      annually. There is no cure for diabetes, and blood glucose monitoring is a key component in
      diabetes treatment and management. Consistently high blood sugar levels can, over time, lead
      to complications such as blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, and nerve damage.In
      addition, low blood sugars may lead to immediate dangers. Self-monitoring of blood glucose
      levels is essential to the self-management of diabetes and has become widespread over the
      past decade. Blood glucose determinations are currently done by invasive methods (finger tip
      pricking), followed by measuring the blood drop characteristics. Currently, there is no
      commercially available reliable non-invasive glucose measurement device that being marketed.

      The GlucoTrack, non-invasive device for determining glucose levels based on the simultaneous
      measurement of three independent orthogonal parameters.

      The rationale for development of the device is to improve the patient's quality of life by
      providing a device that is easily used and provides a painless measurement method, thereby
      leading to higher compliance, and to better managed diabetes
