      Dynamic contrast-enhancing MRI T1-weight DCE-MRI will cover the whole tumor and involved
      lymph nodes if indicated. DCE-MRI is obtained before radiation starts and 4 weeks after RT
      completes. Blood volume images are estimated by using general Toft model, by which the blood
      flow was corrected for vascular permeability and perfusion. These images are geometrically
      co-registered with post-Gd T1-weighted MR images and pre-op RT routine MRI images are fused
      with the treatment planning CT.

      Routine and DCE-MRI will be evaluated in each patient to determine the gross tumor volume.
      The quantitative parameters are determined on DCE-MRI for quantitative parameters in blood
      flow and permeability in the region of interest. Dynamic images are converted into color maps
      reflecting Ktrans, kep, Ve, and mean value of each parameter.
