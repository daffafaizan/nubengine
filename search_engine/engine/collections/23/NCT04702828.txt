      the incidence of falls is about 15% to 34%. Falling can cause subsequent serious injuries and
      post-fall syndromes. Post-fall syndrome is common after a fall. The symptoms of
      self-restricted activity for fear of falling again affect about one-fifth of older fallers.
      This syndrome develops within a short period of time after a fall, which not only causes
      serious problems but also affects psychological symptoms and dependence on daily life
      functions. All of these reduce the function of movement and increase the chance of falling
      again. However, most of the past studies are cross-sectional studies, and rarely explore the
      changes in physical activity, mental state, cognitive and motor functions over time after a
      fall. Therefore, the study will investigate the changes in physiological and psychological
      functions after a fall among older adults who experiences a recent fall within 2 months.
      Additionally, the physiological and psychological functions will be compared between older
      adults with and without a history of falls.
