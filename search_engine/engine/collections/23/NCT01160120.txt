      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors lamivudine 300 mg and tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate 300 mg with the non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz 600 mg for
      once daily and one-tablet HAART. Co-formulated TDF/3TC/EFV demonstrated bioequivalent to
      original individual EFV 3TC and TDF in Indian healthy volunteers (unpublished data). It has
      not been evaluated in clinical trials.
