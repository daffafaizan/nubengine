      of the combination of inhaled DV281 with nivolumab for subjects with advanced NSCLC. This
      study (DV9-NSC-01) is designed for establishing an immunologically optimal RP2D for inhaled
      DV281 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor. This trial, studying the potential
      to enhance the efficacy of an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor in subjects with advanced NSCLC,
      addresses an unmet need for NSCLC patients having tumors that do not respond or do not
      respond adequately to anti-PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.
