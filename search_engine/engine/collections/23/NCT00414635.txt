      treatment followed by two days off treatment versus continuous treatment with the same
      regimen. This is a larger study based on the results of our successful pilot study using the
      same protocol. The 48 week, phase IV trial addresses the issues of the high cost of HIV
      treatment, adherence problems associated with daily treatment, and cumulative toxicities.
      Virologic and immunologic parameters, drug levels of efavirenz, adherence, and toxicity will
      be measured. Subjects will have to be seen at CRI for 6 visits after randomization. Subjects
      randomized to daily therapy will cross over to 5/2 therapy at 24 weeks if their viral load
      remains undetectable.
