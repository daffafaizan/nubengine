    
      This study is set up to document any adverse events and comparing pre- to post-implant
      benefit to subjects. Any adverse events associated with the device will be documented via
      Advanced Bionics complaint handling system for the lifetime of the device. A within-subjects
      repeated-measures design will be employed. Speech perception will be evaluated preoperatively
      with conventional amplification to determine candidacy and to establish baseline performance.
      Efficacy parameters are speech perception data which will be collected according to clinical
      routine with a 6 month follow up period. Subjects will be implanted unilaterally with the
      Ultra X according to standard clinical care.

      The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate that mean monosyllabic word recognition
      score with the Ultra X used in combination with a sound processor programmed with the latest
      fitting software six months after activation is at least 20% better than the mean word score
      at baseline with conventional amplification in the same ear.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is reached six months after device activation.
