    
      This is a Phase Ib, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the
      patient receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      study in treatment-na√Øve (someone who has never used drugs for HCV infection), Caucasian
      genotype 1 chronic HCV-infected patients. The study consists of a screening period, a 9-day
      treatment period (with 5 days of actual medication intake) and a 4-week follow-up period. The
      patients will be divided over 4 panels of 10 patients each that will be initiated
      sequentially. In each panel patients will receive JNJ-47910382 or placebo during 5
      consecutive days. JNJ-47910382 or placebo will be administered once daily or twice daily.
      Within each panel, 5 patients of genotype-1a and 5 patients of genotype-1b will be enrolled.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo in such a way that
      4 patients of each genotype receive active treatment and 1 subject of each genotype receives
      placebo. The pharmacokinetic profile of JNJ-47910382 will be assessed in each panel. HCV RNA
      kinetics (HCV RNA level) and HCV resistance will be studied and biomarkers at the messenger
      RNA (mRNA), protein and cell level will be explored. The entire study duration for each
      participant will be approximately four weeks.
