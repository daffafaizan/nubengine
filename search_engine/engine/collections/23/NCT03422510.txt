      of CXA-10 in subjects at least 18 years of age with primary FSGS.

      The study will be performed at approximately 25 study centers across the United States of
      America (USA). The recruitment period is anticipated to be up to approximately 16 months.
      Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized.

      Study participation for each subject will last up to 5 months. The study will consist of a
      screening period not to exceed 30 days (1 month), 90-day (3 month) treatment period, and an
      approximate 28-day (1 month) follow-up period after the last dose of study medication. An
      optional 9 month open label is available.
