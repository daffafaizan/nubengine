      most affected organ. The progressive decline of the weight and the muscular function linked
      to the aging contributes to the lack of autonomy and dependence, but also to an increase of
      the mortality risks. Sarcopenia is also a prevalent condition, because it is detected in
      13-24% of 60 years old, and 50% of 80 years old and more.

      However, strong inter-individual variations of this prevalence of sarcopenia exists. Some
      elderly (60 years old) reveal a biological aging of 80 years old, whereas 60 years old people
      reveal a biological aging of 60 years old. The key issue is to understand why the biological
      aging of the skeletal muscle is so different between people.

      Previous sarcopenia studies in Humans did not really focus on chronological aging, they were
      all based on a comparison between young and old people. No study considered inter-individual
      modifications (biological aging) in sarcopenia. Furthermore, few studies were associated in
      the same study to "omic", histological, and epigenetic data, to obtain integrated point of
      view of Human Sarcopenia.

      In this study, mechanisms involved in biological aging of the skeletal muscle in aging people
      (same chronological age) will be specified.
