      efficacy of a multi-level intervention that addresses stigma in accessing healthcare, social
      support, and individual risk behaviors of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South
      Africa. The researchers engaged stakeholders from the Department of Health, a Community
      Collaborative Board (CCB), and a Youth Advisory Board (YAB) to inform the adaptation of the
      evidence-based empowerment intervention, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC)-which addresses
      gender-based violence (GBV), substance use, and sexual risk-to address sexual and
      reproductive health (SRH) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) readiness, uptake and
      adherence. Through engagement with stakeholders, the researchers also adapted a stigma and
      discrimination (S&D) reduction training curriculum for clinic staff.

      The project plans to increase uptake of SRH services, and PrEP readiness, uptake and
      adherence among AGYW aged 16 to 24 who engage in high-risk sex. The investigators plan to
      conduct this through a multilevel HIV prevention strategy that addresses S&D in AGYW
      accessing healthcare, social support, and individual risk behaviors. This cluster randomized
      trial with a factorial design will be conducted across 12 clinics in Pretoria.

      The aims of this study are (1) To engage stakeholders, the Community Collaborative Board
      (CCB), and the Youth Advisory Board (YAB) in adapting the Women's Health CoOp (WHC) and
      stigma and discrimination (S&D) reduction training, in the Pretoria area during a formative
      stage.

      (2) To evaluate the impact of training on S&D among healthcare staff on the use of HIV and
      reproductive health services by adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), including
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and staff attitudes and behaviors toward AGYW at 4- and
      8-month follow-up.

      (3) To test the efficacy of a multilevel strategy that addresses structural (stigma and
      discrimination), interpersonal (social support), and individual (personal agency, substance
      use, and gender-based violence [GBV]) factors on PrEP readiness and uptake, and adherence
      (primary outcomes) and condom use, GBV, substance use, and HIV incidence (secondary) at 3-,
      6-, and 9-month follow-up among vulnerable AGYW.
