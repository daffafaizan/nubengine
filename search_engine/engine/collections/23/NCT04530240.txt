      using prospectively collected databases from each participating centre, registering MELD
      score recorded at the time of drop-out, liver transplantation and end of the follow-up.

      Study population was divided in two groups according to the time of waiting list before or
      after the introduction of MELD ≥ 30 allocation scheme: ERA-1 Group (August 2010 - July 2014),
      and ERA-2 Group (August 2014 - July 2018).

      Primary endpoint was waiting list time across different eras in patients above and below MELD
      ≥ 30 cutoff. Secondary endpoints were dropout rate as well as patient and graft survival.
