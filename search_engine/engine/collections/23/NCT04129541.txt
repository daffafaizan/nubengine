    
      This study is a randomized clinical trial comparing same day discharge and overnight
      hospitalization after reconstructive pelvic surgery. Patients who are scheduled to undergo
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and/or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) will be
      recruited at their preoperative visit. Patients will be counseled regarding the existing
      evidence demonstrating the safety of same day discharge after hysterectomy and pelvic floor
      reconstructive surgery. Eligible patients who provide consent will be randomized to same day
      discharge or overnight hospitalization following surgery.

      Patients will receive routine care during their admission for surgery. A standard voiding
      trial will be performed in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for all patients. Patients in
      the planned same day discharge (SDD) cohort will be discharged from the PACU once they meet
      standard discharge criteria. If the patients require unplanned hospitalization (UH), the
      reason for hospitalization will be noted. Patients in the planned overnight hospitalization
      (OH) group will be discharged on post-operative day 1 once they meet standard discharge
      criteria.

      At their postoperative office visit, all patients will complete surveys evaluating patient
      satisfaction. Demographic, surgical, and hospital admission data will be collected from the
      medical record. Information will also be collected regarding any complications, emergency
      department (ED) visits, unplanned office visits, readmissions, and reoperations within 8
      weeks after surgery.
