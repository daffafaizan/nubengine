    
      A multi-center, open-label, prospective cohorts study. Patients with a regular indication for
      COH/IUI (controlled ovarian stimulation/ intra uterine insemination) will be asked to
      participate. Patient's characteristics will be documented including age, weight, BMI, smoking
      status, cycle day 2 3 or 4 FSH /Estradiol levels, antral follicle count, and AMH. AMH and
      FSH/Estradiol will be determined centrally after completion of inclusion of all patients in
      the study. All patients will receive a fixed 75 IU recFSH per day conform normal stimulation
      protocol starting from cycle day 3, 4 or 5 after exclusion of ovarian cysts by ultrasound.
      Ovarian response will be documented by ultrasound only. Once the dominant follicle(s) reach a
      mean diameter of 16-18 mm, hCG (5000IU or 250 mcg) will be applied and insemination will be
      scheduled 36-42 hours later. Cancellation criteria will be defined according to the national
      guidelines provided by the NVOG (7).
