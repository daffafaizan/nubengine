      pectoralis nerve blocks (PECs blocks) additional to general anesthesia have described their
      use for postoperative analgesia in breast surgery. It has been also reported that these
      blocks can be used to provide surgical anesthesia in breast surgery . Segmental thoracic
      epidural anesthesia can be used as an alternative anesthetic technique in patients with
      severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma undergoing breast surgery. It has
      been also reported that thoracic spinal anesthesia was effective and successful in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic surgery. In this study, efficacy of high thoracic spinal epidural
      anesthesia in patients undergoing breast surgery will be evaluated.
