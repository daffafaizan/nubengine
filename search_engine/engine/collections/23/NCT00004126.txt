      advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with oxaliplatin plus paclitaxel. II. Assess the
      overall survival, time to tumor progression, and toxicities associated with this combination
      regimen in this patient population. III. Assess the neurologic toxicity of this combination
      regimen and its correlation with creatinine clearance in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 2 years or
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 24
      months.
