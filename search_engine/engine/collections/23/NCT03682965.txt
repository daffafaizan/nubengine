    
      TX-SMILE is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of an alternative injection site and associated adjustments to dosing and treatment regimen
      for allergen immunotherapy with a commercially-available, FDA-approved allergenic extract for
      the immunotherapy treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis due to pollen from the
      conifer Mountain Cedar (Juniperus ashei).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a three-dose treatment series of
      ultrasonography-guided, intra-lymphatic immunotherapy injections over a two-month period
      prior to the start of the 2018-2019 Mountain Cedar allergy season in central Texas. Patients
      will be evaluated for safety and tolerability during the treatment period and for efficacy
      during the 2018-2019 Texas Mountain Cedar pollen season.
