      clinics performing bariatric surgery in Sweden submits data on baseline characteristics,
      operational data and data from a 30 days, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years follow up for all
      patients. The database is compared annually to the Swedish civil registry to cover all
      mortality.

      From the database we will identify patients who underwent a bariatric procedure between May
      1st 2007 and September 30th 2012. Patients undergoing other bariatric procedures than
      laparoscopic gastric bypass or revisional surgery will be excluded.

      The data will be analyzed with "Chi-2" test, logarithmic regression, linear regression or
      t-test when appropriate. Odds ratio will be calculated.
