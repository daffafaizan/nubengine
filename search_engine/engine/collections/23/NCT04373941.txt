    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-institutional trial in KBA and NoK subjects to be
      conducted under a Food and Drug Administration approved Investigational New Drug application.

      The KBA group is composed of just operated Kasai patients with intraoperative liver
      biopsy-confirmed BA. Their clinical characteristics have been described in the previously
      completed Phase 1 study under CR00005169 (ie. inclusion and exclusion criteria as described
      below)

      The NoK group will be composed of newly diagnosed BA patients, including the following:

        -  surgical patients in whom the Kasai was not performed for intraoperative technical
           reasons or due to advanced liver disease, who also have no option for rescue liver
           transplantation.

        -  Unoperated patients whose family refuses surgery or who are not operative candidates

      Having met the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the Kasai KBS group,

        -  eligible KBA subjects will be randomized to GCSF vs. no-GCSF at the 10 ug/kg/d dose to
           be given subcutaneously for 3 consecutive daily doses on the third day following the
           Kasai procedure.

        -  eligible NoK subjects will be randomized to GCSF vs. no-GCSF at the 10 ug/kg/d dose to
           be given subcutaneously for 3 consecutive daily doses on the third day following
           diagnostic liver biopsy.
