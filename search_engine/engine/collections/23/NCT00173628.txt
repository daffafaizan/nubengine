      epidemiological studies showed the racial variation in the incidence, with the highest of 35
      cases per 100000 in Finland. The incidence of type 1 DM in Taiwan is reported to be 1.5 per
      100000 for the population less than 30 years old. While the diagnosis is made, the residual
      islet cell function is only about 20% of normal population. Therefore, the principle therapy
      in these patients is insulin therapy lifelong.

      The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus is multifactorial and controversial, involving
      the genetic and environmental factors. Type 1 DM is an autoimmune disease, which is T cell
      mediated islet cell destruction. Ninety percent of patients with type 1 DM express at least
      one of the autoantibodies to the islet. Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)
      were observed in 60-80% of such patients, which were considered the most important
      autoantigens. The autoantibodies disappeared successively after diagnosis and decreased in
      concentrations over time, but titers of antibodies to GAD65 had been observed fluctuated in
      patients with type 1 DM.

      The prevalence of GAD antibodies, insulin autoantibodies, IA-2 (tyrosine phosphatase) were
      reported as 45-67%, 23-67% and 49%, respectively in Taiwan. Other associated autoimmune
      disease, such as autoimmune thyroiditis were reported as 13-24%. Such differences may be
      caused by the enrolling criteria and different age population. Therefore, we want to
      elucidate the role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of type 1 DM.
