      of treatment with aromatase inhibitors in women with a history of breast cancer that have no
      evidence of current disease. The aromatase inhibitors (AI) have become a critical component
      of adjuvant therapy for this population, but they cause bone pain, joint pain, joint
      stiffness, and muscle weakness in approximately 40% of patients. These symptoms, referred to
      as aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS), decrease quality of life
      and medication adherence. Identifying effective ways to decrease these symptoms may allow for
      longer and more adherent medication use and thus may improve disease-free survival. We
      hypothesize that vitamin D3 may decrease symptoms associated with the use of aromatase
      inhibitors.
