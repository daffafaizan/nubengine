      cardiovascular disease and stroke. However, few interventions have been developed and
      implemented for this population to address these concerns. A CHW intervention, developed with
      community input to ensure its cultural and linguistic appropriateness, has the potential to
      prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke by helping Filipino Americans control their blood
      pressure. This study has the overall goal of improving health access and cardiovascular
      health status, particularly hypertension, in the Filipino American community living in New
      York City and New Jersey through the use of Community Health Workers (CHW).
