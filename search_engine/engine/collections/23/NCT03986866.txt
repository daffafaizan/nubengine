      questionnaire at post-op day 7, 30, and 90. The Arkansas Prescriptions Drug Monitoring
      Database will also be accessed for information on opioid prescription refills. The overall
      goal of the study is to evaluate the effect that video-based opioid education has on narcotic
      intake after outpatient surgery. The duration of the study will be approximately 3 months,
      plus a single 1-hour long focus group if desired by the patient.
