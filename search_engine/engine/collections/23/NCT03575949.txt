    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the optimal imaging time using FDG positron emission tomography (PET) with
      comparison between a standard of care 1-hour scan (early) and the research scan of 3-hours
      scan (delayed) post radiotracer administration that maximizes separation of activity between
      lesion and non-lesional parenchyma (measured as lesion/background [L/B] ratio) in patients
      with head and neck primary squamous cell carcinoma following chemoradiation treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and undergo PET/CT at
      70 and 180 minutes after injection at 12-14 weeks following standard chemoradiation (CRT)
      completion.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days and then periodically for up
      to 6 months.
