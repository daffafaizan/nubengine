      increased choline activity, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, in
      pediatric patients with progressive low grade astrocytoma treated with surgical resection
      and/or focal radiotherapy. II. Improve the quality of life without use of aggressive surgery
      or radiotherapy in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) over 60 minutes
      prior to surgery and/or radiotherapy. Patients are assigned to one of two treatment arms
      based on tumor accessibility and may crossover to either arm. Arm I: Patients undergo
      conventional surgery. Arm II: Patients with inaccessible tumors undergo focal radiotherapy.
      Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, patients are followed every 4 months for up to 2 years
      with MRSI or MRI for tumor response and growth.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
