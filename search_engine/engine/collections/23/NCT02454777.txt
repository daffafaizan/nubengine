      I. To assess the feasibility (completion of > 80% exercise sessions) of utilizing
      high-intensity interval training (HIT).

      II. To determine the effects of HIT on aerobic exercise adaptation when compared to delayed
      group.

      III. To examine the effects of HIT on left ventricular function when compared to delayed
      group.

      IV. To determine the effects of HIT on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and vascular
      atherosclerosis when compared to delayed group.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      ARM I: HIT (High-intensity Interval Training) group - Participants undergo HIT over 30
      minutes, thrice weekly for 8 weeks.

      ARM II: DEL (Delayed/usual care) group - Participants maintain their current sedentary
      activity level (< 60 minutes of total exercise per week) for 8 weeks. Participants document
      their weekly activity in an exercise log. Following completion of all study visits,
      participants are given the option to complete the HIT exercise program as in Arm I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at weeks 9 and 17.
