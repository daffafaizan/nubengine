      brain health; individuals who are worried about their cognition; individuals who perceive
      themselves to be at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD); individuals who may be at risk for AD
      due to self-identified confirmation of underlying disease pathology; individuals who
      self-identify as having a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or of AD or another
      dementia; and those who self-identify as current or former caregivers of patients with
      Alzheimer's disease or another dementia to participate in the A-LIST Research Projects. Such
      participants will either already be - or will be invited to become - members of the A-LIST
      cohort, an online cohort of individuals ready and willing to engage in A-LIST WMM Insights
      Series (A-LIST members).

      The A-LIST WMM Insights Series will enlist participants to offer insights into a range of
      issues relevant to Alzheimer's, including as examples issues pertinent to clinical trial
      design, regulatory submissions, other research strategies, payer value determinations, and
      care and services research. The A-LIST WMM Insights Series may seek information that in some
      instances will be marketing research or other research exempt from IRB oversight. However,
      when an individual A-LIST Research Project constitutes human subjects research consistent
      with governing law, IRB approval will be sought and obtained. Where questions exist whether
      an individual A-LIST Research Project constitutes human subject research, IRB determination
      will be solicited.
