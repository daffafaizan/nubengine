      the three groups. Participants in group A will receive gabapentin 1800-mg/day orally for
      12-weeks while participants in group B will receive gabapentin 2700-mg/day orally for
      12-weeks. Participants in group C will receive a matching placebo for the same duration. We
      have selected this dose regimen based on our experience with using gabapentin in the pilot
      study. The present study is designed as a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, three-arm,
      parallel-group, dose-ranging, phase II clinical trial. In addition to receiving gabapentin or
      placebo, all subjects will receive a brief behavioral counseling intervention during
      participation in the study.
