      injection of 2 mL PRP into the affected carpal tunnel. Group II received ultrasound guided
      injection of 2 mL steroids (40 mg triamcinolone acetonide). Group III received ultrasound
      guided injection of 2 mL saline as placebo control.

      Each group will be injected twice with 2 weeks intervals. All procedures were done after
      informed consent. Evaluation of the patients at baseline, 3 and 6 months after last injection
      was done clinically by measuring visual analogue scale (VAS), electrophysiologically (by
      measuring motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of median nerve using a standardized
      technique) and ultrasonographic study by measuring cross sectional area (CSA) of median nerve
      at the level of pisiform.
