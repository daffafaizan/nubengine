      with locally advanced stage II/III rectal cancer. The neuadjuvant chemotherapy regimen is :
      oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and irinotecan 150 mg/m2, combined with 5FU 2,400 mg/m2 by 46 h
      infusion, repeated at 2week intervals for 5 cycles. Total mesorectal excision was scheduled
      4-5 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant treatment and followed by a further 7 cycles of
      mFOLFOX or 4 cycles of XELOX. Primary outcome measures of this phase II trial were
      feasibility, safety, tolerance and efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment.
