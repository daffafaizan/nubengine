      problems for both mother and fetus. Despite standard anesthesia protocols designed to
      minimize the occurrence of hypotension during epidural placement, approximately 30% of
      laboring patients will still experience clinically significant hypotension. Maternal
      hypotension can affect placental blood flow causing fetal bradycardia and academia, as well
      as maternal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, there is a need for
      improved management of women in labor at time of epidural placement to avoid negative
      consequences for mother and fetus. We plan to investigate whether the use of lower limb
      compression devices at the time of epidural would decrease maternal hypotension.

      Pregnant women who request epidural anesthesia during labor will be recruited and enrolled in
      this single site, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into either
      control or sequential compression device (SCD) groups. Following epidural, blood pressures
      will be measured at 1, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and rates of hypotension with subsequent
      fetal heart tracing abnormalities will be recorded.
