      loss. In order to avoid the application of large amounts of allogeneic blood, preoperative
      autologous blood donation as a tipe of autologous transfusion have been developed.

      In this study, the investigators studied the benefit of preoperative autologous blood
      donation in participants who undergo total hip arthroplasty. Study is made as a prospective
      and randomized.

      Participants were divided into three groups: the first group donated one dose of autologous
      blood 14 days preoperatively, the second group donated one dose of autologous blood 72 hours
      preoperatively and a third group was not donated autologous blood.

      The blood parameters, hemodynamic stability, bleeding, the need for application of autologous
      or homologous blood and length of hospital stay were compared.
