    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of acalabrutinib and duvelisib in
      patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).

      II. Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). III. To
      estimate the overall response rate (ORR, Lugano 2014, computed tomography [CT] based) of
      acalabrutinib in combination with duvelisib at 6 months in follicular lymphoma (FL) and
      marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) cohorts.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the activity of acalabrutinib and duvelisib as measured by ORR based on
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan at 6 months, duration of response (DOR) and 2-year
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. To capture patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the correlation of the clinical activity of acalabrutinib in combination with
      duvelisib with established biomarkers and identify putative novel markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of duvelisib, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), and duvelisib PO BID on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 19, patients receive acalabrutinib PO
      BID for up to 60 months in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3
      months thereafter.
