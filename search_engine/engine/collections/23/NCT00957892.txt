      three times, for 5 hours each time. The protocol during the three visits will be identical.
      Upon arrival, the infant will be changed into a light-weight cotton body suit. Infants and
      mothers will be weighed and measured for height. An activity sensor will be placed on the
      infant and temperature sensors will be placed on both the infant and the mother. When the
      infant signals hunger, he/she will be fed one of three formulas in randomized order:

        1. cow milk based-formula (Enfamil)

        2. protein hydrolysate formula (Nutramigen)

        3. cow milk-based formula with glutamate level similar to Nutramigen (Enfamilg)

      Intake will be monitored and all feeds will be videotaped. In between feedings, infants will
      rest or sleep on their backs in a crib and mothers will fill out questionnaires.
