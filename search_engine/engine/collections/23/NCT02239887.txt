      up to 45 days post-procedure. Major adverse events are defined as life-threatening incidents
      as determined by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and include events such as device
      embolization; cardiac injury, re-intervention, and/or device-related surgery; bleeding events
      such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding due to any source,
      gastrointestinal bleeding; or any other event related to the device or the procedure, which
      requires treatment.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of LAA occlusion at
      45 and/or 180 days (+ten days) post-procedure. LAA occlusion will be assessed by
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) color flow Doppler and will be defined as absence of
      flow in the LAA or color flow Doppler jets less than 3mm.
