      I. To estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1)
      objective response rate of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus among patients with
      advanced carcinoid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival duration of lenvatinib in combination with
      everolimus among patients with advanced carcinoids.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus
      among patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine clinic benefit rate at 6 months (defined as complete response plus partial
      response plus stable disease) with lenvatinib + everolimus among patients with advanced
      carcinoid tumors.

      II. To determine early CgA and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) response rates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) daily and everolimus PO daily on days 1-28.
      Treatments repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
