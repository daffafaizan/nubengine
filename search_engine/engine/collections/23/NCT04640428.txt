      reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. The latter is constrained
      by limited sensitivity and a timescale of hours to yield results, with no point-of-care test
      widely available. A dedicated computed tomography study of the chest is likely to be more
      sensitive than RT-PCR for COVID-19. Carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a
      routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We aim to assess the lung
      apices on CTA for ground glass opacification and compare this with COVID-19 RT-PCR test
      results and clinical outcome measures.
