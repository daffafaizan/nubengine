      guided localization; excisional breast surgery; and a follow-up visit in breast surgery
      clinic.

      As part of the research protocol, participants will receive a RFID chip for the localization
      procedure and complete surveys.

      Part A of this project is for physician training to master the technique of RFID placement
      and retrieval. On the day of surgery prior to going to the operating room, all participants
      will have the RFID placed first to allow radiologists to become familiar with placement of
      the RFID localizer. Participants will then immediately undergo wire localization. Either
      ultrasound or mammogram guidance will be used for the localization at the discretion of the
      performing radiologist. Surgeons will use a reader to locate the RFID chip during surgery.
      The wire will be present in the event the area of concern cannot be adequately located with
      the reader. Participants, radiologists, surgeons, breast surgery and radiology staff will
      complete surveys.

      Part B of this project is a prospective trial to examine safety, efficacy, operating room
      utilization patterns, and satisfaction with RFID versus wire localization. Participants will
      be stratified based on technique of localization (either US guidance or mammographic
      guidance). Participants will then be randomized to receive either the wire or RFID
      localization. There will be four visits: one pre-op breast surgery visit in which enrollment
      will occur, one radiology procedure visit for localization, one surgical visit, and one
      post-operative visit. This is the same number of visits as standard of care. Participants,
      radiologists, surgeons, breast surgery and radiology staff will complete surveys.
