      6-17y, and related risk factors (such as gender, region strata, ambient UVB level at area of
      residence, season, and outdoor time, etc.). Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured
      with a radioimmunoassay kit in 15 000 children and adolescent participants in Chinese
      national nutrition and health survey (CNNHS) 2010-2012. Age, gender, region type, ethnicity,
      outdoor time, vitamin D supplementation were recorded in unified design questionnaires.
      Season was recorded by the date of blood taken; location was divided into north and south by
      China's Qinling mountains and Huaihe river; and ambient ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation level
      was classified according to the corresponding dose of each participant living area from
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration data.
