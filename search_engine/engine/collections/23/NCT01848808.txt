      atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This pro-atherogenic state is
      strongly correlated and often found co-segregating among individuals with obesity and
      metabolic syndrome. There is increasing evidence to support the use in clinical practice of
      these novel markers of atherosclerosis and CVD risk. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been used
      extensively as a non-specific marker of acute phase response in clinical practice for
      decades. More recently, CRP has also been proposed to be a new cardiovascular biomarker of
      atherosclerosis and its complications. Studies that have investigated the predictive value of
      sub-acute CRP levels have been relatively consistent in showing that individuals with high
      hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) levels (>3.0 mg/L) were at greater risk of CVD
      compared to individuals with lower (<1.0 mg/L) hsCRP levels, independent of gender and plasma
      cholesterol concentrations. Wobenzym is an enzyme formula primarily recommended for the
      treatment of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders. Several studies
      in the areas of arthritis and post-surgery have reported the acute anti-inflammatory effects
      of Wobenzym in terms of changes in CRP. Whether Wobenzym plays a role in managing sub-acute
      inflammation as well remains to be investigated.
