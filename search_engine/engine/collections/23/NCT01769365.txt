    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three H. pylori eradication
      regimens: 7-day standard triple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 7
      days), 10-day sequential therapy (pantoprazole and amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by
      pantoprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole for a further 5 days) and 7-day quadruple
      therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole for 7 days) in Taiwan.

      A total of 306 subjects are enrolled into this study.

      H. pylori-infected patients are randomized to a 7-day standard triple therapy, a 10-day
      sequential therapy, or a 7-day quadruple therapy. Eradication efficacy is assessed by a
      follow-up endoscopy with rapid urease test and histological examination eight weeks after the
      H. pylori therapy. The eradication rates of three groups will be compared.
