      from cardiac arrest die or have poor neurological prognosis. Post-anoxic brain injury is
      common after cardiac arrest and is a major cause of post-resuscitation mortality. Since there
      has been a significant investment in improving the emergency response to both in-hospital ad
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA and OHCA, respectevly) patients and reported
      improvements in short-term survival outcomes, the long-term neurological state and quality of
      life of survivors and their caregiver is of growing significance.

      QUO VADIS is a national observational study created to describe clinical interventions and
      utilization of neuroprognostication tools in the management of patients admitted to ICU
      following cardiac arrest.

      The aims of the study are:

        -  To create an Italian Registry that describes clinical interventions and
           neuroprognostication tools used in the management of patients admitted to ICU following
           cardiac arrest

        -  To evaluate, after one year from the cardiac arrest, the neurological outcome and the
           quality of life of the patients;

        -  To evaluate, after one year from the cardiac arrest, the quality of life of caregivers;

        -  To identify the most effective clinical intervention in the management of post-cardiac
           arrest patients admitted to ICU;

        -  To create a prognostic model for patients admitted to ICU after cardiac arrest.
