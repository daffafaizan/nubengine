      screening tests and the reduction of factors, which increase the probability of malignant
      arrhythmias are important for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

      Study Design: randomized and controlled clinical trial. Setting & Participants: Fifty-nine HD
      patients were randomized into exercise training group (group A-30 patients) and controls
      (group B-29 patients).

      Intervention: Group A participated in a 10-month supervised exercise training program during
      the HD sessions (3/weekly).

      Outcomes: The effects of exercise on the score of the non-invasive cardiac markers for SCD
      risk stratification and on the occurrence of each variable separately. Statistical analysis
      included a two-group comparison of change scores and an analysis of covariance adjusting for
      baseline.

      Measurements: At entry and the end of the study, in all participants aerobic capacity
      (VO2peak) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were estimated, late potentials and
      T-wave alternans were detected and heart rate variability was calculated. Specifically, from
      the 24-h Holter monitoring the standard deviation of all the normal R-R intervals (SDNN), the
      mean R-R intervals (mean RR), the low (LF) and high (HF) frequency components of the
      autoregressive power spectrum of the NN intervals and their ratio (LF/HF) were recorded.
