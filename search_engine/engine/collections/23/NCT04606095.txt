    
      In the first part healthy controls (25 female/10 males) and fibromyalgia (25 female/10 males)
      participants that are enrolled in this phase will have 3 visits as well as a run-in
      observational period (up to a total of 33 days). During this time, participants will complete
      surveys, as well as have electroencephalograms (EEG) with quantitative sensory testing and
      functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Hypothesis: FM patients will display greater ES in the brain, compared to pain-free controls
      when assessed with EEG at rest. Furthermore, patients experiencing increased clinical pain,
      will display increases in ES metrics

      In the third part FM patients will be enrolled (50) and receive treatment with either sham
      treatment followed by M1 HD-tDCS or sham treatment followed by ES HD-tDCS. These participants
      will also complete surveys and have neuroimaging EEG/MRI.

      Hypothesis: Following a course of HD-tDCS targeted at either A.) the motor cortex (M1) or B.)
      an ES-sensitive region identified in Aim 2, FM patients will display decreased strength of ES
      conditions (correlation between node degree and frequency) as compared to Sham, when assessed
      with EEG. Moreover, the degree of pain reduction following HD-tDCS will correlate with the
      amount of reduction in these network parameters leading to ES. If unable to identify an
      ES-sensitive region using computer modeling in Aim 2, our hypothesis for motor cortex
      stimulation is that HD-tDCS at M1 will result in decreased ES conditions as compared to Sham,
      when assessed with EEG.
