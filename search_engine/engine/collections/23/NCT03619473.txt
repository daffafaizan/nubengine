      increase almost 23% from 2014-2020 (Royal Police of Malaysia, 2017). The main road crash
      involved the motorcyclist and the main cause of death was due to the severe head injuries.
      Previous study in Malaysia had reported only 20% of proper helmet usage among the adult
      riders (Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research, 2015). This highlights the need to
      transfer the knowledge to the parent/adult riders on the importance, proper usage and
      availability of the standard child safety helmet and hence increase the prevalence of
      standard helmet usage for the pillion riders especially for the children.
