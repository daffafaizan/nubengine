      tDCS. The distractor inhibition exercise is conducted under either sham or real tDCS.
      Cognitive performance is assessed pre and post tDCS application, complemented by a
      short-termed follow-up on a consecutive day. Interindividual working memory capacity at
      baseline is taken into consideration.
