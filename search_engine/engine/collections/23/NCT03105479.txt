      cohorts, starting from the oldest age categories(12 to < 18 years old) to the youngest (birth
      to < 3 months).

        -  Part A is an open-label, dose finding part to be conducted in at least 24 subjects.

        -  Part B follows a randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group design with vancomycin
           used as an active comparator. Part B will be conducted in about 176 children.

      In both parts, the treatment period will be 10 days and will be followed by a Follow-up
      period of 28-32 days.
