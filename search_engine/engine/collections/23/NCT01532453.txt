    
      This open-label multicenter, randomized, inter-individual comparative, prospective clinical
      trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MD 3511356 sunscreen in preventing
      AK and SCC in post transplant immune-suppressed patients compared to standard of care.

      The present multicenter trial is intended to contribute to the evidence that daily sun
      protection will have a prophylactic effect in this high risk population of chronically immune
      compromised patients.
