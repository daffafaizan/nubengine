      validation study using multiple single-case experimental designs. A thorough assessment,
      including a complete evaluation of components of social cognition but also clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments is proposed for each patient enrolled in the study.

      Investigators collect three kinds of baselines before the beginning of the cognitive
      remediation intervention: baselines specific of the targeted component (Emotion recognition
      and Theory of Mind), non-specific baselines (such as measures of neurocognition processes
      that should not be affected by the intervention), and intermediary baselines that is measures
      of social cognitive function linked with targeted processes but not directly concerned by the
      cognitive remediation program.

      These measures and the complete assessment will be repeated at the end of the intervention to
      highlight impacts of RC KID on social cognitive impairments, and 6 months later to
      investigate the possible long-lasting effects of the benefits.
