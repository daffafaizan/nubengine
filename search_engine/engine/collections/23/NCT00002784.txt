      survival of women with high-risk, operable stage II/III breast cancer treated with three
      courses of dose-intensive epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) supported by granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells vs.
      standard EC followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil. II. Compare the toxicity,
      duration of quality-adjusted time without symptoms and toxicity, and quality of life
      associated with these two treatments. III. Evaluate the cost effectiveness of these two
      treatments.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by estrogen receptor status and
      menopausal status. Within 6 weeks of surgery, patients in the first group receive epirubicin
      (preferred) or doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by
      conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) every 4 weeks for 3
      courses. Patients in the second group undergo stem cell mobilization and harvest with
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) followed within 10 weeks of surgery by
      high-dose chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by peripheral blood stem
      cell rescue and G-CSF. All patients receive adjuvant tamoxifen, and patients who underwent
      lumpectomy prior to entry are required to receive adjuvant radiotherapy (radiotherapy is
      optional for patients who underwent mastectomy prior to entry). Patients are followed every 3
      months for 2 years, then q 6 months for 3 years, then yearly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 210 patients will be accrued over 4 years to provide 195 evaluable
      patients.
