        -  Determine the response rates (complete response and partial response) and duration of
           response in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with
           bortezomib.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then at least every
      3 months for 2 years or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
