      about users who try to quit without formal treatment (so-called spontaneous quitting). This
      study will use two self-report questionnaires to collect information on the socio-demographic
      characteristics, marijuana use history, most difficult marijuana quit experience, and
      marijuana craving from a convenience sample of 1230 adult, non-treatment-seeking marijuana
      users. The questionnaires take 45-60 minutes to administer. Data will be analyzed for
      patterns and correlations among the characteristics of the quit attempt, including any
      withdrawal symptoms, quitting strategies used, and its success. The marijuana craving data
      will be analyzed to evaluate the validity of this measure of marijuana craving. There are no
      direct benefits to subjects from study participation. The scientific benefit is an improved
      understanding of spontaneous quitting of marijuana use, which may lead to improved
      interventions for marijuana users in the future. There are no physical risks to subjects.
      There are risks of anxiety or embarrassment while taking the questionnaire and of loss of
      confidentiality of sensitive information collected about subjects.
