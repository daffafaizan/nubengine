      participants will receive an extensive explanation regarding the different modalities of
      analgesia available during labor. After the explanations the participants will be randomly
      divided into 2 groups:

        1. Routine management-doctors and midwives will treat the participants the way they usually
           do regarding analgesia including frequent inquiries about wishes for analgesia.

        2. Interventional management-participants will not be asked by the doctors and midwives
           about analgesia at all during labor but will be able to receive analgesia by a modality
           of choice at the timing of choice after being advised by the medical team.

      After delivery, participants will fill a questionnaire regarding the experience of labor in
      general and the relevance of analgesia during labor including the effect the medical team may
      have had on decision making during labor.

      Medical information regarding visual analogue scale (VAS), analgesia modality, cervical
      conditions, parity etc. will be extracted from patients' electronic files.
