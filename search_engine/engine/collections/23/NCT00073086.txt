      which have subsequently been termed the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS has
      subsequently spread to multiple countries including the United States, and is accompanied by
      a higher than anticipated morbidity and mortality. Because of world travel and the apparent
      easy transmissibility of this disease reported in other nations, the number of patients with
      SARS may continue to rise. The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate and treat
      persons with SARS. Other goals will be to characterize the clinical course of SARS by also
      evaluating close contacts of people with SARS, as well as those that have recovered from
      SARS. Additional goals of the protocol are to elucidate the pathophysiology of SARS,
      characterize the immune response during SARS, and evaluate diagnostic tests for the rapid
      identification of SARS in clinical specimens. Further knowledge about SARS may lead to
      effective forms of therapy and improve mortality from this disease.
