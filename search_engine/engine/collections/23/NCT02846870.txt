      I. Our goal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a visual
      presentation in the context of a radiation oncologist's discussion with patient during
      consultation on patient satisfaction at end of consultation visit and at end of treatment, on
      anxiety at start of treatment, on decision regret following treatment, and on perception of
      side effects following treatment. Of note, the attending radiation oncologist will be
      responsible for reviewing the Powerpoint presentation with the patient, taking time to answer
      any questions that the patient has

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (STANDARD EDUCATION): Patients receive a standard prostate cancer radiation oncology
      consultation.

      ARM B (VISUAL ENHANCED EDUCATION): Patients receive a visually enhanced prostate cancer
      educational Powerpoint presentation including prostate anatomy, pathologic results, surgical
      options, radiation therapy, and prognosis with pictographs during radiation oncology
      consultation.
