        -  For participants receiving atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg at a stable dose for at
           least 6 weeks prior to screening, the study participation was to be approximately 21
           weeks including a screening period of 1 week, a double-blind treatment period of 12
           weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.

        -  For participants receiving a lipid-lowering treatment other than atorvastatin or not at
           stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to
           screening, or drug naive participants, the study participation was to be approximately
           27 weeks including a screening period of 1 week, a run-in treatment period with
           atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg at a stable dose of 6 weeks, a double-blind
           treatment period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.
