      rods). Any FDA cleared TLIF interbody cage and pedicle screw system is acceptable for this
      study (with the exception of Polyetheretherketone [PEEK] rods).

      This population for this study are patients who are indicated for the biomechanical
      reconstruction and stabilization of a spinal motion segment following decompression at one
      lumbar level from L1/L2 to L5/S1 for skeletally mature patients due to symptomatic lumbar
      degeneration with or without foraminal or recess spinal stenosis confirmed by radiographic
      imaging (CT, MRI, X-rays), with no more than a Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at the involved
      level.

      At least 200 subjects with a potential sample size re-estimation at completion. Subjects will
      be recruited from up to 15 medical centers. The subjects will return for follow-up at
      6-weeks, 3-months, 6-months, and then annually for 5-years post surgery.
