      accelerated IMRT technique. In this study, patients will be eligible if the estimated risk of
      breast cancer elsewhere in the breast (beyond the tumor bed) is low. The radiation treatment
      will be available to women who are older than 40 years, have a DCIS (Ductal carcinoma in
      situ) or T1, N0, M0, (AJCC classification, version 6.0), non-lobular infiltrating carcinoma
      treated with breast-conserving surgery.

      Patients will undergo a pre-treatment planning free breathing CT with 5mm cuts in the
      treatment position, on a breast board, with both arms extended above their head that will be
      used to plan the traditional two field (tangent) plan. An Active Breathing Control (ABC)
      device will be used to minimize target motion due to breathing during a second CT scan. The
      lumpectomy cavity will be identified and delineated, and margins of approximately 1.5 cm in
      three dimensions will be used to allow for subclinical tumor extension and daily set-up
      error. The organs at risk (heart, lungs, contralateral breast) will be contoured on both CT
      scans. An inverse planning system and optimization tools will be employed in order to achieve
      the best IMRT plan (to minimize the dose to the heart, lungs and contralateral breast), that
      will be compared to the two field plan. If the IMRT plan is shown to be the optimal one, in
      terms of doses to organs at risk, then the patient will be enrolled in the protocol and will
      proceed with the treatment. Treatment will start approximately two weeks after the planning
      CT is obtained. All patients on protocol will be treated with accelerated radiotherapy, 3.85
      Gy per fraction, bid, for 5 consecutive days for a total dose of 38.5 Gy.
