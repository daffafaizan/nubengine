      care treatment will be recruited. All patients must have at least two lesions, one that can
      injected with LTX-315 and another that can used to assess response. In the first part of the
      study, LTX-315 will be administered intratumorally on 4-6 dosing days over a 2-4 week period
      to an index lesion which will be biopsied or removed after treatment for T-cell expansion.
      The second part will involve culturing and expanding T-cells for infusion of tumour
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) following an induction regimen. The safety and efficacy of
      the LTX-315 and TIL treatment will be assessed. Patients will be followed up for 15 months.
