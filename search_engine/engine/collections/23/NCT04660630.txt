      Three project groups were set up in this study: primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes and
      hyperlipidemia. In each group, the control group and the experimental group were set up, and
      the patients in two pilot towns of Daming County were selected by cluster stratified random
      sampling. The control group received the treatment of local researchers according to the
      traditional medication strategy. The patients in the experimental group were treated with the
      drug regimen formulated by local researchers according to the results of their
      pharmacogenomic test reports. The subjects were single blind.
