      meaningful and persistent improvements in function of the more-affected arm in stroke
      survivors with severe, chronic hemiparesis. No treatment with an established evidence base is
      available now for this large group, who have barely perceptible voluntary movement of the
      more-affected fingers and wrist. The lab of E. Taub and G. Uswatte has developed an expanded
      version of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) for this population that has evidence
      of efficacy for improving use in daily life of the more-affected arm from a case series and
      small randomized controlled trial (RCT). The original version of CIMT is a form of physical
      rehabilitation that has evidence of efficacy from multiple RCTs for improving use in daily
      life of the more-affected arm in adults with mild to moderate hemiparesis after stroke. CIMT
      has also been shown to produce neuroplastic changes in both grey and white matter structures.
      Expanded CIMT (eCIMT) combines CIMT with neurodevelopmental techniques (NDT) for managing
      tone. Studies from by J. Szaflarski and by others suggest that priming CNS tissue for
      training by electrically stimulating the brain regions that control the target function with
      excitatory intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) augments the benefits of
      neurorehabilitation. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of combining eCIMT with
      brain stimulation by iTBS and, on a preliminary basis, will evaluate whether this combination
      therapy boosts treatment outcomes relative to eCIMT alone.
