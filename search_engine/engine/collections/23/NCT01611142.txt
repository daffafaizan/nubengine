      majority of PTCL subtypes, patients are of older age (>60 years) and present with advanced
      stage disease.With the exception of the ALCL-ALK-positive subtype that responds well to CHOP
      combined chemotherapy, most PTCL subtypes become refractory even to aggressive chemotherapy
      regimens or relapse. Overall survival of PTCL patients is poor compared with that of
      aggressive B-cell lymphomas.Thus, novel and effective therapies are
      needed.KW-0761(mogamulizumab) is a defucosylated, humanized, IgG1 mAb with enhanced antibody
      dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)that binds to CCR4, a molecule that is suggested to be
      significantly involved in patients with PTCL.
