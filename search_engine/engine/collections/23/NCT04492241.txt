      highly prevalent with aging, and is greater than the simple sum of their respective
      prevalence, suggesting a complex age-related interplay between cognition and locomotion.

      Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis has provided evidence that poor gait
      performance predicts dementia and, in particular, has demonstrated that "motoric cognitive
      risk" (MCR) syndrome, which has been described in cognitively healthy individuals and
      combines subjective cognitive complaint with objective slow gait speed, is a pre-dementia
      syndrome.

      MCR as a relatively new recognised clinical syndrome is with a high prevalence calculated
      around 10% in world population aged 60 and above. MCR syndrome predicts mild and major
      neurocognitive disorders. MCR syndrome does not rely on a complex and time-consuming
      assessment, making it applicable to the aging population. Thus, MCR syndrome seems to be a
      good syndrome to identify individuals at risk of mild and major neurocognitive disorders in
      any type of healthcare setting.

      Ginkgo Leaf Extract and Armillariella Mellea Powder Oral Solution has proven efficacy for
      cognitive function deterioration in preliminary studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      its efficacy and safety for MCR.
