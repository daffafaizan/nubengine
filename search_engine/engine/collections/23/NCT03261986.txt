      hip arthroplasty using the Trident II acetabular cup. Fifty patients will be recruited for
      this study. All patients that qualify for the study per the inclusion-exclusion criteria and
      provide written informed consent will receive the Trident II acetabular cup and RSA beads.
      Implant stability, through RSA, will be measured throughout the first two postoperative
      (post-op) years per the following schedule: immediate post-op and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years following surgery. Patients will be discharged and seen for
      follow-up assessments as per standard of care. Adverse events that are related to the index
      joint will be collected. Health outcome questionnaires will be collected. The health outcome
      questionnaires will include: EQ-5D, HOOS JR and Harris Hip Score. Health outcome
      questionnaires will be completed pre-operatively and again at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1
      year and 2 years following surgery. Conventional x-ray analysis will be performed
      pre-operatively and again at 6 weeks, 1 year and 2 years following surgery.
