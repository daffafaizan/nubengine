        1. Screening phase: Tests and evaluations will be done before treatment starts.

        2. Induction phase: Includes chemotherapy plus hu14.18K322A mAb. Participants will also
           have surgery during this part of the study to remove as much tumor as possible.

        3. Consolidation/Intensification phase: Includes high doses of chemotherapy and blood stem
           cell transplantation with additional, experimental "minimal residual disease" (MRD)
           treatment. Participants will also get radiation treatment to all sites of the tumor(s)
           after recovery from the stem cell transplant.

        4. Maintenance/MRD treatment phase: With immune therapy in addition to the standard
           treatment with the drug isotretinoin.
