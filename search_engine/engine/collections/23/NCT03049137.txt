    
      To study the effectiveness of computer guided surgical stents in ridge augmentation with
      implant insertion compared with free hand augmentation

      -Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome (PICO)-

      Population (P): patients with massive bone resorption horizontally and vertically, severe
      bone loss around teeth, periodontal disease or traumatic extraction in partially edentulous
      maxillary anterior region requiring implant insertion.

      Intervention (I): simultaneous implant placement with ridge augmentation using computer
      guided surgical templates with PRF.

      Comparator (C): Free hand simultaneous implant placement with ridge augmentation.

      Outcome (O): Patient esthetic satisfaction - Augmentation and implant insertion accuracy
