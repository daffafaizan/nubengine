      psychosocial interventions are able to help families of childhood cancer survivors cope with
      cancer-related psychological issues.

      Method: 300 families will be recruited from the four pediatric oncology departments in
      Denmark where 150 families' will receive a home-based psychosocial intervention and 150
      families will be in the control group. The study will take place shortly after the child
      completes the primary treatment. The primary outcome is post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)
      in parents and secondary outcomes include among others quality of life, sick-leave, coping
      strategies and family functioning. Families in the intervention group will receive a 6
      session manualized intervention based on a Cognitive Behavioral framework. Four sessions will
      focus on the parents and two sessions will focus on the child, who had cancer, and his/her
      siblings. The main goal of the sessions is to teach families how to adapt healthy
      psychological adjustments to pediatric oncology and prevent PTSS in family members. As a part
      of the intervention, families will be presented with video clips of other parents discussing
      how cancer has affected their family, to show common issues in experiencing having a child
      undergo cancer treatment. Every family member will be asked to complete a set of
      questionnaires to measure the outcome of the intervention at baseline before the
      intervention, 6 months follow-up and 12 months follow-up.

      It is expected that families in the intervention group experience a larger improvement in
      their post-traumatic stress symptoms as well as strengthening the family function, quality of
      life and reducing sick leave compared to the control group.
