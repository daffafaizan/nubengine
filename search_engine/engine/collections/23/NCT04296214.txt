      in patients that aren't fit for intensive treatment. The standard dose of azacitidine is 75
      mg/m2 for 7 d√≠as on 28 days cycles. Nevertheless there are studies of pharmacokinetics that
      have showed there is no difference on plasmatic distribution between 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg/m2
      with similar concentration curves. The actual presentation of azacitidine is 100 mg per
      bottle with less of 24 hours of utility after opened. Looking for optimizations on the use of
      5-azacitidine, we have changed the dosing to 50 mg/m2 for 10 days on 28 days cycles with a
      total dose application of 95% of the traditional regimen with the saving of 5 bottles of the
      drug.
