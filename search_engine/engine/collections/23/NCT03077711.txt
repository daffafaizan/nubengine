      The hypothesis of this study is that the group taking trimethoprim will have a lower
      recurrence rate than those taking methenamine hippurate based on the literature. The
      investigators aim to identify to what degree that difference is and whether or not it is an
      acceptable difference given the greater degree of an antibiotic resistance.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this prospective, randomized study is to determine whether there is
      a significant difference in the prevention of recurrent UTIs when given either methenamine
      hippurate or daily suppressive antibiotics independent of vaginal estrogen use.

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine how well patients are able to tolerate
      each of these medications and what adverse effects are observed in a 1 year time period.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Identify if there is a differential impact on prevention of recurrent UTIs when treated
           with either trimethoprim or methenamine hippurate in a 6 and 12 month period.

        2. Identify adverse reactions in each group.

        3. Determine whether or not estrogen has a more additive effect to trimethoprim or
           methenamine hippurate in post-menopausal women.

        4. Identify how well tolerated the study medications are and whether or not the size of the
           pills or the frequency of taking them prevents patients from continuing therapy.
