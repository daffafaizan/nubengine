      Primary

        -  To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose of sorafenib
           tosylate when administered in combination with vinorelbine ditartrate in women with
           stage IV adenocarcinoma of the breast. (Phase I)

        -  To evaluate the 4-month progression-free survival rate in patients treated with this
           regimen at the maximum tolerated dose. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To determine time to treatment failure in these patients.

        -  To determine the response rate in these patients.

        -  To determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate on days 1-28 and vinorelbine ditartrate IV on days
      1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
