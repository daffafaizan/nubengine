    
      This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, kinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SYNB8802
      within the following 2 study parts:

      Part 1 is an inpatient, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in HV male
      and female subjects in up to 5 dose cohorts (6 treated: 3 placebo) for 5 days of dosing to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Part 2 is a placebo-controlled crossover study in up to 20 adult male and female subjects
      with EH secondary to Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either SYNB8802 (at or below the MTD from Part 1) or placebo for six days before crossing
      over to receive either placebo or SYNB8802 for another six days, respectively. This part of
      the study has been designed with the flexibility of being able to be conducted either at the
      clinical site or by a home healthcare professional at an alternative location (e.g.,
      patient's home, hotel).
