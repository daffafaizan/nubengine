      paclitaxel designed to avoid problems associated with solvents used in Taxol. And
      albumin-bound paclitaxel was characterized with high tolerated doses with greater efficacy,
      and with greater concentration in tumor tissue compared with normal tissues. This is a single
      center, non-randomized, open-label Phase II clinical study to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of albumin-bound paclitaxel plus nedaplatin in patients with advanced, recurrent
      metastatic cervical cancer. About 30 patients will receive 175-200 mg/m2 albumin-bound
      paclitaxel, d 1 combined with 80- 100 mg/m2 nedaplatin, d 2, every 3 weeks. At least 2 cycles
      will be completed for each patient, for whom responded to the treatment, 4-6 cycles will be
      completed.
