      (RF) ablation is directly correlated with a reduction in the recurrence of arrhythmia in
      patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Lesion depth is directly correlated with
      the contact force measured between the the tip of the catheter and the heart tissue. In this
      study, patients in whom a pulmonary vein isolation procedure has been prescribed for the
      treatment of PAF will be randomized for treatment with either a device incorporating contact
      force sensing or one without.

      To be included in the study, patients 18 or older must demonstrate a history of atrial
      fibrillation and will have failed treatment using antiarrhythmic medications. In both study
      arms, ablation will be performed using an accepted treatment strategy and standard
      procedures. Patients will receive routine follow-up for 12 months after the procedure, with
      the addition of ambulatory monitoring to detect the recurrence of episodes of atrial
      arrhythmia. The study will compare the effectiveness of the procedure in the two arms, and
      will characterize any differences in safety outcomes primarily related to complications
      arising from the use of an ablation device and the ablation procedure.
