    
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-controlled Post-Market Clinical Follow-up study
      involving orthopaedic surgeons skilled in reverse shoulder arthroplasty procedures. A minimum
      of three study centers will be involved. A total number of 97 implants will be included into
      the study.

      The primary endpoint is defined by the survival of the implant at 10 years which is based on
      removal or intended removal of the prosthesis and will be determined using Kaplan Meier
      method. The safety of the system will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and incidence
      of adverse events.

      The secondary endpoint is defined by the performance and clinical benefits of the ASHCOM
      Shoulder System at 5 years, which is assessed by the Constant and Murley score. Assessments
      of the overall pain, functional performance, survival, quality of life and radiographic
      parameters of all enrolled study subjects will be evaluated in addition.
