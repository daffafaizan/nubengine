      decrease mortality and reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS
      or advanced ARC. After 1 year of AZT therapy, the effectiveness tends to diminish and
      patients progress with more opportunistic infections and higher mortality rates. Because of
      the demonstrated antiviral activity, absence of hematologic toxicity, and lack of cross
      tolerance in laboratory studies of ddC, a study to investigate the long-term effectiveness of
      ddC in patients with HIV infection who have received AZT therapy is warranted.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. In study arm 1, patients receive
      AZT plus ddC placebo. In study arm 2, patients receive ddC plus AZT placebo capsules. In
      study arm 3, patients receive ddC plus AZT. Patients are seen every other week for first 8
      weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients are stratified by HIV disease status, length of time
      receiving AZT, and systemic or local Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.
      Patients who reach a clinical AIDS-defining endpoint are offered open-label combination
      therapy.
