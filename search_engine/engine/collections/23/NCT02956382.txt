      in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell lines.Data have demonstrated
      synergy between the two agents in various other B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) cell lines.
      The investigators theorize that the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax will provide
      dual, yet unique, targeted inhibition for patients with follicular lymphoma, resulting in
      both significant efficacy and less nonspecific toxicity.
