    
      Study Design: This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of
      single oral doses of CARD-024. Four planned cohorts of 8 subjects each will be dosed
      sequentially and randomized to receive a single dose of active drug (6 subjects) or placebo
      (2 subjects). Cohort 4 will have 10 subjects randomized to receive active drug (7 subjects)
      or placebo (3 subjects). Each cohort will be divided into at least 2 groups; the first group
      will have 2 subjects, 1 receiving active drug and 1 receiving placebo. Dosing of the
      remaining 6 subjects in each cohort will be completed in a manner agreed upon by the Sponsor
      and the Principal Investigator in keeping with the randomization schedule and blinded
      conditions.

      The planned cohorts are:
