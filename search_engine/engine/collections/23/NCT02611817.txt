      to treat people who have moderate to severely active CD. This study will look at clinical
      remission, as well as enhanced clinical response and corticosteroid-free remission in
      participants with CD who receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy after having achieved a
      clinical response to vedolizumab IV induction therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 824 participants. All participants will enter a 6 week
      Induction Phase where they will be administered open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via IV
      infusion at Week 0 (Day 1) and Week 2 (Day 15), and will then be assessed for a clinical
      response at Week 6. Participants who achieve a clinical response at Week 6 will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Maintenance Arm

        -  Placebo SC Maintenance Arm

      Participants who do not achieve a clinical response will not be randomized into the
      Maintenance Period, and instead will receive a third infusion of vedolizumab IV 300 mg at
      Week 6.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 71 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final
      visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants will
      also participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by phone, at 6 months after the last dose
      of study drug.
