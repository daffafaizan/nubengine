    
      1. Rates of acute rejection including subclinical rejection - acute T cell mediated
           (cellular) rejection, antibody mediated acute rejection, and chronic antibody-associated
           injury (i.e.: Transplant Glomerulopathy, Chronic allograft arteriopathy) between the
           groups.

        2. Evaluation of endothelial cell activation and injury on biopsies by checking markers for
           endothelial cell activation and injury (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1/CD54;
           vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-1/CD106; and E-selectin, ELAM-1/CD62E) in
           two-color stains of tissue with classical endothelial markers (CD34 and Factor VIII).

        3. Measurement of serum/plasma levels of TNF-alpha and VEGF and decreased levels of protein
           C and protein S in the circulation, as an assessment of graft vascular perturbation.

        4. Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs) will be measured by flow cytometry with markers for
           endothelial cell activation.
