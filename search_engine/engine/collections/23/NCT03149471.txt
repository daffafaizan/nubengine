      Echocardiography) for patients diagnosed with PE. Presenting signs and symptoms as well as
      clinical and imaging findings during the initial presentation and hospitalization will be
      incorporated into a computerized pre-specified electronic CRF. During hospitalization, an
      endothelial function test will be performed 48 hours post admission. A trained technician
      will perform the test using the EndoPAT device in order to assess patient RHI, a score less
      than 1.67 will be considerate as endothelial dysfunction. Patients will then be followed for
      pre-specified clinical events of up to 1 year post discharge and especially the development
      of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease, post thrombotic syndrome and clinical events.
      RHI will be assessed during 1-year follow up visit.
