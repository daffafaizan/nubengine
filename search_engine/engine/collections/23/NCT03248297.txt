      effectiveness and safety of single dose oral azithromycin or combined
      azithromycin+amoxicillin compared to placebo for the prevention of peripartum infections and
      sepsis in laboring women. We have previously shown the effectiveness of azithromycin for
      extended spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to the standard cephalosporin alone for
      reduction of post-cesarean infections. In LICs, the fraction of maternal infection and sepsis
      from cesarean delivery is minimal. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate strategies aimed at
      reducing these morbidities in women who have vaginal births. There is an increased risk of
      infection in women who have prolonged labor or prolonged rupture of membranes. Drawing from
      our findings with azithromycin-based extended antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean delivery,
      we propose to adapt the intervention and evaluate a single oral dose of azithromycin (with or
      without oral amoxicillin) to prevent maternal peripartum infection and sepsis. This study,
      performed over a course of 3 years in 5 collaborating hospitals in Cameroon, Africa, will
      randomize 750 women in labor with prolonged rupture of membranes ≥ 8 hours or prolonged labor
      ≥18 hours to 1 gram of oral azithromycin, 1 gram of azithromycin+2 grams of amoxicillin,
      compared to usual care (placebo). Women will be followed to ascertain maternal infectious
      outcomes and perinatal outcomes.
