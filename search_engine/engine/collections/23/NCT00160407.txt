      in aminotransferases, and more importantly, underlying histopathology in patients with NASH.
      A total of 50 biopsy-proven NASH patients will be enrolled in a prospective, randomized
      fashion. Twenty-five patients have been enrolled at the primary study site at Saint Louis
      University. Recruitment of the next 25 patients is taking place at a study subsite at Brooke
      Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.

      This will be an open-label study comparing an established weight loss program (1400-calorie
      diet with 30% fat) plus daily vitamin E (800 IU) and a daily multivitamin to the same weight
      loss program, daily vitamin E (800 IU) and multivitamin, plus orlistat (120 mg), three times
      daily for 36 weeks.

      Data to be collected from prospective patients includes demographic information, such as age,
      sex, past medical history, medications, height and weight. Biochemical data to be collected
      from prospective patients includes liver enzymes, measures of insulin resistance to include,
      insulin levels, lipid panel, hemoglobin A1C, free fatty acids, complete blood count,
      coagulation studies, and vitamin E levels. Blood will also be collected and stored for
      markers of inflammation and fibrosis, such as C reactive protein and TNF-alpha. A liver
      biopsy will be obtained at the completion of the study for both histopathologic analysis and
      RNA analysis.
