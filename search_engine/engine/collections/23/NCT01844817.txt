      becomes the primary form of treatment. The combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel
      represents an appropriate front-line standard of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. However, poor outcomes with this disease warrant exploration of novel drugs with
      unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that OGX-427 has shown promising
      activity in pancreatic cancer. In this trial, we will compare the overall survival of
      patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer using OGX-427 with either
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or a placebo with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.
