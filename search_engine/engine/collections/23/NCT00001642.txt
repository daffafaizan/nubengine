      Syndrome (AGS) by a positional cloning approach. The first step towards this goal is to
      define the smallest genomic candidate region for AGS at 20p12 and to begin to identify genes
      within this region which are, by definition, candidate genes for the disease. In a
      collaborative effort with clinician-investigators studying the Alagille syndrome, metaphase
      chromosomes and genomic DNA from affected individuals will be studied for subchromosomal
      deletions and for mutations in the candidate genes. Characterization of genes involved in
      Alagille syndrome could provide important insight into the pathophysiology of the disease,
      the development of normal liver and treatment of this disease.
