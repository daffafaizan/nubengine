      mortality compared to the general population. Arterial stiffness, likely due to vascular
      calcification (VC), has been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality in ESRD. Serum
      calcification propensity (T50) is a novel biomarker, which is believed to reflect the
      propensity toward ectopic calcification (e.g. VC). Increasing serum magnesium (sMg) should
      increase T50, which might in turn reduce the formation of VC in patients with ESRD. A cheap
      and easy way of achieving this would be to increase the concentration of Mg in the dialysate
      (dMg) of patients with ESRD treated with haemodialysis (HD).

      The investigators wish to conduct a randomised controlled double-blind clinical trial to
      examine whether increasing dMg will improve T50 in subjects with ESRD treated with HD.
