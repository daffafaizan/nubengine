    
      This study will be conducted in two parts Part A and Part B. Part A is a double-blinded,
      double-dummy, placebo-controlled study with an atomoxetine arm as an active reference to
      SPD503. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio among SPD503, atomoxetine,
      and placebo treatment arms for the first 18 weeks of double-blinded treatment. At the end of
      the first 18 weeks, participants in the placebo treatment arm will rollover to Part B of the
      study directly for an additional 52 weeks of open-label SPD503 treatment. Participants in the
      SPD503 and atomoxetine treatment arms will continue in Part A of the study for the remainder
      of the 52 weeks. At the end of 52 weeks of double-blinded treatment and evaluation in Part A.
      Participants in the SPD503 and atomoxetine treatment arms will rollover into Part B of the
      study for an additional 1 year of open-label SPD503 treatment.
