    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-agent study. Subjects with at least one melanoma
      lesion â‰¥ 0.2 cm in diameter that can be accurately measured by ruler/caliper or ultrasound
      will receive intralesional injection of PV-10 into each of up to twenty (20) Study Lesions.
      Additionally, one to two measurable Bystander Lesions may remain untreated and will be
      followed for assessment of bystander response.

      To accurately reflect anticipated clinical use, repeat dosing of treated lesions will be
      allowed at the Investigator's discretion at weeks 8, 12 and 16 following initial treatment
      for those lesions not exhibiting complete response. Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks
      following initial treatment with PV-10.
