      progression after standard chemotherapy. Topotecan is active as second-line therapy for SCLC
      patients. However, even in sensitive patients, only 20% response rate and a median time to
      progression of 12 weeks are observed. New therapeutic options in SCLC are needed. Apatinib is
      a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor 2. It has been approved in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two
      or more lines of prior chemotherapy. The efficacy of apatinib in SCLC is unknown. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether topotecan plus apatinib are superior to topotecan alone
      as second-line therapy in small-cell lung cancer.
