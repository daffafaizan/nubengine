      secondary traumatic stress (STS) due to exposure to primary trauma victims have been
      described in helping professionals and in violence researchers. To our knowledge, there are
      few prevalence studies, and no tailored interventions have been tested to reduce secondary
      distress in violence researchers.

      Objective: To (1) describe the epidemiology of emotional distress experienced by Ugandan
      violence researchers; to (2) assess the effectiveness of group debriefings in mitigating
      secondary distress; to (3) assess risk and protective factors.

      Methods: An unblinded, individually randomised trial with parallel assignment was conducted.
      Eligible participants were 59 Ugandan researchers employed by the Good Schools Study (GSS,
      NCT01678846) to interview children and adults who experienced violence in the district of
      Luwero, Uganda. 53 researchers agreed to participate and were randomly allocated. The
      intervention group (n=26) participated in three group debriefings and the control group
      (n=27) participated in three leisure sessions (film viewing).The primary outcome was change
      in levels of emotional distress (SRQ-20); secondary outcomes were levels of VT and STS at
      end-line.
