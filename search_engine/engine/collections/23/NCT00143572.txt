      pidolate for patients with sickle cell disease with either hemoglobin SS disease or
      hemoglobin S beta thalassemia. Hydroxyurea and magnesium pidolate will be tested in pediatric
      and adolescent patients with sickle cell disease who already have been treated with
      hydroxyurea for a minimum of six months. Magnesium pidolate will be given in combination with
      hydroxyurea for six months. In successive small groups of patients, the dose of magnesium
      will be increased in order to eventually determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) for magnesium when given in combination with hydroxyurea. The maximum
      tolerated dose is the highest drug dose that can be given safely to participants. The dose
      limiting toxicity is determined when drug side effects prevent an increase in dose.
