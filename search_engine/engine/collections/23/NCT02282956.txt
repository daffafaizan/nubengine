      pain relief after hallux surgery. The primary objective is to assess the morphine requirement
      in the first 24 hours after surgery. Secondary objectives are maximum pain scores and
      sleeping quality in the postoperative period. Patient's satisfaction with the pain therapy
      and approximately nerve block duration will be asked in the final interview.

      Primary study endpoint is a 50% reduction of morphine requirement with a 60% standard
      deviation within 24 hours after surgery. Power is 80%, the level of significance is set at 5%
      (p < 0,05).

      Secondary endpoints are sleeping quality and maximum pain scores (maximum VAS) measured by
      means of postoperative questionnaire.
