    
      Post-Polio syndrome (PPS) is characterised by new muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue several
      years to decades after the acute polio infection. Pathomechanisms are not yet fully
      understood.

      This is a longitudinal, observational study. The aims are (a) to detect spinal cord gray (and
      possibly) white matter atrophy in patients with Post Polio Syndrome in comparison to healthy
      age and sex matched control subjects both cross-sectionally and longitudinally and (b) to
      correlate spinal cord gray and white matter atrophy to metrics of clinical disability.

      Investigators will assess 20 patients with Post-Polio syndrome and 20 control subjects at
      baseline and 48 weeks by MRI and clinically including quantitative muscle strength
      assessments.
