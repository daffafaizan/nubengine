      constrict. As a result, hypercapnia or hyperoxia may affect the production and drainage of
      aqueous humour in the anterior chamber of the eye. The balance between the production and
      drainage of the aqueous humour determines the intraocular pressure. As this system is
      hydrodynamic, it is expected that any increase or decrease in the production of aqueous
      humour due to dilation or constriction of the capillaries within the ciliary body will be
      compensated by increased or decreased drainage at the trabecular meshwork. Therefore
      intraocular pressure is not expected to show a response to hypercapnia or hyperoxia, but this
      supposition needs to be tested in a stably controlled manner of inducing inhaled gas
      provocations. This study will measure the intraocular pressure at varying levels of
      hypercapnia and hyperoxia using a sequential rebreathing circuit and automated gas blender.
      This will allow the precise targeting and stable control of end-tidal partial pressure values
      of carbon dioxide and oxygen.

      In this study, intraocular pressure will be measured at seven different inhaled gas stages.
      The seven stages are as follows:

        1. Baseline, measured in eye A (PETCO2=38mmHg and PETO2=100mmHg)

        2. 10% hypercapnic increase, measured in eye A (PETCO2=42mmHg and PETO2=100mmHg)

        3. 20% hypercapnic increase, measured in eye A (PETCO2=46mmHg and PETO2=100mmHg)

        4. Baseline, measured in both eyes (PETCO2=38mmHg and PETO2=100mmHg)

        5. 250% hyperoxic increase, measured in eye B (PETCO2=38mmHg and PETO2=250mmHg)

        6. 500% hyperoxic increase, measured in eye B (PETCO2=38mmHg and PETO2=500mmHg)

        7. Baseline, measured in eye B (PETCO2=38mmHg and PETO2=100mmHg)
