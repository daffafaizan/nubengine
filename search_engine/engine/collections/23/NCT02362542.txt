      variety of clinical conditions. In addition, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that
      modifying the activity of brain circuits involved in eating behavior could provide
      therapeutic benefits in obesity.

      The investigators aim to assess whether modulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLFPC) using tDCS, modifies behavioral response and brain activity while watching visually
      presented food cues in obese subjects.

      Subjects will receive tDCS two times, one is active stimulation and the other is sham
      stimulation. Both stimulations will be separated at least one week and the order of sham and
      active tDCS will be counterbalanced across subjects.

      Subjects will perform functional MRI experiments with visual food cues. Questionnaire with
      behavior measures, body compositions, blood tests will be performed.
