      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 (veliparib) when administered
      daily for 14 days out of a 21 day cycle in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine
      (vinorelbine ditartrate) in subjects with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and
      breast cancer (BRCA) mutation associated breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 when combined with cisplatin and vinorelbine
      and the safety/tolerability profile of the combination.

      II. Evaluate the level of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition at each dose level to
      determine whether maximal PARP inhibition is achieved.

      III. Identify the subgroup of triple negative breast cancer patients who will potentially
      derive the most benefits from PARP inhibition combined with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 (days 0-13 of course 1
      only). Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and
      vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 10-20 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6-10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment
      with veliparib alone may continue in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days.
