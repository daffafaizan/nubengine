      conducted with present and past cancer patients, focus groups with families/care givers of
      cancer patients and health care professionals (cancer specialist nurses, clinical and medical
      oncologists, speech and language therapists, dietitians, oncology social workers and
      counselors). The interviews will help collect data and gain understanding on the needs of
      cancer patients, barriers to current food proposals and expectations from new solutions. In
      subsequent stages, semi-quantitative studies will be conducted with cancer patients that
      require texture-modified foods (Stage 2) and patients with taste & smell alterations (Stage
      3). Patients will be required to evaluate texture-modified products (developed using 3D food
      printing technology) and taste-optimised products (i.e. soups, mousses, fruit and vegetable
      beverages, dairy desserts and seasonings) developed based on the results obtained from Stage
      1 above.
