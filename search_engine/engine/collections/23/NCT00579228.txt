      mellitus. This observation study will evaluate non-traditional risk factors for their
      contributions to vascular disease progression as determined by carotid intima media thickness
      and history of vascular disease events over 1 year. This study requires annual checks of
      blood, urine, history, and carotid ultrasound for carotid intimal medical thickness.
