    
      Voluntary patients who have been diagnosed with proximal humerus fracture and managed by
      surgical or conservative will be included in the study.

      Patients with stabilization after proximal humerus fracture with surgical fixation will be
      considered as the Surgery group, and patients treated with non-surgical treatment with sling
      immobilization will be considered as the Conservative group. Signed voluntary consent will be
      obtained from participants. Patients having surgical fixation or nonoperative management will
      be assessed for kinesiophobia, pain, range of motion, functional status, and quality of life.
