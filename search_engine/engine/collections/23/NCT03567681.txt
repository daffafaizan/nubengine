      conducted by a central "meta-site" reviewing eligibility, obtaining consent, randomizing
      subjects to treatment groups, training local care providers (LCP) to function as sub-
      investigators and monitoring outcomes.

      Subjects will be randomized to six weeks of treatment with extended release oxcarbazepine or
      immediate release oxcarbazepine,while remaining under the care of their existing LCP.

      LCP's will receive sub-investigator training for Good Clinical Practice, Human subjects
      protection, and all protocol specified assessments and procedures.

      A computer simulated rater will collect outcomes (including MADRS, YMRS, PHQ-9, and adverse
      effects) ahead of each routine clinical visit and provide Measure-based Guidance o the LCP in
      the form of pre-assessment reports. The primary outcome variable is "treatment effectiveness"
      operationally defined as the response rate X the completion rate.
