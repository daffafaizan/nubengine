      of disorders among minors under the care of child psychiatry in full or part-time
      hospitalization are disorders of psychological development (32%) and behavioural and
      emotional disorders (24.6%). Hospitalisation is reserved for the most complex acute crisis
      situations, as well as for children who need to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team
      several times a week to support their psychological development. In our study, the
      investigators focus on one of the clinical manifestations regularly present: the state of
      agitation when its intensity is moderate to severe. "The state of agitation is defined as a
      psychic, motor and relational behavioural disorder that leads to a reaction of intolerance on
      the part of people in the entourage". The care teams will then implement care actions that
      will be a graduated response adapted to the intensity of these states of agitation. In
      addition to the support provided by a caregiver, the investigators propose to use the "Inner
      Garden" system developed in 2014 at the laboratory of National Institute for Research in
      Digital Science and Technology in Bordeaux. It is an interactive Zen garden allowing to
      present feedback (topographical, physiological) under different sensory modalities.
