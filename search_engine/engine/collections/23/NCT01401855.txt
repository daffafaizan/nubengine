      standard, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, yields approximately 10-25% of indeterminate
      results, leading to patients undergoing thyroidectomy for diagnosis. Elastic scattering
      spectroscopy (ESS) is a new, minimally invasive optical-biopsy technique, mediated by
      fiber-optic probes, that which is sensitive to cellular and sub-cellular morphological
      features. We assessed the potential to incorporate an ESS probe into a 23-gauge needle biopsy
      to use in preoperative trans-cutaneous biopsy of the thyroid to differentiate benign from
      malignant thyroid nodules.

      Methods: We designed and built a miniaturized ESS probe that can fit through a 23-gauge
      biopsy needle and tested it under an IRB-approved protocol on 34 patients undergoing
      ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of thyroid nodules in the endocrine clinic. ESS data was
      collected during the conduct of their biopsy using optical 5 repetitive readings from three
      distinct locations within the thyroid nodule. Using cytology as our gold standard, spectral
      analyses were compared between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. For indeterminate
      cytology, final post-surgery pathology of the tissue was used for the comparison.
