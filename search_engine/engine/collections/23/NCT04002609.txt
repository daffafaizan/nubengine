      University of Debrecen for flexible bronchoscopy were asked to participate in the study.
      After explaining the procedure in detail, all patients gave written informed consent.

      The indication of flexible bronchoscopy was based in all cases on the results of medical
      history, physical examination, chest X-ray and/or chest CT scan, lung function tests and
      laboratory parameters including hemoglobin concentration, hemostasis variables as well as
      blood gas analysis when necessary.

      Bronchoscopy (PENTAX EB-1975K) was performed after an at least 4-hour fasting period. The
      procedure was performed either in sitting or supine position after a topical administration
      of lidocaine 2% solution. Routine monitoring consisted of ECG, non-invasive blood pressure
      measurement, pulse oxymetry (finger probe). As an additional monitoring tool, near infrared
      monitoring sensor was placed to the forhead of the dominant hemisphere of patients for
      monitoring cerebral oxygen saturation. INVOS 5100 C cerebral oximeter (Covidien llc, 15
      Hampshire Street, Mansfield, MA 02048 USA) was used for cerebral near infrared spectroscopy
      measurements.
