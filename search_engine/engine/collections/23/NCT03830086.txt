      endotracheal intubation.

      The use of regional anesthesia in laparoscopy is reserved to patients declared unfit for
      general anesthesia because of severe comorbidities or it is applied in combination with
      general anesthesia to decrease postoperative pain.

      Recently, growing literature evidence supports the use of regional anesthesia in patients
      undergoing laparoscopy.

      The combination of minimally invasive surgery with regional anesthesia could increase the
      advantages of laparoscopic operations (less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, etc).
