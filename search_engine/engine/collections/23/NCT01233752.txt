      hours post-surgery in the two groups of patients, A e B. Group A: homozygous patients for the
      more frequent allele of the polymorphism A118G of OPRM1 gene (about 80%); group B: both
      homozygous and heterozygous patients for the less frequent allele (about 20%).

      In order to avoid the bias related to alterations in metabolism, patients with Cmax and AUC
      of morphine (and metabolites M6G and M3G) >2 standard deviation higher than expected
      population curve ("outliers") will be excluded for the primary purpose.
