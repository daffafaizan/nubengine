        -  To describe illness perception as indicated in the five domains of the Common Sense
           Model (i.e., identity, cause, time line, consequences, controllability) and their
           relationship to symptom distress in patients with colon, rectal, pancreatic, or liver
           (i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma) cancer.

        -  To describe pain and other symptoms and their relationship to overall symptom distress
           in these patients.

        -  To describe overall quality of life (QOL) and its specific summary scales in these
           patients.

        -  To explore the relationship among characteristics (i.e., sociodemographic, disease,
           health status) associated with illness perceptions, overall symptom distress, and QOL in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo an empirical examination of illness perceptions as predictors of
      disease, specifically from the five domains in the Common Sense Model. Patients undergo an
      assessment of the relationship between influencing characteristics (i.e., sociodemographic),
      symptoms, and behavioral factors (i.e., illness perceptions, overall symptom distress, and
      quality of life). Patients complete questionnaires to evaluate demographics by the
      Sociodemographic, Disease, and Health Status Tool; illness perception by the Illness
      Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R); symptoms and symptom distress by the Memorial
      Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and Brief Pain Inventory; and quality of life by the SF-12.
      Patients also undergo a medical chart review and self-report on sociodemographic
      characteristics.
