      and in the COPD patient (Rabinovitch et al ERJ 2003; van Helvoort et al Respir Med 2005;
      Davidson WJ et al. J Appl Physiol). Nevertheless, although it has been described that some of
      the systemic biomarkers related with COPD (Protein C-Reactive (PCR), interleukin [IL]-8) are
      associated with a lower tolerance to exercise in COPD patients (García-Río et al. Respir Res
      2010), the role of IC on systemic inflammation triggered by exercise in COPD patients remains
      unknown.

      This study explores the hypothesis that the inflammatory response induced by exercise in COPD
      patients could be with IC treatment.
