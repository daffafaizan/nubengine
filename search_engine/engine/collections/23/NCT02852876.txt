      ASP2151 single rising doses in groups A-H in fasted condition and to determine the maximum
      tolerable dose (MTD) if possible.

      Part 2 will evaluate the effect of fasted versus fed conditions on the safety, tolerability
      and PK of a single dose of ASP2151 in two treatment cycles. The wash-out period between the
      two treatment cycles will be at least 5 days and not shorter than five times the average
      elimination half-life of ASP2151, as determined in part 1 of the study.
