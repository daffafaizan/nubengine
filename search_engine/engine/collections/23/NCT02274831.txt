      care involving multiple diagnostics and treatments. They are often discharged home with
      instructions to follow up with their primary care physician. This follow up care is crucial
      to ensuring optimal patient outcomes and re-establishing continuity of care. Despite efforts
      to communicate clearly and effectively, ED patients often have difficulty understanding their
      follow-up care instructions. Several different methods have been employed to attempt to
      improve the follow-up rates after emergency department care, including providing patients
      with an easily read, printed copy of discharge instructions, having a nurse or mid-level
      provider call patients days after discharge from the ED to ensure that they understood
      discharge instructions. One medium for communication that has become increasingly relevant in
      recent years is electronic mail (email). Because of its pervasiveness and relative ease of
      use, email offers a potentially valuable resource for augmenting and improving communication
      between physicians and patients. This study will assess whether an email reminder with follow
      up instructions one day after ED visit occurs will increase follow up rates and timely follow
      up rates.
