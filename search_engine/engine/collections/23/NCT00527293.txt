        -  To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from partial breast irradiation using two
           different techniques.

        -  To determine patient satisfaction with partial breast irradiation as it pertains to
           their overall treatment experience as measured by a questionnaire.

        -  To determine if there are patient factors that limit a patient's suitability to receive
           partial breast irradiation delivered by a particular technique.

        -  To evaluate wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast
           irradiation.

        -  To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation comprising either MammoSiteÂ®
      brachytherapy twice daily for 5-10 days OR 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily
      for 5-10 days.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
