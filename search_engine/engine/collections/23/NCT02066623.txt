      including specifically the following objectives:

        -  Documentation of all consecutive patients having been treated with the ABSORB
           biore-sorbable vascular scaffold system under clinical real-world conditions

        -  Documentation of indications, procedural results, and short and long-term outcomes

        -  Documentation of the technical performance of ABSORB implant procedures

        -  Collection of safety data, in particular documentation of hospital mortality, major
           non-fatal complications (especially myocardial infarction, Re-PCI (percutaneous coronary
           intervention) or CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), stroke, thrombosis)

        -  Documentation of long-term patient safety marked by mortality and major non-fatal
           complications (especially myocardial infarction, Re-PCI or CABG, stroke, thrombosis) at
           30 days, 6 months, 2 years and 5 years

        -  Gathering of health economics data (capture of direct costs, especially with view to
           change of medication and outpatient/inpatient hospital services, and indirect costs) pre
           and post ABSORB implant

        -  Gathering data on the quality of life pre and post ABSORB implant to document individual
           QoL dimensions as well as QALY (quality adjusted life year) data
