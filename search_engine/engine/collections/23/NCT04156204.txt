      to once-daily formulations.3 The current literature investigating utilization of once-daily
      immunosuppressive regimens in the AYA kidney transplant population is limited. Two studies
      have demonstrated safe and effective conversion of twice-daily tacrolimus to the Astagraf® in
      stable pediatric solid organ transplant recipients.4,5 Patients maintained equivalent
      tacrolimus exposure and experienced similar rates of rejection and graft loss in the first
      year post-conversion.5 To date, experience with another once-daily extended release (XR)
      tacrolimus product, Envarsus XR®, has not been published in the AYA population. Additionally,
      adherence studies evaluating a once-daily immunosuppression regimen including
      extended-release tacrolimus and azathioprine (which is dosed once daily as opposed to the
      twice daily dosing required for azathioprine's alternative mycophenolate mofetil) have not
      been conducted.

      Of note, and even though twice-daily mycophenolate has been shown to be superior to
      once-daily azathioprine early post-transplant, more long-term data suggest that this
      advantage may not persist.6 Furthermore, a recent Cochrane review addressed the question of
      mycophenolate versus azathioprine as primary anti-proliferative immunosuppression for kidney
      transplant recipients; it concluded that "balancing the benefits and harms of the two drugs
      remains a major task of the transplant physician to decide which agent" is appropriate for
      the individual patient. 7 Moreover, once-daily immunosuppression with tacrolimus
      extended-release and once-daily azathioprine has been used with excellent results at a
      British center that focusses on AYA kidney transplant recipients.
