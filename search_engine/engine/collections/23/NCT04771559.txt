      in patients with cancer. Patients followed up in medical oncology clinic and healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled in the study. Blood samples of participants will be taken 4 weeks
      after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After blood samples are centrifuged at 2500
      rpm for 10 minutes, the separated serum will be backed up in two different eppendorf tubes
      and stored at -80 or -20 degrees. The samples will be delivered to the working center in a
      manner suitable for cold chain transport. COVID-19 antibody test will be performed on the
      blood samples. In addition, volunteers will be questioned in terms of side effects that may
      develop after vaccination and the information obtained will be recorded in the database
      together with the clinical data of the patients.
