    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, in patients with unstable angina who are not responding
      to standard medical therapy and who are eligible for coronary angioplasty. The primary
      outcomes of the study include any of the following within 30 days: the number of deaths from
      any cause, myocardial infarctions or the number of recurrent ischemic events requiring urgent
      intervention (such as a coronary artery bypass surgery, repeat coronary angioplasty, coronary
      stent placement, or intra-aortic balloon pump). Please see attached results.

      Patients will be treated with abciximab or matching placebo.
