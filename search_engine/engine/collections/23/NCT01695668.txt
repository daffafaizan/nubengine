      disease. Ocular symptoms may be the first presentation of GVHD and may be seen in the absence
      of systemic manifestations. GVHD is categorized into acute and chronic forms as defined by
      100 days after the transplant. Acute GVHD is characterized by dermatitis, hepatitis, and
      enteritis. Chronic GVHD involves the skin, mouth, liver, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and
      eyes. Ocular GVHD is a common cause of dry eye symptoms in patients who have undergone bone
      marrow transplant (BMT), and can be defined as ocular surface disease in the context of GVHD.
      Dry eyes develop in 76% of acute GVHD patients and between 62.5% and 81.8% of chronic GVHD
      patients. Current treatment for ocular GVHD includes topical cyclosporine 0.05% (Restasis,
      Allergan). Topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% (Lotemax, Bausch and Lomb) has been shown to be
      safe and efficacious in treatment of inflammatory ocular disorders, but has not been
      prospectively studied in ocular GVHD.

      2. Hypothesis: We anticipate that topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% will be safe and
      efficacious in treatment of ocular GVHD patients, and would add to the armamentarium of
      therapeutics for this disease. Further, by following the natural progression of the disease
      prior to a patient's Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT), we may elucidate a new standard of care
      for these patients - one that involves referral to an ophthalmologist before ocular GVHD
      symptoms arise.
