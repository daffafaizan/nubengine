      to treat, and predict poor outcomes in conventional and neurobehavioral interventions. Here,
      we evaluate the extent to which a novel intervention capitalizing on a preserved
      neurocircuitry for attending to evolutionarily salient somatosensory stimuli can be used to
      train attentional mechanisms to override otherwise pre-potent negative cognitions. The
      initial period will involve open-label intervention refinement and mechanistic evaluation of
      mechanism; N=35 individuals with high levels of intrusive negative cognitions and dysphoria
      will be assessed pre/post intervention in the graded sensory training condition. Success will
      suggest a new intervention pathway for a traditionally treatment-resistant dimension of
      psychopathology. The second phase will be a randomized trial of 70 participants equally
      allocated to graded and non-graded training conditions.
