      I. To assess the value and/or limitations of using orally supplemented arginine (L-arginine)
      to improve renal function associated with the use of anti-angiogenic therapies that target
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive arginine orally (PO) four times daily (QID). Treatment continues
      for up to 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patience receive placebo PO QID. Treatment continues for up to 3 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up within 1 month.
