      Skills Lab located in the UF Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine Institute. During this test
      session the patient will be asked to wear a 0.5mm thick lead wrap-around apron and thyroid
      shield for maximal protection from radiation. The patient will also be asked to wear three
      dosimeter badges: one on the collar, one on the waist, and a ring badge under a pair of
      regular sterile surgical gloves.

      The patient will attempt to obtain a "perfect" anterior-posterior (AP) and axillary views of
      a cadaver wrist using a mini-fluoroscopy unit equipped with a laser pointer.

      A "perfect" view is considered the ability to obtain perfect circle views through a
      cannulated mini acutrak screw that will have been placed into the cadaver prior to data
      collection.

      The patient will attempt to achieve the perfect views using the fluoroscopy unit with and
      without the laser pointer. The use of the laser pointer will be randomized by a randomization
      table that is prepared prior to testing. The patient's total fluoroscopy time and the number
      of shots you take for each task recorded. The investigators will also record the number of
      years training the patient has as an orthopaedic surgeon.

      Female Participants: Because the radiation exposure from the fluoroscopy machine in this
      study might affect an unborn baby, the patient will not be allowed to participate in the
      study if they are pregnant. All women of childbearing potential must take a pregnancy test
      prior to participating in this study.
