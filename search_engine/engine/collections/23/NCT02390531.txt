      adult dose for treatment of acute severe ROP, little is known about lower doses of
      bevacizumab for ROP. An increasing number of ophthalmologists are treating premature infants
      with severe ROP using bevacizumab. Given the potential systemic and ocular adverse effects of
      intravitreal bevacizumab injections, determining a lower effective dose of bevacizumab is an
      important next step. The proposed study will test progressively lower doses to find a dose to
      take forward to a future larger study.
