      platelet function response, and prevention of HDP through a prospective, cohort study using
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics and bioinformatics. The results of this proposal will
      provide necessary data for prospective study on individualized aspirin dose adjustment for
      prevention of HDP.

      Aim 1: Establish pharmacodynamic endpoints for aspirin in prevention of HDP Hypothesis:
      PFA-100 closure time and serum thromboxane/urinary dehydrothromboxane-B2 (dTX-B2) are
      pharmacodynamic markers of aspirin response and are predictive of HDP high risk pregnant
      patients.

      Aim 2: Explore aspirin pharmacogenetics by assessing the relationship between platelet
      receptor genotype, aspirin response, and prevention of HDP Hypothesis: Platelet receptor
      genotype is associated with race and may result in reduced platelet response to aspirin
      therapy, and increased incidence of HDP.

      Aim 3: Assess the utility of circulating microRNA as a marker of aspirin response in
      pregnancy and risk of HDP Hypothesis: Quantitative expression of selected miRNAs are
      biomarkers for response to aspirin therapy and risk of HDP.

      Aim 4: Evaluate aspirin pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics Hypothesis: Individual factors
      influence aspirin pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and may impact individual dosing of
      aspirin
