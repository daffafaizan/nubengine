      experienced by palliative care patients. Technology-based reminiscence and dignity therapy
      interventions have been demonstrated to improve well-being and quality of life in older
      adults (Lazar et al, 2014), although little evidence exists to support the use of these
      technology-based interventions in a palliative care context.

      These technologies may require modification to meet the needs of PEOLC patients that are at
      risk for delirium, a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by fluctuating disruptions in
      awareness, focus and cognition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Delirium can be
      experienced by up to 88% of patients at the end of life (Hosie et al., 2013). Moreover,
      patients in PEOLC settings may also have limited mobility or may be bedbound. Due to the
      potential for disorientation and reduced physical mobility, patients receiving PEOLC may be
      unable to fully enjoy an immersive experience using a virtual reality (VR) headset. To reduce
      the possibility of disorientation that may arise from using a VR headset with 'LIFEView', our
      research team plans to use the 'LIFEView' prototype software loaded on a laptop and connected
      to a mobile high-definition 40-42" TV for inpatient PCU and LTC facility use, or to a
      patient's personal TV within their residence in the community.
