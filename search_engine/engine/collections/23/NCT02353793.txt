      as impaired coagulation, increased rate of wound infections and overall patient discomfort
      among others. Therefore, the investigators test out the new self warming (via an exothermic
      reaction) ReadyHeatÂ® blanket device against the currently used cotton wool blanket in terms
      of effects on the prevention and treatment of hypothermia. Near body core temperature is
      measured by a sublingual sensor as the "gold standard" of body core temperature measurement -
      the pulmonary artery catheter - is too invasive and not suited for this collective of
      patients in the emergency room setting. Blanket use will be randomized. Temperature will be
      taken at emergency room admission, after 15, 30 and 45 minutes of treatment as well as right
      before handing the patient over to the next caring unit (ICU, IMC, operating theatre etc.).
      If treatment time is shorter than expected measurement will stop at the latest possible
      point. Blankets will be applied to the patient once admission in the emergency room is
      complete and will only be lifted for interventions.
