    
      The primary study objective is to demonstrate the clinical non inferiority of efficacy
      between Diosmin 600 mg tablets versus combination Diosmin 900 mg + Hesperidin 100 mg tablets
      in improving lower limb symptoms assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) over 6
      months among adult patients presenting chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs.

      The secondary study objectives are to compare between Diosmin 600 mg tablets and combination
      Diosmin 900 mg + Hesperidin 100 mg tablets in terms of:

        -  The oral acceptability,

        -  The tolerability,

        -  The global patient's satisfaction,

        -  The global physician's satisfaction.

      Clinical assessments will take place at the study center during the study visits at M0, M2,
      M4 and M6 including:

        -  Efficacy on venous symptoms : The VAS of 100 mm is rated by the patient from "0" =
           Absence of venous symptoms up to "100" = Maximal intensity of the venous symptoms. The
           VAS is completed by the patient at the investigator's office. This VAS globally assesses
           the venous symptomatology of the most symptomatic leg : Heavy legs, Painful legs, Tired
           legs, Sensation of swelling and/or tension in the legs).

        -  Acceptability : Easiness to swallow assessed by a VAS of 100 mm rated by the patient
           from "0" = Very easy to swallow, up to "10" = Very difficult to swallow

        -  Patient's global satisfaction related to the treatment efficacy : Four levels scale
           rated as following : bad, acceptable, good, and very good

        -  Investigator's global satisfaction related to the treatment efficacy : Four levels scale
           rated as following : bad, acceptable, good, and very good

        -  Tolerability (related adverse events)

        -  Compliance : Accountability of treatments returned by the patient

      The primary endpoint will be the change between the VAS symptoms scores at M0 and M6 / end of
      study visit (early withdrawal). Secondary endpoints include assessments of efficacy, oral
      acceptability of study drug, and tolerance.
