      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific cancer. "Investigational" means that the drug is still being studied and that
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the
      side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of
      cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet
      approved the drug for use in patients, including people with Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

      Avelumab is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by enabling the activation of the
      immune system. Avelumab blocks an immune inhibiting signal that can impair the ability of the
      immune system to attack cancers.

      Talazoparib is a drug that stops the activity of a protein (called PARP) that's involved in
      repairing damage to the DNA within your cells. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib in
      cancer cells, DNA damage cannot be repaired and leads to the death of the cancer cells.

      Axitinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by blocking certain proteins that
      cancer cells use to form new blood vessels, which the cancer needs in order to grow.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether Avelumab, the
      combination of Avelumab and Talazoparib, or the combination of Avelumab and Axitinib are
      effective in treating recurrent and Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

      Additionally, the investigators are looking to see if participants whose tumors contain a
      particular genetic make-up will have better response to Avelumab, the combination of Avelumab
      and Talazoparib, or the combination of Avelumab and Axitinib.
