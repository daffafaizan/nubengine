      Primary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response in women with HER2-positive stage IIIB-IV
           breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide
           followed by docetaxel and trastuzumab (Herceptin®).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the recurrence-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide in weeks 1-3. Treatment with
      epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Patients
      then receive docetaxel in week 13 and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in weeks 13-15. Treatment with
      docetaxel and trastuzumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

      Patients then undergo appropriate surgery. After surgery, patients with hormone
      receptor-positive disease receive trastuzumab once weekly and either tamoxifen with or
      without a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or an aromatase inhibitor. Treatment
      continues for 40 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
