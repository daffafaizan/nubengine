      effective vaccine. But incomplete understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)
      immunity-how it is acquired, how it is measured-limits vaccine development to empiric rather
      than rational approaches. New perspectives are needed. Most individuals infected with MTB
      never actually develop active tuberculosis. Similarly, most individuals with treated
      tuberculosis or BCG vaccination are also protected from subsequent disease. These individuals
      may be said to be immune. One approach to obtaining greater understanding of MTB immunity is
      to study these individuals to discover mechanisms of immunity that mediate their protection
      from disease. Because it is already known that CD4+ T cells are a critical component of MTB
      immunity, studying CD4+ T cell responses to MTB infection in immune individuals is a
      reasonable starting point. To determine which CD4+ T cell subsets and which CD4+ T cell
      immune responses are important, we will compare individuals with prior exposure (immunity) to
      MTB to individuals with active tuberculosis. Because HIV infection interferes with the CD4+ T
      cell response to MTB, it dramatically increases the risks for acquiring MTB infection and for
      developing disease. Under these circumstances it is easier to discern mechanisms relevant to
      MTB immunity because of exaggerated MTB-specific responses. In this study we aim to identify
      CD4+ T cell subsets and responses that correlate with MTB immunity. We anticipate that these
      correlations will yield new insight into mechanisms of MTB immunity that will be relevant to
      vaccine development. In addition, by examining MTB immunity in the setting of HIV
      coinfection, we anticipate new insights into mechanisms of how HIV causes disease.
