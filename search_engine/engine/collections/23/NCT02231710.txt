      infusion (T cells genetically modified with the inducible Caspase 9 suicide gene) of 3x10E6
      to 1X10E7 cells/kg followed by a Rimiducid infusion on day 7 after a partially mismatched,
      related, T cell-depleted hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with
      non-malignant diseases. The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the dose of BPX
      501 T cell infusion with subsequent planned infusion of Rimiducid which can facilitate
      engraftment and prevent the occurrence of GVHD.
