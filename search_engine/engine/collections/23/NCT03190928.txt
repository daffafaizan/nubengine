    
      Background:

        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is
           incurable with standard first-line systemic therapy

        -  The clinical course of FL varies from slowly progressive over many years to a more rapid
           disease course that requires therapy shortly after diagnosis

        -  Early initiation of therapy does not improve survival, and asymptomatic patients are
           often managed with an initial period of watchful waiting

        -  Clinical prognostic indices predict survival, but cannot predict outcome for individual
           patients; biologic-based classifiers (gene-expression profiling and somatic mutational
           analyses) are more robust than clinical indices, but require prospective clinical
           validation from the time of diagnosis in the modern treatment era

        -  Paired samples linked to clinical information can lead to the discovery and/or
           validation of therapeutic targets for FL patients at the highest risk of early disease
           progression

      Objective:

      Characterize the molecular biology and clinical course of FL patients, and evaluate the time
      to treatment initiation for those patients who require first-line systemic therapy

      Eligibility:

        -  Follicular lymphoma (grade 1-2, 3a) with no evidence of histological transformation

        -  No previous cytotoxic, biologic or monoclonal antibody therapy for FL (previous
           radiation therapy permitted)

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

      Design:

        -  Patients with FL who meet all eligibility criteria will enroll on the study for expert
           monitoring of their disease, improved risk-stratification, and donation of tissue and
           cellular products for research. Patients will be monitored prospectively until they
           require second-line systemic treatment or the patient decides to withdraw from the
           study; untreated patients will be followed with clinic visits every 4 months for the
           first 2 years. After 2 years, protocol-specified visits will be increased to every 6
           months until 5 years. After 5 years, protocol-specified visits will be annually until
           disease progression requiring first-line therapy.

        -  Patients without an indication for first-line systemic therapy at 2 years from initial
           study enrollment will be offered an optional biopsy of their lymph node and bone marrow.

        -  During first-line systemic therapy, patients can continue being monitored on this study
           for post-therapy clonal evolution. Protocol-specified visits after therapy will be every
           6 months until 3 years. After 3 years, protocol-specified visits will be annually until
           disease progression requiring second-line therapy.

        -  Upon initiation of second-line therapy, if applicable, patients will move to survival
           follow-up only.
