      as interleukin IL-6, IL-1Î², and IL-17. These cytokines promote chemokine production and
      changes in cell phenotype which lead to activation of T and B cells, macrophages,
      neutrophils, and mast cells further amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Different analgesic
      modalities are used for pain management during and after spine surgery as narcotic
      analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Paracetamol and neuraxial techniques like
      intrathecal drug administration, epidural analgesia and paravertebral block. In this study,
      Paravertebral Block is used as a new and recent analgesic strategy for spine surgery. It has
      the advantage of higher success rate and analgesic efficacy, less risk of neurological
      complications than most other regional anesthetic techniques, less nausea, vomiting, and
      constipation compared with opioid-based analgesic techniques, urinary retention does not
      occur, unlike neuraxial techniques and intense block of both the sympathetic and somatic
      nerves. This study will be conducted with the hypothesis that the addition of paravertebral
      block as an analgesic regimen with total intravenous anesthesia (propofol-based) will have a
      better Immunomodulatory effect in patients undergoing posterior lumbar spine fixation
      surgery.
