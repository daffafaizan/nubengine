    
      This is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial. Eligible participants who agree to enroll
      in the study will be asked to attend four testing sessions. Participants in both groups will
      receive dry needling to the involved head and cervical muscles and the other group, in
      addition to receiving a dry needling intervention, will be instructed in a standard home
      exercise program consisting of strengthening and stretching exercises for the upper quarter.
      All dry needling (using standard clean technique) will be performed by licensed physical
      therapists board certified in orthopaedic physical therapy and having a minimum of 5 years of
      experience treating patient populations with dry needling.

      The aim of this research study is to compare he effectiveness of dry needling alone with dry
      needling and a home exercise program on pain, pain sensitivity, cervical range of motion, and
      changes in the severity and frequency among individuals with headache symptoms.
