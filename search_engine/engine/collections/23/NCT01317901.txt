      a safe dosing regimen, and a Phase 2 component designed to evaluate the efficacy of BRT
      compared to BR in subjects with relapsed indolent lymphoma. The Phase 2 component was not
      conducted.

      This was an open-label, non randomized, multiple-dose escalation study to determine the MTD
      of BRT and to determine a safe dosing regimen for the combination in subjects with relapsed
      indolent lymphoma.

      The study consisted of a screening period lasting up to 21 days, a treatment period lasting
      up to 6 cycles (28 days each), and a 60-day follow-up period. Up to 12 subjects (2 cohorts of
      6 subjects each) were planned for enrollment. Two dose levels (10 and 20 mg/kg) of TRU-016
      combined with rituximab 375 mg/m2 and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 were evaluated during up to 6
      cycles (28 days each). TRU-016 was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 15
      of each cycle. Rituximab was administered by IV infusion on Day 2 of each cycle. Bendamustine
      was administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Subjects received study
      treatment for up to 6 cycles.
