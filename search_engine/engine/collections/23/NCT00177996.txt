      recruiting men and women, ages 18 to 60, to examine the effectiveness of the FDA-approved
      medication sertraline (Zoloft) for major depression.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group will begin and
      continue taking Zoloft at different doses. A physician will follow eligible participants
      weekly for approximately 12 weeks
