      to lack of adequate reserves and the significant risks of transfusion reactions. Recent
      advances in the use of patient's own blood (autologous transfusion) has rapidly gained
      acceptance in major surgical procedures, however due to the requirement for prior planning
      and the expense of obtaining and storing a patient's blood prior to surgery this alternative
      is less than ideal.

      This research study utilizes a third alternative, a technique called intraoperative
      autotransfusion, which successfully salvages a patient's blood during surgery and reinfuses
      the blood back into the patient. The blood salvaging device uses a filtration device that
      successfully filters out all tumor cells to prevent re-infusion of viable cancer cells.

      This study is designed to demonstrate the safety and benefits of the blood salvaging device
      on patients undergoing major surgical oncology procedures.
