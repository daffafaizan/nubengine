      bradykinesia or rigidity. If motor disorders are the most visible part, lower urinary tract
      dysfunction is one of the most prevalent dysautonomic disorder (27-80%), especially over
      active bladder syndrome (OAB). If it seems evident that gait and urinary disorders are
      linked, because of similar anatomic pathways and control processes, no studies have
      investigated their association in extrapyramidal patients.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the need to void on the walking speed in
      this particular population.

      This prospective study inclues all parkinsonian syndromes who had a follow-up for OAB. They
      must have a security delay over five minutes, no severe cognitive, motor or psychiatric
      disorders. We invite them to drink until a need to void (or equivalent). Bladder filling is
      measured by bladder scan, then they performe gait tests in a specific place, with calm and no
      passage : Patient can use their habitual walking device. Speed walk asking is comfortable for
      the two test. Three ten-meter tests, one double-task ten-meter test, one timed-up-and-go
      test, one timed raise of the floor (GMT). We repeat the same tests after voiding or
      self-catheterization. Toilets are just next to the hall where they realize the tests. A
      clinical examination assesses urinary dysfunction (USP, IPSS), motor score (UPDRS-III, Hoehn
      and Yahr scale, daily equivalent of levodopa), history of falls and comorbidities.
