      BACKGROUND Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is characterized by diminished exocrine secretions with
      the resultant xerostomia and xerophthalmia due to slowly progressive infiltration of lacrimal
      and salivary glands by inflamatory cells.

      OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the safetyness and efficacy of pilocarpine drops versus
      artificial saliva as symptomatic treatment for dry mouth and dry eyes caused by SS in a
      multicenter, doubleblind, controlled trial.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS After providing written informed consent, 72 patients with primary or
      secondary SS and clinically significant dry mouth and dry eyes will be randomized to receive
      either 5-mg pilocarpine drops, or artificial saliva 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Global
      evaluation and subjective responses of patients will be assessed by questionnaires with
      visual analog scales or categorical checkboxes. All patients will be submited to anxiety and
      psicological test before and after 12 weeks. Whole-mouth salivary flow and lacrimal flow will
      be measured using Schirmer test.
