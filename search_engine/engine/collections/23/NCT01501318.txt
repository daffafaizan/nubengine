      substance use behaviors in medical settings and the immediate provision of a 3-15 minute
      intervention to those found to be at risk. In this pilot study, the investigators seek to
      develop a more efficient and effective approach to providing brief behavioral health
      interventions in the field by comparing a brief coach directed intervention to a tailored
      report only group. The goal is to create a cost-effective and sustainable system that
      provides consumers with tailored information that will help them both initiate and sustain
      the lifestyle changes necessary for improving their overall health.

      Hypothesis 1: In a medical setting, personalized feedback alone will be associated with a
      reduction in risky substance use behaviors.

      Hypothesis 2: In a medical setting, personalized feedback alone will have the same impact on
      behavior as that information plus a brief coach education session on risky substance use
      behaviors..
