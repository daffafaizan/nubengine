    
      May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a venous compression syndrome in which the left common iliac
      vein is compressed between the lower lumbar spine and the right common iliac artery. While
      asymptomatic compression is very common, the process can lead to morbidity in selected
      individuals, most commonly deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and the sequelae thereof.
      Radiologists must recognize the diagnosis because of the unique management, which differs
      from DVT without iliac vein compression.

      The most common clinical presentation is unilateral leg swelling due to acute DVT. It can
      also present as chronic venous insufficiency or chronic thrombosis with symptoms of venous
      hypertension and venous stasis namely claudication, pain, swelling, varicose veins and / or
      ulceration.

      Conventional invasive catheter venography remains the gold standard for diagnosis,but the
      decision to undertake invasive venography should be made only after reviewing all available
      clinical data and alternative, less invasive imaging options have been exhausted.

      When visualization of the common iliac veins is possible, MTS may be diagnosed with
      transabdominal color Doppler U/S.

      MDCT with IV contrast is a fast, widely available examination for the diagnosis of MTS and
      accompanying complications .

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR venography is an attractive modality for the
      diagnosis, However, MRI is expensive, time consuming, has more limited availability than
      computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound, and may be impossible in select patients.
