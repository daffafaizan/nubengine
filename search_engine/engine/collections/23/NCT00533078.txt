      enriched in omega-3 PUFA containing oils, mainly FO. These effects are mediated by their
      active metabolites, the EPA- and DHA-derived eicosanoids, which antagonize the predominantly
      pro-inflammatory derivates of omega-6 PUFA origin. In cardiovascular disease these data are
      supported by several large-scale trials, but there also is growing evidence of beneficial
      effects of an omega-3 PUFA rich diet in GI conditions such as postoperative trauma and
      inflammatory bowel disease. AML patients with neutropenic colitis suffer from a condition
      which is pathophysiologically closely related to the studied diseases. It is therefore
      reasonable to raise the question whether this cohort would equally benefit from a novel
      nutritional regimen enriched in omega-3 PUFA.

      The proposed pilot study will address the question of the clinical value of adding an omega-3
      PUFA containing lipid emulsion to the TPN regimen as regards protection against colitis ≥ °3
      (primary objective). A numerical cutoff will be provided to support the decision whether
      further investigation is warranted or the intervention is considered not promising.

      Target accrual is n=35 patients receiving TPN. An interim analysis will be performed after
      n1=13 patients will be evaluable for the primary endpoint. The results of this interim
      analysis will determine whether continuation of the trial is of interest or the trial be
      stopped. The sample size has been calculated by the use of Simon's two-stage minimax design.
