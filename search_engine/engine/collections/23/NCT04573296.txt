      lifestyle change, weight loss and metabolic health and promoting self-management and
      long-term self-sufficiency. The programme includes personalised nutrition/lifestyle
      education, remote dietitian's one-on-one coaching, weekly goals, diet and activity monitoring
      tools, recipes and support member community. Personalization and semi-automation of the
      intervention are achieved by analysis of participant's interactions with the interface.

      In this prospective randomized clinical study, obese adults with insulin resistance,
      prediabetes or diabetes mellitus type 2, patients of a sports medicine clinic of university
      hospital, are randomized to receive either Vitadio Health or a conventional 6-month
      high-intensity lifestyle intervention programme at the clinic, consisting of face-to-face
      nutrition/lifestyle education (at baseline, months 1 to 3 and month 6) and diet
      self-monitoring. In addition, all participants undergo a regular medical assessment at the
      clinic (baseline, month 3, month 6).

      The aim of the study is to assess feasibility and efficacy of digitally administered
      intervention by comparing evolution of weight, physical fitness, laboratory measures of
      metabolic health, blood pressure, adherence to recommended lifestyle measures and other
      outcomes.
