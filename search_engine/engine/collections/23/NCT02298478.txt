      Surveys which identify clinically significant phobias estimate point prevalence at
      approximately 2.5% of the adult population. Around 10% of the general population do not fly
      due to intense fear, 25% of the population that fly experience intense distress during the
      flight and 20% of people depend on alcohol or tranquilizers to overcome the fear of flying.

      The most effective psychological technique for the treatment of phobias is in vivo exposure.
      Besides, not all patients benefit from in vivo exposure, given that an important amount of
      them do not accept the intervention or drop out (around 25%) when they are informed about the
      intervention procedure or they have problems to access to these therapies.

      Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are pioneer applications that can improve
      treatment adherence and acceptance. Specifically, Computerized programs boasts remarkable
      advantages beyond strictly therapeutic and effectiveness-related ones in treating fear of
      flying: a reduction in direct therapeutic contact time, the possibility of standardizing
      treatment to the maximum, the low cost - which allows a greater extension - and, perhaps most
      importantly, access to patients who would not be very willing to subject themselves to live
      exposure (a real flight) with a steep exposure gradient. The application of
      cognitive-behavioural procedures such as exposure through interactive computer programs is
      especially recommended.
