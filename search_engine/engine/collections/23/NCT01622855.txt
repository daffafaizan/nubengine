      includes two main components: preparation for the medical exam; and information about and
      modelling of coping strategies that may help women cope in the aftermath of assault. The
      intervention content is delivered via video. Intervention and standard care groups were
      compared with regard to measures of substance use and abuse and symptoms of PTSD and other
      potentially comorbid problems including symptoms of depression or other anxiety.
