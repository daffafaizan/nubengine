      on decreasing the patient's suffering as well as disease progression. Peri-implantitis has a
      direct influence on both physical and psychological wellbeing and have been related to
      difficulty in chewing due to loss of implants, bad esthetic appearance as well as high costs.
      Therefore, it is of importance for the individual as well as for the society to thoroughly
      investigate any new treatment approaches.

      The study is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing laser treatment (test group)
      and conventional mucosal flap surgery (active control group). Assessment of clinical
      variables at baseline and after 6 months. Patient reported outcomes at baseline, directly
      after treatment and after 10 days.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate if treatment of peri-implantitis with 970 nm laser combined with scaling and root
      planning (SRP) is clinically comparable to conventional mucosal flap surgery in terms of
      pocket probing depth reduction.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate other clinical and radiological variables connected to peri-implantitis and
           the inflammation surrounding the dental implant.

        -  To evaluate the patient experience of treatment of peri-implantitis.

        -  To evaluate the inflammatory and microbial response after laser treatment
