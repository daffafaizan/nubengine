    
      Primary objective To estimate the prevalence of respiratory aspiration in patients with COPD,
      in a tertiary hospital of Buenos Aires.

      Secondary objective

        1. To assess the association between the presence of aspiration and the usual degree of
           dyspnea in patients with COPD.

        2. To assess the association between the presence of aspiration and the amount of regular
           annual exacerbations in patients with COPD.

        3. To evaluate the association between the presence of aspiration and degree of severity
           according to GOLD criteria in patients with COPD.

        4. Compare the estimated aspiration in COPD patients with known prevalence of pulmonary
           aspiration in the general population in the same age patient prevalence

      Patients will be recruited consecutively in the outpatient clinic of Pulmonology and Medical
      Clinic, where a first encounter with the patient will be agreed. Additionally, the
      investigators will cite patients identified as COPD in the Electronic Medical Records.

      During the first meeting the informed consent process to enter the protocol will take place,
      then the same baseline characteristics of the patient is taken into an online form. Finally
      given a shift within 15 days after the first meeting for the FEEST, and if the patient did
      not have a spirometry over the past year to update a new turn. Both studies will be conducted
      without any cost.

      In patients with impaired swallowing or aspiration presence is detected, we will inform the
      doctor to assess the need for additional studies. In turn, the patients will be referred to
      speech therapy services for rehabilitation of swallowing.
