      specifically designed to reduce the risk of ligamentous knee injuries in female soccer
      players by incorporating proven neuromuscular and proprioceptive training concepts into a
      concise, on-field warm-up activity. All 283 Division I NCAA women's soccer teams were asked
      to participate in this research study. Those that agreed were randomized to control (usual
      training program) and intervention (alternative warm-up program). Both groups of teams
      provided investigators with participation and knee injury information during the 15 week 2002
      fall soccer season. Requested information included only that which would be readily available
      to the certified athletic trainers (ATC) in their normal course of duties. The knee injury
      rates among intervention team athletes were compared with control team athletes to determine
      program effectiveness. Data collection is complete and the report should be submitted shortly
      for publication.
