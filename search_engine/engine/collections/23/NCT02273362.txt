    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safe and minimum effective dose (MED) of daily erlotinib (erlotinib
      hydrochloride) that inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the target
      organ (liver) as assessed by phosphorylated (phospho)-EGFR staining.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and side effects in
      participants with cirrhosis.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and immuno-histochemical
      staining pattern of phospho-ERK, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), epidermal growth
      factor (EGF), and alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) in the liver.

      II. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and gene expression signature
      associated with prognosis in cirrhosis participants following hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      resection.

      III. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and viral load in
      participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive (+).

      IV. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and erlotinib plasma level on
      day of liver resection.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation/de-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days (depending on
      the date of surgery, treatment range may be 5-14 days).
