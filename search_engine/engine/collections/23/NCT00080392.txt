      is a disabling syndrome affecting over 10 million patients in the United States. Intermittent
      claudication is caused by peripheral artery atherosclerosis, the same disease causing heart
      attack. Peripheral artery atherosclerosis impairs blood flow to skeletal muscles in the lower
      limbs. Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), have been shown
      in animal studies to improve blood flow the lower limbs by promoting the growth of new blood
      vessels.

      This clinical study tests the safety and feasibility of gene transfer of an agent (EW-A-401)
      intended to improve blood flow in the skeletal muscle of subjects with intermittent
      claudication. The investigational agent is a circle of genetic material (plasmid DNA) that
      instructs the body to produce a genetically-engineered transcription factor, a protein that
      regulates expression of genes. This specific transcription factor has been shown in animal
      studies to increase expression of the VEGF-A gene, and to promote the growth of new blood
      vessels. The study agent will be delivered by injection into leg muscle during a single
      session. This is the first human experience using this transcription factor.

      This study has a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled design. The
      primary outcome measure will be safety and toxicity. In addition, we will collect exploratory
      effectiveness information including blood flow, walking capacity, quality of life, and
      inspection of blood vessels on samples of leg muscle.
