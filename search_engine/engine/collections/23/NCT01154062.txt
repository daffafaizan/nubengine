    
      This is a multi-center, open label study of pazopanib administered for 28 days in adult
      patients with subfoveal CNV due to neovascular AMD. The primary aim is to evaluate safety and
      tolerability in patients with neovascular AMD and a secondary aim is to evaluate
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This study does not include a control treatment group
      (e.g. placebo or active comparator), and instead will be benchmarked to visual acuity and OCT
      changes observed following treatment with other anti-angiogenic agents in a similar patient
      population over the same treatment period.

      All subjects will receive tablets administered once daily. Subjects will be screened within
      eight days prior to treatment assignment and initiation of study treatment. The duration of
      treatment will be 28 days, and subjects will participate in a baseline and four subsequent
      weekly study visits during the treatment phase. Subjects will also return for a follow-up
      visit approximately two weeks after last dose of study medication.
