      standard anti-viral therapy in previously treated adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C
      infected with genotype 1. The efficacy will be determined through comparison of the sustained
      viral response (SVR) to our protocol three-drug regimen (Betaine, Peginterferon plus
      Ribavirin) to that historically seen in relapsers and non-responders when retreated with
      standard therapy (Peginterferon and Ribavirin alone).

      Secondary objectives include: (1) the comparison of the occurrence of rapid and early
      virologic response in the first 4 (Rapid Virologic Response, RVR) and 12 (Early Virologic
      Response, EVR) weeks of therapy, respectively, between the study regimen and historically
      treated patients. (2) the comparison of ALT normalization between the two groups. and (3) the
      effect on interferon gene signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between the
      two groups in the first 12 weeks of therapy and 6 months following the end of therapy..
