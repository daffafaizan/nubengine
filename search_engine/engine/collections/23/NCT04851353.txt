      may cause stress and pain. The study purposes are to compare the effects of different
      combinations of sensory interventions on newborns' pain responses, physiological distress
      (heart rate and oxygen saturation), and crying event during heel stick procedures. This study
      was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Infants were recruited by convenience
      sampling in a baby room of a medical center in northern Taiwan from September in 2017 to
      September in 2018. Newborns who met the criteria were recruited by blocked random to three
      treatment groups: (1)Gentle touch + Verbal comfort, (2) Smell + gentle touch + Verbal
      comfort, (3) Smell + Taste + Touch + Verbal comfort. Pain response was measured by the
      Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS). The physical distress events were measured by the abnormal
      heart rate and oxygen saturation event, and crying event. All data were collected 5 minutes
      before heel-stick (baseline), during heel-stick and in recovery status.
