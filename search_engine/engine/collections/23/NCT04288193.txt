      for treating insomnia or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Despite
      these medications being associated with significant harms, a considerable portion of older
      adults are prescribed antipsychotics for treatment of insomnia or BPSD. The aim of this study
      is to determine the feasibility of a pharmacist-driven antipsychotic deprescribing initiative
      in a community-based practice setting known as Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly
      (PACE). Our primary objective is to assess and describe the implementation process, including
      barriers and enablers to implementation. Our secondary objectives are to quantify and
      describe changes in antipsychotic prescribing following implementation; evaluate and report
      on antipsychotic re-initiations or changes in dosing; and evaluate and report on adverse drug
      withdrawal events (ADWEs) following antipsychotic deprescribing.
