      combination with chemotherapy were included in this study. The tumor response was assessed by
      local MDT group. Based on tumor response, 58 CRLM patients were classified into two groups
      (CR+PR vs SD+PD). Primary samples of the two group patients will be sequenced by mass
      spectrum. After MS sequencing, a prediction model will be estimated. Another 58 CRLM patients
      will be inclued for validation of the prediction model.
