      peer-led walking intervention. The socio-ecological model and social cognitive theory
      provides the framework that will help inform and test the feasibility of a multi-level
      peer-led walking intervention for inactive older adults living in independent living
      communities in Northern Ireland. The behaviour change techniques identified and extracted
      from a previous systematic review on the effectiveness of peer-led physical activity
      interventions helped guide the decision-making process of which behavior change strategies
      should be included in this study. The logic model helped inform the design and development of
      the 12 week peer-led walking programme.
