      infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience extremes in symptomatology ranging from a complete lack
      of symptoms to rapidly worsening end-stage pulmonary disease. The explanatory mechanism
      underlying susceptibility to severe disease remains unknown. We hypothesize that underlying
      genetic factors are at least partially explanatory. We aim to employ a phenotypic extremes
      approach to rapidly ascertain severely and mildly affected COVID-19 patients for genomic
      interrogation to identify germline and somatic variants that may play a role in host
      susceptibility to disease to correlate those phenotypic extremes with genetic variants. We
      will employ both a rare and common variant approach, using both genome sequencing and SNP
      chip analysis and B and T cell repertoire interrogation.
