      most widely used screening test, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), requires an overnight fast and
      a blood draw. FPG also has poor sensitivity contributing to late diagnoses. A more accurate
      and convenient screening method, like SCOUT, will improve early detection and allow the
      physician to begin a treatment regimen to prevent or delay the development of the disease and
      its serious complications.
