      school age children improves their academic performance. Academic performance is associated
      with motor skills, coordination, and executive function. Our objectives are to determine if
      daily participation in motor lab activities changes these skills, to better understand these
      relationships, track outcomes of children participating in motor lab intervention compared to
      non-intervention and children receiving standard level of care in the school, and to be able
      to follow the intervention students over time.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To investigate whether gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and physical fitness,
           predict executive function skills.

        2. To determine the relationship between these variables and academic performance.

        3. To examine the relationship between participation in motor lab activities and measures
           of change in fitness, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, executive function, and
           academic performance.

        4. To evaluate if participation in daily motor lab activities predicts fitness level, gross
           motor skills, fine motor skills, executive function, and academic success at the end of
           the school year and in the next school year.
