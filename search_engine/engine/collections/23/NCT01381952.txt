      diseases by reducing the procedural invasiveness and the recovery time needed by patients,
      thus improving clinical outcome. However, INR procedures often require many high-quality
      digital substraction angiography (DSA) runs and long total fluoroscopy times, which can
      result in patients being exposed to considerable radiation doses levels.

      In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate
      the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a real-time noise reduction algorithm
      for DSA in neuroradiology that is capable to reduce the patient entrance dose by 75% without
      loss of image quality.
