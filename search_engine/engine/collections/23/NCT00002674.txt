    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of MCE (mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide) followed by
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in
      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen. III.
      Evaluate the cytoreductive effects of this regimen in CML as determined by the ability to
      mobilize Philadelphia chromosome-negative PBSC. IV. Assess the time of peak CD34+ and
      CD34+/CD38- cell concentrations in the peripheral blood of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 DHAD Mitoxantrone,
      NSC-301739 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (source not specified) HU Hydroxyurea,
      NSC-32065 MCE DHAD/ARA-C/VP-16 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Single-Agent Cytoreduction
      followed by 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy/Stem Cell Mobilization. HU; followed by MCE;
      G-CSF.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients will be entered over 3 years.
