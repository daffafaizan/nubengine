    
      Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing elective radiofrequency
      (RF) ablation surgery will be randomly allocated to general anesthesia(GA) group or local
      anesthesia(LA) group.

      Patients from GA group will receive anesthesia induced with 0.05-0.1mg/kg intravenous
      midazolam, 3-6ug/kg fentanyl, 1.0-2.5mg/kg propofol and 0.1-0.2mg/kg atracurium. Laryngeal
      mask will be used to maintain ventilation. Anesthesia will be maintained with 4-8mg/kg/h
      propofol and 0.1-0.3ug/kg/min remifentanil, and additional non-depolarizing muscle relaxant
      when necessary. In patients from LA group, analgesia will be provided by a subcutaneous
      injection of 2% lidocaine by the surgeons before insertion of the needles.

      Serum will be collected from patients of both groups at before induction and 1h post-surgery.
      The HepG2 hepatic cancer cell line will be treated with patient serum from both groups. The
      effects of anesthetic methods on cellular invasion, migration, proliferation will be
      measured. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum from patients of both
      groups will also be analyzed.
