      electronic health records (EHR) based on Sepsis-2 criteria. Sepsis patients will be
      identified using a Sepsis Definition which includes meeting SIRS score of â‰¥2 within 12 hours
      of ED presentation and any microbial testing ordered within 24 hours of ED presentation. The
      patient will be enrolled if it meets the Sepsis Definition and additional EMR data elements
      will be extracted to complete case report form. Furthermore, objectives include to confirm
      the clinical validity and performance of MDW in a control population of sepsis patients where
      MDW is measured but not reported to physicians. This study is an observational study which
      will simulate the decision impact of MDW on sepsis identification and patient management
