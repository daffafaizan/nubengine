      examine in healthy volunteers the effects of analgesics given in approved daily doses in
      addition to daily cardio-protective doses of aspirin (81 mg) on the stomach. All subjects are
      examined endoscopically before receiving study medication, and at the end of treatment on Day
      9. Each subject takes 81 mg of aspirin daily plus one of the following treatments to be taken
      daily on Days 1 through 8: four doses of acetaminophen 1000 mg, three doses of ibuprofen 400
      mg, two doses of naproxen sodium (440 mg in the morning and 220 mg in the evening), four
      doses of aspirin 650 mg, two doses of celecoxib 200 mg, one dose of rofecoxib 25 mg, or no
      additional study medication. On Day 9, one dose of aspirin 81 mg and only one dose of the
      assigned treatment drug are taken prior to having an endoscopy. The primary endpoints of the
      study are the effects of the analgesics on the inhibition of COX-1 activity by aspirin, and
      any injury to the stomach mucosa, as determined by direct endoscopic observation. Safety
      assessments consist of routine monitoring for adverse events, as well as endoscopic
      examination of gastric mucosa for erosions and ulcerations occurring during the treatment
      phase. The study hypothesis is that the effects of acetaminophen on the stomach do not differ
      from the effects of ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, celecoxib, or rofecoxib. 81 mg aspirin and
      1of 7 treatments for 8 days: acetaminophen 1000mg 4xday, ibuprofen 400mg 3xday, naproxen
      440mg morning and 220mg evening, no additional study medication, aspirin 650mg 4xday,
      celecoxib 200mg 2xday,rofecoxib 25mg 1xday. On Day 9, 1 dose aspirin & 1 dose study drug
      before endoscopy.
