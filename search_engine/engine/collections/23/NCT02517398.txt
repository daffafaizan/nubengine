    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial with consecutive parallel-group
      expansion in selected solid tumor indications. The current trial is composed of a standard
      dose escalation "3 + 3" cohort design, for which 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled at each
      dose level depending on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), followed by a
      consecutive parallel-group expansion in selected solid tumor indications. Cohorts of 3
      subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, for which no standard effective
      therapy exists or standard therapy has failed, will receive MSB0011359C (M7824) at escalating
      dose levels. After determination of the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), enrollment in several
      expansion cohorts will be opened to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) /
      Pharmacodynamic, and clinical activity of MSB0011359C (M7824). Subjects who have experienced
      a confirmed complete response (CR) should continue treatment through the end of 12 months,
      although additional treatment is possible. In the case of progressive disease (PD), subjects
      should continue treatment through their next tumor assessment. Additional indications will be
      planned based on emerging data in the field.
