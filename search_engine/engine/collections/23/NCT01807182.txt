    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the anti-tumor efficacy of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma
      patients using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with a lymphodepleting conditioning
      regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), and followed by adjuvant
      high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

      II. Examine the safety of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients using
      autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, preceded by a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen
      of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and followed by adjuvant high-dose IL-2.

      III. Evaluate for molecular tumor markers and immunohistochemical features that correlate
      with in vivo persistence and anti-tumor efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -7 to -6 and fludarabine
      phosphate IV on days -5 to -1. Patients undergo TIL infusion over 30-60 minutes on day 0 and
      receive aldesleukin IV every 8 hours on days 1-5 for up to a maximum of 14 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
