      in patients with preeclampsia or eclampsia.

      A total of 442 patients with preeclampsia/eclampsia were randomized to postpartum curettage
      (223) or no procedure (219). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded and analyzed
      at hours 6, 12, 24 and 48. Also, several laboratory values and diuresis were evaluated.
