      inhibition by anti-platelet agents. Consequently, the focus of this longitudinal pilot study
      will be to determine the impact of a single ticagrelor loading dose (180 mg), our "model"
      anti-platelet drug, on platelet RNA splicing in 10 healthy individuals.

      It will test the hypothesis that ticagrelor exposure does not significantly alter platelet
      mRNA splicing. It will involve administering a single loading dose (180 mg) of ticagrelor to
      healthy volunteers.
