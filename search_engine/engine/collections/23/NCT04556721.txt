      to benefit immensely from this established superior drug. Prior studies have not been able to
      correlate negative adverse events with sugammadex in patients with end-stage renal disease.
      More work needs to be done, however, to assess the fate of this renally excreted molecule. It
      has been shown that there is potential to clear sugammadex with high flux dialysis. We
      hypothesize that post-surgical patients with end-stage renal disease will see a significant
      decrease in plasma sugammadex concentration after routine outpatient dialysis.
