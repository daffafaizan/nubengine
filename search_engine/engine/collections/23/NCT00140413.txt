      larger ONH study. The study duration is three years and we anticipate 38 subjects will
      enroll. Subjects will be recruited for this study if they present with either growth
      deceleration or at least one subnormal result for IGF-1 or IGFBP-3.

      Baseline information collected includes: height, weight, head circumference, examinations by
      an endocrinologist and ophthalmologist, endocrine laboratory testing, fundus photography,
      electrophysiology testing, head MRI, and a developmental assessment. A glucagon stimulation
      test will be performed and subjects who are deemed GH-deficient and who have delayed growth
      will be assigned to GH treatment, in line with standard clinical practice. Those with normal
      growth but determined to be GH-deficient by a glucagon stimulation test will be randomized to
      treatment with GH vs control (no intervention; observation only).

      Subjects assigned or randomized to treatment with GH will be provided with GH for the
      duration of their participation in the study. Enrolled subjects will return every four months
      to monitor progress. Subjects will undergo a physical examination at each visit, including
      height, weight, head circumference, and body fat. In addition, subjects assigned or
      randomized to growth hormone will have laboratory testing of thyroid, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3
      hormones, and fasting lipid levels.
