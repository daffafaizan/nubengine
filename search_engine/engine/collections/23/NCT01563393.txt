      ranging from 7.3 to 17.9% in the developed world with higher prevalence rates in infants and
      toddlers and particularly high rates for specific medical conditions. Several studies have
      reported deterioration of nutritional status during hospitalization. Screening children for
      malnutrition risk is recommended by a number of international organizations such as the
      American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), the European Society for
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) and the European Society for Paediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).

      Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP) was chosen for this
      study because it is highly applicable, frequently used by nurses and has shown high
      reproducibility, as well as concurrent and predictive validity. The tool was developed by
      McCarthy et al11 in England. It collects the following information to assess nutritional risk
      for a patient: discrepancy between the weight and height percentile weight for the age
      expected nutritional risk caused by clinical diagnosis, recent changes in the appetite. The
      assessment results are used to define if there is a need for a referral to a full nutritional
      assessment.

      We aimed to evaluate the use of the Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in
      Pediatrics among children admitted in a pediatric hospital, and assess its effect on medical
      staff's awareness to nutritional status and health outcomes at discharge.
