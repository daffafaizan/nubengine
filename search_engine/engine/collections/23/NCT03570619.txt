      metastatic cancer with CDK12 mutations. The study includes two cohorts of patient groups:
      castration resistant metastatic prostate carcinoma and other solid tumor histologies. Both
      cohorts receive the same treatment with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab followed
      by nivolumab.
