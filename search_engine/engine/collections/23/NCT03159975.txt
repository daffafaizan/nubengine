      8,700,000 cases of tuberculosis occured in 2011, and 1,400,000 of them resulted dead.
      Tuberculosis patients with the cavity and positive on AFB show high rate of relapse and
      treatment failure. Those with high risk of relapse and treatment failure may need more
      effective treatment before acquiring resistance and infecting others. GX-70, which consists
      of the four-antigen plasmids from MTB together with recombinant Flt3 ligand is an
      investigational DNA vaccine designed to prevent relapse or treatment failure.

      The purpose of this study is to assess safety of GX-70, in pulmonary TB patients with high
      risk factors for treatment failure or relapse.
