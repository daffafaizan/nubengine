    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the 5-year event-free survival of children or adolescents with stage IA or IIA
           nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma treated with surgery alone or with
           cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, and prednisolone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if this regimen results in a decrease in overall survival rates, in
           significant upstaging at relapse, or increased rates of histological transformation in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Group 1 (patients with stage IA disease only): Patients undergo surgical resection of
           the involved lymph nodes. Patients who achieve complete resection then enter follow-up
           (watch and wait); patients who do not achieve complete resection enters group 2
           treatment.

        -  Group 2 (patients with stage IIA disease or incompletely resected stage IA disease):
           Patients receive cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, and prednisolone for 3 courses. Patients
           with good response enter follow-up (watch and wait). Patients without a good response
           are taken off protocol.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed-up periodically.
