      acceptance, of a smartphone-based self-management supportive intervention, Supporting
      Self-Management of Healthy Behaviors (SMART-HABITS) in patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and hypertension. SMART-HABITS is a web-based application accessible on any device that
      has Internet access and utilizes the mobile health research platform to provide the
      components of the intervention: a) text message reminders (Arm 1), b) text message tailored
      feedback (Arm 1 and 2), c) positive affirmation text messages (Arms 1 and 2), d) access to
      educational resources, community resources, CKD patient forums (Arms 1 and 2), e) option to
      select a accountability partner to share reminders and feedback (Arms 1 and 2). SMART-HABITS
      encompasses multiple behavior change techniques and is centered on the Health Belief Model
      and the Social Cognitive Theory. SMART-HABITS will deliver reminder text messages to a
      participant's smartphone to perform blood pressure self-monitoring in one arm and encourage
      an increase in walking activity both arms. The Omron Connect app will deliver the reminder
      notifications to check blood pressure and will deliver the BP readings to research platform
      (in the non-texting arm). After blood pressure measurements and daily step counts are
      remotely transmitted from the smartphone to mobile health research platform server, tailored
      feedback will be provided via text message). Additionally, intermittent positive affirmation
      messages will also be sent to participants to encourage engagement in the behaviors. Within
      the SMART-HABITS web-based application, there will be a participant portal that will provide
      access to links to community resources, educational links about CKD, and a display of
      adherence to behaviors and data transmission. At the beginning and end of the study,
      questionnaires will be completed to assess patient-reported outcomes, which will serve as
      secondary endpoints.
