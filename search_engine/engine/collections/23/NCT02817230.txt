      of atherosclerosis. Recently, it was reported that monocytes can develop a long-lasting
      immunological memory after stimulation with various microorganisms, which has been termed
      'trained innate immunity'. This memory is induced by epigenetic reprogramming. Here the
      investigators hypothesize that monocytes of patients with elevated LDL cholesterol levels
      show epigenetic changes compared to normocholesterolemic subjects and that this can be
      reversed by treatment with statins.

      Objective: The main objective is to study whether patients with elevated levels of LDL show
      increased Histone 3 Lysine 4 trimethylation in the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines and have an augmented ex vivo Toll-Like Receptor agonist-induced cytokine
      production in isolated monocytes compared to controls. Subsequently the investigators will
      study the effect of treatment with statins on these responses.

      Study design: Observational study Study population: Subjects aged >18 years who have been
      referred to the out-patient clinic and have LDL levels that require lipid lowering treatment
      and matched normocholesterolemic control subjects.
