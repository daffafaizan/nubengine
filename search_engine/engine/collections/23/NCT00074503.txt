      concentrated in the brain. Epidemiologic studies suggest that DHA deficiency is related to
      affective disorders, while clinical studies suggest that DHA is efficacious in treating
      depression. DHA has also been shown to be an important second messenger involved in
      phospholipase A(2)-mediated signal transduction. Although animal studies have provided a
      wealth of knowledge about the role of DHA in neural function, no method exists of evaluating
      DHA content or metabolism in the living human brain. Our goal is to establish a quantitative
      method of examining brain DHA metabolism using PET in healthy humans and to measure regional
      DHA incorporation from plasma into the brain. Utilizing the data from the pilot phase with
      healthy volunteers, we will apply the method to study DHA metabolism in alcoholics. Since
      alcohol consumption depletes brain DHA, we hypothesize that compared to healthy volunteers;
      alcoholics will have a decreased rate of incorporation of DHA from plasma into brain.
      Utilizing the method we have established, we anticipate that we will find previously
      undetectable metabolic abnormalities in alcoholics. We may further find that such
      abnormalities are correlated with cognitive or behavioral function. Now that the pilot phase
      of the protocol has been completed, we are proceeding with the main phase of the protocol to
      study non-smoking chronic alcoholics.
