      μg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, and then insertion of a flexible laryngeal mask airway was
      conducted using the index finger insertion technique by anesthesia providers with a minimum
      of four years endotracheal intubation experience. Mechanical ventilation parameters were as
      follows: pressure-controlled ventilation mode, ventilation pressure: 12, respiratory rate:
      12, oxygen concentration: 50%. The maintenance of general anesthesia was performed with
      sevoflurane at minimum alveolar concentration of 1.3. After induction, a single loading dose
      DEX (0.5μg/kg) was IV infusion within 10 minutes, or IV administration of midazolam
      (0.05mg/kg). Heart rate, blood pressure, tidal volume, ventilation pressure and ETCO2 after
      insertion of a LMA, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes after drug infusion and transferred to
      PACU, besides heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before and after induction.
      Surgical field was evaluated at the time of 10 minutes and 20 minutes after drug infusion.
      Blood gas analysis was performed just transferred to PACU and before transferred to ward.
