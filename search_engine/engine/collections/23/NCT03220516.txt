      option for surgical management of kidney stones. However, the durability of flexible
      ureteroscope still remains a major concern. Due to the high cost and limited durability, the
      cost-benefit of non-disposable flexible ureteroscope continues to be the most important
      factor for initiating and maintaining fURS programs worldwide, especially in the developing
      countries. Nowadays, disposable digital flexible ureteroscopes are available, offering an
      improved image resolution, no need for sterilization and repair, and more economic.
