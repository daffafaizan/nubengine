      assessments are designed to compare the ability of current Parkinson disease clinical trial
      measures with the ability of mobile and wearable devices to detect disease progression in the
      early stage of disease. The at-home assessments are designed to determine the feasibility of
      motor and non-motor assessments of disease progression using a commercially available
      wearable device/mobile application platform and to determine how this data compares with
      traditional clinical measures.
