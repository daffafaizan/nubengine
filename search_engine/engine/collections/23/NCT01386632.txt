    
      Doses for Cisplatin will be based on actual body weight taken on each day of Cisplatin
      therapy. DCA doses will be calculated at baseline according to actual body weight and will
      not change during the 8 weeks of therapy.

      A careful description of the extent of the primary lesion and nodal spread will be recorded.

      Dental Evaluation: Prior to treatment, patients will be evaluated by the dental service and a
      prophylactic cleaning/fluoride regimen instituted. A delay of at least 14 days from major
      surgery, including dental extractions, will be required prior to Day 1 treatment.

      Airway Patency: Significant laryngeal edema has been described after the use of cisplatin
      containing regimens. Patients with laryngeal tumors should be considered for a prophylactic
      tracheostomy prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, if any possibility of airway compromise
      exists. Patients with laryngeal tumors experiencing respiratory stridor or compromise shortly
      after chemotherapy/radiotherapy administration should be rapidly evaluated for tracheostomy.

      Alimentation: Significant stomatitis, mucositis and dysphagia are expected with these
      treatment regimens. Hospitalization may be required for symptomatic management. Pronounced
      weight loss is common, and adequate alimentation needs to be maintained. Early, if not
      pre-emptive, enteral tube feedings should be considered if difficulty is anticipated.

      Compliance: The complexity of these treatment regimes and their attendant toxicity are such
      that compliance is of major concern. Patients expected to pose compliance problems should not
      be entered on this study. Patients will need to be seen at least weekly during therapy so
      that the toxicities can be monitored and treated.
