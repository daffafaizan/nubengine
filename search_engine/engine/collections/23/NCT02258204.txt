    
      Rationale - Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a double-sided molecule, with
      beneficial effect in acute ischemic stroke due to its intravascular fibrinolytic activity but
      with potential deleterious effect due to its ability to potentiate neuronal
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signalling (Nicole et al., 2001). Co-administration of
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine - a non-competitive inhibitor of NMDA receptor - was shown to
      improve efficacy of tPA-mediated thrombolysis following stroke in rodents (Gakuba et al,
      2011).

      Aims - To assess efficacy and safety of co-administration of ketamine with tPA compared with
      tPA-placebo infusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      Sample size estimates -With 25 patients per group, the trial has a 80% probability of
      detecting a 80% decrease of infarct volume growth in the tPA-ketamine group compared with the
      tPA-placebo group on day 1 after admission at a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.

      Study outcomes - The primary efficacy outcome is cerebral infarction growth on diffusion
      weighted imaging between admission and day 1. The primary safety measure is mortality and/or
      symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate at 3 months.
