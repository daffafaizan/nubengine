      antiangiogenic effects known in treating many ocular surface diseases. This notion is further
      strengthened by many studies showing that amniotic membrane can effectively control
      inflammation in HSV stromal keratitis in a murine model of HSV necrotizing keratitis and
      surgical application in ~7 human studies of epithelial and stromal HSV keratitis with or
      without an adjuvant antiviral therapy. More importantly, PROKERA SLIM in conjunction with
      oral acyclovir has been shown to facilitate the ease of early intervention to accelerate
      restoration in herpetic keratitis in 2 case series of 5 eyes. However, a formal prospective
      study has not been performed.
