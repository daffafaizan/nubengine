      improve glycemic control, anthropometric measures and overall diet quality.

      Restriction of dietary cholesterol, and thus the avoidance or restriction of egg intake, is
      routinely recommended to patients at increased risk for CVD, including those with diabetes.
      However, the relative importance of dietary cholesterol to serum lipids and the role of egg
      ingestion in cardiovascular risk are increasingly suspect. Further, the exclusion of eggs
      from the diet may lead to increased consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrate foods of
      particular potential harm to individuals with diabetes. The examination of how food-specific
      recommendations translate into effects on other food choices and overall diet quality, and in
      turn health effects, is a neglected area of research.

      Eggs provide a complete profile of amino acids and an array of micronutrients, and are low in
      total fat. Although epidemiological and clinical studies largely suggest a lack of
      association between egg intake and harmful effects, the evidence is somewhat more ambiguous
      with regard to glycemic control for diabetes, or the risk for CVD among individuals with
      diabetes. Our own prior work shows no adverse effects of egg ingestion in healthy adults,
      hyperlipidemic adults, or adults with established coronary artery disease. As a satiating and
      protein-rich food, eggs have potential to foster calorie and weight control, and to reduce
      the dietary glycemic load, offering potential advantages in Type 2 diabetes.
