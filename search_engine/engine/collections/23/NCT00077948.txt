      exert a favorable effect on the natural history of mild to moderate chronic heart failure
      (CHF), including reducing mortality and hospitalization rate. However, as heart failure
      becomes more severe, beta-blockers become difficult to administer because of myocardial
      depression leading to hemodynamic intolerance. A recent clinical study demonstrated that
      subjects who could not tolerate the beta-blocker metoprolol experienced improved tolerability
      when low-dose, oral enoximone was administered prior to the introduction of metoprolol and
      during ongoing treatment. This study will investigate the hypotheses that by stabilizing
      subjects on enoximone first, advanced CHF subjects who are intolerant of beta-blockade will
      be able to 1) tolerate the effects of beta-blocker therapy, and 2) have clinical benefit that
      is due to the combination of both enoximone and extended-release metoprolol succinate (ER
      metoprolol). Support for these hypotheses will be sought by demonstrating that, as compared
      to placebo, low-dose, oral enoximone plus ER metoprolol will increase left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF), improve symptoms of heart failure, and improve submaximal exercise
      tolerance in subjects with CHF.
