      by recurrent episodes of systemic as well as organ-specific inflammation that can involve the
      skin, eyes, joints, bones, muscles, lungs, serosal surfaces, inner ear, brain, and other
      organs. The prominent role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders first became
      evident through the discovery of mutations in the gene NLRP3 and IL1RN. Since then, we have
      identified additional mutations that cause autoinflammatory diseases, including mutations in
      proteasome components and STING1 that suggest a role of increased type I IFN signaling as a
      contributor to the disease pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases and in NLRC4 and CDC42
      that suggest a role of IL-18 in some autoinflammatory diseases. In this natural history
      study, we seek to comprehensively evaluate people with autoinflammatory diseases that include
      clinical, genetic, immunologic, andendocrinologic characterizations. Other rare diseases not
      mediated by IL-1, IL-18 or type I IFN and presumed to be autoinflammatory diseases with
      unknown genetic causes may also be eligible under this protocol. In addition, we intend to
      evaluate long-term outcomes and biomarkers over time in selected diseases. We plan to follow
      most participants for the duration of this study (15 years). Relatives who do not have
      autoinflammatory diseases as well as healthy volunteers will also be recruited to serve as
      controls for biomarker, genetic, and other molecular analyses.
