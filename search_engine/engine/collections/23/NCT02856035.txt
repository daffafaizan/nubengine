      after stroke, using a combination of rtfMRI, rtfNIRS, FES, and motor learning.

      Aim I. Test the innovative coordination training protocol of combination rtfMRI/rtfNIRS
      central neural feedback and peripherally-directed, neurally-triggered FES-assisted
      coordination practice implemented within a framework of motor learning principles.

      Hypothesis 1. Chronic stroke survivors will show significant improvement in upper limb
      function in response to the combined rtfMRI/rtfNIRS central neural feedback;
      peripherally-directed FES-assisted coordination practice of wrist and finger extension; and
      whole arm/hand motor learning (Primary measure: Pre-/post-treatment change score in Arm Motor
      Abilities Test - function domain (AMAT - F); secondary measure: Pre/post-treatment change
      score in Fugl-Meyer upper limb coordination.
