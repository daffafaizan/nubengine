      knowledge, skills and awareness among high school children. It is important to note that, CPR
      training of young children, increases the self confidence, esteem, responsibility and
      contribution to their community.Moreover, it is clearly shown that, high school children has
      the required physical strength, maturity and positive attitude towards performing CPR in
      family members, friends and strangers in the community. Although some studies suggest benefit
      of periodic retraining, few studies have attempted to collectively identify contributing
      factors to comprehension.It is an attempt to identify national distribution of training
      efforts and factors implicated in comprehension among high school students.
