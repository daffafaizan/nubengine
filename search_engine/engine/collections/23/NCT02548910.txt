      elective liver surgery is a key determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well
      as possibly long-term oncologic outcome. Whole blood phlebotomy is a simple intervention,
      whose aim is to decrease the central venous pressure yielding a state of relative hypovolemia
      and thus lead to decreased blood loss. Small studies, mostly from the liver transplant
      literature, would suggest that phlebotomy with controlled hypovolemia can result in decreased
      blood loss and blood transfusion. Since blood loss is an important issue in liver surgery,
      and the benefits of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia are unknown in liver resection
      patients, a rigorously conducted trial in a representative population of patients undergoing
      liver resection is warranted, and feasible. In this proposal, it is hypothesized that by the
      use of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia, it is possible to decrease blood loss and blood
      transfusions. To test this hypothesis the investigators plan to randomly allocate
      participants to phlebotomy plus standard of care or to standard of care. Participants will be
      those patients undergoing elective major liver resection at the Ottawa Hospital for any
      indication. The primary outcome will be intraoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes will
      include transfusion requirements, perioperative morbidity and mortality, safety, physiologic
      parameters, and feasibility elements. A total of 62 patients will be randomized. The efficacy
      of phlebotomy in terms of blood loss prevention will be assessed.
