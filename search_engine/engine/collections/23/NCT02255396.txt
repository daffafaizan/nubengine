      plasma of men with non-obstructive azoospermia. Indeed, for these patients, none biological
      test allows to predict a positive sperm extraction before the surgical testis biopsy is
      performed. Since the involvement of estradiol and testosterone in the regulation of
      spermatogenesis, the measurement of these hormones in seminal plasma may be a predictive tool
      for these men before testis biopsy.
