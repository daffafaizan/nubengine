      MHs underwent vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, MSC or MSC-Exo intravitreal
      injection, and heavy silicon oil, air, 20% SF6, or 14% C3F8 tamponade. MSCs were isolated
      from human umbilical cord, and MSC-Exos were isolated from supernatants of MSCs via
      sequential ultracentrifugation. At the time of study enrollment, as well as physical
      examinations, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and intraocular pressure will be measured
      and fundoscopy be performed. All diagnoses of MH are going to confirmed via spectral-domain
      optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the minimum linear diameter (MLD) of each MH will be
      measured parallel to the retinal pigment epithelium.The participants are going to be followed
      up for at least 6 months via BCVA measurement, fundoscopy, OCT, and physical examinations.
