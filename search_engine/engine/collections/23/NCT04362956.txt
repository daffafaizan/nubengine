      global pandemic affecting persons of all ages. Pregnant women are in a physiologic
      immunosuppressed situation and have a greater risk and severity of respiratory infection.
      However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the potential for vertical transmission
      (prenatal/congenital or perinatal) of SARS-CoV-2 from infected pregnant women to their
      newborns and its potential clinical consequences.

      This study attempts to provide evidence-based guidelines for managing antenatal, intrapartum,
      and neonatal care around COVID-19 require an understanding of whether the virus can be
      transmitted transplacentally; a determination of which maternal body fluids may be
      infectious; trasnplacental and human milk antibody transfer and data of adequate statistical
      power that describe which maternal, intrapartum, and neonatal factors influence perinatal
      transmission.
