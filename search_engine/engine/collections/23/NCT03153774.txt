      and more than 30% above the age of 80. The concept of sarcopenia has been supported by the
      recent findings of muscular atrophy which was related to the decrease of protein synthesis
      because of the "anabolic resistance", affecting the muscular fibers type II. In fact,
      sarcopenia could be a consequence of chronic disease and not only an issue in the elderly
      people. The diagnosis is assessed by the weak muscle mass and the muscle strength and
      function. A description of these muscle parameters has been described in a study of 200
      patients with NYHA class II-III and showed that 19,5 % have a decrease in muscle mass. They
      also showed that these patients have a lower functional ability. These findings prompted us
      to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in chronic heart failure subjects for a better
      management of these patients.
