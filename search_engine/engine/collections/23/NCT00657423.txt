    
      To study the impact of endostar combined with docetaxel and cisplatin on the angiogenesis of
      non-small cell lung cancer,patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental
      group(endostar combined with docetaxel and cisplatin) and the control group (docetaxel and
      cisplatin).

        -  the serum concentrations of Endostatin,VEGF and bFGF are determined.

        -  Blood circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating hematopoietic progenitor
           cells (CPCs) will be measured by flow cytometer.

        -  the clinical parameters such as objective response rate (ORT),time to progression(TTP)
           and mean survival time(MST) will be collected according to the WHO criteria.

        -  the toxicity will be recorded according to the NCI-CTC v3.0.

        -  the Quality of life was self-assessed using the European Organisation for Research and
           Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C-30 questionnaire.

        -  Statistical analysis will be applied to study the relationship between the levels of
           Endostatin,VEGF,bFGF,CECs and CPCs and the clinical outcomes such as ORT, TTP, MST,
           toxicity and QOL.
