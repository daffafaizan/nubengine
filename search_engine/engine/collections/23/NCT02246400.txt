      mind-body-spirit-based, and multidisciplinary approach, and it will be delivered using
      existing web and mobile technologies. In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial,
      participants will be recruited from primary care patients of an integrated ambulatory care
      system. They will be randomly assigned to receive the eCMP upon completion of baseline data
      collection (the Immediate Intervention group) or after 3 months (the Delayed Intervention
      group). All participants will be assessed at 0, 3 and 6 months. Outcomes include common
      cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., weight, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose),
      health behaviors (e.g., dietary intake and physical activity), and indicators of eCMP
      engagement and adherence (e.g., attendance and self-monitoring).
