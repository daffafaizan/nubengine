      Anti TNF drugs are frequently used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and teaching
      activities in improving patient compliance and patient compliance are very important in the
      success of this treatment. This study was carried out to develop mobile application on the
      android platform for the subcutaneous anti-TNF drug adherence of ankylosing spondylitis
      patients and to evaluate the effect of this application on drug compliance.

      The universe of this experimental designed posttest control group research is consisted of
      patients prescribed subcutaneous anti-TNF drug due to ankylosing spondylitis in Eski≈üehir
