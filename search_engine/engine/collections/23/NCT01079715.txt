      countries around the world, and an increasing cause of blindness in developing countries. The
      ablation of the retina with photocoagulation by laser or cryotherapy reduces the incidence of
      blindness by suppressing the neovascular phase of ROP. However, the visual outcomes after
      treatment are often poor. The development of ROP depends largely from vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF). The reduction of VEGF expression in the neovascular phase might prevent
      destructive neovascularization in ROP.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the administration of propranolol is safe
      and is able to reduce the incidence of blindness by suppressing the neovascular phase of ROP
      compared to a control group receiving conventional laser therapy.
