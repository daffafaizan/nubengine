      I. Determine whether the fluorine F 18 DASA-23 ([18F]DASA 23) PET scan signal change from
      pre-therapy to one week after initiation of therapy can predict the tumor's responsiveness to
      therapy and 6 month progression free survival (PFS6), in suspected recurrent glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of [18F]DASA-23 PET imaging in
      identifying intracranial tumors in patients with intracranial tumors.

      II. Determine whether the [18F]DASA-23 PET scan signal change from pre therapy to one week
      after initiation of therapy can predict progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS), in suspected recurrent glioblastoma.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Healthy volunteers receive [18F]DASA-23 intravenously (IV) and undergo brain PET
      scan over 15 minutes and 4 vertex-to-toe PET scans over 30 minutes each.

      GROUP II: Intracranial tumor participants receive [18F]DASA-23 IV and undergo brain PET scan
      over 60 minutes and 1 vertex-to-toe PET scan over 30 minutes.

      GROUP III: Subjects with glioblastoma will receive [18F]DASA-23 IV and undergo brain PET scan
      over 60 minutes and 1 vertex-to-toe PET scan over 30 minutes. Participants undergo second PET
      scan 7 days after the initiation of therapy.

      GROUP IV: Healthy volunteers will undergo the same procedures as the healthy volunteers in
      Group I with the following exceptions:

      Group IV healthy volunteers will undergo a 60-minute PET/MRI brain scan instead of a
      15-minute PET/MRI brain scan.

      Group IV healthy volunteers will not undergo any vertex-to-toe PET scans.

      After completion of study treatment, intracranial tumor and recurrent glioblastoma
      participants are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.
