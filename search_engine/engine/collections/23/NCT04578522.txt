      < 65 years old, confirmed by clinical examination. A number of studies have found that
      smokers have a significantly increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, and suggest that
      continued smoking is still an independent predictor of mace. These findings suggest that
      smoking is significantly associated with early-onset coronary heart disease. A number of
      studies have found that smoking can increase peripheral arterial stiffness. At present, there
      is no study on peripheral arterial stiffness in patients with early-onset myocardial
      infarction, so we suspect that peripheral arterial stiffness in patients with early-onset
      myocardial infarction is significantly increased
