      Tacrolimus by assessing serial HCV RNA levels in serum. We plan to address the hypothesis
      that CSA is more efficient in limiting viremia than Tacrolimus and that viremia is predictive
      of long-term clinical outcome of hepatic fibrosis that is known to impact on both graft and
      patient survival
