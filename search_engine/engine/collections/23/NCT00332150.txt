    
      Mothers to either healthy full-term babies post delivery or preterms will be asked to
      anonymously answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes demographic data, questions
      regarding their approach to medical issues, factors that influence her to enroll her baby in
      a research trial (different research types, different benefits from the research and fears).
      Finally, the mother will be asked if she will be willing to enroll her baby to on-going
      studies in the department.
