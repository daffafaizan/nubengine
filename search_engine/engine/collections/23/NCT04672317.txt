      muscle invasive UTUC patients in several studies. This study is designed to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma
      (UTUC).
