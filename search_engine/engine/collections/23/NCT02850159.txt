      with simultaneous high-frequency rTMS and tDCS, whereas patients in the rTMS group underwent
      high-frequency rTMS with sham tDCS. Assessments of FOG, motor, ambulatory and cognitive
      function were performed three times: at baseline before NIBS, immediately after NIBS, and one
      week after cessation of NIBS.
