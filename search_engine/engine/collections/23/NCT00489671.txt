      Primary

        -  Obtain urine samples and questionnaire data on cadmium exposure in patients with chronic
           pancreatitis.

        -  Analyze these data to determine risk of pancreatic cancer using urine cadmium levels.

      Secondary

        -  Analyze these data in conjunction with data on serum CA 19-9, to determine whether
           urinary cadmium has clinical utility in predicting pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for
           the cadmium test alone, CA 19-9 alone, and both tests together.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients complete a questionnaire over approximately 20 minutes on lifetime exposure to
      cadmium, including dietary, occupational, and recreational exposure, smoking history, and
      residence. Patients also provide a urine sample that is analyzed by atomic absorption
      spectrophotometry. Serum CA 19-9 levels are obtained from medical record if available.
