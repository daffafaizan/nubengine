      (twice weekly, once weekly, once/10days or less frequent) hemodialysis (IIHD) initiation
      versus conventional thrice weekly HD for incident end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients
      with residual urine volume (RUV > 0.5 L/day, as a reference to residual kidney functions) who
      chose hemodialysis as their method of renal replacement therapy (RRT).

      Incremental HD has been an area of research interest in the past few years with many
      publications discussing its feasibility and safety for incident HD patients. Smooth
      transition to dialysis in incident ESRD patients through incremental twice (or even once)
      weekly dialysis initiation has shown benefits in preservation of residual kidney functions
      (RKF) in comparison to thrice weekly HD. It has also been proposed as a method of reducing
      healthcare cost while providing quality healthcare to the patients(1). However, most
      available data are retrospective analysis, few data are present to compare the results to
      thrice weekly HD in a randomized controlled or even in a prospective manner. Incremental HD
      has been also practiced in some parts of Egypt in the last 2-3 years. The investigators will
      compare outcomes of participants starting a less frequent dialysis program to conventional
      thrice weekly HD in a multi-center study.
