        -  Merck's tetravalent HPV vaccine, GardasilÂ®, has been licensed and is now becoming
           commercially available in an increasing number of countries. Therefore, the study
           procedures were revised to include questions at every visit to determine if subjects
           have received an HPV vaccine outside of the study.

        -  It was decided to offer GSK Biologicals' HPV vaccine to all subjects in the control
           group at the end of the study. The HPV vaccine will be offered to these subjects based
           on its local indication once the vaccine is marketed in Malaysia.
