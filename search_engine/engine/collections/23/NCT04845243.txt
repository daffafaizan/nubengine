      active attention to the eye region, re-directing attention to facial features to facilitate
      facial emotion recognition. Evidence shows positive results using computer-based emotion
      recognition training programs with young children and adolescents with ASD. It has also been
      recently suggested that emotion recognition training may be a suitable intervention for
      patients with CD. This would be supported by some preliminary evidence in patients with
      severe behavioural problems, young offenders and patients with CD + CU Traits. The overall
      goal of this project is to investigate the compared impact of an emotion recognition training
      in patients with ASD or CD. This goal can be subdivided into three separate subgoals: a)
      identify whether the training program is effective; b) identify whether the training program
      has differentiated or comparable effects between both patients groups and c) investigate
      individual characteristics that may help identify those individuals who would benefit most
      from the intervention. This information is crucial to inform the design of more efficient
      treatments to differentially address the specific deficits associated to the disorders.
