      this field. Decitabine is a kind of specific DNA methylation shift enzyme inhibitor. It can
      reverse the DNA methylation and induce the differentiation and apoptosis of the tumor cells.
      Recent studies about decitabine in the treatment for elderly AML patients had achieved
      inspiring results and indicated that low dose decitabine maybe a good choice for elderly AML
      patients. So in this research the investigators plan to evaluate the safety and the
      therapeutic effect of decitabine in the treatment of elderly AML patients.
