    
      This is a single arm, window of opportunity study in which participants with previously
      untreated triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) who are candidates for potentially curative
      surgery will receive one 21-day cycle of therapy prior to surgery, consisting of lenvatinib
      12 mg daily, days 1 through 14, and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1. Participants will
      undergo surgical resection of the primary breast tumor 7-10 days after the last dose of
      lenvatinib. Post-operative adjuvant therapies will be at the discretion of the treating
      oncologist. Post-Surgery Follow-Up information will be collected at assessments at 3 months
      post-op and after that every 6 months until 5 years after surgery
