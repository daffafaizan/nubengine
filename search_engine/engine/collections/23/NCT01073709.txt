      oral dose of acetaminophen 650 mg extended release tablet was administered with 240 mL of
      drinking water during each period of the study under supervision of trained study personnel.
      Both test (T) and reference (R) products were administered to the study subjects, one in each
      period (except subject no 40).

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,
      serology parameters, urine analysis and urine drug screening) were measured at base line.
      Laboratory parameters of haematology and biochemistry (except glucose and cholesterol) were
      repeated at the end of the study.
