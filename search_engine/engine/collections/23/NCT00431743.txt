      agreed that hypovolemia must be avoided, but at the same time it has been agreed that fluid
      excess is harmful for organ function.When distributing fluids it is usually either
      crystalloids og colloids which are given. The effects of the two types of fluid have not been
      compared. Our hypothesis is that using a colloid (HES 130/0,4) will improve orthostatic
      function, nausea/vomiting and shorten hospital stay, compared to using a crystalloid
      (Lactated Ringer's solution).The amount of fluid the patient receives, will be individually
      tailored by monitoring SV using esophageal Doppler technique during surgery.
