      two doses of either GamTBvac or placebo. Subjects will be followed for 5 months after dose 1.

      The primary goal of this study is to assess the immunogenicity of a tuberculosis subunit
      recombinant GamTBvac vaccine in a vaccination scheme with double administration to healthy
      volunteers.

      The secondary goal of this study is the in-depth assessment of the safety and reactogenicity
      of the tuberculosis subunit recombinant vaccine GamTBvac when given twice to healthy
      volunteers.
