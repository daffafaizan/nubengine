      study of patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism (APE). Carried out since January
      2008, the registry includes consecutive patients hospitalized at a single centre. The primary
      data recorded include details of each patient's clinical status, co-morbidities, the
      prescribed treatment, the results of additional studies (ie EKG, imaging studies), and the
      outcome. The study endpoints comprise clinically recognized (and objectively confirmed)
      recurrences of PE, major and minor bleeding complications classified according to the
      International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis classification, need for cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation or catecholamines, and death.

      Collecting the fore mentioned data allows for clinicians to better manage the diagnostic
      workup and treatment and thus facilitates the prevention of possible future complications in
      APE patients.
