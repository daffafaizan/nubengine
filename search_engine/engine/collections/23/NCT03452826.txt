    
      Randomization is performed immediately after the inclusion.

        -  In the intervention arm, a broad panel respiratory mPCR is performed on a lower
           respiratory tract sample (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirate, otherwise
           sputum), collected before the 12th hour following inclusion.

        -  In both arms, an additional lower respiratory tract sample (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
           or tracheal aspirate, otherwise sputum) is collected for biological studies and banking.

        -  In the intervention arm, an algorithm of early antibiotic de-escalation and
           discontinuation is based on the early microbiological results, including the mPCR
           results, and the procalcitonin value. This algorithm is applied as soon as possible
           (before the 24th hour following inclusion if possible).

        -  In the control arm, initial antibiotic therapy is maintained, according to guidelines.

        -  In both arms, after 72 hours of antibiotic therapy, ICU physicians are advised to use
           procalcitonin (values and kinetics) to guide antibiotic therapy discontinuation, with a
           recommended total duration of 7 days, unless otherwise indicated.

        -  In both arms, a switch to oral therapy is encouraged
