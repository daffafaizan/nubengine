      modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT), but local control is not good enough and late toxicities is
      usually severe The aim of this phase III randomized controlled study is to address the
      efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin) with IMRT to improve local control and lower
      the occurrence of severe late toxicities compared with IMRT alone for locally T3/T4 recurrent
      NPC patients.
