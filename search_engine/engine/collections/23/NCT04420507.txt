      microbiome of GDM patients during pregnancy, and to explorer whether GDM happened during
      pregnancy are associated with the maternal gut and oral microbiomes. As a perspective cohort
      study, the researchers will recruit pregnant women in early pregnancy（before 13 gestational
      weeks）and following the pregnancies till delivery. The stool samples and saliva samples of
      the recruits will be collected in 9~14,24~28 and 32~37 gestational weeks separately. The
      investigators will also perform oral examination between 24~28 weeks and sample subgingival
      plaque for test. Overall, all samples will be examined use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to
      analyze microbiome. And part of the samples of GDM patients will be analyzed using
      metagenomics. Combine with the pregnancy outcomes, the differences of gut and oral microbiome
      between GDM patients and healthy women will be expected, as well as the natural change during
      pregnancy.
