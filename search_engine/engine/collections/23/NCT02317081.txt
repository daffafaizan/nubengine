    
      Prospective, multicenter, open-label and single arm study, conducted in 3 interventional
      cardiology centers in The Netherlands. The objective is to assess the feasibility and safety
      of the Axetis Inert Stent for treatment of patients with de novo coronary artery stenosis in
      native vessels. In total, 35 patients will be enrolled. All patients will be treated with
      Axetis Inert Coronary Stent System. All patients will undergo repeat angiography at 6 months
      follow-up. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) assessment will be performed at baseline
      (pre- and post-procedure) and at 6 months follow-up. All patients will undergo Optical
      coherence Tomography (OCT) investigation at baseline (post procedure) and at 6 months
      follow-up. The primary endpoint is in-stent Late Lumen Loss (LLL) at 6 months after stent
      implantation as assessed by off-line QCA. Clinical follow-up will occur at 6 and 12 months
      post-stent implantation.
