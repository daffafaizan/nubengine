      the effectiveness of two different patient-facing advance care planning (ACP) interventions.
      Investigators will enroll 400 patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers to
      receive either (1) in-person discussions with trained facilitators or (2) web-based ACP using
      interactive videos. Because these approaches have never been compared directly, it is unclear
      whether one form of advance care planning is more potent, and if so, for whom and under what
      circumstances.

      Aim 1 compares the effectiveness of in-person, facilitated ACP versus web-based ACP on
      patient and family caregiver outcomes (ACP engagement, ACP discussions, advance directive
      completion, goal attainment, and caregiver psychological symptoms). Aim 2 assesses
      implementation costs of each intervention and effects on healthcare utilization at end of
      life. Aim 3 identifies contexts and mechanisms influencing the effectiveness of each
      approach. Primary patient outcomes will be assessed at 12 weeks. Participants will be
      followed until 12 weeks after the patient's death or completion of the 48-month data
      collection period, whichever occurs first. In-depth interviews with patients, caregivers, and
      clinicians will begin in Year 2 of the grant and continue until thematic saturation is
      reached.
