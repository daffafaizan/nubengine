    
      1. Step 1 Primary objective Investigate the optimum volume of GC1109 to compare the subject
           ratio after seroconversion in each Anti-PA Ab by TNA at 4 weeks following infuse the
           drug 3 times with the immunogenicity of each treatment (GC1109 and placebo cohort) in
           healthy adults.

           In healthy adults, three times the clinical dose of about four weeks, compare
           immunogenicity of each treatment group (GC1109 group and the placebo group) with
           subsects ratio who have been Seroconversion for Anti-PA Ab by TNA

           Secondary objective

             -  Percentage of subjects after seroconversion in each anti-PA IgG level (by ELISA) at
                4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times in healthy adults

             -  Check the Seroprotection antibody titer (survival rate : 50%) with passive immune
                (nonclinical tests) at 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times in healthy adults

             -  Establish the Seroconversion rate from the percentage of subjects after
                seroconversion at 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times and seroprotection
                antibody titer in healthy adults

             -  Compare the immunogenicity of each treatment with the GMT's assessment of Anti-PA
                Ab by TNA for 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times

             -  Compare the immunogenicity of each treatment with the GMT's assessment of Anti-PA
                IgG by ELISA for 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times

             -  Determine the safety of the each treatment cohort

        2. Step 2 Primary objective Evaluate the immunogenicity of GC1109 at 4 weeks following
           infuse the optimal dose drug 3 times, whether the data induced from Step 1 satisfy the
           Seroconversion rate or not.

      Secondary objective

        -  Establish the safety and most desirable level of the GC1109's dosage in healthy adults

        -  Establish the GMT of Anti-PA Ab by TNA after infusing the drug 3 times until 4 weeks in
           healthy adults

        -  Establish the GMT of Anti-PA IgG by ELISA after infusing the drug 3 times until 4 weeks
           in healthy adults
