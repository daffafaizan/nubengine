      public health challenges. Drug abuse can lead to many health related problems such as
      malnutrition and mental disorders along with reduced quality of life. Dietary intervention
      plays a pivotal role in disease prevention and drug rehabilitation for drug addicts, but the
      associations between dietary intake and health related outcomes among drug addicts remain
      unclear.

      In addition, the relationship between the human gut microbiota and its response to addictive
      drugs as a newly arisen subject is given wide attention in recent years. However, the
      underlying mechanism requires further investigation. The dynamic changes of gut microbiota
      among drug addicts during compulsory drug rehabilitation period are in vague.

      Under the same diet exposure, different drug addicts may have different blood glucose
      responses as well as gut microbiota profiles. Therefore, in order to examine the association
      between diet, gut microbiota and drug addiction, our study design will include three
      components: (1) the measurement of dietary intake using FFQ while the menu offered by drug
      rehabilitation center and food diary; (2) the measurements of blood glucose over 2 weeks
      using continuous glucose monitors; and (3) the measurements of gut microbiota at three time
      points using 16s rRNA sequencing techniques.
