      by physical activity/ exercise, and the advices given by the family members and the health
      care professionals to avoid intense activity . In two studies performed about this subject,
      this is the probable reason why adult patients with epilepsy have a weaker physical fitness
      than healthy individuals in the control group. However; in a study of Drawskowski et al., the
      avoidance of activity and exercise in individuals with epilepsy was investigated, and it was
      reported that the injuries and seizure problems were rare even during very intense physical
      activity.
