      (NASA) and AmeriSciences have entered into a Space Act Agreement (1), the primary objectives
      of which are the development of nutritional products in the form of dietary supplements to
      maintain homeostasis, and as countermeasures to reduce the biological effects and damages of
      long-duration spaceflight mediated through oxidative stress both in low Earth Orbit and
      planetary exploration of the solar system, as well as to provide optimal nutritional
      supplementation to aid in pre-spaceflight conditioning.

      NASA has determined through pre-, in-, and post-flight assessment of cells, animals and
      humans that spaceflight induces oxidative stress on crewmembers. There are multiple potential
      sources of oxidative injury to include, but not limited to space radiation, noise, fuel
      reaction products, planetary regolith, and exercise. Furthermore, NASA has also determined
      that several foreseen and unforeseen physiological events can be controlled, avoided, or
      encouraged by means of dietary modification through supplements. Due to unforeseen limitation
      in the available fresh food supply for envisioned exploratory missions, it is desirable for
      NASA to have nutritional supplementation available to provide crewmembers with augmentation
      for the intrinsic defense systems against oxidative damage, as well as for potential
      nutritional contingencies such as food shortages and optimization of the diet. NASA has
      identified the need for specific micronutrient formulations to complement natural food
      sources, for astronaut protection during long-duration space flight.

      AmeriSciences is a nutritional company that specializes in science-based product formulation,
      manufacturing under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) using standards modeled after those
      used by the pharmaceutical industry. It has been charged with the co-development, aid,
      clinical evaluation, construction, and production of said micronutrient formulations, to the
      level of specifications required to meet NASA's expectations for safety and efficacy.
