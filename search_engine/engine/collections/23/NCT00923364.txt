    
      BACKGROUND:

      Mutations in GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) lead to an immunodeficiency disease that
      transforms into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This
      syndrome, previously known as MonoMAC, has 4 clinical features: 1) infections with
      Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) and other opportunistic infections as a teenager or young
      adult, 2) a peripheral blood leukocyte flow cytometry profile with T-lymphocytes, but a
      severe deficiency of monocytes, B-lymphocytes, and Natural Killer (NK) cells, 3) the
      propensity to progress to MDS/AML, and 4) mutations in the gene GATA2. In this pilot study we
      propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a reduced intensity allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) regimen for patients with mutations in GATA2. We are
      particularly interested in determining whether allogeneic HSCT using this regimen
      reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis in patients with mutations in GATA2.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine efficacy, namely whether reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT results in
           engraftment and restores normal hematopoiesis by day +100 in patients with mutations in
           GATA2.

        -  To determine the safety of this HSCT regimen in patients with mutations in GATA2,
           including transplant related toxicity, the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus
           host disease, immune reconstitution, overall survival, and disease-free survival

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Eligibility includes patients 12-60 years old with mutations in GATA2 who have a life
      expectancy of > 3 months but < 24 months, and who have a 10/10 matched related donor, a 10/10
      or 9/10 matched unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing
      identified through the National Marrow Donor Program), a 4/6 (or greater human leukocyte
      antigens (HLA -A), -B, DRB1) matched unrelated umbilical cord donor, or a haploidentical
      donor. Patients with GATA2 mutations who are 12-17 years of age are required to have MDS with
      chromosomal abnormalities to be eligible for this protocol.

      DESIGN:

        -  Patients with mutations in GATA2 with a 10/10 matched related or 10/10 matched unrelated
           donor, will receive a reduced-intensity pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting
           of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day on days -4, -3, and -2, 200 centigray (cGy) total body
           irradiation (TBI) on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. Patients with mutations in GATA2 and a
           9/10 matched unrelated donor will receive a reduced-intensity pre-transplant
           conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day on days -4, -3, and -2,
           300cGy total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. Patients with
           mutations in GATA2 with umbilical cord blood units will receive a reduced-intensity
           conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day -6, fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) on
           days -6 to -2, equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 30 mg/kg intravenous (IV) on days
           -6, -5 and -4, 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. Patients with a haploidentical
           donor will receive a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide 14.5
           mg/kg on days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) on 4days -6 to -2, and 200 cGy TBI on
           day -1. Donor bone marrow cells will be infused on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis will consist
           of sirolimus (Rapamycin) and tacrolimus until day +180, provided that there is no
           evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft
           versus-host-disease prophylaxis for recipients of haploidentical donors will consist of
           cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4, along with sirolimus from day +5 to day
           180, and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180, providing that there is no graft-versus-host
           disease (GVHD).
