      Swabstick--3 swabsticks at once versus 3 swabsticks used one-at-a-time. Hibiclens, a liquid
      antibacterial soap, applied according to the manufacturer's directions as a active/positive
      comparison. Sterile swabsticks (wetted with sterile water) applied as a negative comparison
      using the same method as the ChloraPrep swabstick.
