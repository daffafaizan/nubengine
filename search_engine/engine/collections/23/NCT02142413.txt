      ischemic stroke are still common, and at the same time, stroke aetiology remains cryptogenic
      in about 20-25% of stroke unit patients. Recent studies have shown that (a) cardiac MRI is
      now able to detect cardiac sources of embolism (thrombi and aortic plaques) with equal
      sensitivity as compared to echocardiography, and (b) prolonged ECG monitoring up to several
      days/weeks/years can significantly increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation. These
      developments might allow a faster and more effective diagnostic work-up in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke compared to standard diagnostic procedures including doppler-ultrasound
      of the extracranial brain-supplying arteries, echocardiography, 24-h-Holter ECG and stroke
      unit monitoring. This prospective observational trial therefore aims to assess the detection
      rate of pathologic findings relevant to stroke aetiology as obtained by an enhanced MRI
      set-up (including cardiac MRI, MR-angiography of the brain-supplying arteries) and a
      prolonged Holter-ECG (of up to 5 days after the stroke) in comparison to findings obtained by
      routine diagnostic procedures after acute stroke.

      Moreover, cumulating evidence implies that acute ischemic stroke can lead to cardiac damage.
      Since the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood, the HEBRAS
      study attempts to tackle the relationship between stroke localization (e.g. insular
      involvement), observed cardiac damage (as indicated by troponin elevation) and activation of
      autonomic nervous system (as indicated by impairment of heart rate variability and elevated
      urinary norepinephrine levels), respectively.

      Finally, to clarify the prognostic impact of stroke-induced autonomic dysfunction, heart rate
      variability will be analysed with respect to functional outcome, mortality, recurrent stroke
      and myocardial injury.
