      and increased severity of multiple co-morbid illnesses as well as a reduction in overall
      quality and quantity of life. Traditional behavioural interventions have demonstrated
      efficacy in producing initial weight loss; however, a continued challenge for these programs
      is long-term weight loss maintenance. The Small Changes program is an alternative approach to
      weight loss that encourages modest changes to nutrition and physical activity that are
      sustainable long-term. Although promising, this approach has failed to consistently
      demonstrate clinically significant weight loss. It has been suggested that psychological
      factors, such as low levels of subjective well-being (negative affect, positive affect, and
      life satisfaction), may work in opposition of an individual's weight management goals. Thus,
      the integration of psychological interventions with a Small Changes approach has the
      potential to improve well-being and weight loss concurrently. Based on previous research,
      psychological interventions may be effectively utilized if they are implemented at the
      beginning of an intervention where early changes in well-being promote greater adherence to
      health behaviour change. To date, no behavioural intervention that integrates psychological
      approaches at treatment outset has been evaluated. The primary aim of the study is to
      determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a novel group-based integrative
      behavioural and psychological intervention (INSPIRE) on change in weight and subjective
      well-being outcomes compared to an evidence-based behavioural intervention for weight loss
      (Small Changes).
