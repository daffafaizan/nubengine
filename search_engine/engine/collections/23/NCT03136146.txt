    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect the safety/toxicity information and assess the initial efficacy information
      (objective overall response rate: complete response [CR]+ CR with incomplete platelet
      recovery [CRp]/CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi]) after treatment with
      clofarabine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide (CEC), vincristine sulfate liposome (liposomal
      vincristine) (VCR), dexamethasone and bortezomib in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) including relapsed/refractory Philadelphia (Ph)
      positive B-ALL/LL or Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma or double-hit leukemia/lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the CR duration, event free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) after
      treatment with CEC, liposomal VCR, dexamethasone and bortezomib in relapsed/refractory ALL or
      LL including relapsed/refractory Ph positive B-ALL/LL or Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma or
      double-hit leukemia/lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1-5,
      etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5,
      vincristine sulfate liposome IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 11, dexamethasone orally (PO) daily
      or IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5, bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11,
      ofatumumab or rituximab IV over 4-24 hours on days 2 and 11, and pegfilgrastim SC on day 6 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive 1
      additional course of induction therapy depending on the disease response.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-4, etoposide
      IV over 2 hours on days 1-4, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4, vincristine sulfate
      liposome IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 11, dexamethasone PO or IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5,
      bortezomib SC on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, pegfilgrastim SC on day 6. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may receive ofatumumab or rituximab IV over 4-24 hours on days 2 and 11 for 4
      courses.
