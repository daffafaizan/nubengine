      despite considerable promise. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a poor surrogate of human
      T1DM. Over 463 different treatments have been shown to prevent or reverse autoimmune diabetes
      in these mice. Efforts focused on clinical translation of the most promising strategies have
      led to negative findings despite enormous investment and large-scale clinical trials.
      Encouraging preliminary clinical pilot data suggested that a non-Fc binding CD3 antibody,
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + daclizumab, rituximab B-lymphocyte depletion, a soluble
      NBI-6024 altered insulin peptide ligand, vitamin D3, nicotinamide, parenteral insulin, oral
      insulin, nasal insulin, and elimination of cow's milk from infant feeding could each
      potentially mitigate diabetes onset, or at least prolong endogenous C-peptide and sustain
      honeymoon. To date, none of these approaches have demonstrated robust benefit when subjected
      to adequately powered randomized clinical trials. Basing further clinical trials solely on
      responses in NOD mice would seem ill-advised.

      One of the most promising approaches to date has been use of intravenous non-myeloablative
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after mobilization with granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), thymoglobulin and cyclophosphamide, as first described by
      Voltarelli et al in 2007 in Brazil. Voltarelli et al demonstrated that a potentially toxic,
      cyclophosphamide-based depletional therapy and autologous bone marrow transplant rescue
      restores self-tolerance, prolongs honeymoon, and remarkably, secures insulin independence.
      This 'immunological reset' approach was designed to eliminate autoreactive lymphocyte clones,
      with subsequent immune reconstitution. Remarkably, 20/23 children and adolescents with
      new-onset T1DM were rendered insulin independent for periods of 6-35 months. In longer
      follow-up, 12/23 maintained this state for a mean of 31 months. There were no deaths, but
      nosocomial pneumonia occurred in 2, and oligospermia in 9. The underpinning mechanism appears
      to be restoration of apoptosis-related gene deregulation that contributed to breakdown of
      immune tolerance in T1DM.

      Our proposed new-onset intervention trial is based on Voltarelli's concept, but we have
      eliminated cyclophosphamide, replaced GCSF with plerixafor, substituted thymoglobulin for a
      single dose of alemtuzumab, and added anti-inflammatory treatments derived from the Clinical
      Islet Program in Edmonton with excellent safety profiles to date. Cellular and immunologic
      data from our Clinical Islet Transplant program indicates that T-depletion with alemtuzumab,
      and anti-inflammatory treatment with etanercept and anakinra, markedly suppress autoimmunity:
      a much safer and better tolerated combination than cyclophosphamide. The addition of a
      long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue (liraglutide) is based on its known
      positive trophic and metabolic protective effects.

      Study Procedures

        1. Patient selection: New onset of T1DM, diagnosed < 180 days, positive anti-GAD
           antibodies. Informed consent will be obtained from adult patients aged 18 and older.

        2. Participants will go through screening evaluation, which will include: C-peptide levels
           during mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT), HbA1c, exogenous insulin, infectious and
           malignancy screening, pregnancy test for women, assessment of cardiac, renal, hepatic,
           pulmonary, and hematologic function, assessment of T cells autoreactivity, measurement
           of autoantibodies for GAD, ICA512, IA2A, ZnT8 and mIAA, monitoring of HLA-A2 restricted
           insulin B(10-18), prepro-insulin (PPI)(15-24), islet antigen (IA)-2(797-805),
           GAD65(114-123), islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein
           (IGRP)(265-273), and prepro islet amyloid polypeptide (ppIAPP)(5-13)-specific CD8(+)
           T-cells

        3. Participants will be randomly assigned to treated arm or control arm in a 2:1
           allocation, resulting N=40 for treated arm and N=20 for control arm.

        4. For participants assigned to the treated arm, Intervention treatment will last from Day
           0 up to Month 24.

             1. Day 0: Subjects will receive Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®),(30mg iv single dose);
                Anakinra (100 mg sc.); Etanercept (50 mg sc.) and Liraglutide (0.6 mg sc.) at
                University of Alberta Hospital.

             2. Day 1: Subjects will receive Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/day) sc. at University Hospital
                to mobilize CD34+ stem cells to peripheral blood.

             3. Day 1: Continuing with Anakinra 100mg sc. daily for 12 month; Etanercept 50mg sc.
                twice weekly for first 3 months, and 50mg sc. weekly for another 9 months;
