      allows those with dementia and their family care networks to engage with support services and
      plan for the future. These actions can relieve the significant psychological distress that
      people with dementia and close supporters may experience , and provide knowledge about the
      availability of medical and psycho-social support that can improved functioning and morale

      The main efforts to improve the identification and diagnosis of dementia should logically be
      targeted at primary care as this is the first point of contact for most individuals and their
      carers when faced with experiences of 'ill health'. There is, however, evidence that dementia
      remains under-detected and sub-optimally managed in general practice . An educational
      intervention that could enhance clinical practice, improving the skills of practitioners in
      the recognition of and response to dementia syndromes, could therefore be beneficial to
      people with dementia and their families, and potentially to health and social services.
