      respiratory depression, post-operative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, difficulty voiding and
      ileus.

      The purpose of this study was to determine whether opioid free anesthesia influences the
      quality of recovery. A multimodal approach combining ketamine, lidocaine and clonidine was
      used as an alternative for an opioid based anesthesia.

      The hypothesis of this study was that patient comfort and satisfaction level after an opioid
      free anesthesia would be higher compared to after a more traditional opioid anesthesia.
