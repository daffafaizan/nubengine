      to the general population. Several decades ago, when women with lupus died shortly after
      developing the disease, their deaths were attributed to previously undiagnosed and untreated
      active lupus. But when they died years after their diagnosis of lupus, their deaths were
      attributed to complications of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Similar to lupus,
      atherosclerosis is considered an inflammatory disease. Inflammation plays a major role in
      atherosclerosis, which results when fatty deposits, cholesterol and other materials
      accumulate in the blood vessels.

      The combination of atherosclerosis and lupus greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular
      disease among women. Research has identified many factors that contribute to the risk of
      atherosclerosis in people with lupus. These include high blood pressure and abnormal
      cholesterol levels, chronic inflammation, antibodies that attack proteins that regulate the
      blood vessels, and some medications used to treat lupus.

      In the general population, diabetes is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. A silent
      condition called insulin resistance can lead to diabetes and has been associated with
      atherosclerosis in populations that do not have lupus. Recent studies have shown people with
      lupus are more likely to have insulin resistance than those without the disease.
