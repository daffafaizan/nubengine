      model is designed to increase access to genetic services and uptake of genetic testing in
      childhood cancer survivors. In this model, individual survivors can access remote telegenetic
      services and genetic counselors will partner with PCPs to order genetic testing.

      This study comprises of a 3-arm randomized Hybrid 1 Effectiveness and Implementation study in
      360 CCSS survivors to evaluate the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of
      remote telegenetic services to increase uptake of cancer genetic testing in childhood cancer
      survivors compared to usual care options for genetic testing.

      Aims are as follows:

      To evaluate the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of remote telegenetic
      services to increase uptake of genetic testing at 6 months as compared to usual care among
      childhood cancer survivors who meet criteria for cancer genetic testing. Our primary outcome
      will be a composite variable indicating whether a person had pre-test counseling or genetic
      testing.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of remote videoconferencing to provide greater increase in
      knowledge and decrease in distress and depression as compared to remote phone services, to
      examine the moderators of patient outcomes with remote telegenetic services, and to estimate
      intervention costs and incremental cost-effectiveness of the three study arms.

      To conduct a multi-stakeholder, mixed-methods process evaluation to understand patient,
      provider and system factors associated with uptake of counseling and testing in our adapted
      in-home, collaborative PCP model and facilitators and barriers to uptake to provide
      recommendations for future implementation.
