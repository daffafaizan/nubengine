      personnel will administer all intervention sessions. Each week will cover a specific function
      of the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN) and will include standardized goal-setting and weekly
      homework targets. A research assistant will assess homework adherence using a standardized
      form and through data extracted from the DMN (e.g., number of alarms set). Mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) participants will complete
      separate 6-week individual or group interventions. Following the 6-week intervention,
      participants will continue to use the DMN app for 4-weeks to evaluate stability.

      Participants will also be asked to complete questions about their medical background
      including history of traumatic brain injury or stroke, as well as any current medical
      conditions and questions regarding demographics including age, ethnicity, and education.

      Potential participants will be told that participating in the study will involve completing
      questionnaires at 3 different time points within 12 weeks (i.e.,week 1, week 8, week 12),
      identifying a knowledgeable informant who will also complete questionnaires, participating in
      a 6-week course to learn how to use the DMN and to support everyday functioning, and to
      continue to use the DMN for one month following the intervention.

      Information collected will be in the form of counts (e.g., number of alarms set) and number
      of minutes spent on the device. Specific content entered into the DMN will not be reviewed.
