      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of twice weekly
      17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in combination with weekly rituximab in
      patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      II. To examine the pharmacology of twice weekly 17-AAG in combination with weekly rituximab
      in patients with relapsed CLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity (using NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria) and preliminary efficacy of twice
      weekly 17-AAG when used in combination with weekly rituximab in this patient population.

      II. To examine the kinetics of depletion of PDK1/AKT-related proteins, mutant p53 and
      up-regulation of alternative targets that mediate resistance to therapy following treatment
      with twice weekly 17-AAG; and the relationship of this to spontaneous and drug-induced
      apoptosis in patients with relapsed CLL.

      III. To examine the immunologic effects of twice weekly 17-AAG, in conjunction with weekly
      rituximab, in patients with relapsed CLL.

      IV. To evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy of twice weekly 17-AAG as a single agent in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).

      Patients receive 17-AAG intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18
      (course 1). Patients achieving â‰¥ 25% reduction in measurable disease after course 1 receive
      an additional course of single-agent 17-AAG approximately 10 days later in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and provided absolute lymphocyte count continues
      to decrease. Patients failing to achieve a 25% reduction in measurable disease after course 1
      OR with disease progression after courses 1 or 2 of single-agent 17-AAG proceed to
      combination therapy comprising 17-AAG IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22;
      and rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 and over 1 hour on days 4, 8, 15, and 22 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG as a single agent or in
      combination with rituximab until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at 2 months and then every 3 months for 2 years.
