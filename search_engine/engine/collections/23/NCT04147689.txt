      uncontrolled open-label study investigates the efficacy and safety of DESIRIAL速 PLUS in
      volume restoration of Labia Majora. The study duration is 12 months with an optional
      screening visit (V0) up to 14 days before injection, the baseline visit (injection of
      DESIRIAL速PLUS, V1) and 5 follow-up visits after 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (V2 to V6). At 4
      weeks (V2) an optional touch-up may be done (if needed). It is envisaged to enrol 71 female
      patients with the wish for volume restoration in France to obtain at least 60 evaluable
      patients, which will be monitored over 1 year after baseline injection of DESIRIAL速 PLUS.

      The primary endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients having an improved perception
      of aesthetics (GAIS score after mirror self-examination) at 12 weeks after baseline injection
      of DESIRIAL速 PLUS, which may be touched-up once after 4 weeks (V2).

      Global Aesthetic Improvement (evaluated by the patient and the doctor), Sexual function,
      subject's satisfaction, subject's symptoms & pain, will be measured at all time-point with a
      Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), patient's
      satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) and a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) respectively. Safety will
      be also assessed.
