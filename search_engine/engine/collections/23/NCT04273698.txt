      Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) team which has not offered this kind of work
      specifically before. The project would involve recruiting families, with children under the
      age of five years old, who are experiencing one or more difficulties, and these families
      would be offered five sessions, with the option of an additional five sessions, should this
      be required.

      The work will broadly follow the Tavistock's model of parent-infant psychotherapy and the
      sessions will be centred within a psychodynamic psychotherapeutic framework. I hope that this
      trial will enable to me to learn more about this model of work, in terms of the processes
      involves and the themes that emerge. I hope to see how possible it is for this kind of work
      to be adopted within a generic CAMHS team, and how it is received by the families involved.

      Due to this method of working being new to the team, it will be interesting to see how my
      colleagues respond to the model. It is likely that trying to gather full qualitative or
      quantitative data in this area would be beyond the scope of this piece of research, but I
      hope to make some reflections on how the model was received by the team. I hope to present
      the plan of work to the team prior to the treatment stage, and then share some of the
      findings from the research, after treatment. I also hope to conduct some form of
      consultation, with a staff group, following the treatment stage, in order to hear about their
      experiences of this method.
