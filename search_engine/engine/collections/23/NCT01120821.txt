      phlebotomies may lead to iron deficiency and can contribute to a rising platelet count. This
      may create additional problems, such as clots particularly in patients older than 50. There
      is reason to believe that the use of Gleevec may cause a decrease in the activity of the
      marrow so that patients may not require as many or any phlebotomies. Thus, spleen function
      may possibly improve by decreasing in size and patients' platelet counts may also improve.
