      weeks for each subject. The first week will be a week of adaptation (or run-in period) to the
      diet which they will have to follow for the duration of study. During this period, they will
      collect 2 samples of stools and urine. Then subjects will alternate 4 days of diet either
      with ham, or with ham and calcium, or with ham enriched with vitamin E. At least, 3 days will
      separate every period (wash-out) of nutritional intervention. Urines and stools will be
      collected last 3 days of every interventional period and also last day of every wash out
      period.
