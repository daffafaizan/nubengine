      food additive. It is a natural anti-inflammatory compound and has shown anti-tumor activity
      in the laboratory. Bioperine is a pepper extract that increases the absorption of nutrient
      supplements.

      In this study, 6 patients at a time will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to
      one of two groups of 3 patients each. One group (Arm A) will receive curcumin alone. The
      other group (Arm B) will receive curcumin in combination with Bioperine. There is an equal
      chance of being in either group. While on study you may receive standard supportive care as
      appropriate.

      Both of the study agents will be taken by mouth two times a day. Each group will have five
      dose levels of curcumin, starting with the lowest dose. After 6 patients have been enrolled
      in the first level (3 in each arm), the next group will be treated at a new dose level. You
      will always receive the same dose during your treatment, which will continue for at least 12
      weeks unless there is evidence that the disease has gotten worse or intolerable side effects
      occur. You may receive treatment up to one year depending on your response to treatment.

      You may be treated as outpatient and may receive your treatment at home. You will be asked to
      return to M. D. Anderson every 4 weeks for evaluation and physical exam.

      This is an investigational study. A total of up to 30 evaluable patients will take part in
      the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
