      enrolled after providing consent to extended follow-up. They will be followed to 5 years
      post-implant or outcome (transplant, explant or death), whichever occurs first.

      Subjects who have been transplanted, their device exchanged to another pump other than a HM
      II or HM3, or explanted after the MOMENTUM 3 IDE trial 2-year follow-up but prior to
      providing consent for this PAS can also be enrolled. Data between the 2-year follow-up visit
      and the date of pump exchange, explant, or transplant will be retrospectively collected.

      Once enrolled, if subjects receive a device exchange to any device other than HM II or HM3,
      at any time during the study, they will be withdrawn from the study and will not be followed.

      In the event that a subject expired prior to providing consent, IRB approval will be obtained
      to collect the date and cause of death.
