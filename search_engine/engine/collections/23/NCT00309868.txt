      reduced heart filling pressures. The FDA has approved nesiritide for these patients.

      Between one-third and one-half of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure.
      Few of these patients have been studied while receiving nesiritide.

      A study is needed to test nesiritide on this specific type of heart failure.

      Patients will undergo a heart catheterization and heart biopsy. Patients will then be
      transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. An echocardiogram will be obtained,
      followed by an infusion of nesiritide for 24 hours. At the completion of the infusion, a
      repeat echocardiogram will be obtained.
