      slow the progression of nearsightedness. Low concentration (0.01%) atropine slows the
      progression of myopia 60% to 83% while causing less side effects than high concentration
      (1.0%) atropine though still showing an effect on pupil size and pupil response.This study is
      a prospective cohort study in which several objective and subjective measurements will be
      taken before and after the use of 0.01% atropine for a week to determine the effect of this
      concentration on 1. vision at distance and near; 2. pupil size; 3. focusing ability,
      accuracy, and change; 4. symptoms, including subjective vision, headaches, light sensitivity,
      drop comfort; and 5. pressure in the eye. This will allow us to determine the effect these
      drops have on the eye and whether or not patients would be willing to use them as a possible
      preventative treatment for nearsightedness. The investigators expect to find that the drops
      will not affect vision, will increase pupil size, decrease focusing ability and accuracy (but
      not clinically meaningfully), cause some light sensitivity, and have no effect on eye
      pressure. The investigators expect that patients would be willing to use these drops to
      control nearsightedness even after experiencing the side effects.
