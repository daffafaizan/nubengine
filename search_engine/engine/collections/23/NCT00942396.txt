    
      Objectives: 1) To establish the non-inferiority of the diagnostic accuracy of the Planmed
      Sophie Nuance Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) X-ray System compared to screen-film
      mammography (SFM) in the detection of breast cancer; and 2) To demonstrate in a comparative
      side-by-side feature analysis that interpretations based on the Planmed Sophie Nuance FFDM
      X-ray System are diagnostically non-inferior to SFM in the detection of breast cancer.
