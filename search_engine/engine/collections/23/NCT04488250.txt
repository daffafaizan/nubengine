      optimize for the Botswana context, an affordable technology-based robot system with four
      exercise stations. We will optimize a prototype of our provisionally patented robot gym
      system, REHAB CARES, for therapy. Optimization will include increasing cost-effectiveness,
      utilizing more local resources and manufacturing, and using mobile health android platforms
      for games and data acquisition. In Aim 2, the efficiency of the newly modified robot system
      compared to standard of care will be assessed using 30 patients who have experienced a
      stroke, with or without HIV, will be recruited from those who are being treated by Princess
      Marina Hospital (PMH) and living in the surrounding community. They will receive therapy
      using the robot gym system and receive standard of care. We will assess functional outcomes
      including motor impairment, function, and quality of life. The study outcomes would then
      inform rehabilitation practices for PLHIV with stroke, with or without HIV, and suggest that
      affordable technology-mediated rehabilitation can reduce their motor dysfunction and
      resulting long-term disability.
