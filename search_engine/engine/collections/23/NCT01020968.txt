      with 550,000 new diagnoses made each year (Hunt SA; et al., 2005). Heart failure is the
      leading cause of hospitalization in persons over 65 years of age with cost exceeding $29
      billion annually. Prognosis is very poor once a patient has been hospitalized with heart
      failure. The mortality risk after heart failure hospitalization is 11.3% at 30 days, 33.1% at
      1 year and well over 50% within 5 years (Hunt SA; et al., 2005). These numbers emphasize the
      need to develop and implement more effective treatments to manage heart failure.

      Aastrom is targeting a subset of heart failure patient population, namely those diagnosed
      with dilated cardiomyopathy. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines dilated
      cardiomyopathy (DCM) as a cardiac condition wherein a ventricular chamber exhibits increased
      diastolic and systolic volume and a low (<40%) ejection fraction (Manolio TA; et al., 1992;
      Towbin JA; et al., 2006). DCM is reported to affect 108,000 to 150,000 patients in the United
      States (Richardson P; et al., 1996; Towbin JA; et al., 2006).

      This study is a prospective, stratified, randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center
      study to assess the safety profile and the efficacy of CRCs administered via catheter in
      treating patients with DCM. Two strata will be used: ischemic (IDCM) and non-ischemic
      (NIDCM). Within each stratum, patients will be randomized to receive either CRC treatment or
      control in a 2:1 ratio (8 patients per CRC treatment group and 4 patients per control group).
      It will enroll a total of 24 patients at 2 sites in the U.S.
