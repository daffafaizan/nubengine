    
      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability of doxylamine between two oral
      delayed-release formulations containing the fixed-dose combination of doxylamine succinate 10
      milligrams (mg)/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg

        -  A product of Tecnandina, S.A. TENSA (Test) and

        -  Diclegis (Registered Trademark), a product of Duchesnay Inc.(Reference)

      after an administration of a single dose equivalent to doxylamine succinate 20 mg and
      pyridoxine hydrochloride 20 mg (i.e., 2 tablets) under fasting conditions to determine
      bioequivalence in terms of rate and extent of absorption.

      Furthermore, the tolerability of the fixed-dose combination doxylamine succinate 10
      mg/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg will be evaluated in healthy women in a dose equivalent to
      doxylamine succinate 20 mg and pyridoxine hydrochloride 20 mg.
