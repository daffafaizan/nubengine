    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for
      inhalation in preterm neonates 26 to 32 completed weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Efficacy
      and safety are based on clinical evaluations. The endpoints specified are similar to those in
      Protocols 03-CL-1201 and 03-CL-1401 to allow for potential comparison and pooling of results.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for
      inhalation in conjunction with nCPAP, compared to nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates with RDS,
      as assessed by the time to and incidence of respiratory failure and/or death due to RDS over
      the first 72 hours of life, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks
      PMA, and change in physiologic parameters (FiO2 and PCO2) over the first 72 hours of life.
