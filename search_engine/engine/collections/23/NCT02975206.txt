    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Approximately 450 subjects will
      be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 1 mg, 5 mg, or
      placebo for 6 weeks. During the screening period, subjects will be provided with an
      electronic device for recording electronic diary (eDiary) assessments throughout the study.
      This eDiary will be used to capture efficacy endpoint data and treatment information. At the
      Baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomized, and study drug dispensed beginning with
      a loading dose of 3 tablets to be taken at bedtime that same day. Starting on Study Day 2,
      subjects will take one tablet per day at bedtime. Treatment will continue for 6 weeks. The
      primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed during Week 6. After completion of the 6-week
      treatment period, all subjects will enter a 4-week follow-up period.
