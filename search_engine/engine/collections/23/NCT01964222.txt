    
      A previously developed and pilot tested web-based decision aid (DA) based on best practices
      in health literacy that is well received by minority participants and significantly improved
      knowledge about cancer clinical trials and decision self-efficacy will be used. This study
      will expand the reach of the DA and test it in a larger study in a different geographic
      region and center (Siteman Cancer Center). An additional benefit of conducting this work at
      Siteman Cancer Center is that Siteman and the Program for the Elimination of Cancer
      Disparities (PECaD) already institute structural changes at the system level to improve
      minority participation in trials. This study will activate and educate patients and will
      complement the system-level interventions.

      By random 1:1 assignment, 180 participants will either receive:

      *Targeted, web-based decision aid (DA) about participating in cancer clinical trials.

      or

      *Usual care/control-Access to the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials.

      Outcomes from the DA group will be compared to outcomes in a usual care/control group.
