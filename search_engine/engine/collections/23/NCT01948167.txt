      programs, to advance knowledge on personalized approaches to prevention that may be able to
      better "bend trajectories" of depression that surge throughout adolescence. A randomized
      controlled trial will examine the benefits of matching youth to two depression prevention
      programs of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) and Coping with
      Stress (CWS) for the prevention of depression in adolescents. These two programs are designed
      to address distinct risk factors for depression - CWS addresses cognitive risks and IPT-AST
      addresses interpersonal risks. A total of 210 participants across two sites, University of
      Denver and Rutgers University, will be stratified on cognitive and interpersonal risk and
      randomized to the two conditions. The goals of the study are to (1) demonstrate that
      prevention programs can modify depression trajectories among youth by examining within person
      changes in trajectories over time (three years before and three years after the prevention
      programs) and by comparing trajectories of prevention youth with changes in same aged
      cohorts; (2) evaluate a personalized prevention approach to bending depression trajectories
      by matching and mismatching youth to either CWS or IPT-AST based on individual risk profiles;
      (3) examine mechanisms of bending depression trajectories and test whether the prevention
      programs operate via their hypothesized processes; and (4) explore how genetic
      susceptibility, emotion regulation, and temperament may affect individual response to IPT-AST
      and CWS. By implementing evidence-based prevention programs after 3-years of prospective
      naturalistic data collection, this study will contribute essential data on personalized
      medicine and altering developmental trajectories of first-onset depression.
