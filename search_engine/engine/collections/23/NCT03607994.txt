      closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology that uses software-guided
      algorithmic analysis to identify and translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones
      to support real-time self-optimization of brain activity. Prior research demonstrates that
      the use of HIRREM is associated with reduced symptoms of insomnia, and traumatic stress and
      anxiety, and improved autonomic cardiovascular regulation across heterogeneous cohorts.
      HIRREM has been safe and well tolerated in about 500 people across six IRB-approved studies.
      However, the current in-office HIRREM approach remains very operator dependent (extensive
      Technologist education and experience) and takes a sizeable time commitment from the
      participant (typically ten or more sessions of 90-120 minutes each). To reduce participant
      time required, and operator dependence, while increasing scalability, a new generation of
      hardware and software has been developed. While based on the same core technology and
      algorithms to mirror brainwaves with audible tones, this includes the use of faster, 64-bit
      processing architecture for faster feedback, the use of 4 sensors, and the use of standard
      protocols, all done with eyes closed (HIRREM-SOP). Although only 2 sensors are active at a
      time, applying 4 sensors, for which the software can switch from one pair to the other
      automatically, cuts in half the number of sensor placement changes needed, with reduced
      session time and interruptions. A modified placebo condition now includes random timing and
      pitch of the tones, which have not been acoustically engineered. This pilot study will
      evaluate feasibility of this standardized, enhanced approach, and the effectiveness of
      blinding for the placebo condition in participants with symptoms of insomnia.
