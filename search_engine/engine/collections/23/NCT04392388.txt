    
      The primary objective is to assess the cumulative incidence of infection in the general
      population using dried blood spot sampling.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To identify factors associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive serology)
           and to characterize the durability of the serological response to SARS-CoV-2

        -  To identify associations of symptoms predictive of a SARS-CoV-2 infection

        -  To estimate the health care use associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection

        -  To estimate the fraction of sub-clinical infections or infections not captured by the
           healthcare system;

        -  To study the acceptability of a mass anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological testing and the impact
           of its result, linked with social inequalities in health;

        -  To estimate the individual and collective impact of containment and other preventive
           measures on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection;

        -  To study the impact of social and territorial inequalities on seroprevalence levels.
