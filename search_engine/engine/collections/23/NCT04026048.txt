      CBT-I compared to a delayed treatment group with 124 cancer survivors who have completed
      primary treatment at least 6 months prior and report PCI and insomnia. Participants who are
      randomized to the immediate treatment group will receive CBT-I over the course of seven
      weekly one hour sessions, after which the delayed treatment group will receive the
      intervention. Both groups will complete follow up assessments three and six months after
      completing treatment. PCI will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      - Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) as the primary outcome. To provide an objective assessment of
      cognition, the investigators have included the neurocognitive measures recommended by the
      International Cognition and Cancer Task Force. Other measures will include fatigue, anxiety,
      depression, and work productivity.

      The investigators hypothesize that the online CBT-I group will report significantly greater
      improvements in perceived cognitive function compared to the waitlist control immediately
      post-treatment (primary endpoint). The investigators also hypothesize that these improvements
      will be maintained up at 6-months follow up (secondary endpoint).
