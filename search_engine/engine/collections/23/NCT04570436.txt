      Discrimination crossover study, a Treatment Phase and Follow-up. Following successful
      completion of the Qualification Phase the participants will be enrolled in the Treatment

      controlled, 5 treatment, 10-sequence, 5 period crossover, single-dose, Williams square design
      study in healthy male and/or female adult, non drug-dependent recreational users. On Day 1 of
      each of the Treatment Phase 5 periods, which will be separated by a washout of at least 14
      days, participants will receive an oral dose of either Neurontin 1800 mg, 1200 mg or 600 mg
      or 20 mg diazepam, or placebo. Study treatments will be administered under fasted conditions
      (overnight fast and no food until 4 hours after dosing). Water will be allowed without
      restriction until 1 hour prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing.
