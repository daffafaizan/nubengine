      of gastric cancer precursors and early gastric cancer is crucial for good outcomes. However,
      these lesions are subtle and often missed by conventional white light imaging (WLI)
      endoscopy. Image enhanced endoscopy techniques have been developed to enhance the detection
      and characterization of gastrointestinal lesions. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is one such
      technique. Though widely used, its drawbacks include a limited far view as a result of the
      optical filter causing a dark endoscopic view. Linked color imaging (LCI) is a more recent
      image enhanced endoscopy technique that acquires images by using both narrow-band wavelength
      light and white light in an appropriate balance, enhancing slight color differences in the
      red region of mucosa. It has been proven to improve detection of H pylori gastritis and
      colorectal neoplasms. Thus far, there has been no study to determine whether the use of LCI
      will increase the detection rate of gastric cancer precursors and early gastric cancer
      compared to WLI. This study aims to determine whether LCI can increase the detection rate of
      gastric cancer precursors and early gastric cancer when compared to white light endoscopy,
      with the null hypothesis being no difference in detection rates. This study will also examine
      the use of LCI with magnification to predict histology findings for focal lesions seen on
      endoscopy, as well as the use of LCI in identifying esophageal lesions (such as Barett's
      esophagus) and duodenal lesions.
