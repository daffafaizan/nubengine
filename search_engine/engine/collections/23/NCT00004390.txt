    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, crossover study. Patients are
      stratified by the duration of pain (greater than 1 year or no greater than 1 year) and the
      presence or absence of major depression.

      Patients are randomized into 6 treatment order groups. Patients start with nortriptyline,
      morphine, or placebo, taken orally every day. If patients are unable to tolerate
      nortriptyline or morphine, they will receive desipramine or methadone instead.

      A drug titration period lasting 3 weeks is ensued for administration of the first drug
      treatment. The goal of this titration period is to gradually increase the dose of the drug to
      obtain maximal analgesic efficacy. Drug dosage is maintained for a period of 3 weeks. The
      drug dosage is tapered off and followed by a drug free period of 1 week.
