      increasingly used in patients with non-traumatic abdominal emergencies, too. However,
      non-trauma DCS is an ongoing matter of debate as the open abdomen treatment usually performed
      in DCS is a non-anatomical situation and associated with potentially severe side effects. To
      date, DCS in patients with non-traumatic abdominal emergencies has not yet been
      comprehensively assessed in meta-analysis.

      A systematic literature search will be conducted using the National Library of Medicine's
      Medline database (PubMed). The search strategy will be based on the PICOS process. Original
      research articles in English language addressing DCS for non-traumatic abdominal emergencies
      will be included in the qualitative synthesis.

      Two meta-analyses will be performed, comparing (1) mortality in non-trauma patients
      undergoing open abdomen treatment vs. primary abdominal closure and (2) the observed and vs.
      expected mortality rate in patients undergoing non-trauma DCS based on outcome prediction
      scores. Meta-analysis will be performed using a random-effects model. The estimated effect
      size for mortality will be reported as risk difference with 95% confidence intervals.
      Sensitivity analysis will be performed by repeating the analysis in the subgroups of studies
      with the same study design and studies that applied the same outcome prediction score.
