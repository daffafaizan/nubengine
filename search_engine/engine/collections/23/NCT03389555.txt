      therapy aside from antibiotics. A recent quasi-experimental study (Marik et. al., PMID
      27940189) demonstrated a remarkable benefit when the combination of Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin
      C), Corticosteroids, and Thiamine (Vitamin B1) were given to patients with sepsis. In
      particular, patients who received this combination of medications required a shorter amount
      of time on vasopressors, suffered less organ failure, and had improved mortality. Vitamin C
      has long been suggested for treatment of patients with severe infection as it exerts
      significant anti-oxidant effects and reduces endothelial permeability. Corticosteroids, a
      mainstay of therapy for refractory shock in sepsis, have also been shown to enhance the
      beneficial cellular effects of vitamin C. Finally, thiamine has been shown to be an effective
      mitochondrial resuscitator in sepsis, especially for the ~30% of septic shock patients who
      present with thiamine deficiency (Donnino et. al, PMID 26771781).

      In this study, we aim to reproduce the findings of Marik et. al. using a more rigorous study
      design (i.e. a blinded, randomized clinical trial) and focus on the important clinical
      outcomes of organ failure and death.
