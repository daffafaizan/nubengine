        -  Determine the activity of R101933 in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel in terms
           of response to treatment and level of clinical benefit in patients with
           taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the acute side effects in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive R101933 IV over 1 hour immediately followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours or
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 7 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have no disease
      progression after 7 courses may continue with treatment at the investigator's discretion.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
