      urine tests, bone marrow tests, tests of the central nervous system, x-rays, or MRI/CT test.
      These are needed to measure the patient's clinical condition and progress. A physical exam
      and blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) will be repeated at least one time weekly.

      Since Liposomal Vincristine may prevent the body from making and/or keeping new blood cells,
      prior to treatment patients will also have a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (AIDS virus) test,
      a blood test to detect the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus. A separate informed
      consent will be given to be signed, in order to obtain permission for this test. Female
      patients may also be required to have a urine pregnancy test before treatment may begin, as
      it is not known how the drug may affect the unborn child.

      Patients will receive liposomal vincristine through a central venous catheter (a plastic tube
      usually inserted under the collar bone) over one hour, once every 14 days, + 2 days.
      Patient's will also be given the drug docusate by the day liposomal vincristine is started.
      This is done to try to prevent constipation as a side effect.

      All patients who show a continued response or stable disease without major side effects may
      continue to receive liposomal vincristine for up to 24 months. Patients with solid tumors and
      lymphoma will have X-rays performed every 8 weeks to follow the progression of their tumor.
      Patients with leukemia will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done after the first and
      second months of treatment, and then every 8 weeks.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized the use of the study drug in
      research. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled
      at UTMDACC.
