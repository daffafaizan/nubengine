    
      This multicentre trial consists of an open-labelled single cohort lead-in (Part A) followed
      by a phase II double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled comparison of AZD1775 (or placebo)
      and an antimitotic agent. Review by a central laboratory of fresh tumour or archival tumour
      samples will be required prior to study entry to assess TP53 mutation status. However,
      subjects will be allowed to enter the single cohort (Part A) regardless of TP53 mutation
      status (wild-type or mutant). In addition, patients in the single cohort Part A treatment
      group will be asked to consent to limited sample collections for assessment of
      pharmacokinetic parameters.
