      administration of iodinated contrast agents. CIN is commonly defined as an increase in post
      contrast serum creatinine (SCr) greater than or equal to 25% or an absolute increase greater
      than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from pre contrast baseline values. Study will evaluate and compare
      the effects of two (2) contrast media products on renal function in subjects with stable
      reduced renal function while undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
