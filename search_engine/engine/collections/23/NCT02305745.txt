      diagnosed when a mother has high blood pressure in pregnancy combined with protein in the
      urine which is sign that the kidneys are not functioning properly. When a mother has
      preeclampsia, the placenta makes abnormal amounts of several important proteins that damage
      the lining of the mother's blood vessels. The blood vessel damage that occurs places women at
      up to 10 times higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke at a younger age than women who
      did not have preeclampsia. It usually takes between 8 and 15 years after preeclampsia is
      diagnosed for the first heart attack or stroke to occur.

      Unfortunately, this blood vessel damage is usually silent, meaning that women and their
      doctors are not aware of it. This makes it hard to predict which women are at highest risk of
      a heart attack or stroke and therefore need extra medical care to prevent it. Abnormal levels
      of the placenta proteins in the blood (right after delivery and at three and six months after
      delivery) as well as abnormalities of the placenta itself may be the earliest way to predict
      which women with preeclampsia are at risk of premature heart disease or stroke.

      The purpose of this study is to collect blood and placentas from women with preeclampsia and
      without preeclampsia to measure and compare the levels of proteins in the blood and find
      abnormalities of the placentas that are associated with preeclampsia. We will then see if
      these tests can predict which women will go on to develop high blood pressure and ultimately
      be at higher risk of premature heart attack or stroke after pregnancy.
