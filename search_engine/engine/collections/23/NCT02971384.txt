    
      200 children aged 4-12 years are recruited by pediatricians and general practitioners and are
      allocated to preventive treatment with either Echinaforce Junior tablets or Vitamin C.
      Children take 3 x 1 tablet per day over a period of 2 months followed by 1 week treatment
      break and an intermediate study visit (V2). Thereafter children continue with preventive
      Treatment for another 2 months, followed by exclusion visit (V3).

      Parents are required to contact a study coordinator at the occurrence of acute respiratory
      Symptoms to initiate symptom recording via internet-based e-diary. On day 1 - 3 of episode
      parents will sample nasal secretion, which will be analysed for common respiratory agents.
