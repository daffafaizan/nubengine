    
      Last December, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China. The agent that
      caused this pneumonia was identified as a new virus in the Coronaviridae family (SARS-CoV-2)
      and the clinical symptomatology associated with the virus has been named COVID-19. COVID-19
      is currently a public health emergency.

      Plitidepsin is an authorized drug in Australia for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
      Antiviral activity of plitidepsin has been analyzed in a human hepatoma cell line infected
      with the HCoV-229E-GFP virus, a virus similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

      Taking into account that the available safety data from plitidepsin comes from patients with
      solid tumors that received treatment with a regimen of administration of plitidepsin for 5
      consecutive days, we propose a multicenter, randomized, proof-of-concept clinical trial to
      assess the safety profile of 3 different dose levels of plitidepsin administered three
      consecutive days, in adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who require hospital
      admission.

      This study aims to assess safety and toxicity profile and also preliminary efficacy of
      plitidepsin at each dose level administered according to the proposed administration scheme
      in patients with COVID-19 who require hospital admission. Main objective is to select the
      recommended dose levels of plitidepsin for a future phase II / III efficacy study.
