    
      All patients consulting for nasal obstruction at night and who have functional nasal test
      with pathological resistance in decubitus position are included.

      Functional nasal test (non invasive tests) will be performed before and after intranasal
      introduction of a stent: anterior rhinomanometry to measure nasal function by the measure of
      resistance and acoustic rhinometry to measure the geometry of nasal fossa by the measure of
      minimal sectional cross area sitting, after 30 minutes of decubitus then new measurements
      with a stent in decubitus position in each nostril .
