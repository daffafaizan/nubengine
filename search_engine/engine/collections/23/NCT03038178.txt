    
      This is an open-label study of efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily dosing of
      Liposomal-Amikacin for Inhalation (LAI), in addition to a standard multi-drug antibiotic
      therapy in accordance with the 2007 ATS/ IDSA guidelines, in patients with Mycobacterium
      abscessus lung disease. The multi-drug therapy is determined at the discretion of the
      Investigator. After screening, all eligible patients will enter the trial and will receive
      LAI 590 mg once daily for 12 months. If deemed necessary by the investigator, dose may be
      adjusted from a minimum of three times per week up to daily, in cases of adverse events
      relating to tolerability.

      All patients who enter the study will have subsequent study visits at Months 1,2,4,6,9, at
      End-of-Study or Month 12, and at 1 and 3 months post study drug discontinuation. At each
      visit (including screening), review of concomitant medications, review of adverse events, and
      physical exam, will be performed. Chest CT scan will be performed at baseline, 6 months, and
      12 months, unless a chest CT scan has already been performed within 6 months on this time
      point. The 6 minute walk test and QOL-B-NTM will be performed at baseline, 6 months, 12
      months, and 3 months post study drug discontinuation. All patients will have inducted sputum
      collected at each study visit, and patients will self-collect expectorated sputum during
      intervening monthly time-points until study completion to determine changes in mycobacterial
      smear and culture status.

      Unscheduled visits will occur as needed should subjects' symptoms worsen between visits.
