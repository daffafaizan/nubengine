      neuro-developmental encephalopathy, suffer from osteoporosis which can appear at a very early
      age (before age 10) and can lead to fractures, pain and a limitation in mobility. Few
      epidemiological studies have estimated the frequency of osteoporosis in girls with RETT
      syndrome and showed that they are more exposed to osteoporosis then children with other
      neuro-developmental diseases with a same degree of neurological handicap. However, the
      mechanisms that lead to early osteoporosis in RETT syndrome remain unknown.

      Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in 95% of RETT patients. Preliminary experimental
      studies on the transcriptional consequences of MECP2 mutations showed that the expression of
      13 genes were significantly dysregulated and one of them is the gene that codes for
      osteoprotegerin, a soluble receptor that binds to RANK-ligand. RANK-ligand is an osteoclastic
      differentiation factor expressed by osteoblasts.

      In order to identify risk factors of osteoporosis in RETT syndrome and to understand the
      pathophysiological mechanisms the study protocol includes:

        1. Clinical evaluation of bone health (history of bone fractures, pain, nutritional status,
           pubertal stage, daily caloric/calcium intake, anti-epileptic drugs, walking ability,
           vitamin D status)

        2. evaluation of the mineral density at the lumber spine using DEXA

        3. measuring concentrations of osteoprotegerin and RANK-ligand
