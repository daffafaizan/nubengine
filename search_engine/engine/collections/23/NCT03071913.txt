      I. To define the heterogeneity of blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability by assessing drug
      distribution in a population of patients with central nervous system (CNS) malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish correlation of BBB permeability with radiographic appearance for study patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To utilize tumor samples to investigate mechanisms for BBB heterogeneity.

      OUTLINE:

      As part of pre-operative standard of care, patients receive levetiracetam by injection and
      cefazolin by injection. Patients are also offered lorazepam in the pre-operative area. At the
      time of surgery, patients undergo approximately 2 tissue biopsies from 3-4 tumor locations.
      This tissue is removed as part of the planned surgery, but it is also tested for research
      purposes. During surgery, a blood sample is collected every 20-30 minutes beginning at the
      time of skin incision until all of the research tumor samples have been removed. A minimum of
      3 blood samples are collected up to a maximum of 12.
