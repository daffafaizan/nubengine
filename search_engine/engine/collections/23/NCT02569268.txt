    
      This study aimed to establish vascular disease early detection system and scoring systems by
      comprehensive vascular disease risk factors and vascular function evaluation index. And
      prevention of vascular-related diseases, high-risk groups through positive lifestyle changes:
      such as lipid-lowering, smoking cessation, reversing early vascular lesions, to avoid
      end-stage vascular events.

        1. Detection of vascular function indicators include: PWV, IMT, CFVR, FMD, CAVI, ABI,
           LDL-C, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, Hcy, BNP, UA and so on.

        2. Design the questionnaire: surveying the lifestyle, personal history, family history of
           the study population.

        3. Follow-up:2 years of observation, recording the end time of vascular events, including
           cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, angina, coronary reperfusion
           therapy), stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease.

        4. Statistics: Complex the factors of vascular disease, screen for an effective indicator
           to predict cardiovascular events, and based on the weight of the different factors, the
           establish the rating system, use the system to predict the incidence of vascular events
           terminal, and compare the system with the previous scoring system such as FRS
           (Framingham Risk Score).
