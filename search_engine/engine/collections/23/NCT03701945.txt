      in predicting AECOPD and increasing the evidence on PR in AECOPD through the translation of
      PR guidelines to the community. Specifically, it aims to:

        -  Explore the longitudinal changes in microbiota and clinical data between stable and
           exacerbations periods;

        -  Establish the feasibility and short- and long-term effects of community-based PR for
           AECOPD;

        -  Define the characteristics of patients who most benefit from community-based PR.

           156 patients with COPD will be followed monthly for a year and their lung microbiota and
           clinical data will be analysed. Community-based PR will be delivered to 56 patients.
           Data will be collected before, at 3 weeks, after PR and at 6 months to assess the
           feasibility and effects of PR. A clinical decision-making tool (CDMT) to prioritise
           patients with AECOPD for PR will be developed.

      The experienced multidisciplinary team will ensure the following novel results:

        -  a clinical and lung microbiota profile of patients with COPD;

        -  a model of AECOPD prediction;

        -  recommendations for community-based PR in AECOPD;

        -  a CDMT to prioritise patients with AECOPD for PR.

      PRIME will contribute to optimise outcomes, improve AECOPD healthcare services and reduce the
      burden with COPD.
