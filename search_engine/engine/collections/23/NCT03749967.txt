      integral to adaptive cognitive functioning, promoting neuroplasticity in this network with
      rTMS could be more precisely optimized to improve quality of life across psychosocial domains
      and across neuropsychiatric presentations. The investigators postulate that through
      up-regulating cognitive control circuitry with rTMS that an individual would have 1) enhanced
      capacity for successfully contending with the shifting contingencies of daily life and 2)
      improved ability to regulate intrusive affect and impulses. As a function of these processes
      an individual is expected to experience reduced psychosocial impairment. Thus, the
      investigators propose that rather than targeting specific symptom reductions in specific
      disorders, rTMS could be dosed for efficacy in enhancing psychosocial functioning. Such an
      approach has the potential to enhance rehabilitation for far more Veterans suffering a range
      of neuropsychiatric conditions.

      Aim 1. Establish the dose-response curve for improved psychosocial functioning secondary to
      accelerated rTMS in a transdiagnostic anxious and depressed sample of Veterans.

      Aim 2. Establish the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of an accelerated delivery
      schedule of therapeutic rTMS for improved psychosocial functioning in a transdiagnostic
      anxious and depressed sample of Veterans.

      Exploratory Aim 3. Establish whether neurocognitive function demonstrates a dose-response
      function to accelerated rTMS similar to psychosocial functioning in a transdiagnostic anxious
      and depressed sample.
