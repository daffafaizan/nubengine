        -  Correlate changes in the level of serum tumor-specific DNA over time with changes in
           brain tumor size as measured by serial MRI or CT scans in patients with grade III-IV
           malignant gliomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected from patients at baseline and every 2 months thereafter. Tumor
      and nontumor plasma is extracted. Plasma samples are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) to assess the p16_ink4a, p73, and O ^6-MGMT gene promoter methylation profile.
      Quantitative realtime PCR is performed on samples with tumor-specific DNA to determine the
      plasma concentrations of each methylated tumor-specific gene and the total plasma
      tumor-specific DNA concentration. Patients also undergo MRI or CT scans every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
