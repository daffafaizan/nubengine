      are admitted to a residential facility in North Little Rock (RCA-NLR) and randomized by
      depressive symptom severity to receive one of the following: sertraline alone (200 mg/day),
      sertraline (200 mg/day) plus gabapentin (1200 mg/day), or placebo. Subjects are expected to
      participate in the Substance Abuse Day Treatment Program while residing on the RCA-NLR and
      being inducted onto the maintenance dose of study medication (weeks 1-2). When participants
      transfer to the Outpatient Treatment Research Unit (TRU) at the start of their third week,
      they will continue to receive study medications or placebo (weeks 3-12) and they will be
      expected to participate in weekly individual cognitive behavioral therapy. Supervised urines
      and vital signs will be obtained thrice weekly; self-reported adverse effects, mood and drug
      use self-reports will be obtained once weekly. At the end of 12 weeks, participants will be
      tapered off the study medication over a five-day period, discharged from the study, and
      referred to an appropriate treatment or treatment/research program in the community if they
      are interested.
