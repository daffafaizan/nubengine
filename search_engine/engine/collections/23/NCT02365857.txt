      duration of subarachnoid block. When clonidine or Dexmedetomidine was added to intrathecal
      local anesthetics, the regression of sensory and motor blocks increased dose-dependently.
      Further, a recent meta-analysis including seven randomized controlled studies reported an
      increase in the duration of analgesia and reduced morphine requirement after the concomitant
      subarachnoid administration of clonidine.

      Animal studies demonstrated that Dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine significantly enhanced
      the duration of sensory and motor blockade of sciatic nerve block. Histo-pathological
      examination proved that all of the nerves analyzed had normal axons and myelin at 24 h and 14
      days after the peri-neural administration of Dexmedetomidine. Several clinical studies
      confirmed the analgesic potentials and safe neurological outcome of neuraxially administered
      Dexmedetomidine in the non-obstetric settings while intrathecal clonidine proved to be a
      useful analgesic adjunct for spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing cesarean section. But
      to the best of the investigator knowledge the effects of intrathecal Dexmedetomidine on the
      perioperative clinical profile of bupivacaine-induced spinal anesthesia were not studied
      before in the obstetric patient population.
