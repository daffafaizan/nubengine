    
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an incurable and untreatable group of heterogeneous retinal
      degenerative diseases that cause severe visual loss. There is currently no therapeutic that
      substantially slows the progression of this disease, and certainly none that can restore
      vision in RP patients. The Valproic Acid (VPA) study is designed as a six-site,
      interventional, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded study of 90
      participants to evaluate the efficacy of oral Valproic Acid to both slow the progression of
      visual function loss and/or to restore visual function in patients with an Autosomal Dominant
      RP genetic mutation and to collect safety and tolerability information. Patients that
      participate in the study will be randomized to either placebo or VPA in a 1:1 ratio.
