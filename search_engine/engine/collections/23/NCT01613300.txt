        -  Rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 12, 24, 36 and 60 months post-transplant
           defined as the time between the infusion of progenitors and the disease progression or
           death. Patients alive or in complete remission will be censored at the time of last
           follow up

        -  Transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 12, 24, 36 and 60 months after transplantation,
           defined as any death not caused directly by lymphoma (any death caused by complications
           related to transplantation).

        -  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time between infusion of progenitors and the
           patient's death from any cause. Alive Patients will be censored at the time of last
           follow-up

        -  Incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) wide at 1 and 5 years according to
           conventional criteria (Atkinson et al. 1989) and Filipovich et al. (BBMT, 2005).

        -  Rate of event-free survival (DFS) defined as time interval between diagnosis of lymphoma
           and lymphoma progression or relapse or death if the above does not occur.

        -  Successful graft implantation: is defined as:

             1. º: three consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 * 109 / L

             2. ° thrombocythemia exceeds 20 * 109 / L.

        -  Reconstitution of the immune system: lymphocyte count populations CD20, CD3, CD4 and CD8
           and immunoglobulinemia serum (days +100, 180, 360, 18 months and 24 months).

        -  intercurrent infections. All sorts of infections (viral, fungal and bacterial)will be
           recorded

        -  Safety assessment by the standards of Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events v.
