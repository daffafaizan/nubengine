      mononuclear cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.Patients could be in different
      stages of chronic myeloid leukemia pre-treatment.Additionally, the investigators also
      selected some healthy volunteers as comparison.Firstly, the investigators analyzed
      mitochondrial biogenesis and basal metabolic characteristic of mononuclear cells from
      patients and healthy volunteers.Secondly, the investigators tested the cell viability and
      apoptosis after tigecycline treatment.Thirdly,the investigators detected the changes of cell
      mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic characteristic in the same study sample after
      tigecycline stimulation. Finally,the investigators analyzed the correlation between
      sensitivities of mononuclear cells to tigecycline and patients' clinical parameters and
      survival outcome.
