      Neonatal Research Network site. Infants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized
      to either caffeine citrate at 10 mg/kg/dose or placebo (equal volume of all the excipients
      except for the active ingredient, caffeine citrate) to be given daily beginning within 72
      hours of open label caffeine discontinuation. The infant may still require hospitalization
      for observation after discontinuation of open label caffeine or for other discharge issues
      such as temperature control or feeding tolerance.

      Once deemed ready for discharge, infants will be continued at home on the same dose of
      caffeine citrate or placebo for the first 28 days after hospital discharge. On the day of
      discharge, the parent will be supplied with 28 numbered vials with oral caffeine citrate
      (intervention group) or placebo at an equivalent volume (placebo group).

      The parents will be educated by the research nurse, discharge nurse, physician, or pharmacist
      on storage and administration of study medication. A member of the research team will contact
      the parents to obtain post-discharge information within 72 hours after discharge, once a week
      for the first 4 weeks, and biweekly during the weeks 5 to 8 after discharge.
