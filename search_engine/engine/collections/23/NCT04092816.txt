      having dependent children worsens suffering for parents with advanced cancer and their
      families. The FAMILY intervention consists of manualized visits with a trained intervention
      facilitator and psychoeducation materials to help parents cope with cancer-related parenting
      concerns. The purpose of the intervention is to improve parenting concerns, emotional
      well-being, and end-of-life (EOL) preparation among participants. This study will evaluate
      whether a psychosocial intervention to reduce psychological distress and improve EOL
      preparation for mothers with metastatic breast cancer and their co-parents can be acceptable,
      feasible, and relevant to the target patient population.

      This study is needed in order to generate critical data to: (1) refine the intervention in
      preparation for a pilot efficacy randomized controlled trial (RCT); and to generate
      preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of core intervention
      components. The preliminary data will support future grant applications for a full-scale
      efficacy RCT.
