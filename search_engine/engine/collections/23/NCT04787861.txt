      chest physiotherapy alone on pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, and endurance in
      children with Down Syndrome (DS). Methods: This randomized controlled study included 40
      children (24 boys & 16 girls) with DS. Their ages ranged from 9 to 13 years. The control
      group received conventional chest physical therapy program, three sessions per week for 12
      weeks. The study group received an aerobic exercise regimen using a motorized movement
      therapy device 3 times /week in addition to the same traditional program used with the
      control group. Pulmonary function tests, and six-minutes walking test were measured at
      baseline, after 18 sessions and after 36 sessions of treatment.
