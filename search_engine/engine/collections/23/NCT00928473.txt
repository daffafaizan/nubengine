    
      The Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank collects data from two cohorts - an obesity clinic
      cohort and a population-based cohort, of which the latter functions as a reference group.

      The biobank continuously and longitudinally includes clinical data and biological samples
      from children and adolescents in obesity treatment. The population-based cohort has been
      recruited in a cross-sectional manner from Danish schools, high schools, and dentistries.

      Data included in the biobank include venous blood samples, stool, urine, saliva,
      anthropometrics, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance
      imaging and spectroscopy, and genetic markers among others. The data are stored in a central
      secured electronic database and biological materials are stored in -80-degree Celsius
      freezers until analyses.

      To date, the Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank have included data from more than 5250
      children, adolescents and adults from the obesity clinic cohort and more than 4200 from the
      population-based cohort.
