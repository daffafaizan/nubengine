      chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. The increased diabetes risk observed among
      Chinese immigrants has been primarily attributed to changes in diet and weight gain following
      immigration, but these changes can only partially explain disparities in disease risk. Models
      of immigrant health suggest that the stress of adapting to life in a new country has a
      considerable impact on physical health. However, few studies have considered the psychosocial
      impact of immigration upon biomarkers of health and disease risk. Therefore, this
      longitudinal study of US Chinese immigrant men and women will examine: (1) whether
      psychosocial factors (e.g., acculturative stress, social isolation, discrimination) are
      associated with markers of type 2 diabetes risk over time; and (2) whether the association
      between psychosocial factors and diabetes risk markers is mediated by inflammatory pathways.
