      obligatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the nasopharyngeal swab and an optional serum
      antibody testing are carried out for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). An obligatory standardized questionnaire is used to evaluate symptoms and
      contacts, medical history and underlying conditions and the psychological effects of the
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as its effects on individual access to
      medical care. Children with a positive nasopharyngeal swab or antibody test, as well as their
      household contacts aged 0 to 18 years enter the Follow-up phase. During the Follow-up phase,
      blood and urine samples are taken from children for immunological analysis, HLA typing and
      untargeted metabolomics, enabling a broad analysis of the adaptive and innate immune response
      to SARS-CoV-2, as well as metabolic and genetic risk factors for infection and disease
      compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, a repeated swab and antibody
      testing at 0, 3 and 6 months for children and adult household contacts is carried out to
      analyse household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults and the persistence of
      antibodies.
