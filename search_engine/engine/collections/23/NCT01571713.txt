      experiencing. This study seeks to quantify these symptoms for research purposes. Participants
      will be identified through those who attend the pediatric pulmonary hypertension clinic at
      LPCH. Only children who are currently on one of seven PH medications (Bosentan, Epoprostenol,
      Letairis, Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Treprostinil, Ventaris) will be approached. Patients who
      consent to be in the study will answer a brief series of questions pertaining to the presence
      and duration of their symptoms. These will be correlated to a list of side effects taken from
      Lexicomp (a medication database).
