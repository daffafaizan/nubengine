      incubators and to maintain climate-controlled nurseries. Therefore, premature low birth
      weight infants continue to be at an increased risk of hypothermia throughout their
      hospitalizations. This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth
      weight infants randomized to receive WHO thermoregulation care (control groups) or WHO
      thermoregulation care and a plastic bag covering their torsos and lower extremities
      (intervention group) starting at one hour after birth and continued to discharge or 24 hours
      after birth, whichever occurs first. The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken
      one hour after birth, every subsequent 3-4 hours, and at discharge or 24 hours after birth
      when infants will be removed from the plastic bags. Seizures, hyperthermia, room temperature,
      and death will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With an estimated
      baseline hypothermia rate of 50% and a hypothesized 20% absolute risk reduction (40% relative
      risk reduction), a sample size of 182 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence
      interval of 95%.
