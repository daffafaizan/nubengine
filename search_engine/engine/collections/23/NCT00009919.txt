      I. Determine the clinical activity of SU5416 in patients with progressive metastatic renal
      cancer failing prior biologic therapy or fluorouracil-containing regimens.

      II. Determine the changes in tumor perfusion in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the time to progression and survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      complete response (CR) receive an additional 6 months of therapy after achieving CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
