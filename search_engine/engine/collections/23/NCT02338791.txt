      utilizing ultrasound imaging (USI). Specific aims include: 1) measurement of the distance
      between the articular surfaces at rest; 2) measurement of the distance between the articular
      surfaces during manually applied glides of those surfaces; and 3) analysis of any association
      between the amount of glide and reported joint mobility, force application, or joint
      position.

      Subjects will be recruited from a population of convenience. After consenting to participate,
      eligible subjects will complete a demographic questionnaire and pretesting of scapular and
      shoulder mobility. Two days of testing will be scheduled. On the first day, three grades of
      glenohumeral mobilization will be applied in the following directions: distraction, posterior
      and inferior. A handheld dynamometer will measure force; ultrasound imaging will record
      glenohumeral joint position. Each grade and direction will be repeated three times on the
      right and the left shoulder. On the second day, the mobilizations will be repeated.
      Measurements of humeral movement will be calculated from the ultrasound images.
