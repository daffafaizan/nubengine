      an increasing medical problem with important social and financial implications worldwide. OSA
      is a well established risk factor for systemic hypertension , myocardial infarction or
      stroke.

      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper
      airway during sleep .The obstructive apneic event is associated with considerable breathing
      efforts against a totally or partially occluded upper airway, and apnea is terminated by an
      arousal and heavy snoring as airflow is restored. Severity of OSAS is described according to
      total number of apneas and hyperpneas per hour of sleep, which is named as the apnea-hypopnea
      index (AHI).

      Cardiovascular disturbances are the most serious complications of OSAS. These complications
      include heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, nocturnal arrhythmias, stroke, systemic
      and pulmonary hypertension. All these cardiovascular complications increase morbidity and
      mortality of OSAS.

      Currently, sleep apnea is accepted as one of the identifiable causes of hypertension. Also,
      OSAS is closely associated with obesity and ageing.

      There is conclusive evidence that OSAS influences right heart function (the
      pathophysiological consequences of sleep apnea-hypopnea might result in an imbalance in
      myocardial oxygen delivery/consumption ratio, activation of sympathetic and other
      neurohormonal systems, and increased right and left ventricular after load )
