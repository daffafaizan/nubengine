    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b study to evaluate safety and
      immunogenicity of the investigational Sing2016 M2SR H3N2 influenza vaccine delivered
      intranasally to a healthy adult population age 50 to 85 years. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive one administration of Sing2016 M2SR or placebo followed by a dose
      of age-appropriate licensed inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) at least 28 days later. Two
      lead-in groups of adults ages 50-64 years (Cohort 1) and 65 - 85 years (Cohort 2) will be
      followed by enrollment of an expansion group, ages 65 - 85 (Cohort 3). Safety data will be
      reviewed between enrollment of successive cohorts.
