      available ( is demasked) in our CTG monitors. We will include all women in labour with an
      intern scalp monitoring and analyse the CTG, the lactate samples and the STAN signals in the
      same patient and

        -  Study the relationship between the decision-to-delivery interval and neonatal morbidity
           in deliveries monitored by scalp lactate measurement

        -  Compare the diagnostic capability of both methods to identify fetuses at risk of hypoxia

        -  Compare the false negative alerts from both methods

        -  Explore the temporal and quantitative relation between fetal lactate metabolism and ST
           interval changes of the fetal ECG
