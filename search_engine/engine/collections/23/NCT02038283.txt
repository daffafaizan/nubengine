      colorectal neoplasm in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different CRC screening
      strategies for the Chinese population in Hong Kong.

      The specific objectives are:

        1. To determine the HRQOL preference values of patients in different stage of colorectal
           neoplasm in order to estimate the quality of life adjustment applicable to each stage of
           colorectal neoplasm.

        2. To evaluate the HRQOL of patients with colorectal neoplasm in order to find out their
           concerns and needs.

        3. To find out whether HRQOL preference of people with colorectal neoplasm changes with
           time.

        4. To determine the expected life years gained from the reduction in the incidence and
           mortality rates of CRC for each CRC screening strategy base on literature review.

        5. To determine the QALY gained from each CRC strategy by combining the preference value
           with life years gained.

        6. To identify the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy and to determine the
           incremental cost per additional QALY gained compared to no screening, by Markov
           modelling.

      The study hypotheses are:

        1. Patients with colorectal neoplasm including those with polyps have lower HRQOL than the
           general population.

        2. There is a gradient reduction in HRQOL preference among patients with different stages
           colorectal neoplasm from polyp to metastatic cancer.

        3. HRQOL preference of patients with colorectal neoplasm is stable if there is no change in
           the disease stage.

        4. Annual I-FOBT is the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy for the Chinese
           population in Hong Kong.
