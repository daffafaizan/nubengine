      in the study. If the participant agrees to be re-contacted in the event of disease relapse or
      recurrent cancer, follow-up data will be collected at a second time point up to five years
      after enrollment. This second follow-up time point is optional.

      Participants will complete two short questionnaires and a guided survey on a laptop computer.
      AYA patients and parents will participate in an interviewer-led interview session. The
      surveys are the Herth Hope Index (HHI) to assess hope in adults in clinical settings, and the
      Decision Making Preference Questionnaire (DMPQ) to identify factors that parents believe
      influence their role in treatment decision making. The guided survey presents a hypothetical
      situation outlining different treatment options at the time of recurrent or progressive
      disease. Participants will be asked to answer questions related to type of treatment,
      location of treatment, hospital of treatment, route of treatment, symptoms or side effects
      from treatment, quality of life, frequency of clinic visits, chance of being hospitalized,
      chance of cure, and survival length of time.

      Medical data including cancer diagnosis, date of diagnosis, duration of time on treatment,
      and serious side effects and complications of treatment will be collected on AYA patients.

      Data will be analyzed by group: (1) adolescent and young adult patients, (2) parents, or (3)
      health-care providers.
