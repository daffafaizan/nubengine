      significantly improve their oxidative DNA damage repair capacity and reduce the occurrence of
      lipid peroxidation [measured as increased excretion of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine
      (8-OH-dG) and decreased excretion of urinary 8-isoprostane, respectively] through
      improvements in sleep quality (measured via actigraphy) and melatonin's direct antioxidative
      properties.
