      the respiratory tract. The world is currently experiencing COVID-19 pandemic with a
      significant portion of those infected developing severe disease manifestations including
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome with respiratory failure, and, in some cases,
      death. The clinical characteristics and spectrum of disease severity of acute COVID-19 are
      currently being defined. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, very little is known about possible
      clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute infection. In addition, the
      characteristics of the initial cellular immune and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus
      that causes COVID-19) have not been fully defined and it is not known if the immune responses
      generated by infection provides long-term protective immunity. The purpose of this study is
      to establish a longitudinal cohort that has recovered from COVID-19 and characterize the
      clinical sequelae of acute infection, characterize the immune response to the virus, and
      follow the evolution of the immune response over time and determine the extent to which
      natural immunity is protective against re-infection.
