        -  Estimate the efficacy of dolastatin 10 in patients with indolent lymphoma, Waldenstrom's
           macroglobulinemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of dolastatin 10 in this patient
           population.

        -  Investigate the mechanism of action of dolastatin 10 in regards to apoptosis and effects
           of microtubules.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease
      (chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs indolent lymphoma vs Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia).

      All patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Patients continue treatment until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's withdrawal from the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 74 patients will be accrued for this study over 15 months.
