      bleeding in patients who have low and/or dysfunctional platelets. Treatment of blood cancer
      and other blood diseases, as well as bone marrow transplantation, is not possible without
      platelet transfusion support. Unfortunately, 15- 25% of chronically transfused patients
      platelet counts will stop responding to these transfusions, putting them at risk for serious
      bleeding complications. The development of HLA antibodies is responsible for 4- 8% of this
      platelet transfusion refractoriness. The presence of HLA antibodies is a clinical
      complication that is generally managed by the selection of products that are negative for the
      antigens for which the patient has antibodies. Often, for patients with chronic and ongoing
      need, this selection is facilitated by targeted recruitment of donors with known HLA types
      (i.e., types that lack antigens cognate to the patient s known antibodies and are thus
      predicted to be compatible). However, for very broadly HLA- alloimmunized patients,
      compatible products may be exceedingly scarce or completely unavailable, precluding the
      ability to consistently provide products the patient will likely increment from. This
      research protocol is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a 4-HOUR continuous infusion of
      single donor, apheresis platelets in overcoming both alloimmune-mediated and
      non-alloimmune-mediated platelet refractoriness. We hypothesize that when we transfuse
      patients over a long duration, who have platelet refractoriness, the platelet counts will
      increase to higher numbers for an extended period of time in the peri-transfusion period when
      compared to shorter transfusion intervals.
