      procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] were included in this study. Simultaneous
      samples were taken from the central venous line, pulmonary artery, and from venous side of
      the heart lung machine. Samples were taken after 10 minutes on full CPB and at the end of
      surgery before end of CPB. Bland and Altman plots were used to study the agreement between
      venous saturations.
