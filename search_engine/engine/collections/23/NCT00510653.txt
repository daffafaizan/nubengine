      development of cancer. Before going on study, potential participants will have their tumor
      tested for c-KIT, PDGFR, and ABL for positivity. Those participants who have at least one
      positive biomarker will be eligible for treatment.

      Before treatment starts, participants will have a complete checkup, blood tests, chest x-ray,
      and heart function test. Women able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy
      test. A blood sample (3 teaspoons) will be taken once a week during treatment and at the end
      of treatment. A complete exam will also be done at the end of treatment. Tumors will be
      measured by computed tomography (CT) scan every 6 weeks while one study and at the end of
      treatment.

      Participants in this study will take Imatinib Mesylate by mouth in a single dose on a daily
      basis. Participants will be treated for 6 weeks, which is one cycle of therapy. After 6
      weeks, participants will be evaluated for side effects and tumor response. The dose may be
      decreased for the next cycle if participants side effects. Participants will be removed from
      the study if the tumor gets worse. Participants may remain on the study as long as the tumor
      has not gotten worse and there are no intolerable side effects.

      This is an investigational study. Imatinib Mesylate has been approved for chronic myelogenous
      leukemia patients. However this is an investigational study of Imatinib Mesylate in patients
      with ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. Participants may responsible for the cost of all
      or part of this drug. At least 24 and as many as 74 patients will take part in this study.
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
