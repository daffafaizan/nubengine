    
      Patients with primary knee osteoarthritis will be included in a randomized controlled trial
      and assigned to total knee arthroplasty with or without closed suction drainage. Subjects
      will be evaluated preoperatively, 1-day, 3-, 6- and 12-month postoperatively.

      Change in morphology results will be measured by comparing preoperative and postoperative
      levels of haematocrite, haemoglobin, erythrocytes, and platelets.

      Change in the number of blood transfusions will be measured by analyzing the number of needed
      transfusion of packed red blood cells in the postoperative period during stay in the
      hospital.

      Change in levels of inflammation factors will be measured by analyzing the level of
      C-reactive protein in first and third day postoperatively.

      Change in body temperature wille be measured daily by analyzing body temperature from day of
      the surgery until the day of discharge from the hospital

      Presence of haematoma will be evaluated daily in the postoperative period by clinical
      examination.

      Change in Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Score
      will be measured from baseline (can be measured anytime to a maximum of one month before
      surgery) 3,6 and 12 months post-operatively

      Change in Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Function
      Score will be measured from baseline (can be measured anytime to a maximum of one month
      before surgery) 3,6 and 12 months post-operatively

      Costs of hospitalization will be measured by comparing cost of hospitalization between two
      analyzed groups
