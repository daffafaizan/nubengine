      sequentially at escalating doses. During study treatment, subjects will receive HX009
      treatment via intravenous infusion once every 2 weeks. Dose escalation will continue until
      identification of an MTD or the maximum dose is reached. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will
      be assessed from the first dose of study treatment (Day 1) until 28 days later (Day 29).

      The study is divided into a screening period (28 days before first dose), treatment period
      (up to 24 months), and survival follow-up period. Safety will be evaluated throughout the
      study up until 90 (Â±7) days after the last dose of study treatment. Blood samples will be
      collected at regular intervals for pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity evaluation. Tumor
      evaluation (assessed by the Investigator in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors Version 1.1 [RECIST 1.1] and immune RECIST [iRECIST]) to assess efficacy will
      start from the first dose and occur every 8 weeks in the first 12 months and every 12 weeks
      in the second 12 months and during the survival follow-up period.
