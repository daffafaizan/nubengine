      treating attending physician with the plerixafor for the achievement of >6 x10^6 CD34+
      cells/kg. The patients that fail to mobilize >6 x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg will not be randomized
      and will subsequently be followed for disease progression and overall survival.. Patients
      with >6 x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg cryopreserved on study will be admitted to the hospital for
      planned ASCT. Patients will be randomly infused with either 3-4 x 10^6 CD34+ stem cells/kg or
      6-8 x10^6 CD34+ stem cells/kg on d0 per study randomization. The cell dose ranges within the
      two groups allows variability within aliquots of cells at the time of cryopreservation.
      Patients will receive standard supportive measures (including: growth factor support
      post-HDT/ASCT, antimicrobial prophylaxis, red blood cell and platelet transfusion and
      treatment for neutropenic fever) as per institutional guideline practices.
