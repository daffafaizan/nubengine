      reduced from prolonged and repeated exposure to externally applied forces. As many as 85% of
      individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report the occurrence of at least 1 PU since
      being injured. Despite the increasing attention and emphasis on prevention strategies, PUs
      still represent a major risk for morbidity in persons with SCI. Among the numerous potential
      physical risk factors identified for the development of a PU were several conditions that
      have a significant adverse influences on skin blood flow. In addition, poor glycemic control
      is a major risk factor for PU development and it impedes healing. Thus, it would appear that
      vasoactive hormones associated with carbohydrate metabolism that target the endothelium may
      play an important role in the development and formation of a PU. In persons with SCI, skin
      blood flow responses to insulin in the lower extremity were shown to be much lower than
      healthy individuals despite no clinical signs of insulin resistance. In the skin next to a
      PU, the current proposal will determine if a once-daily treatment with pioglitazone for 8
      weeks improves skin blood flow after insulin by iontophoresis.
