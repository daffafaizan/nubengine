    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved rogaratinib as a treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying rogaratinib in bladder cancer that has
      not responded to BCG and overexpresses a protein called FGFR1 or 3.

        -  Mutations in FGFR help bladder cancer grow. In metastatic cancers that express FGFR 1 or
           3, rogaratinib and other inhibitors of FGFR have shown to be an effective treatment

        -  Rogaratinib is an oral drug that inhibits FGFR

        -  To date, no therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling bladder cancer after
           BCG does not work.
