      warranting invasive physiological interrogation (in the opinion of the investigator) will
      undergo PressureWireâ„¢ assessment under 2 conditions: rest and adenosine hyperemia. The
      measurements at rest (standard Pd/Pa and Pd/Pamin) will be repeated to assess test/retest
      repeatability. Subsequent treatment decisions will be made by the operator according to the
      standard practice based on the adenosine FFR value together with all other clinical
      information.
