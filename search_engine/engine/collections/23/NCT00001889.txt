      coronary artery disease (CAD). Its accuracy has been shown to be superior to that of the
      exercise electrocardiogram and comparable to that of myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial
      contrast echocardiography (MCE) offers the potential to evaluate tissue perfusion at the
      level where oxygen transfer to the myocytes occurs. MCE can, therefore, provide information
      regarding the functional status of the myocardial microvasculature and presence of blood flow
      disparity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of MCE compared to stress
      echocardiography. We will correlate these results with findings from coronary angiography and
      compare the ability of those techniques to detect CAD.
