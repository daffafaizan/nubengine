    
      This is a non-randomized cohort study. Participants will be on a specific diet for 4 weeks
      prior to transplant and 10 days after transplant, and will then be asked to fill out several
      questionnaires during this period to see if this diet is easy and simple to follow. The
      questionnaires will be weekly while participants are outpatient and once admitted to the
      hospital, participants will need to fill it on the last day (10 days after stem cell
      infusion). Participants will also be requested to provide fecal swab samples which we will
      test for bacteria and fungi. A total of 3 samples will be taken at different time points
      during this study.
