      remifentanil without prolonging recovery times in minor laparoscopic surgery when
      administered equivalent antinociceptive doses during surgery. Intraoperative opioid
      administration for equivalent nociception-antinociception balance could be achieved via
      surgical pleth index (SPI)-guided analgesia. This study was designed to compare the efficacy
      and safety between sufentanil and remifentanil as an adjuvant of balanced anesthesia in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under SPI-guided opioid administration.
