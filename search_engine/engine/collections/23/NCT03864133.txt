      in patients undergoing cataract surgery. Routine cataract surgery without the protection of
      topical NSAIDs results in an increase of the number of patients with macular edema and
      macular thickening.

      Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection 1%/0.3%) infusion is used in patients during
      cataract surgery to decrease post-operative pain and inflammation. It is also indicated to
      maintain pupil dilation during cataract surgery.

      This study will evaluate whether treating patients with Omidria during cataract surgery will
      control post-operative pain and inflammation as well as reduce or eliminate macular edema
      without the use of adjunctive topical NSAIDs.
