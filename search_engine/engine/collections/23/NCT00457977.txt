      pneumococcal disease, a serious disease that kills more people in the United States than all
      other vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Individuals with COPD, characterized by
      breathing difficulties due to damaged and obstructed lung airways, may have an increased risk
      of developing serious complications from pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia and
      meningitis. Currently, there are two types of pneumococcal vaccines available. The
      pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (CPS) vaccine, known as Pneumovax, is typically given to
      adults 65 years of age or older and to any individuals with a serious health condition,
      including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. The diphtheria protein-conjugated
      vaccine (PCV7), known as Prevnar, is typically given to infants; however, adults who receive
      this vaccine may also have a favorable response. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      immune response to the Pneumovax and Prevnar vaccines in adults with COPD.

      This study will enroll adults with mild to moderate COPD. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the Pneumovax or Prevnar vaccine. This will involve one or two
      injections. Blood collection will occur during study visits at Months 1, 12, and 24. Study
      researchers will contact participants by telephone at Months 6 and 18 to document any
      pneumococcal infections and any additional pneumococcal vaccinations.
