      cancer (HRPC) and skeletal metastases, the efficacy of best standard of care plus Radium-223
      dichloride versus best standard of care plus placebo, with the primary efficacy endpoint
      being overall survival (OS).

      Patients were randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio (Radium-223 dichloride:Placebo). The study
      treatment consisted of 6 intravenous administrations of Radium-223 dichloride or placebo
      (saline) each separated by an interval of 4 weeks. The patient were followed until 3 years
      after first study drug administration.

      Within the U.S., the trial was conducted under an IND sponsored by Bayer HealthCare
      Pharmaceuticals.

      All patients received BSoC (Best Standard of Care).

      This study has the original PCD as 14 October 2010, when a total of 316 deaths had been
      observed; this resulted in the Independent Data Monitoring Committee's (IDMC's)
      recommendation to stop the study as the primary efficacy analysis of overall survival had
      crossed the pre-specified boundary for efficacy. Later an updated analysis of primary
      endpoint in the first addendum was done with cut-off of 15 July 2011.
