      Due to a lack of information on drug's human milk transfer, breastfeeding is sometimes
      contraindicated. Mothers are advised to either stop breastfeeding or if they don't, not to
      treat themselves. Since the fatal neonatal case with codeine during breastfeeding, analgesics
      are being reviewed. Ibuprofen seems to have the best benefit-risk ratio during the
      post-partum period. However there are no pharmacologic data about the use of ibuprofen during
      breastfeeding, after the colostrum phase.

      This study aims to determine the relative infant dose (RID) of ibuprofen in human mature
      milk. Considering the increased interest in NSAIDs in light of the codeine case, this is an
      important information. It will help health practitioners when advising and treating
      breastfeeding women.
