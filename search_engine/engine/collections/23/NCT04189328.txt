      Interdental papilla height is crucial for eliminating this black triangle.

      32 participants, 16 in two groups were assigned randomly. Microsurgical approach using
      microsurgical instruments and magnifying loupes were used for one group participants and
      similar procedure without magnifying loupes and microsurgical instruments was done in the
      other group.

      comparsion of the microsurgical outcome is done by measuring peri implant papilla gain and
      radiographic crestal bone loss will be done between the groups.
