    
      Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) is the most common gynecological operation worldwide. Some
      studies noticed about abused of opioids in postoperative care, led to a more adverse effect
      of opioids, slow recovery, prolong the length of hospitalized stay and consequently increase
      the unnecessary cost of treatment.

      Guidelines have considered using preoperative analgesics for reducing post-operative opioids
      consumption, including lidocaine infusion. With its anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperalgesia and
      analgesic properties, intravenous perioperative lidocaine infusion (IVLI) has been used for
      optimal postoperative care in different surgeries and in various procedures involving
      hysterectomy.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of bolus administration of
      intravenous lidocaine at the time of abdominal hysterectomy to decrease postoperative pain
      and reducing morphine requirements, after TAH.
