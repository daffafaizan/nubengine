    
      This is an interventional, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase I/IIa clinical
      trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of allo-APZ2-PAOD for the treatment of
      Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease patients with non-healing ulcers. The allogeneic
      investigational product allo-APZ2-PAOD contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem
      cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.

      Patients are followed up for efficacy for 12 weeks by clinical visits at the clinical trial
      sites to monitor wound healing. The wound healing process of all relevant ulcers will be
      documented by standardized photography and the quality of the wound healing process will be
      assessed.

      Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated
      with a standardized and validated questionnaire. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-PAOD
      three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 post IMP applications are included. An unblinded
      external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will continuously monitor safety
      throughout the study.
