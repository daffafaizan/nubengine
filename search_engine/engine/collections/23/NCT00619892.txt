      (2 groups), 8-week, quetiapine extended release (XR) coadministration trial. SSRI resistance
      was determined either historically or prospectively. Patients were randomized if they
      remained moderately ill (CGI-S score ≥ 4). Change in the PDSS scale total score was the
      primary efficacy outcome measure. Responders were identified as those with a ≥50 % decrease
      from their baseline PDSS score. In the early weeks of therapy, XR was flexibly and gradually
      titrated from 50 to 400 mg/day.

      Conclusions: This proof-of-concept RCT did not support the efficacy of this treatment
      strategy for SSRI-resistant PD. Quetiapine XR was generally well-tolerated. Important
      limitations were the small sample size, and the relatively low average dose of quetiapine XR
      used.
