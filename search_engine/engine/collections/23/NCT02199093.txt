    
      Apraxia is a neurological disorder characterized by a loss of ability to execute and carry
      out skilled movements and gestures despite intact motor and sensory systems, coordination and
      comprehension.

      Upper limb apraxia comprises a wide spectrum of higher motor disorders caused by acquired
      brain disease, affecting the performance of skilled movements carried out by the upper limbs.

      Few data are available on the effectiveness of interventions in this disorder and no exists
      studies that implement a mixed intervention (rehabilitative and compensatory ) of
      Occupational Therapy in these patients at home.
