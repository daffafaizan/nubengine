      designed study. The treatment period was 12 months. Eligible participants were randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment groups: abatacept fixed dose approximating 10 mg/kg (based on participant's
      body weight; 500 mg for participants weighing < 60kg; 750 mg for participants weighing 60 to
      100 kg; and 1 gram for participants weighing > 100 kg, monthly) or placebo intravenous (IV)
      infusion. All participants continued their background therapy(ies) for rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) (non-biologic or biologic disease-modifying drugs [DMARDs], or combination) throughout
      the double-blind treatment period. Double-blind study medication (abatacept or placebo) was
      administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter, for a total of 14 doses.

      All participants who completed the 12-month double-blind study period (Day 1 through Day
      365), were eligible to continue into the open-label period. All eligible participants (active
      or placebo) were re-allocated to receive abatacept at a weight-tiered dose that approximated
      10 mg/kg, based on their Day 365 body weight. Participants continued to receive infusions
      every 28 days.
