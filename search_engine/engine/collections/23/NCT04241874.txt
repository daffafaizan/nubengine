      general ICU of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, Roma, Italy.
      Patients with ARDS will be screened for eligibility. ARDS will be defined according to the
      Berlin Definition.

      Intubated patients fulfilling ARDS criteria, undergoing assisted ventilation as per clinical
      decision and exhibiting intense inspiratory effort (occlusion pressure equal or greater than
      13 cmH2O) will be enrolled.

      Patients will be placed in a 30°-45° head up position during all study phases. According to
      our institution protocol, pressure support setting will be selected by the attending
      physician to target a predefined tidal volume range of 6-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight
      (PBW) (female PBW [kg] = 45.5 + 0.91 [cm of height - 152.4]; male PBW [kg] = 50 + 0.91 [cm of
      height - 152.4]).The lowest pressure support level allowed will be 7 cmH2O, even if Vt <8
      ml/Kg PBW is not achieved.

      In each patient, four different ventilator settings will be applied in a random order. Each
      step will last 45 minutes.
