    
      This is a biological study for adult MDS patients who undergo HSCT procedure.The research is
      focused on the study of biological mechanisms of disease relapse after HSCT in MDS to provide
      the rationale to develop pre-emptive strategies in patients with high risk of transplant
      failure.

      Viable bone marrow samples will be collected and cryopreserved from MDS patients before
      transplantation and at clinical disease recurrence.

      CD34+ blast cells at disease relapse after HSCT will be compared with CD34+ cells collected
      before transplant by using Single-cell sequencing.

      To study genomic and transcriptomic changes in CD34+ blast cells at disease relapse after
      HSCT will be used TARGET-seq in parallel with unbiased whole-transcriptome analysis.
