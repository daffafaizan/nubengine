      the "Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) through the Turkish translation of the questionnaire
      and the intercultural adaptation. The Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) is a self-report
      measure of body awareness and autonomic reactivity. Its items are based on the organization
      of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), a set of neural pathways connecting the brain and
      body. These pathways send information from the body about the status of organs and tissues
      (i.e., afferent projections). Some of these incoming signals form a basis for the subjective
      awareness of the body. The ANS also carries signals that control the functions of these
      organs and tissues (i.e., efferent projections). These signals can alter the functions of the
      body, depending on internal and external needs. The study includes 175 healthy participants
      and 120 participants with anxiety. Beaton's 6-step procedure was used for translation and
      intercultural adaptation. After the steps of the procedure were completed, the questionnaire
      was finalized.
