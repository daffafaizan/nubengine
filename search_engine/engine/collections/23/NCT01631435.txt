    
      This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 6 sites) study which aims to evaluate the
      diagnostic yield and safety of the PillCam Platform with the CD capsule in subjects with
      symptoms associated with Crohn's disease. All subjects to be enrolled in this study will have
      evidence of active symptoms associated with Crohn's disease. Each subject will be required to
      follow a bowel preparation regimen and will undergo the Crohn's Disease capsule endoscopy
      procedure and thereafter the ileocolonoscopy procedure on the same day. The ileocolonoscopy
      procedure may be done the following day per physician discretion. If the ileocolonoscopy
      procedure is done within 24 hours from the CE procedure, the subject will stay on clear
      liquid diet. Observations/ assessments to be conducted in the trial detailed in the sections
