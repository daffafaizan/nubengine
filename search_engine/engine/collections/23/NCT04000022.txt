      treatment for patients with treatment-resistant depression (Mutz et al., 2019). Consequently,
      several countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the United States have
      approved rTMS as second-line treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), while others have
      included rTMS in their guidelines for good clinical practice (e.g. Finland, Germany and
      Serbia). Historically, rTMS was conceptualized as a "soft" alternative to electroconvulsive
      therapy. Therefore, most studies to date primarily recruited patients with relatively high
      degrees of treatment-resistance (> two failed treatment attempts) and there is a lack of
      trials investigating rTMS as a first or second line treatment. This finding is contrasted by
      the fact that on the most stable predictors of response to rTMS is low-treatment resistance.

      Therefore, this trial aims to compare the antidepressant efficacy of 20 pharmaco-na√Øve
      patients with 20 treatment-resistant patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. In
      this open label trial, patients will receive four weeks high-frequency left-sided theta burst
      TMS (lDLFPC). The target will be located by neuronavigation to the target ascertained by Fox
      et al.
