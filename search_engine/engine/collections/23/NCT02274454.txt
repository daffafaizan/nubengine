      during labor augmentation is related to myometrial OTR desensitization to oxytocin. Calcium
      is an important messenger required within the uterine muscle cell to result in muscle
      contraction following administration of oxytocin. A physiological level of calcium is known
      to provide optimal contractility to normal myometrium.

      Characterization of the importance of low, normal or high calcium levels in a setting of
      prolonged exogenous oxytocin administration may provide guidance for the use of exogenous
      calcium as a uterotonic adjunct; or for the optimization of serum calcium levels during
      augmented labor. In the clinical setting of failed labor augmentation and OTR
      desensitization, the role of serum calcium levels is not currently known.

      The investigators' previously validated in-vitro model provides a solid foundation for the
      study of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions, without any confounders that
      could be encountered in clinical settings.

      The results of this study will provide insight into the effect of low, normal or high calcium
      levels on the oxytocin pretreated (desensitized) and non-pretreated myometrium. Based on
      oxytocin dose-response curves after pretreatment to oxytocin and then subsequent exposure to
      either low, normal or high levels of calcium, the investigators will be able to determine the
      role of calcium on desensitized myometrium.
