      the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single subcutaneously injected dose of albiglutide in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with varying degrees of renal function. During Stage
      1, a single dose of albiglutide will be administered to subjects with normal renal function
      and subjects with moderate-to-severe renal impairment not requiring hemodialysis. In addition
      to subjects with normal renal function and moderate renal impairment, Stage 2 of the study
      will also include cohorts of subjects requiring hemodialysis, subjects with severe renal
      impairment not requiring hemodialysis, and potentially subjects with mild renal impairment.
