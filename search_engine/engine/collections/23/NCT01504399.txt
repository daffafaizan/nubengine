      endonasal anterior skull base surgery and pituitary surgery are not well understood. Several
      timely and controversial topics, such as the influence of endoscopic techniques and the
      impact of underlying disease on nasal outcomes are in need of further study.

      The Anterior Skull Base (ASK) Nasal survey is a 24-item questionnaire designed to assess for
      common postoperative nasal complaints, such as crusting, nasal congestion, pain, sinusitis,
      sense of smell, and overall functioning. The survey is a brief and simple assessment that
      asks patients to score symptom severity on a five-point scale.
