      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, either the Phoxilium® - Group or
      Biphozyl® - Group. After randomization, patients receive either Phoxilium® or Biphozyl® for
      CVVH initiation and maintenance as a replacement fluid during the first 48 hours (h) of
      treatment. After the first 48h of CVVH with either Phoxilium® or Biphozyl® a cross-over
      follows, with another 48h of CVVH with the opposite replacement fluid (Phoxilium® switched to
      Biphozyl® or Biphozyl® switched to Phoxilium®). In comparison, all patients should receive
      one session of CVVH with 96h. Resulting from 48h of CVVH with Phoxilium® and 48h of CVVH with
      Biphozyl® as a replacement fluid. The order is determined by randomization.

      Anticoagulation is always delivered as pre-filter RCA with Regiocit® (Gambro Lundia AB,
      Sweden). For antagonisation of Regiocit®, a calcium solution (calcium chloride, with or
      without magnesium chloride) will be used post-filter.
