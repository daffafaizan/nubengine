    
      This study is a pilot study. The investigators will test whether donepezil has important
      effects on the arousal threshold and on the apnea hypopnea index.

      Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

      Eligible participants will undergo overnight polysomonography as described below and will
      receive either donepezil (10 mg immediately prior to sleep) or placebo (in random order)
      followed roughly 14 days later with placebo or donepezil. This aim will allow us to test the
      impact of donepezil on the apnea hypopnea index. The study plans to enroll approximately 30
      subjects.

      The change in apnea hypopnea index as well as arousal thresholds/upper airway mechanics will
      be compared in the donepezil groups with the placebo group.
