    
      Primary: (1) To estimate the immunologic effects, as assessed in the tumor & PBMC, of both
      sequential and concurrent administration of pembrolizumab to CRT. Change between pre and post
      measurements of HPV E2, E7 specific CD8+ T cells, regulatory FoxP3+ T cells (Tregs) and the
      ratio of CD8+ T cells to Tregs are the immune measurements of primary interest. (2) To
      determine the safety of concurrent chemoradiation in combination with pembrolizumab for the
      treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. Secondary: (1) To estimate rates of complete
      metabolic response on PET/CT imaging obtained 12 weeks after CRT.

      (2) To estimate rates of distant metastasis as the first site of recurrence for patients.

      (3) To estimate the influence of concurrent and consolidative MK-3475 on levels of
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a marker of immunosuppressive TGF-B.

      (4) To estimate the influence of concurrent and consolidative MK-3475 on levels of IDO, an
      enzyme that depletes tryptophan, which is essential for T-cell function.

      (5) To estimate the influence of concurrent and consolidative MK-3475 on levels of MHC class
      I (CD8+ T cell ligand) and MICA (NK ligand), as measured by MHC.

      (6) To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with locally advanced
      cervical cancer treated with sequential and concurrent administration of pembrolizumab in
      relation to CRT.

      (7) To estimate the overall survival (OS) in subjects with locally advanced cervical cancer
      treated with sequential and concurrent administration of pembrolizumab in relation to CRT.
