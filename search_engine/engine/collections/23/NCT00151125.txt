    
      This is a prospective, single center, open-label, escalating dose Phase II comparison study
      of interleukin-11 (rhIL-11, Neumega) in subjects with type 1 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD).

      The purpose is to establish the clinical safety and hemostatic efficacy of rhIL-11 in
      individuals with type 1 Von Willebrand disease.

      Study subjects will include the following subjects:

        1. age >= 18 years of age

        2. diagnosis of VWD confirmed by: 2a) at least 2 of 4 abnormal vWD-related coagulation
           tests; 2b) a past bleeding history

      A total of 10-16 subjects are anticipated to be enrolled and complete the study. The specific
      aims of the study are:

        1. to compare the hemostatic efficacy of three escalating doses of rhIL-11

        2. to determine the biologic effects of rhIL-11

        3. to determine whether DDAVP, when given after the seventh daily dose of rhIL-11, enhances
           hemostatic efficacy or rhIL-11

        4. to compare the safety of three escalating doses of rhIL-11

      Efficacy will be based on the number and percent increase of VWD-related coagulation tests
      into the normal range, or at least to 2-3 times baseline.

      Safety will be based on the number and frequency of adverse reactions, including fever,
      headache, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, fluid retention, and edema.

      The study will last up to 4 weeks per subject, and for 24 months for the entire study.
