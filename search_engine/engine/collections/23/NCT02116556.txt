    
      Design: Open multicenter comparative study. A cohort (n = 66) will receive rifaximin (1200 mg
      / d) for 90 days. Results will be compared with those of a cohort of AAH prospectively
      included in an observational study. Both groups with a uniform treatment protocol (which
      includes the administration of corticosteroids and standardized treatment for complications
      of liver failure). Patients will be monitorized until hospital discharge and a follow-up
      visit at 7, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days will be performed.

      Endpoints:

        1. Primary endpoint: Bacterial infections after 90 days.

        2. Secondary endpoints: :

      2.1. Liver function tests 2.2. Levels of endotoxemia 2.3. Complications of liver cirrhosis.
      2.4. Survival
