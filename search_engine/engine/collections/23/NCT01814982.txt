    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center
      (conducted in more than one center), and exploratory study of single and repeat, escalating,
      intravenous (injection of a substance into a vein) doses of JNJ-17299425 in participants with
      traumatic brain injury. The study consists of 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2), and each part will
      have 2 stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2). In Stage 1 of each part only standard care will be
      given, through sedation, analgesia and ventilation. If Intra cranial pressure (ICP) rises to
      greater than 20 millimeter of mercury (mmHG) after ventricular drainage, participants will
      enter Stage 2 of each part and will receive JNJ-17299425 (single dose in Part 1 and repeated
      dose in Part 2). During Part 1, safety and efficacy of JNJ-17299425 will be evaluated and
      during Part 2, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated doses
      will be evaluated. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by reduction in ICP. Blood samples
      will be collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation at pre and post administration of study
      treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
