      the US only. This protocol sought to evaluate the aberrations of common pathways for newly
      diagnosed HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer tumors and responses to ribociclib in diverse
      patient populations. This companion sample collection protocol was available for all US
      patients enrolled on CLEE011A2404 (CompLEEment-1) and did not alter the planned treatment.
      Tumor collection required for this study occurred at two time points: at baseline/screening
      and upon the development of progressive disease as shown in the protocol. Patients eligible
      for this companion study were required to sign an optional additional consent form at the
      time of enrolling into the core trial.

      After eight patients had consented and samples had been taken, it was determined that the
      companion study protocol had not been properly initiated or monitored at the sites. This was
      determined to be a significant GCP violation and the clinical team made the decision to
      terminate the trial. In addition to the GCP issues, enrollment had been closed to the core
      study so enrolling additional patients was no longer possible. The limited number of samples
      would not provide any meaningful analysis. The samples were never analyzed. The study was not
      terminated due to safety or efficacy concerns. Samples collected were either destroyed or
      will be retained for up to 15 years based upon the decision of the patient.
