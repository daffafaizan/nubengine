      monitoring of coronary patients, and this examination has already been the subject of
      multiple validation studies, including for the stratification of the prognosis of these
      patients, information that can usefully guide therapeutic choices (medical treatment,
      myocardial revascularization, ...). The arrival of new solid-state cameras has been a real
      technological leap for this examination, making it possible to significantly improve the
      quality of the images and also to drastically reduce the activities of injected
      radiopharmaceuticals and thus the exposure of patients and staff to ionizing radiation.
      Today, this reduction in the activity of injected radiopharmaceuticals is taking place in a
      growing number of nuclear medicine departments. The injected activities are reduced up to a
      third of those injected in the past (this is indeed the case in the population we propose to
      study).

      However, the value of the prognostic stratification obtained with stress myocardial perfusion
      scans recorded with low activity on semiconductor cameras is not yet known. In particular,
      the implications are unknown in terms of the risk of death of the different parameters
      studied (normal or abnormal examination, extent of myocardial ischemia and infarction
      sequelae, impact on left ventricular function in post-stress and resting states, etc.).
