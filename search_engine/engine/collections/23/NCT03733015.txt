      research, there are still few effective treatments. Since pain experience is a construct of
      the central nervous system (CNS), chronic pain has been recently thought to be a CNS
      disorder.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, non-invasive technique for
      cerebral cortex stimulation and the clinical applications of which have expanded considerably
      in recent years. Recent studies have been shown that 'classical' rTMS to different cortical
      areas temporary reduce chronic and acute pain, suggesting that rTMS may Â´have some clinical
      application in future management of chronic pain. However, new rTMS paradigms involving theta
      burst stimulation (TBS) have recently been described with the major clinical advantage to be
      much shorter than 'classical' rTMS. The investigators hypothesize that cTBS would yield
      analgesic effects similar to or, possibly, even stronger than those produced by 'classical'
      rTMS. The investigators will carry out a sham-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover
      study in healthy volunteers, to compare the analgesic effects of two rTMS protocols over
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: classical high-frequency rTMS (10 Hz), and TBS. As
      rTMS-induced analgesia may be dependent on changes in pain modulatory systems, the
      investigators will analyze the effects of the stimulation on conditioned pain modulation
      (CPM). More specifically, the investigators will compare the effects of multiple sessions of
      rTMS on the inhibition of a test experimental stimulus induced by heterotopic noxious
      stimuli, to assess possible changes in diffuse noxious inhibitory controls.
