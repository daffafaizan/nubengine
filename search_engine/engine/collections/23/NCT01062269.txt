      orange-flavored generic Questran (cholestyramine) versus orange-flavored Tang Drink Mix (a
      commercial powdered orange drink without cholestyramine) via 2 BASA scales. A second
      objective is to assess the 2 different versions of the BASA scale. One version will be
      unweighted with the score based upon the aggregate score of each acceptability component. A
      second version will be weighted based upon subjectively-reported importance of the
      acceptability components. The one main study objective or focus is to determine which version
      of a BASA scale best differentiates patient acceptability of a bile acid sequestrant
      (cholestyramine) versus a placebo control powder (containing no bile acid sequestrant)
      thereby determining which BASA scale is the best validated instrument for future studies in
      assessing and comparing patient acceptability of bile acid sequestrants.
