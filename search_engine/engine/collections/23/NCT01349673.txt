      in a Salix-sponsored budesonide rectal foam study for the treatment of UP or UPS.
      Approximately 300 participants were to be enrolled into the study and receive budesonide foam
      cyclically for 6 weeks (twice a day [BID] for 2 weeks and once daily [QD] for 4 weeks). The
      study was to continue until regulatory approval of budesonide foam occurred or the sponsor
      decided to terminate the study.
