      radiographic emphysema. Thirteen patients with an obstructive ventilatory defect without
      emphysema (OVD) and 18 normal controls were similarly studied. All subjects underwent
      spirometry followed by whole body plethysmography and He dilution volume measurements; VASB
      and VARB order was randomized.
