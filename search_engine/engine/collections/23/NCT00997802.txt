      cancers (at least 6 mm in diameter) in 1,500 subjects at increased risk of colorectal cancer
      (CRC), using optical colonoscopy as the reference standard. The primary endpoint will be
      sensitivity in the detection of colorectal polyps and cancers that are at least 6 mm in
      diameter. The secondary endpoints will include specificity and predictive values in the
      detection of colorectal polyps and cancers.

      This clinical study will also evaluate the differences of the detection accuracies between
      human readings with and without computer-aided detection (CAD) that automatically detects
      colonic lesions in CTC images and presents the detected lesions to the readers. This clinical
      study will also compare performance between radiologists and gastroenterologists in detecting
      colorectal lesions in CTC images.

      All the CTC images and their interpretations, optical colonoscopy reports and images, and
      pathology reports of resected colorectal lesion will be prospectively collected from 12
      Japanese hospitals participating in the trial. All patients' information will be completely
      anonymized at each site before any analysis of the data takes place.
