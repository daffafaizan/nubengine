      be treated with crizotinib administered orally. Crizotinib will be taken continuously until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, in continuous treatment cycles of 28 days each,
      for a maximum of 12 cycles. Clinical response will be assessed by MRI (volumetrics, primary
      objective) and audiology at the end of every 3rd cycle. Subjects with volumetric tumor
      progression will be taken off protocol. Patients who complete 12 cycles of treatment without
      disease progression, but within the following 24 weeks show subsequent disease progression
      (defined as >20% increase in target tumor volume compared to off-treatment volume), will be
      eligible for re-treatment on study for up to 48 additional weeks, provided they still meet
      study eligibility criteria.
