        -  To assess hypoxia in primary prostate tumors by magnetic resonance imaging.

        -  To correlate hypoxic score with disease aggressiveness (proliferation biomarkers'
           expression).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To correlate hypoxic score with ExoHypoxic concentration in plasma of same patient.

        -  To correlate hypoxic score with fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression.
