      tissue and serum markers of angiogenesis in patients with newly diagnosed surgically
      resectable brain tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with contrast
      in conjunction with preoperative conventional MRI scanning with contrast. Patients receive
      gadopentetate dimeglumine IV over 5 seconds prior to perfusion MRI. Gadopentetate dimeglumine
      is administered at a slower rate prior to conventional MRI. Patients undergo blood draw to
      determine urokinase type plasminogen activator levels. After completion of perfusion and
      conventional MRI scanning, brain tumor tissue samples are obtained during surgical resection
      to determine tumor grade and type and urokinase type plasminogen activator and basic
      fibroblast growth factor levels. If CSF removal is required during surgery, then CSF samples
      are collected to determine urokinase type plasminogen activator and basic fibroblast growth
      factor levels.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
