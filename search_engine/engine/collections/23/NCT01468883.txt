      receive treatment by one of two methods: (1) total mastectomy and axillary dissection; or (2)
      excisional biopsy, axillary dissection, and definitive irradiation.

      Data from single institutions and from retrospective comparisons suggest that definitive
      irradiation with cosmetically acceptable breast preservation offers survival and local
      control results equivalent to extirpative surgery. This study will test this hypothesis in a
      prospective, randomized manner. After primary therapy, subjects will be followed for: (1)
      survival; (2) sites of recurrence; (3) anatomic function; (4) complications of therapy; and
      (5) cosmesis.
