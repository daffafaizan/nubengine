    
      The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of a cetirizine 10 mg chewable
      tablet manufactured at Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (McNeil LLC) with two commercially
      marketed cetirizine 10 mg immediate release (IR) tablets (ZYRTEC®, US reference) and
      (Australian/EU reference), establish bioequivalence between the two commercial products
      (ZYRTEC®, US reference and REACTINE®, Australian/EU reference), and to evaluate the effect of
      food on bioavailability of the cetirizine 10 mg chewable tablet compared to the
      bioavailability of cetirizine 10 mg chewable tablet administrated with water only. In
      addition, subject's sensory experience and ease of swallowing of the test product will be
      assessed.
