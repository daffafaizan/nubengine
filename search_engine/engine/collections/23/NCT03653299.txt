    
      This is a clinical, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover and triple-blind study. Ten
      participants with injury history (stroke) will perform the protocol. The intervention will be
      held once a week for 4 weeks. Each week a different dose of phototherapy (Placebo, 10J, 30J
      and 50J) will be applied. The phototherapy, active or placebo, will be applied in 9 different
      points of anterior muscle of the thigh, 6 different points of posterior muscle of the thigh
      and 2 different points of the gastrocnemius muscle, bilaterally, before the tests. Only one
      investigator, that will not participat in any phase of the assessments sessions, will know
      about what program is active or placebo in phototherapy device. Randomisation will occur by a
      simple drawing of lots (A, B, C, or D) in the first visit. The phototherapy unit emitted the
      same sound regardless of the program used, active or placebo. For three-dimensional gait
      assessment and muscle activity will be used a SMART-D system 140® - BTS Engineering with six
      cameras, two Kistler force platforms Platform model 9286BA and FREEEMG® electromyography -
      BTS Engineering wireless system with four channels. In addition, the evaluation will quantify
      the static balance (force platform), the functional balance (Berg Balance Scale) and mobility
      (6 minute walk test and go upand team test).
