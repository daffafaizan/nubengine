      cancer screening programs with low-dose CT, a growing number of early-stage lung cancers were
      detected so that a large number of patients have undergone surgery.

      Although a number of radiological studies have been used morphological signs so-called
      semantic features to make a differential diagnosis, it is still hard to apply by clinician
      because pulmonary nodules especially ground-glass nodules and small size nodules have
      atypical radiology signs and have strong subjectivity from different observers. Recently,
      CT-based radiomics, extracting the quantitative high-throughput features from medical images
      and facilitating clinical decision-making system, showed a good performance to predict
      diagnosis and prognosis of diverse cancer.

      Therefore, the proposed project aims to develop and validate radiomics models based on CT
      images to identify malignant nodules and then to discriminate the different types of lung
      adenocarcinoma in patients with pulmonary nodules.
