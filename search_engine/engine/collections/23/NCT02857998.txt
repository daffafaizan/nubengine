    
      There are two stages in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion
      stage (stage 2).

      Dose-escalation stage (stage 1):

      The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add additional
      3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity) will be applied for dose
      escalation and maximum tolerated dosage determination. Approximately 27 to 42 dose limited
      toxicities evaluable patients will be enrolled. The actual number of patients depends on the
      dose limited toxicities situation as well as the maximum tolerated dosage reached at this
      stage.

      Dosing will begin at 200mg once daily. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 28 days
      of continuous dosing.

      Dose-expansion stage (stage 2):

      This phase is to further evaluate the safety, the pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of
      HMPL-523 at recommended phase 2 dosage in approximately 190 patients with relapsed or
      refractory Hematologic Malignancies.

      In this stage, approximately 190 patients with Mature B-cell Neoplasms will be enrolled with
      recommended phase 2 dosage 600milligram(mg) one a day(QD) as starting dosing. The tumor types
      of the expansion stage are restricted to Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia
      (WM)/Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma(LPL) Subjects will receive HMPL-523 with every 28-day
      treatment cycle until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity, whichever comes
      first.
