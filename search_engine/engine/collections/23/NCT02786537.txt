    
      In Phase 1 of this study, consented subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3 HCV
      treatments:

      1) Harvoni® 2)Viekira Pak™ 3)Zepatier™ (The addition of Ribavirin and the length of treatment
      will be determined by the provider). In Phase 2 of this study, consented subjects will be
      randomized to 1 of 2 FDA approved HCV treatments: 1)1) Harvoni® or 3)Zepatier™. Both Phase 1
      and Phase 2 subjects will have up to 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for HCV resistance testing
      and future biorepository testing (if subject provides additional consent). The results of
      testing will determine whether a genotype 1a subject will be provided 12 or 16 wks of
      Zepatier (if randomized to Zepatier).

      Following randomization, subjects will complete patient reported outcome questionnaires via
      electronic device or telephone. Following randomization, subjects will be asked to complete
      surveys again at Wk 4 of treatment, End of Treatment, 1 and 3 year post treatment. Subjects
      standard medical care will continue. Test results and medical records throughout treatment
      and for up to 3 years post treatment will be collected.
