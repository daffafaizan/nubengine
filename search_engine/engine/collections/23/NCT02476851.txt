      that facilitates safer blood transfer between the collection set (i.e., the diversion pouch)
      and a VacutainerÂ® for the purpose of viral testing or other testing of the whole blood. The
      POLFA needle assembly was developed as a means to reduce costs while maintaining
      functionality, quality and safety. Since the overall functionality of the POLFA needle was
      designed to be equal to the currently approved Kawasumi needle, a change to the overall
      device safety and use profile is neither anticipated nor intended.

      This trial will serve to generate data sufficient to demonstrate that blood transferred
      through the POLFA needle results in plasma hemoglobin levels below 100mg/dL.
