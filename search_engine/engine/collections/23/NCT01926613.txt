    
      This randomized controlled trial is evaluating the effectiveness of a pilot-tested,
      manualized cognitive remediation intervention entitled the "Thinking Skills for Work Program"
      by comparing it to enhanced supported employment services in clients with severe mental
      illness (SMI) who are participants in high fidelity supported employment programs at the
      Greater Mental health Center of Manchester and Thresholds, Inc., Chicago, Il, but who have
      had difficulty getting or keeping jobs. Participants are randomized to either the Thinking
      Skills for Work (cognitive remediation +supported employment; CT+SE) or enhanced supported
      employment (E-SE), with cognitive, symptom, and quality of life assessments performed at
      baseline, 3 months (following the completion of the computerized cognitive training component
      of the Thinking Skills for Work program), 12 months, and 24 months, and employment data
      gathered over the full 2-year period. For the E-SE condition, supported employment services
      are enhanced by training provided to the employment specialists regarding to recognize
      cognitive problems related to work performance, and how employment specialists can teach
      clients coping strategies for managing these problems. Primary analyses will focus on testing
      the hypotheses that the Thinking Skills for Work Program (CT+SE) leads to better cognitive
      functioning and better competitive work outcomes over the 2-year follow-up period compared to
      the E-SE program.
