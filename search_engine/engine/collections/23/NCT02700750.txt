      Spectralis OCT. Each scan is graded on a scale of 0-40, with 0 representing the lowest
      quality and 40 the best possible one. Each of the subjects will be scanned numerous times
      using this noninvasive imaging tool, while trying to get as many scans as possible of
      different quality. The differences in the parameters between the scans will then be recoded.

      Collected data will include age, sex, subjects' refractive status, visual acuity, full slit
      lamp exam and the participants' OCT characteristics and measurements.
