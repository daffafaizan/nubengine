      accelerated whole breast irradiation (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over 22 days) to a longer
      conventional schedule of whole breast irradiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 35 days)
      following breast-conserving surgery. The results reported at 5 years demonstrated equivalence
      for these two different radiation schedules for the effect of local recurrence in the breast
      and cosmetic outcome. Emerging data has suggested that accelerated or shorter radiation
      schedules may potentially be associated with an increased risk of late morbidity of the skin,
      soft tissue and the heart at 10 years and beyond. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the long term outcomes of women randomized in the trial. The outcomes evaluated will include
      cosmetic outcome and cardiac disease as a measure of late radiation morbidity and local
      breast recurrence as a measure of effectiveness.
