      cord stimulator for pain. All patient will have implantation done at University Hospital
      Newark or Newark Beth Israel. The data points that will be collected will be the patient's
      weight, BMI, and detailed questionnaires regarding disability, activity, quality of life, and
      depression. The first data set will be taken pre-operatively at the DOC, 90 Bergen Street,
      suite 8100. Those patients enrolled will have the same data taken again upon subsequent
      postoperative visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Being that spinal cord stimulation is a
      well-documented safe procedure, the investigators do not anticipate any deviation from the
      standard risks of surgery. With that being said the primary safety endpoint would be if there
      is an increased complication rate, secondary to the procedure, greater than the current
      anticipated risk rate. This is a purely observational study. Patients are not being recruited
      for an intervention but are being recruited during routine clinical practice.
