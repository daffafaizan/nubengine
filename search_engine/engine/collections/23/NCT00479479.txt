      and central nervous system development. A metabolic profile consistent with impaired
      cobalamin status is prevalent in breast-fed infants. Whether this profile reflects immature
      organ systems or cobalamin deficiency has not been clarified.

      Low levels of cobalamin, elevated levels of total homocysteine (tHcy), cystathionine and/or
      methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the blood are measures of impaired cobalamin status.

      The purpose of this randomized, controlled study is to determine if cobalamin supplementation
      may influence the metabolic profile related to cobalamin status in infants.

      Six weeks old infants will be randomly assigned to receive either an intramuscular injection
      with 400 Âµg cobalamin or no intervention. Concentrations of cobalamin and folate in serum,
      and total homocysteine (tHcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA) and cystathionine in plasma will be
      determined at inclusion and at the age of 4 months. A questionnaire on infant and maternal
      nutrition, vitamin supplementation, growth parameters, parity and maternal use of tobacco
      will be completed.
