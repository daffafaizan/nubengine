    
      The first nine patients will be sequentially treated in three cohorts of three patients, i.e.
      they will receive 3 SC injections of TG4040 on Days 1, 8 and 15, at the dose of 10e6 pfu
      (first cohort), 10e7 pfu (second cohort), or 10e8 pfu (third cohort).

      There will be a one-week safety interval between the first injection of the patients of a
      given cohort, and a two-week safety interval between the last injection of the last patient
      of a given cohort and the first injection of the first patient of the next one. There will be
      also a two-week safety observation period after the last injection of the last patient of the
      third cohort. If the dose of 10e8 pfu does not raise safety problems, then 6 patients will be
      further enrolled, without safety intervals between patients. They will receive 3 SC
      injections of TG4040 at the dose of 10e8 pfu, on Days 1, 8 and 15.

      All patients will be followed up to at least 6 months after his/her first injection. In
      addition, all patients treated at the dose of 10e8 pfu will receive a TG4040 boost injection
      6 months after the first injection, and will be followed up during an additional 6-month
      period.

      Three additional cohorts of 9 patients will receive a boost injection either at 2, 4 or 6
      months.
