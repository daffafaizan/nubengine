      data continued for three years for each enrolled subject. Potential patients were screened by
      the enrolling physician according to the detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria below.

      The specific required visits for this registry are: Enrollment, Three-month, Six month,
      One-year, Routine Follow-Ups (every subsequent 6 months), Interim follow-ups for Corox OTW
      Steroid LV lead related visits, and Out of Service visit. Data will be collected at each
      patient follow-up. The programmed pacing parameters, LV pacing impedance, and LV pacing
      threshold measurement at 0.5ms pulse width will be obtained. The programming parameters will
      be set to best suit each patient. If adequate system function, including effective CRT,
      cannot be obtained, the patient should not be selected for the registry.
