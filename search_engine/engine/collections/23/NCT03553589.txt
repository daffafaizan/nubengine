      developed world. Optimal treatment of EC depends on early diagnostics and pre-operative
      stratification to appropriately select the extent of surgery and to plan further therapeutic
      approach. Currently, invasive endometrial histology is the gold standard for diagnosis, as
      there are no valid non-invasive methods available, and patient stratification is based on
      histopathology and surgical findings. There is a great need for efficient and reliable
      screening test for asymptomatic women with high risk of EC including Lynch syndrome patients
      and tamoxifen treated patients. In addition, a prognostic test is needed to stratify
      pre-operatively EC patients with high risk of progression in need of radical surgery together
      with adjuvant chemo/ratio therapy from EC patients with good prognosis. In this project the
      investigators are addressing this lack of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
      of EC.

      Objective: the investigators aim to identify diagnostic serum metabolite and protein
      biomarker signatures for early detection of cancer in asymptomatic high-risk population and
      (secondary objective) prognostic biomarkers for selection of patients with poor prognosis.
