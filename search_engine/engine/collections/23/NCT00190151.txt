      Ciprofloxacin in Human Commensal Flora Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been a growing
      therapeutic problem since the late 1980s. Resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria can arise
      through initial selection of resistant strains in the commensal flora. The emergence of
      fluoroquinolone resistance in the commensal flora will be assessed in 48 healthy volunteers
      receiving variable doses of ciprofloxacin during 14 days. Emergence of resistance will be
      correlated to pharmacokinetic characteristics of ciprofloxacin.
