      age ~72 months. PPB occurs within the lung or between the lung and the chest wall. There are
      three primary forms of PPB called Types I, II, and III PPB. PPB is related to an underlying
      change/mutation in a gene called DICER1 which impacts gene expression and cell growth. DICER1
      mutations may also lead to the development of other tumors in children and adults.

      The International PPB/DICER1 Registry offers information based on previous data from Registry
      participants and the medical literature and collaborative efforts with international rare
      tumor groups.

      Retrospective and real-time central pathology review is encouraged. Therapy decisions remain
      at the discretion of the treating institution.

      Children with Type I PPB require surgery and sometimes chemotherapy. Therapy decisions are
      the responsibility of the treating institution. Surgical guidelines are presented. It is
      unknown whether adjuvant chemotherapy improves cure rates for Type I PPB patients.
      Chemotherapy options include a 22-week regimen: 4 courses of vincristine, actinomycin D and
      cyclophosphamide (VAC) followed by 3 courses of vincristine and actinomycin D (VA).

      Children with Types II and III PPB, require surgery, chemotherapy and sometimes radiation
      therapy. Many children with Types II or III PPB receive a single-arm multi-agent chemotherapy
      neo-adjuvant/adjuvant regimen of IVADo (ifosfamide, vincristine, actinomycin, doxorubicin)
      for 36 weeks. Second and possible 3rd look surgery may be considered for local control.
      Radiation therapy may be considered.
