      crowding or tooth malalignment. The first phase of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is
      concerned with tooth alignment and relies upon a rapid and predictable response of the
      appliance system to the forces applied by the aligning archwire. The appropriate length of
      time between orthodontic appointments, generally called the 'appointment interval', has been
      the subject of debate for many years. Doctors all have their own preferences, based either on
      what they were taught in their orthodontic specialty programs or on community norms. Little
      evidence has been presented in the orthodontic literature to support these biases. The
      appointment interval may influence tooth alignment rates and treatment time along with other
      variables, such as periodontal status. Accelerating orthodontic tooth movement can
      significantly reduce treatment duration and the risk of side-effects.
