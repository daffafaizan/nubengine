      MEDI4736 monotherapy, or SoC. Patients in all arms will continue therapy until progression.
      Tumor assessments will be performed on computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance
      imaging scans, preferably with intravenous (IV) contrast. Efficacy for all patients will be
      assessed by objective tumor assessments every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 8
      weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation due to progression or toxicity. All patients
      will be followed every 3 months for survival after progression is confirmed.
