      Tomography (EIT) measurements are performed parallel to measurements of cardiac output at
      rest, low stress generated by a dosage of 10µg dobutamine, at peak generated by a dosage
      between 20-40µg dobutamine (individually)and at relaxation(pulse <100). Therefore prior to
      the examination a rubber belt with 16 integrated electrocardiographic electrodes is placed
      around the thorax at the fifth or sixth intercostal space, connected with an EIT device. EIT
      data are generated by application of a small alternating electrical current of 5mA and 50kHz
      and are stored and analyzed offline on a personal computer. Changes due to ventilation as
      well as changes due to perfusion will be measured by EIT. Cardiac output will be
      retrospectively compared to parameters of the EIT. EIT data are stored in a database and
      pseudonymized evaluated in relationship to routinely measured stress echocardiography data.
