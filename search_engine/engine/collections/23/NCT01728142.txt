      cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Service members with TBI can experience notable
      neurological impairments-e.g., attention disturbances, memory and language deficits, and
      delayed reaction time. Cognitive performance can still be impaired 2-4 weeks after concussion
      with no overt physical symptoms. Thus, there is a critical need to have an efficient means to
      determine the incidence of cognitive deficits in service members exposed to or injured by
      blasts. To that end, this study plans to evaluate the ANAM and the DANA to determine which
      neurocognitive test more reliably and accurately detects cognitive impairments during the
      recovery period from a concussion.
