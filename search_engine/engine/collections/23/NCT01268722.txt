      has shown encouraging long-term results in the femoropopliteal artery. However, there is
      complete lack of data about performance of new-generation nitinol stents in the treatment of
      chronic total occlusions (CTO) of the Femoral artery. This is a multicenter double-arm
      randomized trial investigating plain balloon angioplasty versus primary placement of
      self-expanding nitinol stents after endovascular recanalization of femoral CTOs. Study will
      recruit up to 200 patients to be adequately powered for detection of a significant difference
      in vessel patency after 1 year.
