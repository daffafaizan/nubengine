      Twenty six child or adolescent outpatients, with age ranges from 5-17, will be randomized
      into a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel treatment study. During the 12
      weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist and assessed by an independent
      evaluator (IE). The IE will perform study assessments while remaining blind to medication
      regimens (including possible tapering) as well as any side effects. Study assessments will be
      administered at designated time points
