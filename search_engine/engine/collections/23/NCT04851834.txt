    
      Dose Exploration (Phase 1a, n~25): This part of the study will assess the safety and
      tolerability of NTX-301 and to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). It will initiate with a dose escalation using a 3+3 design.

      Combination Dose and Disease Expansion (Phase 1b-2a, n~60): The study will be expanded in
      specific subsets of patients with solid tumours and with combination therapy as follows:

        -  Arm 1 (Phase 1b, n~20): Dose Escalation, NTX-301 platinum-based doublet therapy

        -  Arm 2 (Phase 2a, n~40): Dose Expansion, NTX-301 platinum-based doublet therapy

      Patients with advanced ovarian & bladder cancer considered to be incurable by the
      investigator and for which available anti-cancer therapy has been exhausted will be enrolled
      for this component. Patients will be given NTX-301 at the MTD determined in Phase 1a. This
      will be combined with a platinum-based agent that will be administered by IV infusion.

      Optional Cohort -High-Grade Glioma Combination Dose & Disease Expansion (Phase 1b-2a, n~40)

        -  Arm 3 (Phase 1b, n~20): Dose Escalation, NTX-301 combination therapy with TMZ

        -  Arm 4 (Phase 2a, n~20): Dose Expansion, NTX-301 combination therapy with TMZ

      Patients with IDH1 mutated high-grade glioma that have commenced initial chemoradiotherapy
      with temozolomide and are yet to commence Temozolomide maintenance therapy will be enrolled
      for this component. Patients will be given NTX-301 at the MTD determined in Phase 1a. This
      will be combined with TMZ that will be administered orally.
