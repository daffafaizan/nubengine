      because their disease tends to be more aggressive and does not respond to treatment as well
      as patients without chromosome abnormalities. When researchers at the Myeloma Institute
      looked at the results of Total Therapy II, they found that although research subjects with
      chromosome abnormalities had better outcomes (how many responded, and how long they survived)
      than those treated with standard chemotherapy; still their outcomes did not improve
      significantly with Total Therapy II, when compared to Total Therapy I.

      The research in this new study is designed to target this high-risk group of individuals with
      chromosomal abnormalities. However, it is hoped that both groups of research participants -
      those with and without chromosome abnormalities - will derive benefit from changes made in
      this new research study.
