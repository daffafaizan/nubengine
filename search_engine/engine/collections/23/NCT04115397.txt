      autoantibody-positive individuals consisting in a bone-mediated induction of pain by
      autoantibodies. We hypothesize that specific targeting of this new mechanism, rather than
      using therapies developed for already established disease (where other mechanisms are
      active), will be able to treat pain with arthralgia and halt disease progression in
      seropositive at-risk individuals.

      We will address this hypothesis by repurposing of bisphosphonates, currently used in clinical
      practice in both RA patients as well as in many individuals at risk for RA (mainly women in
      post-menopausal age). We will perform a multi centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind
      and placebo-controlled study with 2 parallel groups.

      Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either one infusion aclasta (5 mg zolendronic
      acid, n=40) or placebo (n=40). The primary outcome is the VAS pain score and the study is
      powered to detect a 20% difference in the primary endpoint between the active and the control
      arm. The study is powered to detect a 20-percentage point difference in proportions between
      the control and the treated group. Subjects may withdraw from the trial at any time at their
      own or the investigators request for safety reasons.
