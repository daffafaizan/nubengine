      with Crohn's disease. One in 4 patients experiences an Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC)
      during the disease course, defined as a severe flare with systemic inflammation. ASUC is a
      medical and surgical emergency as complications and death may occur when patients do not
      respond to medical therapy and require salvage colectomy. Little is known about the
      pathophysiology and specifically the triggers of ASUC. At baseline, investigators will
      investigate the presence of a microbiome signature in patients with an ASUC compared with
      patients with a non-severe UC flare (NSUC). To identify the role of microorganisms,
      investigators will look specifically for known enteropathogens, i.e. Clostridium difficile
      and Cytomegalovirus. Investigators will investigate the impact of microbiota disruptors, such
      as antibiotics, NSAIDs and diet on microbiota and patients' outcomes. To evaluate the role of
      the host inflammatory pathways, investigators will study the colonic mucosa transcriptome and
      the host metabolome, focusing on anti-microbial defence pathways, regarding the suggested
      role of defective immune defence pathways in IBD pathogenesis. Investigators will focus on
      the IL23 and Jak pathways, since new drugs targeting these molecules are now available for
      IBD patients but still not recommended in the ASUC setting. Our last approach will be to
      evaluate the predictability of the response to therapy according to baseline and early
      changes of stool microbiome and host metabolome.
