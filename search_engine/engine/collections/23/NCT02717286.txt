      6-8 years. FPM fully erupted and with restorative treatment needed was the inclusion
      criteria. We excluded FPMs with destroyed crowns. The FPMs were randomly assigned to two
      groups: G1 (self-etching adhesive) and G2 (total-etching adhesive). Clinical evaluation was
      performed during 18 months according to the USPHS-Modified by a blinded examiner. The
      actuarial method was used to evaluate survival of the restorations and Fisher's exact test
      was used to compare differences between the groups (Î±=5%).
