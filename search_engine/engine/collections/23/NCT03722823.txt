      tucatinib in subjects with hepatic impairment. The current study will be carried out in
      subjects with hepatic impairment according to 3 different Child-Pugh (CP) categories (Mild,
      Moderate, and Severe impairment), and in matched-control healthy subjects. The minimum number
      of matched-control healthy subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure that each
      hepatically-impaired subject has a healthy match. Each matched-control healthy subject will
      be enrolled following the enrollment of a Mild and/or Moderate and/or Severe hepatic
      impairment subject and will be matched by age (+/- 10 years), by BMI (+/- 20%), and by sex to
      the enrolled hepatic impairment subject(s). Each healthy subject may be matched with up to 1
      subject within each hepatic impairment group. Based on these criteria, with 3 cohorts of 8
      hepatically-impaired subjects enrolled in the study, the number of healthy control subjects
      required to be enrolled will be at least 8 and not more than 24.
