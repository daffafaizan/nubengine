      feasibility testing with 10 youth and 10 parents) and a pilot validation phase [Phase 2:
      pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT)] using a sample of 90 African American youth
      transitioning to independent diabetes care and their parents. In this phase, families will be
      randomly assigned to one of three study arms: parent motivation for monitoring and youth
      motivation for diabetes care (arm 1), parent motivation for monitoring and youth information
      (arm 2) or parent and youth information (arm 3). In phase 1 (development), youth and their
      caregivers will complete a one-time research visit where they use the program and provide
      feedback via a semi-structured interview regarding the usefulness of the content, its
      user-friendliness and make suggestions for changes to enhance acceptability. In phase 2 (
      RCT), families will complete three intervention plus data collection visits and one
      additional data collection only visit. Research visits will be scheduled to coincide with
      appointments in the diabetes clinic to maximize convenience for families.
