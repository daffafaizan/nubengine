      the pituitary gland lies just below the optic chiasma. The visual RNFs are organized in a
      very specific way along their long course from the retina to the Lateral Geniculate Body
      (LGB) in the thalamus. Pituitary enlargement would compromise particular RNFs. It is well
      known and established that pituitary enlargement, if not properly treated in time, would
      possibly cause bitemporal hemianopia due to interference with the crossing RNFs of the nasal
      half of each retina. In this study pituitary enlargement was suspected by OCT findings while
      the patient still had perfect peripheral visual field in each eye.
