      fixed-dose combination of Quinapril 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg after an overnight
      fast of at least 10 hours. The study drug was administered as per the SAS generated
      Randomization Code, 30 minutes after serving of a high-fat high-calorie breakfast under
      supervision of a trained Medical Officer in each period.Blood samples were collected predose
      and at intervals over 72 hours after each dose. A 7-day interval was maintained between each
      dosing in the Study Periods I-IV.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, physical
      examination, medical history, clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters and urine analysis) at base line. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated and sodium & potassium levels were estimated at the 24 hours post
      dose of the last period of the study.

      A total of 40 subjects were randomized to receive fixed-dose combination of quinapril 20 mg
      and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tablets and 37 subjects completed all the four periods of the
      study.
