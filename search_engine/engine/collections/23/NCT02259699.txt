      fatality-to-case ratio of all gynecologic malignancies diagnosed in the United States.
      Arguably the most effective treatment regimen to date is provided through intraperitoneal
      (IP) chemotherapy delivery, together with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, which in the most
      recent phase III randomized trial conferred the longest median survival (65.6 months) ever
      reported in advanced ovarian cancer, compared to 49.7 months in the IV-only treatment arm.
      However, during active treatment, patients randomized to the IP therapy group reported
      significantly worse quality of life (QOL), and more treatment-related toxicities. In short,
      women are less likely to die if they receive an IP component to their chemotherapy, a finding
      that was underscored by an NCI Clinical Alert. However, there may be greater toxicity with IP
      treatment. The tradeoff between short-term reduced QOL and longer survival is difficult for
      patients to understand and then incorporate meaningfully into their decision-making process.
      In fact, for reasons that are not entirely clear, many patients are not offered IP therapy.
      Patient-centered care requires that they be given the opportunity to participate in treatment
      decision-making.
