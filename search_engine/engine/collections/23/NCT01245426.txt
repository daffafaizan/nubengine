    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to determine the
      efficacy of twenty-seven day- repeat inhaled doses of GW870086X on FEV1. GW870086X is a novel
      inhaled corticosteroid with potent glucocorticoid activity currently in development by
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as an inhaled treatment of persistent asthma. Initially, subjects will
      be randomised to receive placebo, 2mg or 4mg GW870086X once daily. An interim analysis will
      be performed on the primary endpoint to potentially adapt the study design after
      approximately 45 subjects have completed dosing. Based on the results of the interim
      analysis, the trial may continue to completion using the original doses or an adaptation to
      the doses could be made. Either the 1mg GW870086X once daily arm or 3mg GW870086X once daily
      arm may be added, or the trial could be terminated early. After screening there will be a 4
      week run in period prior to start of treatment and after will be a follow up period 1-2 weeks
      after last dose. Approximately 120 subjects will complete the study. Key safety assessments
      include; clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and collection of adverse events (AE's).
