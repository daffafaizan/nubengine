      children in the US and is rising worldwide. While the true prevalence and incidence are not
      known, estimates have placed prevalence in the US as high as 7 million children. The
      prevalence varies greatly across race and ethnic groups with Hispanic, Asian and White
      children having increased rates compared to African American children. Lifestyle changes are
      the first line treatment, but many children fail to respond to these. Pharmaceutical
      treatments are needed for children that cure NAFLD and ideally also benefit the systemic
      features (dyslipidemia, insulin sensitivity, BMI). Gemcabene calcium (Gemcabene) is a
      promising therapeutic that may benefit pediatric NAFLD and early phase trials are needed to
      support further development for this indication. It has several mechanisms of action
      including enhancing the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and blocking the
      production of hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis. Gemcabene was previously tested
      in adults for treatment of dyslipidemia and has extensive safety data.

      In this study, 40 children ages 12-17 years with histologically confirmed NAFLD or MRI based
      diagnosis and elevated ALT will receive 300 mg of gemcabene per day for 12 weeks. Study
      visits will occur at screening, baseline, week 2, week 6 and week 12. A follow up phone call
      will occur one month after the child stops taking the study medication.
