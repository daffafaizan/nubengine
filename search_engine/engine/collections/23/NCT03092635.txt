      determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers
      helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to see if certain drug (OPC) has an effect on the AGE levels in your
      blood and to see if those AGE levels have an effect on your cancer.
