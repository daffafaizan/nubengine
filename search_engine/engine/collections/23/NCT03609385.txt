      stroke (depending on the assay used). Elevated troponin indicates increased mortality in
      stroke patients. There is currently little evidence regarding the ideal care of these
      patients. The investigators know from previous studies that approximately 25% of acute stroke
      patients with elevated levels of cardiac troponin have culprit lesions on coronary angiogram.

      The primary goal of the PRAISE study is to develop a diagnostic algorithm that allows the
      prediction of acute coronary syndrome in stroke patients. To achieve this, clinical symptoms,
      troponin levels as well as findings on EKG, echocardiography and coronary angiography will be
      systematically evaluated. The PRAISE study is a multicenter study with more than 20 sites in
      Germany. Joint funding will be provided by DZHK (German center of cardiovascular research)
      und DZNE (German center of neurodegenerative diseases). Acute ischaemic stroke patients with
      elevated troponin are eligible for participation in the study. The primary endpoint is the
      diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome as established by an independent endpoint committee.
