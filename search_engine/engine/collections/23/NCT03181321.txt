      cross-over treatment design to determine the efficacy of The First Twenty (TF20), a wellness
      program focused on nutrition and fitness for firefighters. Modifications to the existing TF20
      will be made to enhance the health coaching features and include tools for program
      evaluation. Study outcomes (changes in weight, BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference,
      dietary intakes, blood pressure, and fitness activities) will be assessed pre- and
      post-intervention.

      This will be the first internet-based, occupationally tailored health and wellness program
      implemented for the volunteer fire service. TF20 will be an essential cost effective tool to
      address the epidemic of unhealthy body composition, nutrition and fitness among firefighters.
