      to be developed in the last three decades. Although it is predominantly bacteriostatic,
      linezolid has good in vitro and in vivo activity against MRSA . However, several studies did
      not show that linezolid was superior to any of glycopeptides in treatment of MRSA pneumonia.
      Moreover, combination therapy against MRSA is argued when several in vitro and in vivo
      studies showed synergy between linezolid and carbapenem or fosfomycin or rifampicin, while
      vancomycin and linezolid in combination should be avoided. our study is aim to investigate
      the activity of linezolid, alone and in combination with carbapenem against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
      patients.
