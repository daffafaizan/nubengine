      eligibility (screening period) of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1
      cycle (28 days) of study treatment, and an End of Treatment (EOT) visit at least 30 days (or
      until the participant receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier) following
      the last administration of study treatment. Study treatment may continue until precluded by
      unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or upon participant's request.
