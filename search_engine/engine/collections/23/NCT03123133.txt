      several clinical centers will provide controlled, de-identified blood samples and associated
      clinical information to DxTerity Diagnostics (DxTerity). Variations in dose and frequency of
      delivery in TBI protocols are expected between the clinical centers and this has been
      accounted for in the study design. Samples from up to 200 participants will be collected via
      this protocol. Blood samples for this study will be collected from radiation therapy patients
      receiving TBI as part of a therapeutic regimen from the site.

      Blood samples (up to 4 mL per time point) may be obtained at the time of routine blood
      collection; participation in this biomarker study will not affect any aspect of patient
      treatment. Study samples will be obtained prior to, during, and post-radiation treatment
      regimen. Associated clinical information will be collected from the subject's medical record,
      as well.
