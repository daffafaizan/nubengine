    
      This is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel group study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of SST-0225 for the
      treatment of pain associated with DOMS. Healthy volunteers will be recruited to undergo an
      exercise regimen designed to induce DOMS in the elbow flexor of the non-dominant arm.
      Subjects who are eligible following the exercise regimen will be randomized to receive
      treatment with SST-0225 or placebo for a 48 hour period. Subjects will be housed in the
      clinic for the first 24 hours of dosing and sent home for the second 24 hour dosing period.
      Arm pain/soreness will be assessed throughout the study using an 11-point (0-10) Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS).

      Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to SST-0225 or placebo at up to
      three study centers in the US. Subject participation will be between 12 and 26 days depending
      on the length of the initial screening period. Once a subject is randomized the duration of
      participation will be 10 days. The expected duration of the study is approximately six months
      depending on enrollment. The sample size may be increased to a maximum of 250 based on the
      results of the planned interim analysis described in Section 15.2 of the protocol.
