      acid)-controlled, blinded platform trial. Eligible participants will be enrolled and
      randomized to Hydrocychloroquine (HCQ) + placebo (folic acid), HCQ + azithromycin,
      lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) or placebo (ascorbic acid + folic acid). Initially, this study
      will enroll up to 495 eligible adults ( with high risk for Lower respiratory tract infection
      (LRTI) progression at baseline who are PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (165 per arm). An
      additional cohort of 135 eligible adults without risk factors for LRTI progression at
      baseline who are PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will be enrolled for the co-primary
      virologic outcome. During the 28 study days, participants will take the medication, complete
      surveys, collect mid nasal swab for viral quantification, and assess symptoms for progression
      to LRTI. Additional arms will be added should new potential agents be discovered or
      combination treatments be proposed. In addition, arms may be dropped prior to completion if
      deemed futile or if there is a safety signal.
