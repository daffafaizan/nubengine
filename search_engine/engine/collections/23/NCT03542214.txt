      in the study and the time for inclusion of patients is estimated to be 1-2 years. All
      patients will have been offered the standard of care and all available alternatives before
      entering the protocol. Calcium electroporation will not be compared to other means of
      treatment.

      All patients will be treated once, but in case of residual tumor tissue at follow-up, and if
      the investigator considers it safe, they will be offered re-treatment. A maximum of 3
      treatments per patient will be conducted with an interval of minimum 4 weeks. The patients
      will be followed with regular examinations for 12 months, starting from first treatment day.
