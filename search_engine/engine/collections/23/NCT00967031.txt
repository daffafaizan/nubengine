      Primary

        -  To assess the objective response rate by volumetric analysis of brain metastasis as
           assessed by MRI in patients with HER2-positive stage IV breast cancer treated with
           lapatinib ditosylate and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  To document any toxicity evaluated by NCI CTC v3.0.

        -  To assess the time to radiotherapy.

        -  To document the time to disease progression in the central nervous system (CNS) of these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the overall response rate for extra-CNS disease.

        -  To assess the clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, and stable disease
           for â‰¥ 6 months) for both CNS and extra-CNS disease in these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To evaluate serum proteomics and metabonomics markers as predictors of response.

        -  To evaluate the predictive value of circulating tumor cells (CTC) on response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily. Patients also receive oral
      capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
