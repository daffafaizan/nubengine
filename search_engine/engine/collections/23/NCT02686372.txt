      infection (HBsAg+) post liver transplantation. For patients who successfully match TCR
      histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) restriction, escalating doses of HBV/TCR expressing
      autologous T cells will be infused. Tests will be done to confirmed safety and efficacy
      during the two-month treatment and observation period and twice each year of a follow up
      period up to five years.
