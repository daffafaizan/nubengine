    
      Upon enrollment, a form containing demographic and injury-related information will be
      completed, and the subjects will fill out the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand
      (DASH) questionnaire. Subjects will be evaluated for negative pain thoughts, pain anxiety,
      and depression. Study staff will supervise and assist with the questionnaires. Subjects will
      be evaluated at 2 and 6 months after enrollment during their routine office visits. The DASH
      questionnaire will be filled out and active wrist motion will be measured using a standard
      goniometer by a research assistant who will not be involved in the care of the patient. The
      number of physical/occupational therapy visits, additional surgeries, ease of splint
      application and use, and splint protocol compliance will be recorded.

      The investigators intend to study the effectiveness rather than the efficacy of the splint,
      which means subjects will be free at all times to pursue an alternative treatment course and
      discontinue splint wear. The investigators will use intention to treat analysis.

      Radiographs and other diagnostic studies will be obtained at the discretion of the treating
      surgeon and will not differ from routine clinical care.
