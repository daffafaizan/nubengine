    
      Phase 1A involves adapting Cleveland Clinic's assessment and treatment approach for
      somatosensory tinnitus to make it feasible for a VA population.

      Phase 1B involves screening Veterans with tinnitus to evaluate and describe the prevalence of
      somatosensory tinnitus (in Veterans with tinnitus).

      Phase 2 involves Veterans with somatosensory tinnitus receiving 3 individualized physical
      therapy sessions using the adapted approach developed during Phase 1A.

      Phase 3 will evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of the adapted treatment approach.
