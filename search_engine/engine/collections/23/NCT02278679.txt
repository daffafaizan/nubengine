      comparing responses on the digital rectal exam clinical tool (DiRECT) from both expert and
      novice clinicians, with surgical pathology reports. The second phase of validation will
      involve the participation of standardized patients, medical students and MUTA (medical
      urology teaching associate). During a standardized patient exercise focusing on digital
      rectal exam in the University of Virginia School of Medicine curriculum, 160 second-year
      medical students will be given the DiRECT to document their examination. An attending
      physician will also attend the standardized patient exercise and document their examination
      for comparison with the medical students.

      The third phase includes 8 residents and up to10 attendings in the Urology clinic, who will
      independently complete the DiRECT documenting their DRE in the course of usual care.

      Comparison of faculty and student/trainee responses in all phases will be used for validation
      of the clinical tool for further use in medical education.
