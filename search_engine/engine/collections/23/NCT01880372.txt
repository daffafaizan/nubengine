      diabetic patients. Based on animal studies, increased production of free radicals tends to
      persist even after blood glucose is tightly controlled. The rationale of using a potent
      antioxidant is based on the observation that increased oxidative stress associated with
      hyperglycemia can contribute to cellular injury leading to apoptosis; consequently, leading
      to diabetic retinopathy. Evidence from animal model showed that alpha lipoic acid (a potent
      antioxidant) was effective for decreasing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and in
      reducing free radicals.

      Therefore, we hypothesize that therapy that can exert a powerful antioxidant activity can
      provide a therapeutic modality needed to target the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.

      This study will be a 12-month pilot study demonstrating the role of alpha lipoic acid in
      patients who have moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to two groups, treatment and control groups. Patients in
      the treatment group will receive 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid daily with routine care while
      patient in control group will only follow routine care. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)and
      electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (ETDRS) will be used to measure changes in retinal
      thickness and visual acuity respectively. Blood changes in macrophage colony stimulating
      factor (M-CSF), vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF), Interferon 2 alpha, interleukin 6
      and 8 will also be evaluated and compared between the two groups. Descriptive statistics and
      intention to treat analysis will be used to compare treatment and control groups.
