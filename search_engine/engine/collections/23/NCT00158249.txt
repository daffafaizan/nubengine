      effective therapies are available. It is unclear how marijuana affects brain function after
      acute or chronic use. Knowing about the changes in brain function during marijuana dependence
      would aid in the understanding of the neurobiological basis of marijuana abuse and serve as a
      foundation for the development of new treatment medications for this disorder. New and
      improved brain imaging techniques, such as functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS), allow the viewing of these subtle, yet important, changes in brain
      function.

      Citicoline is used to treat victims of head trauma and neurodegenerative disorders. It has
      been found to be effective in reducing cocaine use and craving, and it has no known side
      effects. It has also been shown to reduce marijuana use. This is likely due to citicoline's
      ability to reduce insomnia and craving, act as a mild antidepressant, and improve cognitive
      function. How citicoline reduces drug use may be related to effects on cerebral blood flow
      and/or brain phospholipid metabolism in the reward areas of the brain.

      This study will determine whether citicoline alters marijuana use patterns, reduces craving,
      and affects brain phospholipids and metabolism in marijuana-dependent people. The outcome of
      the study could offer important insights into the pathophysiology and course of marijuana
      dependence. Furthermore, this study's outcome could potentially relate to other drug
      dependence disorders.
