      cingulate cortex (ACC) function, will be administered before and after one session of rTMS in
      all participants. The first neurocognitive session will be administered in a separate day
      from the rTMS session. The second neurocognitive session will be performed immediately after
      rTMS and in the same day. Participants will perform five tasks designed to test: error
      processing, error likelihood assessment, meta-memory, response inhibition, and affect
      recognition.

      The rTMS paradigm will consist of four short trains of magnetic pulses which include 5
      minutes of stimulation with 1Hz frequency (overall 1200 pulses in one session) with an
      intensity of 110% of each participant's motor threshold, and 2 minute intervals between the
      stimulation trains. Stimulation will be applied over the dorsal ACC (dACC) using a
      double-cone rTMS coil. dACC will be precisely targeted using neuronavigation software loaded
      a high resolution MRI of each subjects' brain.

      OCD patients will go on to receive two weeks (10 sessions) of daily rTMS treatments using the
      same protocol described above.
