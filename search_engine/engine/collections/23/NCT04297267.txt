    
      This is a prospective, open-lable phase II clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and
      safety of gemcitabine plus cisplatin as adjuvant treatment for non-pCR TNBC patients after
      standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Non-pCR TNBC patients who completed 6-8 cycles of standard
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be included in this study and receive 4 cycles of GP regimen
      chemotherapy(cisplatin 75 mg/m² d1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m² d1,8, every 3 weeks). Our
      primary endpoint is disease free survival (DFS). Secondary end points include overall
      survival (OS), recurrence free survival (RFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS)rates and
      safety.
