      immune-checkpoint inhibitor who have recurrent brain metastasis that have failed stereotactic
      radiosurgery treatment will be screened. They will sign consent and complete screening
      procedures. Each patient will be scheduled to undergo biopsy and LITT treatment. Within two
      weeks of surgery, patients will begin receiving pembrolizumab every three weeks.
      Pembrolizumab infusions will continue until brain met recurrence per RANO for Brain Mets or
      up to two years, whichever comes first. Blood samples will be collected for immune
      monitoring. Tumor tissue will be collected for immune and genomic studies. Approximately 21
      patients will be enrolled to accrue 15 evaluable subjects. Patients will be followed for
      survival data for one year or until death, whichever comes first.
