      with anemia due to end stage renal disease. Epo is used in preterm infants to treat the
      anemia of prematurity, but has not been studied using once weekly dosing. We compared
      reticulocyte responses of once weekly Epo dosing with thrice weekly dosing in preterm
      infants.

      Infants ≤1,500 grams and ≥7 days of age were randomized to once weekly Epo, 1,200
      units/kg/dose, or thrice weekly Epo, 400 units/kg/dose, subcutaneously for 4 weeks, along
      with iron and vitamin supplementation. Complete blood counts, absolute reticulocyte counts
      (ARC), transfusions, phlebotomy losses, and adverse events were recorded.
