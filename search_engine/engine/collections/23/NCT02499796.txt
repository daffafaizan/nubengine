      but their impact on respiratory mechanics and, eventually, mechanical ventilation efficacy,
      particularly in patients highly dependent from mechanical ventilation, are not
      superimposable.

      It has already been described that heated and moisture exchangers (HME), increasing dead
      space, can negatively affect ventilatory function and gas exchange, in comparison to heated
      humidifiers (HH).

      The Hygrovent Gold, mainly because of its position between the tracheostomy and the Y-piece
      of the ventilatory circuit and its structure, may lead to analogous or even worse effects,
      determining and increase in inspiratory resistances and dead space and consequently an
      increase in the work of breathing.
