      for oral administration, and is approved in the US and some other countries in a tablet form.
      A new liquid formulation of ivermectin has been developed to facilitate dosing. This is a
      single dose, randomised, crossover study in healthy adult male and female volunteers, with
      doses taken 20 minutes after a standard breakfast. Doses will separated by washout period of
      at least 14 days. Twenty-one blood samples will be taken from each volunteer over 144 hours
      in each period. Concentrations of Ivermectin in plasma will be measured using a validated
      chromatographic assay (LC-MS/MS). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and
      bioequivalence on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.
