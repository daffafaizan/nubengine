    
      Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient obesity and surgical clinics at
      Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center after they have chosen to undergo a surgical procedure.
      The groups will not be randomized. Rather, they will decide on their choice of surgery along
      with their physicians. The patients will be evaluated pre-operatively and followed
      post-operatively for 5 years.

      Initial evaluation will include a complete history and physical examination, measurement of
      calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D, and assessment of skeletal health using
      markers of bone turnover and bone mineral density.
