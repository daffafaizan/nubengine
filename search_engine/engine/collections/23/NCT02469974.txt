    
      This is a pilot, single arm, single center study with no stratification to assess the safety
      (measured by graft failure or death) and feasibility (measured by adequacy of stem cell
      collection) of combining ruxolitinib with autologous Hematopoeitic Stem Cell Transplantation
      (HSCT) in patients with advanced myelofibrosis (MF). Patients will receive a short course of
      ruxolitinib prior to and during mobilization of HSCT with Filgrastim. Conditioning for the
      autologous HSCT will consist of Bulsulfan. Post-transplant patients will receive ruxolitinib
      maintenance.
