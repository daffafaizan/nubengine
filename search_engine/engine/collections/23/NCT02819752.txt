      pembrolizumab with standard platin-based chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage IV high-
      and intermediate-risk locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (LA-SCCHN). 6-36 patients (18 HPV+ve and 18 HPV-ve) will be recruited in a standard 3+3
      dose-escalation trial design with an expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (or 200
      mg, if no DLT is defined). A pre-loading dose of 100 or 200mg (dependent on dosing level) of
      pembrolizumab will be given once the patient has completed the screening period. Patients
      will then return 2 weeks later to begin cycle 1 of a regimen of pembrolizumab 3 weekly at a
      dose of 100 or 200mg (dependent on dosing level) for a total of 7 cycles (3 during
      chemoradiotherapy and 4 after chemoradiotherapy).

      Parallel studies in HPV-ve and HPV +ve disease will be conducted (note these patients may
      have different patterns of co-morbidity and, hence, different treatment-related toxicities).
      The primary endpoint of the study will be safety and tolerability. Dose-limiting acute
      toxicity will be assessed during administration of study drug according to CTCAEv4.0. The
      maximum tolerated dose of study drug (or 200 mg in the absence of DLT) will be used in a
      subsequent randomised phase 2 study comparing standard-of-care therapy with standard-of-care
      therapy plus study drug.
