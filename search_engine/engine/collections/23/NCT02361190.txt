      lower levels of anxiety (anticipatory and situational) and greater levels of approach
      behavior in response to two distinct (social and nonsocial) anxiety challenges relative to
      men administered placebo spray.

      Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that anxiety challenge type (social versus nonsocial) will
      moderate the effects of testosterone administration on subjects' responses to challenge.

      Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that rejection sensitivity - heightened sensitivity to evaluative
      threat - will moderate the effects of drug condition on response to the two anxiety challenge
      tests.
