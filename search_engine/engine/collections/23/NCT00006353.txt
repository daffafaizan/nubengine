      overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. Compare the
      toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the progression free
      survival of these patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the quality of life in
      these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, age (under 50 vs 50 and over), WHO/ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2),
      and extent of surgical resection (biopsy only vs complete or incomplete resection). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a
      week for 6 weeks. Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I concurrently with oral
      temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Patients then receive adjuvant oral temozolomide alone on
      days 1-5 every 28 days for 6 courses beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.
      Quality of life is assessed prior to the study, at week 4 during radiotherapy, at 4 weeks
      after completion of radiotherapy, at the end of courses 3 and 6 of adjuvant chemotherapy (arm
      II), and then every 3 months until disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months
      until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 520 patients (260 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.5 years.
