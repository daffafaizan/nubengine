      I. To evaluate the impact of octreotide in reducing the incidence of grade 2 or greater
      diarrhea in men receiving cabazitaxel plus prednisone for castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC) after docetaxel therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS).

      II. Progression-free survival (PFS) (defined as the time between treatment start and the
      first date of progression as measured by objective tumor progression using the Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), pain progression or death).

      III. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate.

      IV. Objective response rate.

      V. Pain response.

      VI. Toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabazitaxel as intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour on day 1, prednisone by
      mouth (PO) every day (QD), and octreotide pamoate given as intramuscular (IM) injection on
      day 1. Patients also receive octreotide acetate as a subcutaneous (SC) injection three times
      a day (TID) on days 1-14 of course 1 only. Treatment with cabazitaxel repeats every 21 days
      and treatment with prednisone and octreotide pamoate repeats every 4 weeks for up to 10
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of
      study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months until disease
      progression, and then every 6 months thereafter.
