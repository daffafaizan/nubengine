      study. After initial screening of the subjects, they will be familiarized with Lumen and will
      learn on how to take a measure. After 2 days of using Lumen device at home for acquaintance
      and calibration, subjects will arrive to the clinic and several baseline measurements will be
      taken, including blood samples and anthropometric variables. Then, subjects will use Lumen at
      home and will take a Lumen measurement each day for a period of 12 weeks. Subjects will take
      a Lumen measurement each morning at fasted state and will get a nutritional plan according to
      their result. In addition, subjects will be guided to log in the last time they consumed a
      meal (how long they fasted for), the duration of their sleep, and if they managed to follow
      the previous day recommendations. Moreover, the Lumen application will encourage the subjects
      to take more measurement throughout the day, in particular in response to food intake as well
      as before and after workouts. Lumen coach will remotely support the subjects via Lumen's
      mobile phone application and will provide clarifications and guidelines if needed based on
      the Lumen metric. Finally, subjects will return to the clinic for their final assessment
      which would include taking blood samples and anthropometric variables again.

      The study will include 40 subjects the most with a minimal target of 30 subjects. The number
      of subjects was determined based on power analysis made according to a study evaluating HbA1c
      levels in prediabetic subjects who received low-carb diet for 12 weeks.
