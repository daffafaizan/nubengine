      age-related physiological vulnerability that is associated with an increased likelihood of
      adverse outcomes, including falls, fractures, physical disability and mortality. The
      parameters used to assess sarcopenia in clinical practice have limited use due to its cost.

      In this perspective, this study proposes the development of a tool for the diagnosis of
      having sarcopenia with good specificity and good sensitivity and of low cost and useful.

      Elderly patients (n = 403) from the Geriatrics Outpatient Clinic of Hospital das Clínicas,
      Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo will be selected. After signing the informed
      consent, sarcopenia will be assessed using the reference method (DXA) and anthropometry. The
      data obtained by the methods are treated statistically to obtain correlation and thus a new
      tool for the evaluation of sarcopenia patients in the elderly can be developed.

      This study is of clinical importance, as sarcopenia is a relevant factor and can lead to
      consequences and poor prognosis in elderly patients, and there is no low-cost method in
      clinical practice to properly assess body composition in this population.
