      21st century. Obesity has multiple deleterious effects on health, significantly increasing
      the risk of fatal and non-fatal diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Bariatric surgery
      is a well-established method for the treatment of morbid obesity and has increasingly been
      recognized as an effective, long-lasting treatment option for T2DM.

      Recently a potential, non-invasive alternative to bariatric surgery, a duodenal-jejunal
      bypass liner (EndoBarrierTM) has been introduced. It is an endoscopically implantable and
      removable device that prevents contact between partially digested nutrients and the proximal
      intestine. This device was shown to reduce body weight and to improve glycaemic control in
      subjects with diabetes. Small pilot studies suggested a change in incretin levels, similar to
      that observed after gastric surgery with an improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose
      metabolism. To better understand and characterize the hormonal and/or metabolic effects after
      the implantation and removal of the EndoBarrierTM, this monocentric, prospective, trial is
      being performed.

      The primary objective of this study is to clarify the changes in gut peptides and gut
      permeability after implantation the EndoBarrierTM in obese subjects with sub-optimally
      controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the investigators aim to determine the
      changes in body weight and measure of adiposity, the change in global cardiovascular risk
      from baseline to 12 months as well as the changes in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell
      function over time.
