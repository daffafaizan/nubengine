      stimulation for IVF. On the other hand, patients who are carriers of polymorphisms in the FSH
      and LH receptors, have shown to need higher doses of gonadotrophins for ovarian stimulation.
      The proportion of carriers has been described to be around 20% of the population.
      Nevertheless, the determination of these polymorphisms is not performed in routine practice.
      It is unknown if their presence affects to the relationship between serum AMH levels and
      ovarian response.

      This is a prospective, single center, non-interventional, cohorts study.
