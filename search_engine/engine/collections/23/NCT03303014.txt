      linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure with 5-0
      fast absorbing gut (both SOC). We will use a split wound model, where half of the wound is
      treated with 5-0 prolene and the other half is repaired with 5-0 fast absorbing gut.
      Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician observer scar
      assessment scale, a validated scar instrument (research procedure). The scar width and
      adverse events will be recorded.

      There are many options when it comes to closing a linear cutaneous wound, and an important
      consideration is choosing between non-absorbable and absorbable sutures. The overall
      aesthetic superiority between the two is not well understood. Studies to date have typically
      compared prolene (non-absorbable) and vicryl (absorbable) sutures and found no significant
      difference in cosmesis.1-4 One study found an increased pain score at 10 days with vicryl,
      but not at 6 weeks,1 while others have found no difference in pain.2-4 Another study found an
      increased number of complications with vicryl sutures, including infections and suture
      granulomas.4 This supports past observations that absorbable sutures can cause more of an
      immune response and therefore inflammation, despite the benefit of providing more prolonged
      support to wound edges compared to non-absorbable sutures.1

      There is a lack of data, though, comparing prolene to other absorbable sutures, such as fast
      absorbing gut. In the setting of blepharoplasty, a study found that a running stitch of fast
      absorbing gut with a simple interrupted stitch of prolene at each end of the incision yielded
      better cosmetic results and fewer complications than a running stitch or subcuticular stitch
      using prolene.5 More studies are therefore needed to compare the outcomes of linear closures
      using only prolene compared to only fast absorbing gut. Using only absorbable sutures has the
      potential benefit of decreasing healthcare costs by reducing the number of appointments
      needed for suture removals, and, if superior in terms of cosmesis, corrective procedures.
