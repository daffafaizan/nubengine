      estrogen-dependent disease that occurs in menstruating women of reproductive age. Although
      all major endometriosis therapies are effective for the treatment of pain, no single
      treatment is superior to others in terms of efficacy. The major drawbacks of the current
      medical therapies are severe side effects such as hot flushes and osteoporosis. The objective
      of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of asoprisnil 5, 10, and 25 mg tablets,
      compared to placebo, administered daily for 12 weeks to women with endometriosis, by
      assessing whether asoprisnil administration diminishes the pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea,
      dyspareunia, excessive bleeding, and analgesic use associated with this disease and lessens
      the subjects' perceived pain symptoms. Otherwise healthy women with surgically confirmed
      endometriosis will be enrolled.
