      supraclavicular, infraclavicular and axillary level as an alternative to general anesthesia.
      The axillary block requires more deposits to achieve a complete block. MRI investigations are
      of interest to better understand the block specific distribution of LA. With the new MRI
      Achieva 3.0T X-series (Philips Electronics, Eindhoven the Netherlands), with resolutions
      beyond 100Î¼m using 2k imaging, we expected new information also compared with the earlier
      axillary MRI publication from our department. In that former study we used a single deposit
      technique in an open 0.5 Tesla scanner. We could not in that study recognize the terminal
      nerves or determine if the LA reached the axillary plexus.

      MRI publications of the brachial plexus mostly study the shoulder region and few are
      describing the axillary region. We did not find any article describing the axillary brachial
      plexus using a 3.0 Tesla high resolution MRI.

      Ultrasound visualizes the plexus nerves in the axilla and demonstrates dynamically the spread
      of LA. This usually occurs in 2-dimensional images where the initially observed LA fades
      after some minutes. MRI provides more easy 3 - dimensional images also in oblique planes
      compared with ultrasound.

      This study was done in order to demonstrate the relevant anatomy in the volunteers and the
      spread of LA in patients. We also present the used protocols and MRI - stacks after having
      optimized the configuration of the 3.0 MRI scanner.
