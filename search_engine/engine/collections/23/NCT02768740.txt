      to be reconstituted with 2 ml of sterile water diluent. The placebo was saline serum supplied
      as 10 ml ampoules. The study drugs were administered according to two protocols. In the
      200-mg group, patients received an intravenous bolus of 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six
      hours for seven days associated with a continuous infusion of placebo for five days. In the
      300-mg group, patients received an initial bolus of 100 mg of hydrocortisone followed by a
      continuous infusion of 300 mg per day for five days associated with a bolus of placebo every
      six hours for seven days. In the two groups, hydrocortisone was stopped abruptly at the end
      of treatment. The investigators had the choice or resuming hydrocortisone at the end of the
      fifth day if deemed necessary.
