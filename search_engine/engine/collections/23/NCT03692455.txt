      patients, esophageal syndromes will be evaluated following the Montreal Consensus, where
      troublesome symptoms were defined as score â‰¥ 2 on a validated questionnaire of symptoms for
      Portuguese language along with esophageal syndromes with injury assessed through upper
      endoscopy.

      Esophageal acid exposure will be determined through 24h pH monitoring. Increased acid
      exposure will be characterized when total esophageal pH < 4 for at least 4% of its total
      monitoring time.
