      I. To estimate the safety and efficacy of sulindac and tamoxifen in patients with recurrent
      desmoid tumor (DT) and primary DT that is not readily amenable to surgery or radiation
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the tumor response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Correlate changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) signal features of the tumor with
      clinical outcome in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Correlate pathological studies of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and estrogen/progesterone
      receptor expression in the tumor with clinical outcome in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Collect information about clinical factors that make a tumor unresectable at diagnosis
      and resectable during the four courses of study treatment.

      V. Determine whether short-term endocrine toxicity is associated with treatment with this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sulindac and oral tamoxifen twice daily for up to 12 months (four
      3-month courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional month of treatment beyond documentation
      of CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 5 years.
