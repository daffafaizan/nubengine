      screening, participants will be randomized into two study arms for the fMRI phase of the
      study. In each study arm, participants will complete a placebo-controlled, within-subject,
      pharmaco-fMRI paradigm with one of two possible dosages of oxytocin (20 or 40IU) and placebo.
      In the fMRI scanner, they will complete two well-validated theory of mind tasks: the false
      belief task and the person description task. Following the fMRI phase of the study,
      participants will be randomized to receive the same dosage of oxytocin the participant
      received in the fMRI phase, or placebo, twice daily for 3 weeks. Before and after the three
      weeks of drug administration, participants will be assessed for social functioning, social
      ability, negative symptoms, and theory of mind. More participants will be randomized to
      receive chronically administered oxytocin than placebo to maximize the study's power to test
      the investigators' hypothesis that acute oxytocin-induced increases in right temporo-parietal
      junction activity will be positively correlated with improvements in social functioning
      (primary outcome), social ability, negative symptoms, and theory of mind over three weeks of
      oxytocin administration.
