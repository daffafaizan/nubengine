    
      Type of the study: Observational prospective cohort study. Hypothesis: Despite appropriate
      prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis in general ICU patients in accordance with the current
      guidelines, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis is 5 - 10%.

      Sample size: 200 consecutive general ICU patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: defined
      in the Eligibility section. Protocol description: All patients admitted to ICU with expected
      period of the stay longer than 72 hours will be evaluated for the presence of deep venous
      thrombosis by ultrasound testing during the first 48 hours of ICU stay. Thereafter, each
      participant will be examined by ultrasound testing twice a week until the discharge from ICU.
      All patients will receive deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis following the current
      guidelines. All patients with positive finding of deep venous thrombosis will be managed in
      accordance with the current guidelines.

      Ultrasound examination for deep venous thrombosis: Ultrasound compression test at the
      following locations: common femoral vein at the groin, deep femoral vein, popliteal vein,
