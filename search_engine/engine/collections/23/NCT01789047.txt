      already on amantadine but with continuing dyskinesia. Topiramate or placebo was introduced in
      blinded fashion with a gradual titration (topiramate 25-150 mg/d) over 6 weeks and then a
      maintenance period of 8 weeks. The primary outcome of interest was change from baseline to
      end of study in total Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) score using Intention to Treat
      analysis.
