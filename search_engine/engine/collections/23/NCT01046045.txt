      inhibitor and rescue immunosuppression with everolimus-based therapy would attenuate the
      renal parenchymal injury associated with long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors in renal
      transplant recipients with declining kidney function. Another objective of this study is to
      elucidate the efficacy of our approach to arrest the progression of allograft dysfunction by
      means of protocol renal allograft biopsy.
