    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of PuraPly™ AM on the management of wounds
      in real world clinical settings as it leads to an improvement in wound bed condition (i.e
      increase in healthy granulation tissue, reduction in bioburden, and reduction in amount of
      exudate).

      The RESPOND Registry is a prospective, non-interventional research initiative to collect
      information on patients who are eligible to receive PuraPly™ AM, and no interventional
      procedures will be mandated by this protocol.

      Enrolled and eligible patients will receive standard wound care clinical assessments and any
      additional care as determined by the treating wound care clinician. Although multiple wounds
      may be treated simultaneously, one wound will be identified as the target wound, and
      characteristics regarding this wound will be consistently documented.

      The case series is being undertaken to better understand PuraPly™ AM utilization and
      subsequent healing outcomes as well as to evaluate the effects of concomitant wound therapy
      on healing. Patient's participation may involve follow-up for up to 24 weeks following
      application of PuraPly™ AM.
