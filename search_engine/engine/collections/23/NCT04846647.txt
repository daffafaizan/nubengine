      bibliographical data is available in the scientific literature. Future studies will have to
      address this issue in order not to underestimate the frequency of this complication.

      In this context, investigators would like to study the incidence of inappropriate FGF23
      increase from a collection of biological samples carried out on 500 patients treated at the
      Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital for hypophosphatemia.
