      drop alone, tear drop combined with omega 3 nutritional supplement and warm compresses) for
      dry eye reporting patients against a control (saline) over a 3 month period. A relatively new
      clinical measure (osmolarity) will be performed alongside traditional tear film volume, tear
      film stability, gland integrity and ocular surface damage measures to determine how this
      influences symptomatic complaints.
