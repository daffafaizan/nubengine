    
      1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 gene-knocked out
           chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with mesothelin positive multiple
           solid tumors.

        2. To evaluate the duration and in vivo persistence of transferred CAR-T cells.

        3. To observe and measure anti-tumor responses for patients with detectable mesothelin
           positive tumor lesions.
