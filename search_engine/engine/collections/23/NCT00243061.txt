      I. To assess the objective tumor response rate of AZD2171 administered to patients with
      recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity, median survival time, 1-year survival rate, response or stable
      disease duration, time to disease progression and clinical benefit response of AZD2171
      administered to patients with recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma.

      III. To measure baseline and post-treatment levels of angiogenic growth factors and
      receptors, as well as circulating endothelial cells, and to explore the relationship between
      these potential correlative endpoints and clinical outcome.

      IV. To assess changes in blood flow and vessel permeability using dynamic contrast-enhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) pre- and post-treatment, and to explore the relationship
      between these potential imaging endpoints and clinical outcome.

      V. To look for polymorphisms of kdr/flk-1, and other genes in this pathway, by performing
      pharmacogenetic analysis of pbmc's, and correlate genotype with VEGF levels and response to
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.
