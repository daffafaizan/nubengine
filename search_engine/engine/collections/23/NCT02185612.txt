      against wait-listed control subjects. The program provides low-wage workers with incentives
      and rewards for savings. The program involves a web-based platform that permits eligible
      savers to create a centralized savings account, which is a secure online account without
      fees. The account offers eligible savers small monetary rewards for dollars saved each month.
      The investigators plan to conduct a baseline online month 0 survey and a follow-up 6 month
      and 12 month online survey among participants and wait-listed nonparticipants, with telephone
      follow-up to maximize 6- and 12-month survey completion. The surveys consist of
      previously-validated instruments to assess key health behaviors self-reported well-being, and
      require approximately 20 minutes each. The surveys includes the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor
      Surveillance System scales for assessing demographics and income, overall self-rated health,
      tobacco and alcohol use, depression and anxiety symptoms, and optimism and locus of control.
      Participants will receive prorated a gift card for each survey, to compensate participants
      for their time while avoiding a direct income effect of a cash incentive for participation.
