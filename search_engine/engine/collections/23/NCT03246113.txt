      high concentrations of CBD in patients receiving chemoradiation for GBM. This is not a
      therapeutic study for the treatment of glioblastoma. Patients will first complete a cannabis
      sampling session to assess for initial marijuana tolerability. Proceeding this, patients will
      complete 3-5 outpatient smoking sessions per week over a 6 week period. During each session,
      patients will be given 90 minutes to smoke 0.5 to 2 cannabis cigarettes. Outcome measures
      will include measures of pain, mood, nausea, quality of life, and the both the potentially
      positive and negative subjective effects of cannabis. Food intake, opioid use, and compliance
      to cannabis treatment will be investigated. It is hypothesized that concurrent use of
      cannabis with chemoradiation in the treatment of patients with GBM will be feasible, well
      tolerated and may decrease radiation-induced toxicities.
