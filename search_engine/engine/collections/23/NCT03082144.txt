      involved-field RT combined with concurrent intrathecal-MTX or intrathecal-Ara-C,
      respectively. Concomitant regimen consisted of intrathecal chemotherapy (via lumbar puncture,
      MTX 15 mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, or Ara-C 50mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, once per week, 4
      weeks in total) and RT. RT consisted of fractionated, conformal radiation given at a daily
      dose of 2 Gy. The planning volume consisted of sites of symptomatic disease, bulky disease
      observed on MRI, including the whole brain and basis cranii received 40 Gy in 20 fractions
      and/or segment of spinal canal received 40-50 Gy. The RANO proposal for response criteria of
      LM disease was used to assess the clinical response in this study.
