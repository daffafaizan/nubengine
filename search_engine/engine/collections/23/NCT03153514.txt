      it behaves like a chronic disease with minimal impact on life expectancy, in around 15-20% of
      the patients it takes a very aggressive course. Patients who experience a high grade
      transformation, i.e., Richter's transformation also have a poor prognosis. Despite the advent
      of new therapeutic agents like Bcl-2 and BTK inhibitors which are revolutionising the outlook
      for this particular patient cohort, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only
      currently available therapy with the potential to cure. The non relapse mortality associated
      with this treatment is a major deterrent for physicians and patients alike to opt this
      intervention. We propose a trial to study the use of a B-cell depleting agent, obinutuzumab
      to simultaneously reduce tumour bulk control and offer GvHD prophylaxis in the
      peri-transplant setting and thereby analyse its impact on non relapse morbidity and mortality
      as well as maximum minimum residual disease (MRD) eradication. All patients with poor risk
      CLL (current EBMT criteria) and Richter's transformation with the best possible response to
      available therapies will be considered for the trial. Due to the poor disease control
      associated with peri-transplant T-cell depletion, obinutuzumab will be used instead of T-cell
      depleting agents as GvHD prophylaxis.
