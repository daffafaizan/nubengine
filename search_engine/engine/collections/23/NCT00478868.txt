      adult patients (263 women and 224 men) in whom lumbar MRI had been prescribed for low back
      pain lasting â‰¥ 3 months. Patients' characteristics and imaging findings were assessed through
      previously validated instruments. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to
      assess the features associated with Modic changes.

      Outcome measures were: Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), life time smoking exposure, degree
      of physical activity, and image features (disk degeneration, type and extension of Modic
      changes, disk contour, annular tears, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis).
