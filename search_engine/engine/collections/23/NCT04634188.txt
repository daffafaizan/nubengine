      inflammatory markers in patients with brain tumors. Samples were collected from patients at
      Haji Adam Malik Hospital in Medan, then the patient's blood serum was taken to be checked for
      these variables. Sample collection began in March - September 2020. The sample obtained was
      35 people who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Willing to be a sample

      Samples were categorized based on demographic data (age and gender), then the samples were
      categorized based on the type of brain tumor suffered. Once categorized, the levels of
      inflammatory markers was examined. Specimens were taken from the patient's peripheral blood
      examination and analyzed in laboratorium. The results of these examinations are grouped on a
      nominal scale, and analyzed statistically.

      Based on this analysis, it will be determined whether there is a significant relationship
