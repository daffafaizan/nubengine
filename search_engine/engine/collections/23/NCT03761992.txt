      feet,etc.). .As with most supplements, GBE is neither regulated nor FDA approved.

      A technique called Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA),will be used to measure
      the small blood vessels at the back of the eye, the macula (the area of sharpest vision), and
      the optic disc (the point at which the nerve fibers from the retina enter to form the optic
      nerve, which transmits visual impulses to the brain). This technique uses a camera, capable
      of imaging the smallest vessels, so that their density (number) can be calculated by a
      computer. This is being done to determine if there is disease causing increasing loss of
      these vessels. The imaging is done by a widely used camera which does not contact the eye. It
      simply uses visible light to measure the amount of blood vessels present in a determined area
      in the back of the eye. Blood flow at the 4th finger nailfold (nailfold capillaroscopy; NFC)
      is a standard technique, especially in rheumatology, performed by using a commercially
      available light microscope which glides over the base of the fingernail and can image the
      tiny capillaries in the nailfold. These images are recorded as videos from which the blood
      flow can be analyzed by freely available software for the purpose of quantitative
      measurements (amount of blood flow and blood flow velocity).
