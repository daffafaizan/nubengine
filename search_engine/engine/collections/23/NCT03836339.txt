      epidemiological studies on the subject are available to calculate the required number of
      subjects and analyze the power of the study. Investigators planned to include 1 575 patients
      (45 patients in 35 centres) with a minimum targeted 1000 patients to be included in the 30-40
      participating centers. The study aims to assess patients characteristics (age, sex, body mass
      index, type of AF, Congestive Heart failure Hypertension Age Diabetes Stroke - VAscular
      disease (CHA2DS2- VAsc) Score, Hypertension Abnormal liver/renal function, Stroke history,
      Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drug/alcohol usage (HAS-BLED)
      score), methods of diagnostic (blood tests, ECG, Imaging tests, Cardiac echography),
      treatment pattern (drugs administered in ED, drug prescribed at hospitalization discharge),
      patient pathway (orientation after ED admission, discharge, consultation planned),
      drug-related observance reported by the patient.

      Data are collected in a case report form (CRF). Source data verification is performed by
      sites investigators. A data dictionary containing detailed descriptions of each variable is
      shared with investigators. Sites monitoring is planned by a clinical research assistant for
      completing missing data.

      Statistical analysis: Data are medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous
      variables, and numbers and percentages for qualitative variables. Stratified analysis of
      subgroups (age, sex, anticoagulant treatment, examination performed â€¦) will be considered.
