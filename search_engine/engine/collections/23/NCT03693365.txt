    
      This is a prospective and observational study designed to test the accuracy of the
      non-invasive effective pulmonary blood flow measured by the capnodynamic methodology for
      detect preload-dependent patients.

      Fourty patients undergoing mechanical ventilation during surgery will be studied.
      Preload-depency (fluid responsiveness) will be tested during an increase in end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) from 5 to 10 cmH2O during one minute. Pulse pressure variation will be use as
      the reference method to detect preload-dependency. The effective pulmonary blood flow will be
      continuously recorded during the PEEP maneuver. Receiver Operator Curves will be used to
      detect fluid responsiveness taking a pulse pressure variation higher than 13%.The
      corresponding cut off value for the effective pulmonary blood flow signal will be
      determined..
