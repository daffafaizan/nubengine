      class, in the face of discomforts which are caused monthly. For this, the income index of
      this woman in the work environment tends to reduce, thus harming the development of every
      sector to which she responds. The expected effects, after the intervention, will be positive,
      favoring a considerable improvement of the symptoms reported by the women. We chose
      auriculotherapy because it is a non-medicated, noninvasive intervention that is inexpensive.
