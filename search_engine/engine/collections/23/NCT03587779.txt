      sevoflurane and desflurane. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study
      which compared the two inhaled anesthetics using patient state index. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to compare the patient state index values produced by sevoflurane and
      desflurane at equi-MAC in patients undergoing single-agent inhalation anesthesia.
