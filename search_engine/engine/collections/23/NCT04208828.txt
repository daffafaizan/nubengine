      with autoimmune findings, either on serologic testing and/or end organ anatomic and
      physiologic effects.

      The identification of patients with autoimmune gastrointestinal neuropathies (GAIN) or also
      as autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID), has led to trial with autoimmune
      therapies. Most promising therapy has been intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and this,
      usually given in 12-week courses with standard dosing, has helped a number of patient's
      refractory to other available therapies including diet, drugs, devices and enteral
      diversions/disruptions.This observational study documents clinical observations in
      consecutive patients meeting entry criteria who received IVIG.

      Patients will have their gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms documented by a standardized patient
      reported outcome (PRO) survey at baseline and use the same assessment tools after at least
      one course of IVIG therapy.
