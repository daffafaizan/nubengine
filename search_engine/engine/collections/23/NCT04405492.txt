      (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has spread globally, stressing many health
      systems especially intensive care unit (ICU) capacities thus resulting in high mortality. On
      16 March 2020, WHO Director-General called on all countries to ramp up their testing programs
      as the best way to slow the advance of the coronavirus pandemic. Although the current gold
      standard for COVID-19 diagnosis remains real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
      reaction (rRT-PCR), this technique has many shortcomings such as low sensitivity on
      nasopharyngeal swabs (70%). Multiple diagnostic test manufacturers have developed and begun
      selling rapid and easy-to-use devices. Before these tests can be recommended, they must be
      validated in the appropriate populations and settings.

      Funded by French Defense Innovation Agency (AID), ERap-CoV is a prospective clinical study
      which aims to assess clinical performances of serological and antigenic assays for the
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in comparison with current diagnostic tests on the market
      (immunological, proteomic, molecular). The ERap-CoV research will extend the clinical
      validation of the first NG-Test IgM-IgG COVID-19 point-of-care immunodiagnostic test (NG
      Biotech), which has shown excellent biological performance, compatible with the
      recommendations of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) for serological assays (sensitivity> 90%
      and specificity> 98%, 15 days after symptoms) (1). Finally, AID funding will be used to
      develop 100% French-made serological and antigenic RDTs in less than a year.
