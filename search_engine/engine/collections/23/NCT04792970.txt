      the talc instilled via tunneled pleural catheter combined with standard daily drainage group.
      Patients will complete questionnaires regarding their health. If you are randomized to the
      talc group, you will receive talc infused through the tunneled pleural catheter. If you are
      randomized to the standard daily drainage group, you will not receive any additional therapy.
      Patients will complete a drainage diary for everyday they drain fluid which will provide
      information on drainage volume, fluid color, pain, and complications. At 30 days and 90 days
      post randomization, patients will return to clinic for follow-up, at which time they will
      have a physical exam, chest x-ray, and complete questionnaires regarding their health.

      Risks/Safety Issues: Risks associated with talc include fever and pain. Less likely risks
      associated with talc include infection, dyspnea, hypoxemia, pneumonia, unilateral pulmonary
      edema, hemoptysis, pulmonary emboli, and bronchopleural fistula.
