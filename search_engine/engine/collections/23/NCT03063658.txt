      Paracetamol and non-steroid anti-inflammatory analgesics plus opioids are the mainstay
      treatment options of the moderate postoperative pain. These drugs are the most common used
      analgesics to ameliorate this type of pain and to reduce the consumption of opioids and their
      side effects.

      Ibuprofen is a well-known anti-inflammatory drug and has been used as an oral formula for a
      long time. Few studies using its new intravenous formula had been conducted to evaluate its
      effectiveness for mixed type of surgeries . However, its intravenous formula has not been
      studied for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, this study will compare the effects of
      postoperative analgesic potencies of preemptive intravenous paracetamol and ibuprofen in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
