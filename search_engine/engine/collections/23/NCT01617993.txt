      procedures. The fertilized eggs will be placed in an Eeva dish and the development of the
      embryos will be monitored by the Eeva system in a standard incubator. On day 3 of embryo
      culture, Eeva blastocyst prediction data will be printed from the system to be used to assist
      the embryologist in selecting the best embryo(s). The performance of the system will be
      summarized and the user feedback from the embryologists will be collected.
