      combination with endocrine therapy (physician's choice based on prior administered agent
      including tamoxifen, exemestane, fulvestrant, anastrozole, or letrozole).

      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression (with the exception of patients who
      develop isolated progression in the brain), unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation
      from the study treatment for any other reason.

      Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up
      period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every
      six months (Â± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product. The treatment follow-up
      period will conclude at six months after the last patient has received first treatment dose
      in the study.
