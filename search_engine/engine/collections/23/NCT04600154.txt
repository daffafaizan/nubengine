    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated randomized trial to
      evaluate the effects of MS-20 on gut microbiota and risk/severity of cachexia in patients
      receiving chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Approximately 40 subjects who meet the criteria
      will be enrolled into the study. The total of study comprises of a 28 days screening period,
      a 12-week treatment period and a 8-week follow-up period.

      Potential candidates should provide signed informed consent forms before starting any
      screening activities. MS-20 or placebo will be orally administered twice per day in treatment
      period. All medications (especially antibiotics) should be recorded and documented during the
      study period.

      The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study if any of the following conditions
      occurs:

        1. Subjects who experiences a serious adverse event (SAE) or intolerable adverse event
           (AE), or laboratory safety assessments reveal clinically significant hematological or
           biochemical changes from baseline values.

        2. The subject would like to withdraw consent and discontinue from the study at any time,
           for any reason, without any influence on further treatment. (Patients who withdraw or
           terminate early from study should proceed to EOT visit for safety evaluation.)
