        -  To test partial breast radiotherapy using intensity-modulated techniques following
           complete local tumor excision in women with low-risk, early stage breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to center (not participating in sub-studies vs
      participating in sub-studies). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo standard whole breast radiotherapy once daily on days
           1-5 (15 fractions) for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo reduced whole breast radiotherapy (15 fractions) and standard
           partial breast radiotherapy (15 fractions) once daily on days 1-5 for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo standard partial breast radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5
           (15 fractions) for 3 weeks.

      All patients complete a family history questionnaire at baseline. Patients also undergo blood
      sample collection at baseline and paraffin-embedded tissue collection at follow-up for
      molecular studies analyzing inter-patient variation by microarrays.

      Patients in centers participating in sub-studies undergo quality of life and health economic
      assessment at baseline, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5 years. These patients also undergo
      photographic assessment at baseline, 2 years, and 5 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 10 years.
