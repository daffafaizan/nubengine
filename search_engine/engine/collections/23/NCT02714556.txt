      a consequence of an increase in both cardiac output and intra-abdominal pressure. These
      alterations lead to a ventilation/perfusion mismatch which is potentiated by a decrease in
      functional residual capacity (FRC). These effects explain why pregnant women are more prone
      to the occurrence of hypoxemia, particularly in the third trimester of their pregnancy. The
      importance of the ventilation inhomogeneity can be estimated from the lung clearance index
      (LCI) measured by the non-invasive nitrogen multiple breath washout (N2 MBW) technique.
      Moreover the loss in lung volume is associated with reduction in respiratory system
      compliance, which can also be assessed non-invasively by the forced oscillation technique
      (FOT).

      To our knowledge, there is no existing data on LCI or FRC using the aforementioned techniques
      in pregnant women. Furthermore, existing data on respiratory function in pregnant women is
      largely restricted to spirometric and body plethysmographic measurements taken primarily in
      the 1970s-1980s. As such, the important roles of lung ventilation inhomogeneity as well as
      the potential changes following birth after caesarean section have yet to be completely
      characterised.
