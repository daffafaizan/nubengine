    
      This clinical trial has 3 phases: enrollment, treatment (15 hours) and follow up.

      During the enrolment phase consent and eligibility will be determined. After surgery, the
      participant will be given routine pain medication as per standard of care in the hospital.

      Treatment phase: When the participant has a functioning gastrointestinal tract after surgery,
      can tolerate medication administered orally or via a feeding tube, meets the inclusion
      criteria, and does not meet any exclusion criterion, the participant will be allocated to the
      investigational medicinal product (IMP). Evaluations will be performed over the next 15
      hours, including the assessment of the amount of pain. During this time, 2 blood samples will
      be taken for testing of the amount of tapentadol and its main metabolites in the
      participant's blood.

      A final follow-up visit is planned to take place up to 2 weeks after taking the trial
      medication.
