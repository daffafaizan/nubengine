    
      As part of the new drug approval process in Canada, AstraZeneca has committed to Health
      Canada to conduct a Drug Utilization Study among patients recently treated with CAPRELSA
      (vandetanib) and a Knowledge and Understanding Survey among the prescribing physicians to
      determine whether the product monograph, communication plan, and educational material
      developed by AstraZeneca Canada for vandetanib are adequate to provide knowledge about the
      potential risks associated with this product, and if other medications taken concomitantly
      with vandetanib are managed adequately.
