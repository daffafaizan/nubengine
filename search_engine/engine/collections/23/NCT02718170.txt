      force from either a axial load to the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joint or low energy
      fall onto an outstretched hand. Many of these fractures can be treated closed with a closed
      reduction and splinting however, some displaced or angulated fractures require open reduction
      and internal fixation. Many fixation techniques have been used, however to the investigators
      knowledge, no one has prospectively randomized patients to compare plate and screw fixation
      with buried intramedullary k-wire fixation.

      The purpose of this study is to compare Plate and screw and buried intramedullary fixation,
      using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire as the primary
      outcome measured. Secondary outcomes will include total active motion, complications, cost,
      reoperation rate.
