      increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus with ageing. Different antihypertensive
      regimens have varying effects on glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes mellitus.
      In a double-blind,randomized cross-over study we aim to compare the metabolic effects of 10
      mg amlodipine and 100 mg losartan + 5 mg amlodipine in patients with hypertension and other
      risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.

      After a 4-week open label amlodipine 5 mg run-in period, all hypertensive patient will be
      randomized to additional treatment with either amlodipine 5 mg or losartan 100 mg for 8
      weeks. At the end of this 8-week treatment-period we will do a physical examination,
      laboratory-tests, hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic glucose clamp, heart rate variability and
      baroreflex sensitivity measurements. Following this is a 4-week wash-out phase where the
      subjects continue open label 5 mg amlodipine, before crossed over to the opposite treatment
      regimen for another 8 week before the final examination.
