      Hospital (January 2017-December 2018). After agreement with parents and the local ethics
      committee, the investigators included children aged 1 to 18 years, ASA 1-2, proposed for a
      hypospadias repair. Patients were randomized to: Group D receiving 0. 15mg/kg of
      Dexamethasone IV after induction and group P receiving the same volume of saline. The
      pudendal block was performed by neurostimulation after induction with Sevoflurane and 3
      gamma/kg Fentanyl IV. The success of the block was tested at 10 and 15 minutes, it was
      declared successful when the systolic blood pressure and heart rate did not increase by more
      than 20% compared to the baseline values at the time of the incision. No analgesics were
      administered at the end of the surgery. The pain was assessed by the CHEOPS score the first
      24 hours. The X2 test was used for qualitative variables and the student test for
      quantitative variables with P<0. 05 as the significance threshold. The number of patients
      required for the study was calculated (alpha=5% beta=90%) and was 62.
