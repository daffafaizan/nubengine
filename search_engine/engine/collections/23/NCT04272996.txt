      surgical evacuation through burr holes or craniotomies. Many of these patients are elderly
      patients who are high risk surgical candidates. Unfortunately given the pathophysiology of
      SDHs there is a high rate of recurrence ranging 5-30% in the literature necessitation
      frequent imaging, increased length of hospital stay, increased morbidity, and increased rate
      of reoperations. A more novel and less invasive approach has been used to treat SDHs in this
      patient population. There are increasing reports of endovascular embolization of the middle
      meningeal artery using a less invasive endovascular approach for SDHs. The reported outcomes
      in literature have been very positive when endovascular embolization has been used without
      surgery or as an adjuvant to surgery. These reports include case series and retrospective
      reviews. There have been no studies directly comparing endovascular embolization following
      surgical evacuation to assess if this technique can actually benefit patients with chronic
      SDHs. The investigators propose to study this treatment process by randomly assigning
      patients who have undergone surgical evacuation of SDHs through burr holes into a control and
      treatment group. The control group (surgery) would only receive surgical evacuation of the
      hematoma using current standard of care. The treatment group (surgery plus) would receive
      surgical evacuation followed by endovascular embolization of the middle meningeal vessels
      using current standard of care. We will directly compare these two treatment modalities to
      obtain class I evidence on the efficacy of embolization for treatment of chronic subdural
      hematomas.
