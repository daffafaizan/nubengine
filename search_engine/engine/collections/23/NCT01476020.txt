      and in the need for repeat angioplasty of the stented lesion. However, the occurrence of late
      stent thrombosis has resulted in an increase in the duration of dual antiplatelet treatment.

      According to the guidelines of the ESC, the current recommended duration of dual antiplatelet
      treatment is 12 months.

      A relationship has been demonstrated between the occurrence of late stent thrombosis and
      aspirin resistance.

      Furthermore, dual anti-platelet treatment is associated with an increase in bleeding, the
      severity of which has been well documented. In addition, the patients involved, and
      especially those over 70, have significant co-morbidities often requiring extra-cardiac
      surgery which cannot easily be carried out in patients on dual antiplatelet treatment or
      clopidogrel.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether, after a period of 6 months following
      Drug eluting stent (DES) implantation in patients regarded as sensitive to aspirin, dual
      antiplatelet therapy may be replaced by aspirin alone.

      The original Italic Trial is a multicenter, randomized study evaluating the non-inferiority
      of aspirin as a single treatment versus dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and
      aspirin 6 months after drug-eluting stent implantation, including a 12-, 24- and 36-month
      follow-up analysis.
