      with chronic urticaria? Answering this question should help allergists treat chronic
      urticaria with a more evidence based approach. To date there has one been one prospective
      trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in hives, and although it showed a trend towards efficacy
      (0.05<p<0.10), it was not statistically significant. There have been case series, and
      anecdotal reports which seem to demonstrate efficacy of chloroquine in chronic urticaria.
      Because of these reports hydroxychloroquine is often the first medication used in patients
      with chronic hives that are refractory to standard therapy of antihistamines. We believe an
      evidence based answer to this question will be an important step towards improved treatment
      of this disease.

      We plan to ascertain the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine by completing a randomized double
      blinded placebo controlled study of treatment in patients with chronic urticaria. We will be
      measuring an Urticarial Score to evaluate hive symptoms. We will be measuring them at
      baseline, and at the end of the study to note change in drug vs placebo.
