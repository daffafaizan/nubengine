    
      The present study will be double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients
      requiring surgical treatment of peri-implantitis after non-surgical therapy will beassigned
      to either:

      Test group: submerged healing or Control group: non-submerged healing treatment of
      peri-implantitis using guided bone regeneration with a bone substitute and a resorbable
      membrane.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether submerged healing of implants
      willsignificantly improve the changes in marginal bone levels measured on X-rays 12months
      post-treatment compared to a non-submerged healing approach for the treatment of
      peri-implantitis.

      Secondary aims include changes in clinical attachment levels, changes in probing pocket
      depth, recession, keratinized tissue, occurrence of bleeding on probing, suppuration on
      probing (PUS), marginal gingival recession (REC), full mouth plaque score (FMPS), full mouth
      bleeding score (FMBS), type of peri-implant bone defect, frequency and type of complications
      and implant loss.
