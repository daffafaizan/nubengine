      Implant users who are within 6 months of expiration or beyond the end of the FDA-approved
      duration. Participants will be contacted via telephone and either scheduled to enroll in
      person or be mailed the consent form before participation in the EPIC study. After the signed
      consent form is obtained, participants will also be asked to complete a brief telephone or
      in-person questionnaire on sociodemographic, medical and reproductive history, sexual and
      contraceptive history, history of unintended pregnancy and substance abuse. During the
      informed consent process, implant users will also be offered to participate in an arm of the
      study that will randomize them (if they consent) to either keeping their subdermal implant in
      or have it removed and replaced with a new subdermal implant. The randomized control trial
      subset allows us to compare effectiveness to that of a new implant.

      It also allows us to assess "other contraceptive use" (e.g. condom use) in both groups.

      Participants will also be asked if they are interested in providing a blood sample for
      analysis of etonogestrel assay levels at baseline enrollment and annually. If Follow-up phone
      interviews will occur every 6 months for 36 months beyond the expiration of their method. The
      investigators will attempt to validate all pregnancy outcomes with medical chart reviews.
