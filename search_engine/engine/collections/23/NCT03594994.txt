      is a condition associated with both lower sleep duration and poor glucose tolerance.
      Therefore, increasing sleep duration is a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for
      improving glucose metabolism in this population. The investigators will assess this by
      determining insulin sensitivity during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp before and after a
      sleep extension intervention in both the control and sleep extension groups.
