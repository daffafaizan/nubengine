      a recruitment letter in the mail that includes a description of the study and paper survey.
      The survey will collect participant first and last name so the research team can track
      replies. Participant first and last name will not be transferred from the surveys and not
      used in data analysis. Even though it is likely that there are dermatologists with practices
      involving skin of color patients or with interest in skin of color patients who are not
      members of the Skin of Color Society, we believe that this will be a representative group of
      physicians with this interest. We do not believe we will experience significant bias.
      Duration of the subjects' involvement will be approximately 10 minutes. The total participant
      recruitment period will be approximately 8 weeks. Quantitative survey responses will be
      compiled, coded, and entered into a statistical program.
