    
      This is a prospective randomized study comparing the outcomes of patient undergoing rotator
      cuff repair with either an interpositional procedure administering demineralized bone matrix
      (DBM), or a control group without demineralized bone matrix. Patient outcomes will be
      collected and compared between the two cohorts up to a five (5) year post-operative period
      and will include a range of subjective and functional outcomes, along with radiographic
      imaging.
