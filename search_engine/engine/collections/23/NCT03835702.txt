      depressive symptoms. The participants will also be provided with some literature on sleep
      hygiene.

      SAM Clinic. The SAM is a group clinic created to address challenges in PAP management by
      promoting adherence by providing access to problem-solving of PAP therapy issues. This allows
      patients with common problems and needs to have direct access to sleep medicine providers,
      sleep nurse practitioners, sleep nurses and/or durable medical equipment (DME)
