    
      Test group and treatment: the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly divided
      into calcium dobesilate group, Xuefuzhuyu Decoction group and combination group. All
      participants were given hypoglycemic, metformin (1000 mg, bid, PO), Mecobalamin Tablets,
      nerve nutrition (0.5 mg bid, PO): treatment. Calcium dobesilate group were given
      hypoglycemic, metformin (500 mg tid, PO), to improve the circular Calcium Dobesilate Capsules
      (0.5 g bid, PO), Mecobalamin Tablets, nerve nutrition (0.5 mg bid, PO): treatment. Xuefuzhuyu
      Decoction group was given hypoglycemic, metformin (500 mg tid, PO), to improve the circular
      Xuefuzhuyu Decoction (100 ml bid, PO), Mecobalamin Tablets, nerve nutrition (0.5 mg bid, PO):
      treatment. The combined treatment group was given metformin hypoglycemic (500 mg tid, PO),
      Calcium Dobesilate Capsules, improve circulation (0.5 g bid, PO) + Xuefuzhuyu Decoction (100
      ml, bid, PO), Mecobalamin Tablets, nerve nutrition (0.5 mg bid, PO). Before treatment, three
      groups of patients with blood glucose, oxidation related indicators, retrobulbar hemodynamics
      and pulmonary function were recorded.

      Detection: continuous treatment were observed before and after treatment of the three groups
      of patients after 24 weeks of fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 hour postprandial blood glucose
      (2hPBG), body mass index (BMI), peripheral blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and related
      indexes of oxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, Gu Guang (GSH-Px),
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and pulmonary
      function, vital capacity (VC%), forced vital capacity (FVC%), one second forced expiratory
      flow (FEV1%), peak expiratory flow (PEF%), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV%), total lung
      capacity (TCL%) and a second rate (FEV1/FVC%), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon
      monoxide (DLCO%), lung volume diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO/VA%) changes of the
      central retinal artery (CRA) and posterior ciliary artery (PCA), eye movement The changes of
      blood flow velocity and resistance index (RI) of the pulse (AO) systolic and diastolic blood
      flow were recorded.
