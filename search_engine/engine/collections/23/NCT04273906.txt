      of disability worldwide. Although many mechanisms may contribute to knee pain severity, the
      patient-reported hyperalgesia can be attributed to peripheral and central sensitivity in knee
      OA. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) measurement is a simple and commonly applied method for
      measuring somatosensory function in musculoskeletal disorders, just as in knee OA. Many
      trials have shown a lower PPT value in knee OA underlining the presence of peripheral and
      central sensitivity compared to healthy controls.

      Manual therapy techniques, as a preferred treatment option, may not only alleviate pain, but
      also increase pain tolerance to locally applied mechanical pressure. Positive results of
      different manual therapy techniques on increase of PPT has been reported in knee OA.
      End-range manual therapy is an option for the decrease of sensitivity in knee OA; however,
      the effect of end-range mobilization has not been evaluated so far in knee OA.
