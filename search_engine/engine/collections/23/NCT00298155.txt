      but does not cure the disease and all patients ultimately progress if the tumor is not
      eliminated with definitive local therapy. It has been demonstrated that despite androgen
      deprivation with LHRH agonists or orchiectomy, prostate tissue and prostate cancer maintain
      levels of androgens which are more than adequate to stimulate the androgen receptor. These
      levels of androgen may continue to stimulate the receptor and allow both survival of tumor
      cells and induction of resistance by overexpression of the receptor. The presumption that
      standard androgen deprivation achieves the optimal level of androgen suppression for patients
      is based on the levels of androgen achieved with castration, which achieves relatively short
      term control of cancer in the majority of patients. The hypothesis of this study is that more
      effective suppression of the androgen axis through elimination of adrenal androgens and more
      effective suppression of conversion to dihydrotestosterone will lower intraprostatic androgen
      levels, minimizing activation of the androgen receptor and augmenting apoptosis. We propose
      to test this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized trial, administering neoadjuvant
      androgen deprivation therapy of different types prior to radical prostatectomy for patients
      with clinically localized prostate cancer for 3 months.

      Plan of therapy

      Patients with clinically localized (cT1-T2) prostate cancer, at intermediate-high risk for
      relapse who are candidates for radical prostatectomy will be treated with one of three
      regimens:

        -  Goserelin with dutasteride

        -  Goserelin with bicalutamide and dutasteride

        -  Goserelin with bicalutamide and dutasteride and ketoconazole

      Patients will undergo radical prostatectomy 3 months after initiation of treatment.

      Preoperative and intraoperative biopsies of the prostate gland will be utilized for analysis
      of prostatic hormones, gene expression and apoptosis.
