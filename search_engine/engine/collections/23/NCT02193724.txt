      be used to produce iPSCs. After RB1-deficient iPSCs are produced, their karyotype and RB1
      mutation will be confirmed and their pluripotency will be tested by studying the expression
      of pluripotent genes and proteins according to standardized guidelines established for human
      iPSCs. After validation of the RB1-deficient iPSCs, they will be differentiated in the
      laboratory into retina following established protocols.
