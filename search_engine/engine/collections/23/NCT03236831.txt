    
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether preventive measures for patients
      undergoing ventricular assist device (VAD) placement will reduce AKI occurrence, progression
      and associated complications.

      Participants will be in the study for a total of 6 days (1 day prior to the surgery and 5
      days after the surgery). The investigators will review the participant's medical record up to
      one year after surgery.

      The study investigators will access the participant's electronic medical record 24 hours
      prior to the planned VAD implantation and review the participant's medication regimen and
      provide recommendations to the participant's primary care physician in an effort to minimize
      potential risks for AKI. There will be no intervention during the operation.

      The clinical recommendations will cover the following:

        1. Avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic agents.

        2. Optimizing volume status (avoidance of volume overload or depletion)

        3. Optimizing electrolytes and acid-base status

        4. Minimizing IV contrast exposure when appropriate

        5. Treating severe anemia

        6. Optimization of hemodynamics (Mean arterial BP>65mmHg).

      The investigators plan to compare the results of this study with the historical data in the
      same patient population in the years of 7/1/2015-6/30/2017.
