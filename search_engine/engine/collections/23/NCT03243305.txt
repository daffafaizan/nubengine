      gynecological history, subjects will be screened for eligibility in order to enroll
      approximately 1349 subjects into the study. After a screening period of up to 60 days,
      enrolled women will receive study drug. Each woman will participate in the study until after
      she has completed treatment during seven study cycles. Women who have individual cycles that
      do not meet the criteria for an evaluable cycle will not have those cycles replaced by
      subsequent cycles in order to provide a total of seven evaluable cycles.
