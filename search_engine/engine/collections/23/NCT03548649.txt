      Participants will be given consent forms and explained the research before participating. The
      participants must pass the initial evaluation described below in order to go through robot
      training: (1) medical history, (2) bone density, (3) joint range of motion, ROM (4) strength
      (manual muscle test, MMT), (5) muscle tone (modified Ashworth scale, MAS).

      The training program consists of 5-min preparation, 50-min of functional activities training
      including weight shifting, sit-down, stand-up, stepping and walking, and 5-min training
      feedback. Every participant will receive at least 20 training sessions (1 hour per session,
      2-5 sessions per week) and an post-training evaluation after completion of training. The
      post-training evaluation includes the following tests: timed up-and-go test, 10-meter walk
      test, and 6-minute walk test.
