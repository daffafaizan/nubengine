      recruited into the study. These paramedics would undergo didactic and hands-on training to
      learn how to operate the U/S machine, and obtain and interpret basic U/S images. The
      paramedics will then participate in video review sessions and spend time in the emergency
      department (ED) with the U/S team to get hands-on experience with patients. In the second
      phase of the study, paramedics will be staffing ambulances or fly cars in and around the
      greater New Haven region and will respond to dyspnea calls. At each call, the paramedic will
      initially evaluate the patient clinically conducting a standard history and physical exam.
      The paramedic will then use the portable U/S machine to look for the presence of either
      unilateral or bilateral B-lines indicating possible pneumonia (in the case of unilateral
      B-lines) or pulmonary edema (in the case of bilateral B-lines). The paramedic will then
      document the presence or absence of B-lines for each lung on the prehospital study sheet. The
      paramedic will then use the U/S to evaluate for the presence of pleural effusions, lung
      sliding and pericardial effusion.
