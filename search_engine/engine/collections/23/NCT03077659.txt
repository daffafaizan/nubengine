    
      In this open-label, dose rising, Phase IIa trial with an expanded cohort at the dose of
      NanoPac® determined to have the best tolerability and safety profile, subjects with prostate
      cancer scheduled for prostatectomy will have NanoPac® injected under image guidance directly
      into the lobe of the prostate with the dominant lesion 4 weeks prior to prostatectomy. The
      study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose confirmation phase.

      In the dose escalation phase, NanoPac® concentrations of 6, 10, and 15 mg/mL in an injection
      volume of 20% of the lobe of the prostate containing the dominant lesion will be studied in
      cohorts of 3, with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration.
      Following DSMB review of the cohort data the next cohort may begin enrolling, or an
      additional 3 at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the first dose does not provide
      adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted. The dose determined to be the most
      suitable for further evaluation, defined as the highest dose with an acceptable safety and
      tolerability profile as determined by the DSMB, will enroll additional subjects to provide a
      cohort of 12 subjects at that dose level.

      Tumor volume and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) will be determined prior to NanoPac®
      injection. Pharmacokinetic samples, PSA, and ejaculate will be collected in the interval
      between injection and prostatectomy. Imaging with mpMRI will be performed prior to NanoPac®
      injection and prior to prostatectomy. Prostate and pelvic lymph nodes excised at
      prostatectomy will be evaluated.
