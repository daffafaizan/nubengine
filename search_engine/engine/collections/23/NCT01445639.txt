      blinded clinical trial. The study compares dexmedetomidine versus normal saline (placebo) in
      patients after intracranial surgery with delayed extubation. In dexmedetomidine group,
      infusion (0.4Î¼g/kg/h) is started when patients are admitted to neuro-intensive care unit for
      postoperative recovery. In control group, patients receive normal saline infusion at the same
      rate and volume in dexmedetomidine group. The patient's level of sedation is assessed by
      Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) per hour. Midazolam is administered in 0.3-0.5 mg bolus or
      continuous infusion as SAS above 4. The study is designed primarily to compare the percentage
      of patients with agitation and requiring midazolam infusion in the 2 study arms.
