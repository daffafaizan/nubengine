      world. Effective treatment for cardiac ischemia is based on identification of the proper
      patients and assigning prompt treatment to those patients.

      It is not simple identifying the proper patients. There are many patients complaining of
      typical anginal chest pain without coronary heart disease, and there are many patients with
      active angina who complain of non-typical symptoms or who don't feel any symptoms.

      Management of hospitalized patients with suspected angina pectoris is based on their
      complaints, their risk factors and laboratory results (ECG, troponin). They are classified
      into low-risk, high risk and intermediate.

      Intermediate risk patients usually require additional testing in the hospital in order to
      re-classify them into high or low risk.

      Heart rate variability is a well-known marker of active cardiac ischemia. The investigators
      plan to perform a 60 minute heart rate variability monitoring.
