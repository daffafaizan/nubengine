      approach has shown better survival results than abdominal approach in retrospective analyses.
      However, patients having mediastinal nodal metastasis have poor prognosis and the benefit of
      thoraco-abdominal approach is still controversial. We evaluated the two approaches in a
      prospective randomized trial.
