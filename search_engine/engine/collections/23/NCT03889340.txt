      Managing temperature is part of standard care for this population and surface cooling is
      commonly employed.

      The following phases will be conducted as standard of care, and will be reviewed for this
      study:

      Induction phase: When a subject is included in the study, the IQool will be connected to the
      patient and activated. The induction period will continue until the patient has reached the
      upper limit of the target temperature range (defined as 0.5°C above the target temperature).

      Maintenance phase: Set target temperature will be maintained for 24 hours. The maintenance
      phase begins when the subject temperature is within 0.5°C of goal temperature. The
      maintenance phase is completed 24 hours after first reaching below the upper limit of the
      target temperature range.

      Rewarming phase: After 24 hours of maintenance, gradual rewarming at 0.25 °C/h will commence.
      When the subject reaches 37°C the TTM period is completed and the IQool will continue to
      provide fever control.

      Post TTM fever control: The subject will be kept at a body temperature of 37°C until 72 hours
      after the cardiac arrest or earlier if the subject regains consciousness.
