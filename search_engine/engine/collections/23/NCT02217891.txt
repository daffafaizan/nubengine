    
      Part 1, the investigators will recruit 40 participants from those already enrolled in
      existing MSK IRB protocol #12-245 (PI: David Hyman, MD) including male and female patients
      who have been diagnosed with late-stage breast, colorectal, bladder, and lung cancer (some of
      the most common cancers in this study population).

      Part 2, the investigators will recruit 20 participants from those who have actually received
      incidental germline findings from MSK IRB protocol #12-245 Consent Part C in order to
      cognitively test novel survey items about their knowledge and perceived utility of their
      incidental findings (note that the content of these items will be derived from the data
      collected in Part 1)
