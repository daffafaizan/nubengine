      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy, in terms of complete remission rate, of fludarabine phosphate,
           cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure (TTF) in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients until 10th January 2019.

        -  Assess the predictive value of immunophenotype, hypermutation analysis, and FISH in
           determining TTF and OS in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes or orally and cyclophosphamide IV or orally
      on days 1-3 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 4. Starting on course 2, patients receive
      rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6* courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients achieving negative minimal residual disease receive 4 courses of treatment.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker analysis. Samples are analyzed for
      protein expression (i.e., CD38, CD20, and ZAP70) by flow cytometry; quantitative
      immunoglobulins, Î²2-microglobulin, and T-cell subsets by electrophoresis; IgVH mutation
      status; and cytogenetics (i.e., +12, del 13q, del 11q, and del 17p) by FISH.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then
      annually until 10th January 2019.
