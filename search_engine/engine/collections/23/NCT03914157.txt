      week over 3 weeks. We will measure before and again 3 months after a 3-wk regimen renal
      cortical and medullary perfusion and function (multi-detector computed tomography [MDCT]),
      oxygenation, and fibrosis (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), urinary and plasma levels of
      renal injury markers, systemic endothelial function, and heart rate variability, an index of
      sympathetic activation.
