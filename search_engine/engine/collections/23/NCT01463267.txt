    
      A pilot and feasibility randomized trial of two medication reminder systems for patients with
      heart failure (HF). The investigators believe that medication reminder systems will improve
      adherence and will reduce the effects of cognitive impairment on medication adherence. The
      investigators believe that patients will accept and use a medication reminder system, but the
      investigators cannot specify which system will be preferred. Each has different features
      which may be perceived as more or less desirable.

      The investigators will enroll 60 patients with HF and randomize them to four conditions in a
      2 (device 1 versus device 2) by 2 (Active versus Passive) design. After enrollment in the
      trial, patients will be consented and will complete pretesting at Summa Health System in the
      Center for Clinical Trials. They will primarily undergo brief computerized cognitive testing,
      complete self-report measures (e.g., quality of life, depression, self-management related
      social support), and will give consent for medical information to be collected from their
      electronic medical record. They will then be randomized to condition. In-home training will
      be provided regarding how to use the equipment. Medication adherence will be monitored for 28
      days, followed by an in-home post-test (all pre-test measures) during which the equipment is
      returned.
