      receive either a telemonitoring platform in their houses or standard health care. The
      platform will include sensors able to detect falls, nocturia (which have been previously
      validated) and sensors for environmental variables including humidity, carbon monoxide levels
      and temperature. In addition, a wearable panic button will be provided for participants
      allocated to the sensor platform which will allow them to obtain help in case of an
      emergency. The sensor platform will be connected to emergency services and healthcare
      providers,and they should receive and react to any anomaly detected in their readings.

      Participants will be followed up for 10 months. Quality of life questionnaires, including the
      World Health Organisation's WHOQOL-BREF and the EQ-5D for health-related quality of life,
      will be used to address potential intervention effects.
