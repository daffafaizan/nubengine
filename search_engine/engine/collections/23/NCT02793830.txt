      coronary heart disease (CHD) by using mobile applications. An exploratory randomized
      controlled trial (RCT, N=49) and interviews (n=15) will be included in this pilot study. The
      RCT will compare the effects of the medication adherence (MA, n=24) intervention and control
      condition (n=25) on the MA score (percent of prescribed antihypertensive drugs taken), and
      health outcomes (SBP and DBP obtained) of patients. The health outcomes will be assessed at
      enrollment and every three days after the intervention begins for thirty days. Feasibility
      will be determined by the number of patients enrolled, and retention (percent of patients who
      complete the study). Acceptability (read daily reminders and educational materials via mobile
      applications) will be evaluated through focus group interviews. All analyses will be
      performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC). The potential risks of this study are minimal.
