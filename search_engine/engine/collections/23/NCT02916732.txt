    
      This is a prospective observational, non-interventional study that has been integrated into
      the usual standard of care practices. All information and biological samples collected during
      the course of this project will be done through the new medical standard of care which has
      been put in place during the ZIKV epidemic in the DFAs; this new standard of care is a result
      of existing recommendations from medical professionals and/or public health authorities.
      Outside of these recommendations, no invasive procedure will be done simply to satisfy an
      objective of this study.
