      clinically stable patients platelet Transfusion will be given in case of bleeding WHO IIÂ° or
      higher, for clinically instable patients platelet transfusion will be given at the decretion
      of the attending physician.

      aspergillosis), plasmatic coagulation disorders or sudden or increasing headache with or
      without neurologic symptoms should receive prophylactic platelet Transfusion, if their
      platelet Count is less then 10/nl. Otherwise no prophylactic platelet Transfusion will be
      given irrespective of the actual platelet Count.

      documented. The bleeding incidence will then be compared to a historic cohort.
