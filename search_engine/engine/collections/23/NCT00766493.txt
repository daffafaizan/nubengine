      tapered nitinol stents designed specifically for carotid applications have made CAS a viable
      alternative to CEA. Advances in embolic protection technology will assist in moving CAS
      forward as a universally accepted procedure. While the GORE® Embolic Filter is similar in
      many ways to other currently available filters, it has been designed to provide optimal
      vessel wall apposition. Bench tests suggest that the wall apposition may provide improved
      filter efficiency, thereby minimizing embolization of particles downstream and potentially
      decreasing adverse clinical effects. In addition, preclinical testing suggests that the GORE®
      Embolic Filter has improved deliverability, including torque ability and lesion cross that
      may improve the ability of the system to access and treat tight lesions in tortuous anatomy.
      Thus, the purpose of this multi-center clinical study is to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of the GORE® Embolic Filter when used to provide cerebral embolic protection
      during carotid artery angioplasty and stenting.
