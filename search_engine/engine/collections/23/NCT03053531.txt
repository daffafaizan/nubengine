        1. Measure the feasibility of in-ED hearing screening using HHIE-S and a handheld
           audiometer, among low-acuity11 ED patients age â‰¥75 years, by quantifying the proportion
           of eligible patients who complete hearing screening.

        2. Test whether low-acuity older ED patients who screen positive for significant hearing
           loss (> 40 dB HL bilaterally and HHIE-S > 24) and are provided a hearing assistance
           device (HAD) use that device during the ED visit.

        3. Test whether patients who are given a hearing assistance device will report ability as
           opposed to disability in hearing and understanding, using a six-item questionnaire
           adapted from a study by Cox et al.

        4. Test whether those who are given a hearing assistance device will report being prepared
           for post-discharge care, using an adapted subset of the Care Transitions Measures (CTM).

        5. Assess patient understanding of the HAD survey items within the post-use survey.
