      manual and associated materials are being tested in this pilot study, and, if found to be
      successful, will be available for public consumption. This EAT, which is delivered in a group
      setting, combines therapeutic horseback riding with cognitive behavioral strategies for
      anxiety. The group meets weekly over the course of ten weeks, with each session lasting 45
      minutes. Each session is delivered in a group format with up to four children between 6 and
      17 years of age.
