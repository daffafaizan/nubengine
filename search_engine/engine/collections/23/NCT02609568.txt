      studies that have been done in patients with severe TBI and biomarkers from serum and
      cerebrospinal fluid have shown to have prognostic significance. However there are no prior
      studies looking at biomarkers in salivary specimens. In this study we will include patients
      with moderate and severe TBI who require inpatient admission, and will study 3 specific
      salivary biomarkers. This is a unique project, since salivary specimen collection is easy and
      non-invasive and can be collected at any site even on a sports field by using a simple
      absorbable swab resembling a cigarette stub, unlike blood or CSF that can be highly invasive.
      Salivary specimens can also be frozen and stored for long periods of time prior to testing.
      If our study detects abnormalities in levels of these biomarkers when compared to healthy
      controls, and children with extra-cerebral injuries, in future studies we can look at
      children and adolescents with minor head traumas and concussions who are discharged from the
      emergency department after evaluation, and study their long-term outcomes and correlation
      with salivary biomarkers.

      Specific aims:

      To study levels of three specific biomarkers in salivary specimens (GFAP, S100B and NSE) in
      children with moderate TBI (GCS: 9-12) and severe TBI (GCS: <8) admitted to a pediatric
      trauma referral center. These biomarkers have been shown to have prognostic significance in
      prior studies using serum and CSF.
