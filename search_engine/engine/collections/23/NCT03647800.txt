    
      Phase 1 - Open-label, Dose Escalation: The dose escalation stage of the study will test
      step-dose and/or split-dose regimens infused weekly over 10 dose levels (cohorts). Cohorts 1
      to 10 will follow a 3 + 3 design. The next cohort is started after patients in the previous
      dose cohort have completed the first cycle of dosing and an evaluation for dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle has been completed.

      Phase 1b - Expansion: The recommended-dose from Phase 1 will be further examined in 2
      expansion cohorts consisting 24 AML patients (Cohort 1) and 24 MDS patients (Cohort 2).
      Patients will receive APVO436 intravenously weekly for six 28-day cycles, unless disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurs earlier. Patients with
      evidence of clinical benefit at the end of Cycle 6 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      may also continue on study for up to 12 total cycles at the discretion of Investigator (6
      cycles in addition to the initial 6 cycles).
