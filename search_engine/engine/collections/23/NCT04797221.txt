    
      Veterans will be recruited from the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center (RMRVAMC) ED
      who are identified as having elevated suicide risk by VHA's new suicide risk screening
      initiative. All Veterans visiting VHA EDs are screened using an eight-item version of the
      Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Screener, a valid predictor of future
      suicidal behavior. The C-SSRS Screener assesses suicide risk using eight items about recent
      suicidal ideation and intent, preparatory behaviors, and action. Deductive and inductive
      content analysis of qualitative interviews will occur in parallel with recruitment, and
      particiants will be recruited until thematic saturation is achieved.

      Veterans' visits (approx. 90 minutes) will be scheduled at their preferred times at RMRVAMC
      within two weeks of discharge from the ED. Sociodemographic and military service data will be
      collected using the Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center
      (MIRECC) Demographics Survey. During this visit, individuals will participate in qualitative
      interviews to identify contextual factors that may inform development of VA-based lethal
      means safety interventions.
