    
      The treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the setting of intracranial large artery occlusion
      and especially middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with intravenous tissue plasminogen
      activator (IV-tPA) is associated with low rates of recanalization and high rates of
      neurological morbidity and functional dependence.

      In the last few years, endovascular intervention (mechanical thrombectomy) has proven its
      safety and its efficacy on clinical outcome in patients diagnosed with MCAO and is now
      commonly recommended.

      However, in this population of patients treated by thrombectomy, very few predictive factors,
      except for the post-procedural recanalization score (TICI), do exist to foresee the
      variability of clinical outcome.

      Tissue viability of the infarcted territory can be approached by the measure of metabolic and
      morphological parameters (Na+, H+, phosphore, diffusion imaging) which can be non-invasively
      done by multimodal MRI, as suggest by recently published studies.

      Our study plans to measure these parameters between 12 and 24 hours after acute ischemic
      stroke in patients with MCAO treated by thrombectomy in order to correlate those parameters
      to clinical outcome at 3 months (modifier Rankin Score).
