      brain injury. Currently a variety of cooling methods can achieve mild hypothermia,the
      hyper-hypothermia blanket being the most widely-used one.

      Hyper-hypothermia blanket is a waterbed mattress connected to a thermostat-controlled water
      tank. Water is cooled in the tank and recycled between the tank and the mattress so that the
      patients sleeping on the mattress can be stably cooled. The operation is basically
      program-controlled ,but the whole system is quite expensive.

      The investigators came up with a new cooling system which is very simple and accessible. A
      condom inserted with two 10# gastric tube and one 6# gastric tube and ringed with a rubber
      band is inserted into the patient's rectum, and ice-cold saline is pumped in through one 10#
      gastric tube and drained out from the other 10# gastric tube, the 6# gastric tube connected
      to the pressure monitor. Cooling rate is controlled by the flow speed of cold saline. The
      investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this new method for achieving
      mild hypothermia.
