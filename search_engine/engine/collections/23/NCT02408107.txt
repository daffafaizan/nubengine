      metabolic syndrome, recurrence and cardiovascular disease, breast cancer survivors may
      require diagnostic, therapeutic, supportive or palliative services for many years
      post-diagnosis. Encouraging breast cancer survivors to adopt a healthy lifestyle
      post-treatment may reduce the healthcare burden resulting from treatment-related sequelae and
      improve survival. In particular, higher levels of physical activity (PA) may positively
      influence some of these side-effects of treatment, enhance quality of life and reduce risk of
      recurrence and all-cause and breast cancer-related mortality. However, PA levels are
      generally low among breast cancer survivors and many women decrease their PA following
      diagnosis. Therefore, interventions are required to improve the post-diagnosis PA levels of
      breast cancer survivors.

      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have found improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness,
      HRQoL, fatigue and weight maintenance in breast cancer survivors participating in PA
      interventions compared with control groups. However, most of these RCTs utilised
      facility-based interventions, which may limit their patients who have trouble accessing
      exercise facilities due to transportation or time-related difficulties. To overcome these
      problems home-based PA interventions have been investigated and have generally reported good
      adherence and positive effects on health, fitness and HRQoL outcomes. However, there is a
      lack of relevant interventions in the United Kingdom.
