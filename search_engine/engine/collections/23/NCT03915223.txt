      post-operative complications for healing).

      The effect corticosteroids (anti-edema and anti-inflammatory) is used in neurosurgery and
      maxillofacial surgery.

      So, it seemed judicious to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroids in bolus
      preoperatively in order to limit the importance of the edema before intervention to prevent
      adverse effect of the edema on the cicatrization.

      This study will aim to confirm this indication or not on the contrary to change current
      practices.
