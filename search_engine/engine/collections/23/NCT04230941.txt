      patients receiving chemotherapy. Older adults are at greater risk of developing CRCD which
      can negatively affect their functional independence and quality of life. Memory and Attention
      Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a promising tool that improves perceived cognition in younger
      cancer survivors with CRCD. For older adults with cancer, MAAT could be delivered alongside
      chemotherapy to mitigate the development of CRCD (when risk is highest) and CRCD-related
      effects on functional independence for older adults. However, MAAT will require adaptation to
      meet the unique needs of older adults to optimize usability and efficacy for this population.
      The overarching goal of this project is to adapt MAAT for older adults using input from
      patient and caregiver stakeholders (phase I), and subsequently gather data on the preliminary
      effects of the adapted MAAT (MAAT-Geriatrics [G]) on perceived cognition, objective cognitive
      measures and functional independence. The provided details pertain to Phase I of the study,
      which will focus on the adaptation process. The investigators will adapt and refine MAAT-G
      using feedback from key stakeholders through iterative testing of MAAT-G with 10
      patient-caregiver dyads. The research plan combines the use of standardized quantitative
      measures of cognition and functional independence with semi-structured interviews (mixed
      methods), so that data from both can be integrated to optimize the adaptation and to gain a
      better understanding of MAAT-G's effects that are not fully captured by traditional
      quantitative measures alone.
