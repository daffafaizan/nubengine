    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter roll-over extension program (REP) to:

        -  CLNP023X2203, a Phase II trial investigating the dose ranging effects of LNP023 on
           efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability in
           primary IgAN patients, and

        -  CLNP023A2301, a Phase III trial, investigating the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK),
           pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability of LNP023 in patients with primary IgAN.

      Subjects completing the CLNP023X2203 and CLNP023A2301 trials on study drug, who want to
      continue treatment and who meet the inclusion/exclusion requirements of the roll over
      extension program, will have the opportunity to receive LNP023 until:

        -  the Investigator discontinues treatment for any reason, or

        -  the benefit-risk profile of the product in IgAN is no longer positive, or

        -  initiation of maintenance hemodialysis, renal transplantation or eGFR < 15
           mL/min/1.73m2, or

        -  the product becomes commercially available in a specific country following product
           launch and subsequent reimbursement for IgAN, where applicable, or

        -  if a marketing application or reimbursement of an investigational product is
           rejected/not pursued in a region/country for the indication under study, or

        -  3 years after LPFV of CLNP023A2002B whichever is sooner.
