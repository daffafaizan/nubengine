      established. This 3-year follow-up study will provide additional data to gain understanding
      of the safety of the investigational agent. This study is designed to determine the safety of
      a single intra-articular injection of 50 million donor-derived hMSCs or 150 million
      donor-derived hMSCs in suspension with commercial sodium hyaluronan compared to an injection
      of vehicle (diluted hyaluronan) alone. The injections were performed under the initial study,
      Protocol No. 550.
