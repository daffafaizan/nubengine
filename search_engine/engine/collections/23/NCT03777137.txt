      subjects will take the telephone screening questionnaire. Those who meet inclusion criteria
      with no exclusions will come for first visit. At this visit, subjects will discuss and sign
      the consent form, and have a one sequence MRI scan which is used to localize sites in the
      brain to be stimulated with TMS.

      The subjects will then have four visits at intervals of two weeks; each visit will have TMS
      intervention designated (SITE1), (SITE2), (SITE3), and (SITE4). TMS will be applied each of
      four sites (SITE1, SITE2, SITE3, and SITE4) which will be randomly assigned among stimulation
      sites Medial Frontal (MF), Dorsolateral Frontal (DL), Primary Motor Cortex (M1 and superior
      Interparietal sulcus (Sham) and counterbalanced across subjects (see Diagram below).

      During each of visits 2 to 5, the participant will undergo baseline Quantitative Sensory
      Testing (QST), followed by TMS stimulation and then by repeat QST. QST will consist of pain
      thresholds for cutaneous hot stimuli. Visits 2 through 5 will last for approximately 1 hour
      each and will occur at two-week intervals. The total study duration will be 50 days for each
      subject. Study enrollment will last for three years and total study duration will be four
      years.
