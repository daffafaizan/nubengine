      treatment of MM. BCMA CAR is composed of BCMA nano-antibody, CD8 strand region, transmembrane
      region and 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and CD3-_T cell activation domain. BCMA nano-antibody
      CAR-T cells were prepared by lentivirus infection of T cells. In this study, a 3 + 3 dose
      gradient climbing design was used. Three dosage groups, 5x106 / kg, 1x107 / kg and 1.5x107 /
      kg, were divided into three groups. Patients were enrolled in the sequence from low to high
      doses. When each dose group was completed, the next dose group could be enrolled if there was
      no more than 3-level toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity. If the dose group had more
      than 3-level toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity, two patients were enrolled to observe
      if there was any toxicity. Sexual occurrence, if two patients in each group developed grade 3
      or more toxicity or unpredictable severe toxicity, the dose group was the dose-limiting
      group, and the dose group in front of the group was the maximum tolerated dose, at which the
      initial efficacy was observed. Nine patients were enrolled in the hill climbing test, and six
      patients were enrolled in the follow-up preliminary efficacy study, with an estimated 15
      enrolled. After transfusion, adverse events were closely monitored and therapeutic effects
      were evaluated on the 28th day after transfusion. Follow-up was conducted every 6 weeks
      within 6 months and every 10 weeks after 6 months. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      BCMA nano antibody CAR-T in the treatment of refractory and relapsed MM.
