      and RPMA-based protein pathway activation analysis of their tumor, can change the clinical
      course of their disease (i.e. produce a Growth Modulation Index (GMI) â‰¥1.3). The GMI is
      calculated as the ratio of Progression-free survival (PFS) under molecular profiling and RPMA
      analysis selected treatment to the time to progression (TTP) for the most recent regimen the
      patient has progressed on.
