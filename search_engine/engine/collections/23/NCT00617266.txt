    
      This is a four arm randomized controlled trial among Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)
      employees working in four different BPO units. The trial is undertaken with the objective to
      explore the prevalence of tobacco use in its various forms along with factors responsible for
      initiation and continuation of the habit. This trial also aims to study the change in the
      knowledge, attitudes and practices among BPO employees after intervention with different
      tobacco cessation strategies.

      Four BPO units with work force of approximately 200 employees each, with the management and
      employees that consent to participate in the study will be selected for the trial. The aim
      and purpose of the study will be explained and a written informed consent form in English
      will be offered. The employees who are willing to participate in the trial, will be recruited
      after signing the informed consent form.

      The subjects involved in the research will be expected to answer a few questions about their
      socio-demographic, occupational, medical, risk factor history and some questions to assess
      their knowledge, attitude and practice regarding tobacco use. Following this the tobacco
      users will be offered one of the tobacco cessation interventions to help them quit tobacco.

      Regular follow-up visits will be conducted through out the period of the study. The same
      questionnaire as the pre intervention will be repeated post intervention, ten months later to
      assess change in their knowledge, attitude and practice regarding tobacco use.
