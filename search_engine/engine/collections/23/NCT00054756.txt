    
      Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) is a neuropeptide used in the diagnostic evaluation of
      patients with dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. In healthy
      individuals, administration of TRH intravenously results in pituitary secretion of
      thyrotropin [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)], which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland
      release of thyroid hormones; thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). TRH stimulates the
      secretion of other pituitary hormones under normal physiologic as well as pathologic
      conditions.

      Under this protocol, TRH is used for routine diagnostic testing and research studies in
      adults and children. It is produced by the Pharmaceutical Development Section of the Clinical
      Center Pharmacy at the NIH. The safety, activity and comparability of this preparation were
      demonstrated in a small group of normal volunteers prior to its release for diagnostic and
      research use.
