    
      Stroke survivors in Region GÃ¤vleborg, Sweden, will be eligible for the study from October
      2017. Patients with a history of ischemic stroke without documented atrial fibrillation
      before or during ECG evaluation in the stroke unit will be evaluated by the chest and
      thumb-ECG system Coala Heart Monitor. The monitoring system is connected to a smart phone
      application which allows for remote monitoring and prompt advice on clinical management. Over
      a period of 28 days, patients will be monitored twice daily and may activate the ECG
      recording at symptoms. Upon completion, the system is returned by mail. This system offers a
      possibility to evaluate the presence of atrial fibrillation post-stroke, but the feasibility
      of this system in patients who recently suffered from a stroke is unknown. In addition
      Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 in comparison to Swedish population norms
      will be assessed. The feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor will be assessed by a
      self-developed questionnaire.
