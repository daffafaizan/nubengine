      and autoantibodies, have not provided conclusive evidence of their efficacy due to small
      sample size and/or weak study design. We undertook a RCT of low molecular weight heparin plus
      aspirin versus aspirin alone to investigate if the low molecular weight heparin treatment
      resulted in an increased rate of livebirths as compared to treatment with aspirin alone.
