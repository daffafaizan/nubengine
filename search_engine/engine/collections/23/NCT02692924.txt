      entitled: "Fetal Body Composition and Volumes Study" to catalog and perform 2 Dimensional
      (2D) and 3 Dimensional (3D) measurement of the obstetrical ultrasound images in the existing
      bank of singleton and twin gestations collected from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. The
      research study aims to augment the singleton Study with organ volumes by racial group and to
      understand the relationship between gravid diseases and longitudinal changes in fetal body
      composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and organ measurements (in singletons) over the
      course of pregnancy, thereby, complementing available data for the Cohort.
