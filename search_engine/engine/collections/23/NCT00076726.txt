      Currently, the only treatment for GCA is prednisone. GCA is a long lasting inflammatory
      disease. The cause is unknown. It may affect all the arteries, but it focuses on the big
      vessels such as those around the heart, the vessels in the neck and head, and their major
      branches. It can lead to vision loss, blindness, stroke, stenosis (narrowing of blood
      vessels) and aneurysms (a weakening in the lining of the blood vessel wall, which may
      eventually lead to rupture of the blood vessel). The damage to the arteries is caused by an
      immune response. A naturally occurring substance in the immune system called "tumor necrosis
      factor alpha" (TNFa) plays a significant role in this immune response against the blood
      vessels. This response is thought to cause the long-lasting inflammation (irritation and
      swelling of the vessels). By blocking the effect of TNFa we think that we may reduce the
      signs and symptoms associated with GCA. This trial will study patients who are stable on
      prednisone treatment by evaluating whether infliximab can control their symptoms as the dose
      of prednisone is reduced. Patients will receive infusions of either 5mg/kg of infliximab or
      placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46. Safety evaluations will be performed at
      specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs
      (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse
      events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive receive infusions of
      either 5mg/kg infliximab or placebo infusions at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46.
