    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined
      gemcitabine, bendamustine, and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To determine the efficacy of bendamustine, gemcitabine, and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival for
      patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who receive gemcitabine,
      bendamustine, and nivolumab, including those who receive nivolumab maintenance.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, bendamustine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2, and nivolumab over 60 minutes IV on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment with
      single agent nivolumab repeats every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
