      topiramate (IR-TPM), namely Topamax®, to an extended-release topiramate (XR-TPM), namely
      Trokendi XR®, regimen on cognition in adults with migraine.

      The secondary objective is to determine the factors that explain inter-individual variability
      in cognitive response. Pharmacokinetic and demographic factors will be explored. Variability
      in cognitive response between individuals can be large. A population approach (nonlinear,
      mixed effects) will be used to determine drug exposure response relationships.
