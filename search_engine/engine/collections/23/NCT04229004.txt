      multiple regimens in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The goal of the platform is to find
      effective therapies for pancreatic cancer. The platform will rapidly and efficiently test
      multiple novel drugs and combinations compared to standard of care therapy in first and
      second metastatic patients. Bayesian response-adaptive randomization will be used to assign
      patients to arms based on their performance in subtypes of the disease. The primary endpoint
      is overall survival.
