      disease management programs for nicotine dependence. In this study, we will recruit 750
      smokers from 20 rural, primary care clinics in Kansas. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      one of three study arms, each providing 20 months of treatment: C (comparison group), LDM
      (low-intensity disease management) or HDM (high-intensity disease management). Participants
      in group C will receive health educational mailings and an offer for free nicotine
      replacement therapy (six weeks) or bupropion (seven weeks) every 6 months (months 0, 6, 12,
      and 18). Participants in LDM will receive the same interventions as C plus a low-intensity
      disease management program that includes a single telephone counseling session using
      motivational interviewing (MI) at months 0, 6, 12, and 18 to encourage a cessation attempt
      and also includes coordination of smoking assessments and pharmacotherapy with the patient's
      physician. HDM participants will receive C plus a high intensity disease management program
      that includes up to six telephone-based MI counseling sessions at months 0, 6, 12, and 18 to
      encourage a smoking cessation attempt and to prevent relapse after a quit attempt, as well as
      coordination of smoking assessments, quit attempts, and pharmacotherapy with the patient's
      physician.

      The primary outcome of the study is 7-day point prevalence abstinence from cigarettes at 2
      years after enrollment. Secondary outcomes include: 1) number of quit attempts and 2)
      progress in stage of change. If successful, this intervention will provide a generalizable
      model for addressing nicotine dependence that could improve long-term management of smoking
      in primary care.
