    
      Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia that needs development of more effective
      medications. Propafenone is a medicine currently used to treat atrial fibrillation and is a
      mixture of two compounds, (R)-propafenone and (S)-propafenone. The investigators have
      discovered that purified (R)-propafenone may be more effective than (S)-propafenone for
      treatment of atrial fibrillation, and that (S)-propafenone reduces the efficacy of
      (R)-propafenone when administered as a mixture. This study will compare the ability of
      (R)-propafenone, (S)-propafenone, and placebo to suppress the induction of atrial
      fibrillation in participants undergoing an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure.
