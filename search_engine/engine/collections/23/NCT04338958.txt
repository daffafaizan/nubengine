      Covid-19 patients with defined hyperinflammation. Purpose of the study is the reversal of
      hyperinflammation to improve pulmonary function, reduce respiratory dependency and reduce
      mortality. Patients with a hyperinflammation Score 10/16 without a clinical diagnosis of
      sepsis will be treated with 2 x 10mg Ruxolitinib with defined response adapted dose
      escalation up to 2 x 20mg for a duration of 7 days with clinical and/or radiographic response
      assessment. Inflammation assessment will be performed every other day (day 3, 5,7) using the
      CIS. In patients with unaffected CIS alteration < 25% or increasing CIS > 25% dose escalation
      by 5mg steps (15mg, day3; 20mg day 5) at the investigator´s discretion. Treatment can be
      extended up to 28 days if clinically indicated and the benefits of treatment outweigh the
      risks. Primary endpoint of the study is the overall response rate in reversal of
      hyperinflammation at day 7 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints are total use of
      assisted oxygenation dependency (duration (days) of invasive/non-invasive ventilation or
      duration (days) of high-flow Oxygen support), radiologic response (reversal of pulmonary
      Covid-signs, Lung-XRay/CT), day 15 clinical status and day 15 and day 29 mortality. Patients
      aged ≥18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia (demonstrated by CXRAY or chest CT), with
      a study specific Covid Inflammation Score ≥ 10 are eligible. Patients with active
      tuberculosis or uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides SARS-CoV-2
      virus) will be excluded from the study.
