      the excess calories. The role of diet composition in over-feeding/energy dissipation in
      humans is unknown. We propose that:

        1. High and low protein diet will result in less weight gain as compared to a moderate
           protein diet during a 56d high fat overfeeding.

        2. Increase in energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity, adjusted for lean and
           fat mass will be greater in the high and low protein diets as compared to a moderate
           protein diet.

        3. the average size of the fat cells and the pattern of genes expressed in the adipose
           tissue, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will "predict" which
           group of subjects will gain the most weight (and fat mass) independent of the level of
           the protein in the diet.
