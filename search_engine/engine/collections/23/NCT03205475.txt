      for new JASPER interventionists. Coaching and training supports will be provided by Local
      Senior JASPER Trainers will support the development of new interventionists. Based on the
      interventionist's individual response to the coaching/training supports, a change in support
      may be provided at a priori time points including end of month 1 (training case) if at least
      70% fidelity is not reached, and at end of month 4 (midpoint of first child cohort), at least
      90% fidelity is not reached.
