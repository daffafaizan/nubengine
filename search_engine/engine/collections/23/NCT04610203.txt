        -  Phase I - the glycaemic response (GR) and insulinaemic response (IR) to:

             -  50 g available carbohydrate

             -  50 g available carbohydrate + protein (dose 1)

             -  50 g available carbohydrate + protein (dose 2)

        -  Phase II - the GLP-1 and GIP response to:

             -  50 g available carbohydrate

             -  50 g available carbohydrate + protein (dose 1)

             -  50 g available carbohydrate + protein (dose 2)

      A single-blind, randomised, repeat measure, crossover design trial was used to study the
      response following consumption of three meals: one reference meal (50 g available
      carbohydrate) and two test meals (50 g available carbohydrate with protein dose 1 and 50 g
      available carbohydrate with protein dose 2). The study was conducted in two phases:

        -  Phase I: glycaemic response (GR), insulinaemic response (IR)

        -  Phase II: GLP-1 response and GIP response
