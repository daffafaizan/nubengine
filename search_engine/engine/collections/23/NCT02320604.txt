    
      -  The overall trial design is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-centre,
           single-dose, multiple dose level trial, (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg).

        -  A total of sixteen patients with a BMI â‰¥40 kg/m2 undergoing bariatric surgery who
           receive a pre-surgery dose of AmBisome 1 mg/kg (n=8) or 2 mg/kg (n=8) will be enrolled.

        -  After enrollment of group 1 (1 mg/kg), an interim analysis on the safety of AmBisome
           will be performed before proceeding to group 2 (2 mg/kg).

        -  Infusion time and concentration of AmBisome will be 45 minutes (1 mg/kg group) and 90
           minutes (2 mg/kg group)

        -  A PK curve will be determined after administration of a single, pre-surgery dose of
           AmBisome at t = 0.5, 0.75 (end of infusion group 1), 1.5 (end of infusion group 2), 2,
           4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 and (if feasible) 72 hours post infusion (n=12 samples)
           for group 1 (1 mg/kg), 8 patients.The PK curve of group 2 (2 mg/kg, 8 patients) will be
           similar to group 1, except for the t=1.5 hour sampling point, which will be end of
           infusion due to the infusion time of 90 minutes.

        -  Patients are considered to have completed the study if at least 9/11 samples of the PK
           curve up until 48 hours have been collected.

        -  Patients will be selected by the research team to have a good spread in weight bands.
