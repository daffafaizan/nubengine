      exercise intervention (delivered at 55-64% age-predicted maximal heart rate) with a high
      intensity aerobic exercise intervention (delivered at 65%-90% age-predicted maximal heart
      rate) on measures that probe cortical synaptic plasticity using transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) in sedentary healthy adults.
