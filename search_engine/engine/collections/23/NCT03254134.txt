      either dabigatran or warfarin. There is no formal hypothesis to be tested, but rather to
      provide the estimates on the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism (effectiveness) and
      bleeding events (safety) using 95% confidence interval for comparison between those
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients taking dabigatran vs. warfarin using a large,
      nation-wide claims data in Japan.
