    
      40 subjects with Type 2 diabetes using > 100 units of insulin per day with or without
      metformin with HbA1c > 6.5% will be randomized into 2 treatment groups: treatment group will
      have liraglutide added to insulin and control group will have insulin uptitration only for 6
      months. Primary endpoint to be compared between groups will be HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary
      endpoints will include weight, total daily insulin dose, percent time in euglycemic,
      hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic ranges by continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and effect on
      GlycoMark and hs-CRP. Safety endpoints will include incidence of hypoglycemia and incidence
      of gastrointestinal side effects.
