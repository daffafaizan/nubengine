      I. Correlate uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab) PET by
      individual tumors with subsequent tumor response to ado-trastuzumab emtansine as assessed by
      serial 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) (fludeoxyglucose F 18)/PET-computed tomography (CT).

      II. Compare tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET between patients who do and patients
      who do not respond to ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

      III. Obtain tumor tissue for subsequent assessment of the presence of putative molecular
      mechanisms of resistance (MMRs) to ado-trastuzumab emtansine. When funding becomes available,
      those samples will be used to explore the correlation between the presence of MMRs as
      assessed by histopathology and tumor response to ado-trastuzumab emtansine both in univariate
      analysis and in combination with tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab as measured with
      PET/CT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo whole body fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT. Patients then receive trastuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes immediately before receiving copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab
      IV and then undergo PET scans at 24 and 48 hours. Patients then receive ado-trastuzumab
      emtansine IV every 3 weeks until complete response or disease progression at the discretion
      of the treating oncologist. Patients undergo restaging by whole body fludeoxyglucose F 18
      PET/CT every 6 weeks for 1 year after initiation of treatment until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
