      TC who developed cardiac disease ((either myocardial infarction, proven coronary artery
      disease (grade ≥2) or congestive heart failure (grade ≥2)) will be invited by their (former)
      treating oncologist to participate in this study (cases). Furthermore, in each hospital a
      random sample of 15% of the total population treated for TC will be invited (the subcohort).
      The investigators will collect detailed diagnostic- and treatment data on TC and on (risk
      factors for) CVD for all cases as well as for all subcohort members. All cases and subcohort
      members will be approached to complete a questionnaire and to donate a blood sample for DNA
      analysis, after written informed consent. Patients who were younger than 40 years at TC
      diagnosis and younger than 75 years at moment of study contact will be asked to participate
      in the cardiometabolic risk inventory sub study. For this, participants have to undergo a
      basic study assessment consisting of physical examination, venapuncture and handing in a
      morning urine sample. This assessment can be performed at the participating hospital, their
      general practitioner or during a home visit by a member of the investigators research team.
      Additional (non-invasive) cardiovascular function measurements (IMT and AGEs) are only
      performed in the UMCG.
