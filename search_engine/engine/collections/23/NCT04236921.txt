      conducted in three sequential parts:

        -  Part I: bioequivalence, food-effect, randomized, open-label, single dose, 3-period,
           6-sequence, crossover design.

        -  Part II: multiple-dose (every 4 hours), open-label, 1-period design.

        -  Part III: multiple-dose (every 2 hours), open-label, 1-period design.
