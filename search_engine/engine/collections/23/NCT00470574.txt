    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of sialyl Lewisª -keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate vaccine and
           QS21 immunoadjuvant in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the IgG and IgM antibody response to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of breast cancer cells expressing this antigen in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Monitor the presence of circulating tumor cells prior to, during, and after this regimen
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sialyl Lewisª -keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate vaccine
      subcutaneously (SC) and QS21 immunoadjuvant SC once in weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 19 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable disease.

      Blood samples are collected periodically and evaluated for circulating tumor cells and
      reactivity against sialyl Lewisª antigen in ELISA and/or immunoprecipitation-western blot
      assays.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
