      provide sedation and analgesia for a variety of painful procedures in children. The use of
      nitrous oxide as a sedative agent is very common in pediatric dentistry. In concentrations up
      to 50% it is considered as mild sedation and it is very safe. It is usually used for mild or
      moderate anxiety state because it is not so potent in concentrations up to 50 %. Despite its
      safety and widespread of its use nitrous oxide is not a potent drug and many times dentists
      fail to gain cooperation in moderate or high anxious children, and the alternatives are to
      use moderate sedation with drugs such as Midazolam, Atarax or general anesthesia. Nitrous
      oxide 50% is the most common concentration in use but the results of the sedation does not
      always provide a satisfactory cooperation, higher concentration was not conducted in Pediatry
      densitery. The aim of this study is to compare the effectivity and safety of providing
      nitrous oxide at increasing concentrations 60%, 70% with 50% parameters, sedation depth,
      adverse events and cooperation of the child during the dental treatment.Our hypothesis is
      that nitrous oxide in concentrations higher than 50% up to 70% is a safe and effective
      sedation method in dental treatment of children.
