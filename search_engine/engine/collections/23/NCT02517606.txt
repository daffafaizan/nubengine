      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). Will be recruited participants of both genders,
      aged between 18 and 60 years, with and without chronic nonspecific low back pain for over 3
      months without irradiation for lower limbs. Potential participants with chronic nonspecific
      low back pain will be referred by their doctors orthopedic surgeons and/or rheumatologists
      that will make all the assessments and routine exams, for example, Imaging tests,
      prescription drugs and referral to physical therapy care. The characteristics of participants
      will be collected through an evaluation form specially designed for this study. This
      assessment form will contain issues related to demographic and anthropometric data, plus
      information about the clinical picture of the participants, as for example the use of
      medications, physical activity level, educational level, prior history of back pain and
      duration of symptoms.The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (6
      weeks) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization.

      The data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the
      intention-to-treat principles.
