    
      This is an open-label, one-period, single-dose study with 14C labeled ASP3652.

      Screening takes place between Day 22 to Day 2, and subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day
      -1.

      On the morning of Day 1, each subject receives a single oral dose of 14C-labeled ASP3652.
      Blood, urine and feces samples for analysis of 14C radioactivity are collected until at least
      120 h after dosing. Blood samples for the analysis of ASP3652 and metabolites are collected
      until 120 h after dosing.

      The subjects remain in the clinic until Day 6 (or up to Day 13 in case discharge criteria are
      not met on Day 6) and return for an End of Study Visit (ESV) 7 to 14 days after (early)
      discharge.
