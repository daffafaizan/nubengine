      the study and agreed to participate in the study will be randomized into two groups
      (computer-assisted randomization method will be used.) In the first group of patients
      classical closure method of Kerr incision(double layered continuously locked suturing) will
      be used. In the second group of patients double layered purse string closure technique will
      be used.

      Women will be followed for a subsequent pregnancy in the next 4 years. If they become
      pregnant again they will be followed up during pregnancy for comparison of long-term effects
      of the two suture techniques. Patients will be followed especially from the aspects of
      placental anomalies. Presence of intra-abdominal adhesions, uterine dehiscence, placenta
      previa, placental invasion anomalies (eg, placenta accreta and others)and incomplete or
      complete rupture will be compared between two groups.
