    
      The purpose of this study is; To investigate whether a pellets based sachet formulation of
      D961H 20 mg (D961H sachet 20 mg) is bioequivalent to a commercial HPMC capsule of D961H 20 mg
      (D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg) after repeated oral doses by the assessment of percentage of time
      with intragastric pH>4 during 24 hours after dose on Day 5.

      To compare a D961H sachet 20 mg with a D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg after repeated oral doses by
      the assessment of percentage of time with intragastric pH>3 during 24 hours and 24-hour
      median pH after dose on Day 5

      To compare PK properties of a D961H sachet 20 mg with those of D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg after
      repeated oral doses by the assessment of AUCÏ„, Cmax,ss, AUC0-t,ss, MRT, tmax,ss, and t1/2,ss
      of esomeprazole after dose on Day 5.

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a D961H sachet 20 mg and D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg
      by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, blood pressure (BP), pulse
      rate and body temperature.
