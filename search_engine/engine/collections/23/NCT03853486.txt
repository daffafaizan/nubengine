    
      The overarching objective of this longitudinal, observational and prospective study is to
      characterize the safety and effectiveness of factor replacement in participants with
      clinically severe congenital VWD (VWF:Ag, VWF:GPlbM or VWF:RCo of ≤30% or ≤40% of normal with
      severe bleeding phenotype defined as requiring recurrent use of factor concentrates) enrolled
      in the ATHNdataset.

      This is a longitudinal, observational cohort study being conducted at up to 30
      ATHN-affiliated sites. Participants will be followed for 2 years from time of study
      enrolment. The total study duration is 3 years.

      Safety will be measured by the number of reported events defined by the European Haemophilia
      Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) program. In addition, although not specifically defined by
      EUHASS, treatment-emergent side effects of therapy will be included as reportable events
      including: hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, thrombotic events, VW Factor inhibitor
      development, treatment-emergent side effects of therapy, transfusion-transmitted infections,
      malignancy, cardiovascular events, neurological events, unexpected poor efficacy and death.

      Secondary objectives of ATHN 9 are:

        -  to enrich and analyze the data from currently enrolled participants with clinically
           severe congenital VWD in the ATHNdataset via the collection of laboratory data
           consisting of a standardized diagnostic battery using an ELISA based VWF activity assay,
           and genetic sequence analysis of VWF coding regions and adjacent non-coding regions;

        -  to establish a platform for sub-studies for participants with congenital severe VWD,
           that are treated with VWF products on demand or have started on or switched to a
           particular VWF containing product for prophylaxis;

        -  to evaluate the use of factor replacement as prophylaxis in participants over 6-month
           time periods;

        -  to describe bleeding events, changes in overall bleeding and annualized bleeding rate
           (ABR) over the course of the study as measured by individual bleeding components; and

        -  to describe real-world effectiveness of VWD treatment as measured by health care
           utilization and quality of life.
