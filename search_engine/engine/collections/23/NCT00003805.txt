      in reducing fever in patients with hematological malignancies and persistent febrile
      granulocytopenia.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients receive
      piperacillin/tazobactam IV over 20-30 minutes every 6 hours. Patients who become afebrile
      within 48-60 hours after beginning treatment continue to receive piperacillin/tazobactam
      alone. These afebrile patients continue treatment for a minimum of 7 days, of which 4 must be
      consecutive without fever. Patients who are still febrile after the initial 48-60 hours are
      randomized to continue on piperacillin/tazobactam alone or with vancomycin. Vancomycin IV is
      administered over at least 1 hour twice daily. Treatment continues for a maximum of 28 days
      in the absence of persistent fever. Patients are followed at 7-10 days after completion of
      therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
