      during adolescence, and the age of children suffering from it tended to be lower. It's urgent
      to explore effective ways to alleviate the pain caused by dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

      In our research, 160 children are randomly divided into a Chinese medication periodic therapy
      group (80 cases) and a Gong Xue Ning control group (80 cases). Paticipants in Chinese
      medication periodic therapy group are treated with kidney-tonifying and tune up Chong-Ren
      hemostasis Chinese medicine for 3 months, whereas the Gong Xue Ning control group received
      Gong Xue Ning capsules for 3 months. We compare the effect of the two therapies about
      hemostasis and menstruation regulation, and the change of the thickness of endometrium, sex
      hormones, Kisspeptin, and PAI-1 in blood before and after the treatment, in order to make
      clear the efficacy and the mechanism of the Chinese medicine periodic therapy.
