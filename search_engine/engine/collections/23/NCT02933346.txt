      histological non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) types, most patients with advanced tumors are
      still treated with first-line chemotherapy. In 2015, several studiess demonstrated the
      efficacy of nivolumab, an immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints. In France, besides the
      clinical trials, this molecule has been made available in January 2015 under a Temporary
      Authorization for Use (ATU, compassionate use).

      Our study sought to examine nivolumab efficacy and safety in advanced NSCLC patients treated
      under the ATU setting and describe their long-term clinical characteristics, notably the
      treatments they received after nivolumab discontinuation. The profile of these patients shows
      greater conformity to that of a non-selected population, yet the clinical data collection
      does not reflect "real life" conditions and stops when treatment ends, which does not enable
      us to get an overview of post-immunotherapy treatments.
