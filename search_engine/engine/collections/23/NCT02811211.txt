    
      Male and female subjects 6 to 17 years of age with a primary psychiatric diagnosis of ADHD
      will be enrolled in this study. The subject and his or her parent/guardian must agree to
      genotyping to determine whether the subject has disruptive mutations within any of the
      approximately 274 mGluR-network genes, and complete an interview that will include
      information about the subject's ADHD history, treatment, and co-morbidities.
