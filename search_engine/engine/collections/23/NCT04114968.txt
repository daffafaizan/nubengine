      cervical cancer screening program in the Central Denmark Region. The study includes all 65 to
      69 years old Danish women with no record of a cervical cytology sample or screening
      invitation within the last five years. Furthermore, the women are not registered as
      ineligible for screening, eg due hysterectomy. Eligible women residing in the Central Denmark
      Region are allocated to the intervention group (n=20,000), while women residing in the other
      four Danish regions are allocated to the control group receiving standard care (n=71,500),
      which for this group is low-level opportunistic screening at the general practitioner (GP).
      The intervention group are invited for HPV-based screening by the GP or to request a
      self-sampling kit.
