      discrepancies, preventable and ameliorable ADEs, hospital readmissions, and ED visits through
      the use of HIT. The proposed tool will prompt primary care physicians to perform medication
      reconciliation at the first post-discharge outpatient visit, clearly display and organize
      preadmission and discharge medication regimens, and facilitate the creation of the new
      post-discharge medication list with just a few keystrokes. Using methodologies from prior
      studies at BWH, we will evaluate the intervention in a two-site RCT. The study will be
      conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, taking
      advantage of our rich experience with designing and testing new informatics applications,
      including one for inpatient medication reconciliation.
