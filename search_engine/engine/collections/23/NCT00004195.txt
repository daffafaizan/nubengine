      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), normal mucosa, or normal liver in patients with
      primary or metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Evaluate the ability of eniluracil to inactivate
      DPD in the tumor, PBMCs, and normal tissue in this patient population. III. Assess DPD
      recovery and uracil levels in PBMCs following surgical resection in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified according to
      colorectal tumor (primary vs metastatic). Patients are randomized into one of two treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral eniluracil twice daily on days -2 and -1 followed by
      surgical resection and tissue harvest on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo as
      in arm I followed by surgical resection and tissue harvest on day 0. Patients are followed
      weekly for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
