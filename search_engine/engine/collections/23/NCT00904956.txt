      ability to develop a dormancy state within well-structured lesions (granulomas), which can
      remain in the lung of the host even for life. The investigators have developed a new original
      hypothesis based on scientific evidence that takes into account the idea that a lesion cannot
      be held forever, because the host tends to remove any lesion in order to rebuild the original
      parenchyma, in a healing process. Even if M. tuberculosis can remain in a
      dormant/non-replicating state for a long period, this is an important but not sufficient
      factor to explain the LTBI. The Dynamic Hypothesis tries to explain the existence of LTBI in
      spite of the healing process that could remove it by a constant reinfection of the host's
      tissue.
