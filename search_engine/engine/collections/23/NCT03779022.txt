      determining the breast cancer risk. The concentrations of some circulating microRNAs in human
      breast cancer have been correlated with tumor development and progression. Aberrant miRNA
      expression may be involved in drug resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents in breast
      cancer. Therefore, we hope to investigate the value of miRNAs in predicting the effect in
      breast cancer neoadjuvant treatment.
