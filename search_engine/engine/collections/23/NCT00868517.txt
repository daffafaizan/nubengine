      report insomnia. Presently, conventional treatments for PTSD-related insomnia include
      medications, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. While some of these
      conventional treatments do improve PTSD-related insomnia, many of these treatments have
      limitations (e.g., medication effects, lengthy time commitments, psycho-social stigma).
      Because of these limitations, many veterans are increasingly turning to complementary and
      alternative therapies to relieve their symptoms. There is a growing body of research that
      shows that acupuncture may improve many health symptoms including depression, PTSD,
      addiction, headaches, musculoskeletal pain, and insomnia. However, to date, no study has
      specifically explored how acupuncture may affect PTSD-related insomnia. Because so many
      veterans with PTSD experience PTSD-related insomnia, and because the current conflicts in
      Southwest Asia are producing a new generation of combat veterans, it is critical that the VA
      explore innovative treatments for PTSD-related health concerns.
