      study will be initiated as a single center evaluation and is intended to be step-wise
      expanded to a Vienna-wide systematic survey. The study will include patients with chronic
      critical limb ischemia and ischemic ulcerations as defined by Fontaine stage IV or Rutherford
      stages 5 & 6. The study will include all patients presenting with CLI to the participating
      centers including inpatients and outpatients.

      Patients will be followed up 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and then every 6 months.
      The study will be continued at least until the 5 year data of the last included patient are
      available.
