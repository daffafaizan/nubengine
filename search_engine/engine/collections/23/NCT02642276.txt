      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Studies have shown that exercise training improves walking
      distance, pain-free walking distance, endothelial function and quality of life in these
      patients. However, to date the most effective exercise training option in terms of
      improvement of cardiovascular parameters has not been clearly identified. In this controlled
      trial, patients with PAD will be randomized to either maximal walking group, submaximal
      walking group, or usual care. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of maximal vs.
      submaximal walking training programmes on i) walking ability, ii) vascular function, iii)
      arrhythmogenic potential, iv) parameters of inflammation, hemostasis and heart failure
      severity, v) health-related quality of life in individuals with PAD.
