      Montelukast 10 mg and Bilastine 20 mg is superior to monotherapy with Bilastine 20 mg in
      patients with Seasonal Allergic RhinoConjunctivitis (SARC) and comorbid mild to moderate
      asthma on total symptom scores (TSS) and if the combination therapy reflects an improvement
      in quality of life as assessed via the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) over a
      longer time period when compared to monotherapies with Montelukast 10 mg and Bilastine 20 mg.
      Mild to moderate asthma was defined according to the criteria of the Global Initiative for
      Asthma, i.e., GINA criteria 2 and 3 (GINA, 2012). The study population included patients
      inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids and in whom "as-needed" short acting
      beta-agonists provided inadequate clinical control.
