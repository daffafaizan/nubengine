      with single level, symptomatic degenerative disc disease (DDD) from L3-S1. This is a
      prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects with DDD will be randomized
      to disc arthroplasty with the FLD device or a control device. The overall purpose (objective)
      of this trial is to collect clinical data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of FLD
      used for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar degenerative disc disease compared to the
      control device.
