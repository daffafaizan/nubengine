      targeted drugs which block the molecular machinery of cancer cell growth [such as erlotinib]
      have failed to improve their efficacy over only-chemotherapy in patients with metastatic lung
      cancer of the non-small cell histology type. It is not yet known whether administering
      targeted drugs intermittently could result in improved efficacy of the combinations. This is
      a multicenter randomized Phase II trial aiming to determine the more active dosing sequence
      between intermittent erlotinib and docetaxel for treating patients with advanced
      Non-Small-Lung-Cancer.Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: they
      will receive a 12-days course of erlotinib either before docetaxel [arm A] or after docetaxel
      administration [arm B].Treatment will be repeated every 21 days.Patients will be evaluated
      every 2 cycles (~6 weeks) for response using RECIST criteria. Those patients achieving stable
      disease or better will continue therapy up to a total 8 cycles. Those patients experiencing
      progressive disease will be taken off study. Biopsy material will be assessed for biomarkers.
