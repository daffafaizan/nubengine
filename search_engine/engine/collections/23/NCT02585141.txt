      where the traditional treatment is surgical drainage. Anorectal abscess is associated with
      recurrence rates between 6-44 % after surgical drainage and persistent subsequent fistula up
      to 37 %. Inadequate incision, missed abscess components or fistulas can be the cause of
      recurrence . Surgical drainage is associated with discomfort from prolonged wound healing,
      affecting the daily activities as well as the potential risk of complicated scaring and fecal
      incontinence. Less invasive method with pus aspiration under antibiotic cover has been shown
      to be safe in terms of recurrence rate and subsequent fistula formation and well tolerated by
      the patients with less morbidity and wound complications and a potential lower risk of fecal
      incontinence. However, this has been shown only in few studies with small population and no
      randomized controlled study comparing the two approaches has been conducted or published to
      our knowledge. The risk factors of recurrence and subsequent fistula formation are not that
      clear but age below 40 years, absence of diabetes mellitus and recent smoking are shown to be
      risk factors for developing recurrent abscess and fistula. Applying aspiration and
      antibiotics method for the treatment of perianal abscess can be an advantage for the society
      due to a shorter recovering period, quicker return to daily activity and work and avoiding
      wound healing problems and sphincter damage; thus lower expenses. The results of this study
      have the potentials to reveal the risk factors of developing fistula after perianal abscess.
