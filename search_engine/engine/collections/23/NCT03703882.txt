      by a 2-week follow- up. Approximately 125 boys with DMD will be enrolled in this trial, with
      2 boys receiving edasalonexent for every 1 boy receiving placebo.

      Following completion of the treatment period, patients may elect to continue in a separate
      open-label extension study.
