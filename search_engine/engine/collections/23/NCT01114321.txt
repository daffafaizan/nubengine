    
      50 patients

      Inclusion visit :

        -  Clinical examination/ Interview on health and medical history

        -  Complete UPDRS, MMS

        -  Biologic check up

      Protocol :

      All patients were studied in the postabsorptive state after a 10-h overnight fast.

      On the day of the experiment, patients did not receive their treatment. One catheter was
      inserted for blood sample collections. Patients ingested then 75 g of glucose.

      Blood samples were collected for plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentration analyses at
      T0, T30, T60, T90, T120, T150 and T180. Urinary glucose was researched at T0 and T120.

      In parallel, a dysautonomia evaluation of each patient was made (SCOPA AUT questionnaire,
      Tilt test).
