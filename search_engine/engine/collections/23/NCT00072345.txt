      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of temozolomide, thalidomide, and lomustine, in terms
           of objective response rate, in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV
           melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-42, oral thalidomide on days 1-56, and
      oral lomustine on days 1 and 29. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
