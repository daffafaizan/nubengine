      (intrarectal 2% lidocaine gel + periprostatic nerve block) due to suspected prostate cancer.
      Patients detected with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score (PIRADS) â‰¥3 lesion
      on MpMRI underwent MpMRI-guided FPB (Group I) and the patients who had no suspected lesions
      or had a PI-RADS <3 lesion on MpMRI underwent TRUS-guided SPB (Group II). Pain assessment was
      performed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 5 min after the procedure. Following the procedure,
      the patients were asked to indicate the most painful biopsy step among the three steps (1:
      insertion of the probe into the rectum, 2: probe manipulation, 3: the piercing of the biopsy
      needle).
