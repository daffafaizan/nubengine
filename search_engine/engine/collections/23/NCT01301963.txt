      I. Ability to reach target collection of 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/Kg with =< 2 days of
      leukaphereses using one of two mobilization regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Percentage of patients achieving target goal CD34+ cell dose (as above) in =< 5 days of
      leukaphereses.

      II. Compare collections between different mobilization regimens in those patients who are
      crossed over from one mobilization regimen to the other.

      III. Compare days of apheresis, need for hospitalization during mobilization, and need for
      remobilization between mobilizing groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-8.

      ARM II: Patients receive G-CSF SC QD on days 1-7 and plerixafor SC QD on days 4-7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days.
