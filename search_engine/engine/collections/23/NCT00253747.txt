      placebo, increases the effectiveness of standard smoking treatment (i.e., nicotine patch and
      individual smoking cessation counseling) in obtaining prolonged abstinence for smokers with
      ADHD. The study will involve an estimated 252 participants, recruited from approximately 6
      sites.
