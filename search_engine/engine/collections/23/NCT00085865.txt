      alcohol appropriately. Serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
      this illness. Serotonin transporters (SERT) critically regulate the tone of serotonergic
      transmission (Gobbi et al 2001). In a brain imaging study using the SPECT radioligand, [123I]
      Beta-CIT, male alcoholics who had abstained from alcohol for more than four weeks, had
      significantly reduced serotonin transporters in the raphe area of the brainstem compared to
      healthy control subjects (Heinz et al 1998). However, the [123I] Beta-CIT ligand, binds with
      high affinity to both the dopamine transporter (DAT) and SERT. Binding of [123I] Beta-CIT in
      regions rich in SERT or DAT have been attributed to SERT and DAT respectively but in regions
      of mixed innervation (e.g. cortical regions), it is not possible to distinguish between SERT
      and DAT.

      [11C]DASB is a PET ligand with high affinity for SERT with almost 1,000 fold selectivity
      versus DAT. Using this tracer, we will be able to measure SERT binding in cortical and
      subcortical brain regions including those with mixed innervation. [11C] DASB PET studies in
      humans (Houle et al 2000; Meyer et al 2001) indicate the feasibility of quantifying SERT
      binding in SERT rich regions. In the current protocol, we plan to use PET imaging with the
      radioligand, [11C] DASB, for serotonin transporter (SERT) to delineate regional abnormalities
      in SERT binding in two subject groups consisting of 30 patients with alcoholism and 30
      healthy volunteers. Our goal of the present study is to further our understanding of the
      roles of the serotonergic systems in the pathophysiology of alcoholism.
