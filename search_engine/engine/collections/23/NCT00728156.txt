      thrombosis in patients with T2DM and CAD with placebo. The Badimon chamber, an ex vivo
      arterial injury model is used for this purpose. This model simulates the in vivo situation of
      high shear arterial wall damage and helps to quantify thrombus which is the sum endpoint of
      all haemostatic abnormalities seen in vitro.
