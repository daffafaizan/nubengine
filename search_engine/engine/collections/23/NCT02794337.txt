      carcinoma (HCC) however a vast majority of patients present with unresectable disease. In the
      last decade results of randomized trials and a subsequent metaanalyses established
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as standard of care in patients with Barcelona Clinic
      Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B. However, TACE alone is not a curative approach. The two year
      survival following TACE ranges from 31-63% with almost 100% patients developing disease
      progression after treatment. There is need to investigate additional therapeutic options that
      would consolidate the initial response to TACE. A recent metaanalyses including 17 trials (5
      randomized and 12 non randomized studies) concluded that addition of high dose radiation to
      TACE results in upto 10-35% improvement in two year overall survival. However as results of
      metaanalyses were based on studies with small sample size, unclear randomization procedure
      and heterogenous dose of radiation, the need for conducting a high quality randomized study
      was highlighted. The present study is designed to investigate the role of high dose conformal
      radiation as consolidation therapy after TACE in patients with nonmetastatic unresectable
      HCC.

      With an integrated phase II/III design the study investigates the impact of local radiation
      therapy on infield progression free survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable
      HCC.
