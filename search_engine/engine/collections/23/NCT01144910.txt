      predicting asthma. Caudri et al. found more important predictors like perinatal transmission,
      parental use of inhalative medications and wheezing/dyspnea out of viral infections(5).
      Measurement of BHR in children was in most studies a second outcome parameter.

      Four visits will be performed, baseline and after 1, 3, and 5 years. At visit 1 the
      investigators will characterize all patients by a ISAAC survey. At each visit in children a
      methacholine challenge, a skin Prick test, eNO, RAST and total IgE will be performed. At
      visit 3 and 4 sputum will be induced. In parents only at the first visit a methacholine
      challenge will be performed. A genetic identification of ADAM33 gene from EDTA blood shall be
      provided. ADAMs are multidomain proteins with a metalloprotease domain, associated with
      airway remodelling. Visits should be kept in a time interval without asthma therapy and
      respiratory infection.

      To examine the feasibility of methacholine challenges in preschool children data measured in
      2006 will be analysed.
