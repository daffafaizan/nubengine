      their epinephrine auto-injectors. Adolescents/young adults are at increased risk of adverse
      events, because of increased risk-taking with food and decreased likelihood of carrying
      epinephrine.

      Study design: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial, with a survey component. Text
      messaging is the mode of communication and inquiry with study participants.

      Hypothesis: The intervention group, which will receive modest financial incentives for
      carrying epinephrine, will be more likely to demonstrate that they are carrying their
      epinephrine, when queried by the study team.

      This study employs text messaging, along with photography, as a mode of momentary ecologic
      assessment, or real-time measurement of epinephrine carrying. In addition, text messaging was
      used as a mode of asking questions regarding food allergy knowledge and beliefs among young
      adults. Text messages were sent from a designated telephone (and telephone number) purchased
      for use in this study. We used text messaging for reminder messages, text responses, and for
      the participants to send photographs back to us. We converted text message data (participants
      responses) into a RedCap database. Our research coordinator sent and received the text
      messages and compiled a secure RedCap database of responses.
