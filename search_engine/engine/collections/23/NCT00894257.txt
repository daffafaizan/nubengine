      This multi-centre epidemiological study (CHU Nice, CHU Toulouse, CHU Montpellier, H Clinic
      Barcelona, H Mar Barcelona) consists in two parts. Our study does not interfere with the
      usual management of mother and child as laboratory data (virology, immunology, and liver
      function) are already included in the medical files. Data collection will be conducted via an
      anonymous questionnaire by an only one clinical research assistant who will travel to each
      participating centre. These data are contained in the mother's and child's medical files. The
      data concerning the socio-demographic characteristics of mother, the characteristics of HIV
      and HCV infection with special attention for infection risk factors, and the circumstances of
      the delivery. The questionnaire among children include laboratory results at birth, M6, and
      M12, as well as assessment of hepatic fibrosis.

      Data were analysed using SPSS software. Qualitative variables were tested by Chi-square and
      Fisher's exact test. For quantitative variables, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was
      used (median, 25th and 75th quartile). A p-value inferior than 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant.
