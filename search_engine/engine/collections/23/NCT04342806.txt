      currently working in the United States. The overall goal of the Registry is to create and
      engage a community of HCWs who may be eligible for participation in future research studies,
      including those of COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment. The Hero registry will create a
      repository of health care workers that can be eligible for future research studies. The main
      objectives of the study are, 1) create a virtual community of adult HCWs in the United
      States, 2) Identify HCWs interested in engaging in upcoming research studies, including those
      related to COVID-19, and 3) Create a dataset of health related measurements, risk factors,
      and outcomes for future analysis. The population of interest is adult healthcare workers in
      the United States.

      All analysis of the HERO Registry will be exploratory in nature. Analysis may include
      descriptive statistics of the cohort, statistical associations between variables of interest,
      and predictive modeling for health outcomes and behaviors. Analyses may be conducted on all
      participants in the HERO Registry or may be conducted on subpopulations defined based on
      clinical, demographic or other factors.

      There is no direct benefit to the participants for their participation in this study, but the
      information obtained will be used in scientific research and may be helpful to the
      participant or others in the future. Participants may experience indirect benefits such as
      learning about their own health, access to health data, and opportunities to participate in
      future research.
