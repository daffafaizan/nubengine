      pregnancy is hazardous to both the mother and/or fetus. The induction in a ripe cervix is not
      difficult but complications are significantly increased when the cervix is unripe. The only
      agent approved for cervical ripening and induction of labor in patients with an unripe cervix
      is dinoprostone(PGE2). Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analogue marketed for the prevention
      and treatment of gastro-duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol costs much less than dinoprostone and
      does not require refrigeration and has few systemic side effects.In addition, it is rapidly
      absorbed orally and vaginally. Although misoprostol is not registered for such use, it has
      been widely used for obstetric indications such as induction of abortion and of labor.
      Misoprostol for induction of labor in preceding literatures mainly prescribed in multiple
      dosing regimen. The adverse effects on uterus potentially occur owing to the frequent
      administration of misoprostol. The objective of this study was to compare a single dose oral
      misoprostol with vaginal misoprostol.
