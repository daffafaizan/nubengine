      associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) compared to cognitively normal HIV+ individuals
      and HIV- controls.

      It will also demonstrate that the phenoconversion from cognitively normal (CN) status to HAND
      will be closely correlated with neocortical F 18 T807 uptake. In particular, HIV+ patients
      with MND will have greater tau cortical deposition compared to ANI individuals.

      The investigtors hypothesize that in vivo tau imaging will ultimately:

        -  Demonstrate the presence of tau fibrils in older HIV+ patients with HIV associated
           neurocognitive disorders (HAND) compared to cognitively normal HIV+ individuals and HIV-
           controls.

        -  Demonstrate that the phenoconversion from cognitively normal (CN) status to HAND will be
           closely correlated with neocortical F 18 T807 uptake. In particular, HIV+ patients with
           MND will have greater tau cortical deposition compared to ANI individuals.
