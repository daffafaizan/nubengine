      general anesthesia were included in this study, by using an open (non-blinded) study design,
      patients were randomly assigned to two groups, 15 patients in each. Randomization was done
      through computer generated random tables. Isoflurane group; anesthesia was maintained with
      isoflurane 1-2%. Sevoflurane group; anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane 1-2%.

      A peripheral intravenous access was secured in the hand opposite to the functioning fistula
      and induction of anesthesia was done with propofol 2mg/kg, neuromuscular blockade was
      maintained with atracurium 0.6mg/kg and all patients were intubated and ventilated to
      maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) concentration between 30-40 mmHg. Anaesthesia was
      maintained with 1-2% isoflurane (isoflurane group) or 1-2% sevoflurane (sevoflurane group)
      with fresh gas flow of 2 L/min. In both groups inhalational anesthetic was delivered in an
      air-oxygen mixture of 1:1 ratio. Analgesia was maintained with fentanyl 1Âµg/kg/hr. Mannitol
      and sodium bicarbonate was given immediately before reperfusion (de-clamping of renal
      artery). Intraoperative monitoring included heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen
      saturation, ETCO2, ECG and central venous line was placed in the right or left internal
      jugular vein depending upon the presence of dialysis catheter. Hemodynamic target include:
      mean arterial pressure of > 80mmHg, CVP between 10-15 mm Hg to optimize cardiac output and
      renal blood flow.
