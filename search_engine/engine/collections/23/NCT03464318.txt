      The young patients need to undergo several radiographic controls for a correct therapeutic
      balance. However, the repeated radiation exposures is associated with a greater risk of
      carcinogenesis even if reduced with a digital imaging technique.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the intraobserver repeatability and the interobserver
      reproducibility of low-dose radiographs with a HELIOS DRF (CAT) imaging system in patients
      with idiopathic scoliosis.
