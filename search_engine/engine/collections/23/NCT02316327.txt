      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To assess early tumour response (at day +7) in terms of blood flow as compared to Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) in terms of RECIST criteria (CR + PR) at day 42.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess early tumour response (at day +7) in terms of blood volume, mean transit time,
           enhancement peak, time to the enhancement peak and capillary tumour permeability as
           compared to ORR (CR + PR) at day 42.

        -  To assess tumour response (at day +42) in terms of blood flow, blood volume, mean
           transit time, enhancement peak, time to the enhancement peak and capillary tumour
           permeability as compared to ORR (CR + PR) at day 42.

        -  To assess tumour response (at day +7 and +42) in terms of blood flow, blood volume, mean
           transit time, enhancement peak, time to the enhancement peak and capillary tumour
           permeability as compared to PFS and OS

        -  Safety profile using NCI-CTC AE (version 4.0).

        -  To assess the efficacy in the subgroup of adenocarcinoma pts.

      Outline:

      Patients receive bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV, cisplatin 80mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on
      days 1 and 8 up to 6 cycles of 21 days. Patients without progression may continue maintenance
      treatment with single-agent bevacizumab 7.5 mg/Kg on day 1 every 21 days.
