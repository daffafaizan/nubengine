      Permanente Northern California (KPNC) or Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC)
      integrated healthcare delivery systems during the time period January 1, 2020 through
      December 31, 2020, (representing the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic) and diagnosed with
      incident Covid-19. The outcomes will be incident VTE and all-cause death, assessed through
      March 2021. The primary comparison will be the risk of post-hospitalization VTE between
      patients with Covid-19 compared with matched controls. Next, the risk of VTE associated with
      key patient subgroups, including by severity of Covid-19 disease, will be described.
