      function and subsequent vascular responses. The combination of ET-1, ET-3, and the respective
      ETA and ETB receptor antagonists will be used to provide insight into the mechanisms of ETB
      receptor dysfunction in the presence of adiposity. Previous studies have revealed elevations
      in circulating ET-1 in obese individuals; therefore, we predict that obese subjects will
      exhibit 1) ETB receptor dysfuncton compared to lean subjects and 2) an improvement in ETB
      receptor dysfunction following treatment with Candesartan.
