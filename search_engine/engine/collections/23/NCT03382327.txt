      for hepatic surgery. Surgical resection is the approach leading to the best survival rate in
      case of liver cancer. In hepatocarcinomas, systematic removal of the infected liver segment
      is considered the most effective technique to eliminate tumour, potential satellite nodules
      and avoid vascular spread. Resectability rate highly depends on the analysis of preoperative
      images. However, in 20% of cases, there are modifications compared with the initial surgical
      plan leading to an increase in morbidity rate.

      In 2002, Couinaud highlighted the difficulty of identifying portal pedicles, especially
      because of anatomical variations, and recommended the use of a three-dimensional
      reconstruction from images provided by a helical scanner.

      The hypothesis of the study is that 3D models would improve surgical planning leading to a
      decrease in intra-operative adjustments and mortality.

      The aim of this multicentric, prospective study is to assess the benefit of 3D models in the
      surgical management of hepatocarcinomas, more specifically in the detailed analysis of 3D
      vascular structures and in the surgery planning with resection merges evaluation. The
      validation of this virtual method will be built on the comparison of the surgical plan based
      on the analysis of conventional preoperative images (CT-scan and MRI) and the surgical plan
      based on the analysis of 3D reconstruction.
