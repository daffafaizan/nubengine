      clinical use of the Bard® UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon for the treatment of stenotic
      lesions of the superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery, and infra-popliteal
      arteries (posterior tibial, anterior tibial and peroneal arteries). Follow-up for all treated
      subjects will be performed at hospital discharge, 30 days, and 6 and 12 months post-index
