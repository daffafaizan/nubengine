      In many studies it was demonstrated that children are much more susceptible than adults for
      environmental toxic metal exposure. Hair analysis is a promising tool for routine clinical
      screening and diagnosis of heavy metal exposure and essential trace element states in the
      human body. Additionally it was demonstrated that oxidants and antioxidants play a central
      role in the pathogenesis of many pulmonary diseases including asthma. Furthermore, toxic
      metals, trace elements and oxidative stress have many pivotal role on immune system.

      Objective:

      To evaluate and compare hair toxic metals, hair essential trace elements levels and plasma
      total antioxidant activity between children with recurrent wheezing and age and sex matched
      healthy children.

      Intervention: Hair samples will be collected for the analysis of the toxic metals, trace
      elements. Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of the cytokine levels and plasma
      antioxidant activity.

      Study Measures:

      Differences in hair toxic metals, hair trace elements, plasma cytokine levels and plasma
      total antioxidant activity will be compared between children with recurrent wheezing and
      age-sex matched healthy children
