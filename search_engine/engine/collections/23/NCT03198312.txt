      it is a kind of the closed venous infusion system that can fully implanted, can be used for
      all kinds of high concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs, completely parenteral nutrient
      solution infusion, blood transfusion and blood samples, It can be used to reduce painfulness
      and the difficulty of repeated venipuncture, to prevent external stimulants weeks vein

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CathiportTM. The
      CathiportTM will be compared to an active control group represented by the FDA approved
      commercially available Bard Implant Port.

      The study consists of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in China which will enroll
      approximately 220 subjects (1:1 randomization CathiportTM : Implant Port) with patients

      the operation or puncture points, observe whether if there is blocking pipe, and fluid
      extravasation surrounding skin tissue of judging when using, whether there are conditions
