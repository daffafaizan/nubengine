      traditional glass ionomer cement (GIC) and contains nano-sized powder particles of
      hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite. These materials claim to have improved mechanical properties
      and better bonding to dentin, in addition to continues fluoride release.

      The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial where teeth will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three restoration groups.

      Following medical and dental history, bilateral bitewing radiographs will be taken for each
      patient to assess the presence of proximal lesions. Suitable teeth will then be randomly
      assigned to one of the restoration groups. A single operator using local anesthesia and
      rubber dam isolation will then prepare standardized Class II cavities and place the
      designated restorations according to the manufacturer's instructions.

      The quality of the 3 types of restorations will be clinically evaluated at baseline and every
      six months for color match, marginal discoloration, anatomic form, marginal adaptation, and
      secondary caries using the criteria described by "Cvar and Ryge" (2005). The evaluation will
      be performed by 2 calibrated examiners.

      Following placement of the restorations, bitewing radiographs will be taken to evaluate the
      restorations and will be repeated every six months for detection of recurrent caries.
