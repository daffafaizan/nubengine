      health outcomes. Engaging in healthy behaviors is not always rewarding (e.g. carrot vs.
      cake). Neural models of healthy behaviors focus on the balance between reward and regulation
      brain regions. The current pilot application examines the engagement of these regions during
      the evaluation of food and nonfood cues before and after a guided imagery exercise targeting
      positive associations with food and regulation.

      The long-term goal is to understand the interaction between positive associations with
      healthy foods and thinking about future rewards may influence healthy decision-making. The
      objective of the current study is to empirically test the combined effects of positive affect
      and positive episodic future thinking on brain activation.
