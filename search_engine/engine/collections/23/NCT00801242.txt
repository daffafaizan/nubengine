      during the induction period(s). The off-treatment period(s) started when prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) â‰¤4 ng/mL and lasted up to 24 months based on PSA levels. A visit was scheduled
      on a monthly basis during the induction treatment periods, and every two months during the
      off-treatment periods. During the off-treatment periods, degarelix treatment was re-initiated
      when PSA >4 ng/mL. The maximum of degarelix IAD treatment cycles that a participant could
      receive was limited to three.
