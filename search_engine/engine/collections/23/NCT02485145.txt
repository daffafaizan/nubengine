      anti-inflammatory agents through a topical delivery system. In the present study compounds
      with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties will be combined in a vehicle that promotes
      penetration of molecules through the skin to deeper underlying tissues such as the joint
      capsule at articulations in the hands. The vehicle consists of Versapro cream base (a
      formulation of Medisca, Inc. that contains Vitamin E and Aloe Vera, along with other
      ingredients that are proprietary), Tranilast powder, Pentoxifylline USP powder, Cetyl
      Myristoleate 40% wax, liquid Pentylene Glycol, liquid Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) USP, liquid
      Propylene Glycol USP, liquid Ethoxy Diglycol reagent, liquid Ethyl Alcohol 190 proof USP.
      These are all inert ingredients, i.e. they only promote penetration of molecules through the
      skin. A mixture of the following compounds will be incorporated into this vehicle as the
      active test medication:

      Diclofenac 3% - an NSAID. FDA pregnancy category C for the first 30 weeks, then category D.

      Baclofen 2% - an agonist for the GABAB receptors. FDA pregnancy category C.

      Orphenadrine 5% - an anticholinergic drug of the ethanolamine antihistamine class. FDA
      pregnancy category C.

      Bupivacaine 2% - a local anesthetic that binds voltage-gated sodium channels and blocks
      sodium influx into nerve cells preventing depolarization. FDA pregnancy category C.

      Due to the FDA pregnancy categories for the drugs used in this study, pregnancy is an
      exclusion criteria.

      The control medication: The vehicle alone will serve as the control compound.
