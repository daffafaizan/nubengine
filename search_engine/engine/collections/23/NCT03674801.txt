      management strategy of esophageal cancers after endoscopic treatment. Consequently, the
      interests of this study, national inventory, are multiple:

        1. List a significant number of endoscopic treatments. In particular, by sub mucosal
           dissection in France, in order to strengthen scientific evidence of its efficacy, to
           assess its feasibility and complication rate.

        2. Describe the therapeutic strategies currently in place during endoscopic treatment,

        3. Evaluate the adequacy between the proposed upstream management of the endoscopic
           procedure by SCP and the actual management.
