      chemotherapy, and CD25 can mediate resistance, which can be reversed by targeting CD25
      therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Basiliximab in combination with pegaspargase in the treatment of relapsed/refractory
      NK/T-cell lymphoma.
