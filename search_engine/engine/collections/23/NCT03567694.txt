    
      The study consists of 2 parts, Part A (SAD, including fed/fasted comparison) and Part B
      (MAD). Part A will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalating
      titration of up to 8 single dose levels of HA115. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive
      active compound and 2 will receive placebo in a randomized manner. Part A will include an
      assessment of the effect of a high-fat breakfast on the absorption and PK profile of HA115,
      performed in 10 participants at a single dose to be selected based on SAD results and
      predicted to be associated with therapeutic plasma concentrations.

      Part B will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group study of up to 3
      dose levels of HA115 given once daily. The number of days of dosing will be based on the
      results of the PK analysis from Part A. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive active
      compound fasted and 2 will receive placebo in a randomized, double blind fashion. Safety
      observations and PK evaluations will be made. Safety data will be reviewed with the SRC prior
      to each dose escalation.
