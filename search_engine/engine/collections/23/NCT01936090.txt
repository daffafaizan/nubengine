    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib that can be added to high dose
      melphalan and low dose total body irradiation as part of conditioning chemotherapy for
      myeloma. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the bortezomib added to high dose
      melphalan and low dose total-body irradiation (TBI) in patients with myeloma undergoing stem
      cell transplantation, as defined by achievement of complete response (CR). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the toxicities associated with addition of bortezomib to high dose melphalan
      and TBI in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status.

      II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II study.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days -5 and -2, TBI
      twice daily (BID) on days -5 and -2, and melphalan IV over 1 hour on days -4 and -3.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant
      on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days and then every 90
      days for up to 3 years.
