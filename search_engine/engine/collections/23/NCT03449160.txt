    
      Participants with low back pain who are referred for physical therapy will be randomized to
      routine physical therapy or routine physical therapy plus receiving a postural training
      device.

      Physical therapy will be completed 1-2 times per week over 4-6 weeks. If randomized to the
      group that also receives a postural training device, one of the physical therapy sessions
      will instruct the patient on use of the device, which can be used thereafter as tolerated by
      the patient.

      At 6 weeks and 3 months, questionnaires that assess patients pain and function will be
      completed to assess outcomes
