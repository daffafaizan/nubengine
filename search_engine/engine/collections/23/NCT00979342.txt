      offices or day surgery settings. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a local anesthetic group
      (Group #1 or Group #2). Subjects will undergo a hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure to
      remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 fibroids, or type I fibroids. Subsequent to the procedure,
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 within the local anesthetic group to a post procedure pain
      management group (Group A or Group B). Subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11
      point scale)will be compared at three time points: Immediately post procedure, prior to
      discharge from the treatment facility, and at 48 hours post procedure.
