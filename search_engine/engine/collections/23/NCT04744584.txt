      center for PH for PAH or CTEPH. Detected medication errors will be tracked and fixed by the
      physician before the end of hospitalization. A synthesis of new/stopped and modified
      treatments will be given to the patient as well as his related healthcare professionals
      (community pharmacist and general practioner) to ensure the maintaining of the new
      therapeutic management and the understanding of drugs modification. To compare the potential
      decrease of medication errors promoted by MR, a retrospective MR will be also done for
      patients without MR at 1st hospitalization but at the next one (3 to 6 months after).
