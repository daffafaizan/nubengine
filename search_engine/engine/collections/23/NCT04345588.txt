      blocks. Use of additives further prolongs the duration of analgesia For upper limb surgeries
      below shoulder joint, the brachial plexus block using supraclavicular approach introduced by
      Kulenkampff has gained popularity. Supraclavicular approach to brachial plexus block is
      useful for procedures done at or below the level of elbow.

      This technique involves the deposition of local anesthetic near the brachial plexus
      approached from immediately above the clavicle. Brachial plexus is formed by ventral rami of
      C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 which forms the roots.These then continue distally to form trunks,
      divisions, cords,and branches Local anesthetics used alone in supraclavicular block provide
      analgesia for 4-8 h.

      The use of dexamethasone perineurally along with local anesthetic has been shown to improve
      the duration of analgesia. Intravenous dexamethasone is also useful in attenuating the
      postoperative need for analgesics in different clinical settings even in the absence of any
      nerve blocks.

      Hence, it is logical to compare the duration of analgesia with the use of dexamethasone in
      the setting of supraclavicular brachial plexus block, dexamethasone given either perineurally
      or intravenously.
