      motor system seen in a number of different circumstances. Techniques used will involve the
      combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and pharmacologic interventions. We
      propose to use drugs judged to be safe, that either potentiate GABA related intracortical
      inhibition, change presynaptic release of excitatory aminoacids like glutamate, or decrease
      the activity of the NMDA receptors (mostly antiepileptic drugs). If plastic changes expressed
      as larger motor maps or motor evoked potentials (MEP) to TMS are secondary to intracortical
      disinhibition, administration of a drug that potentiates intracortical inhibition may result
      in decreased plasticity and smaller motor maps or MEP. This finding would then identify
      intracortical disinhibition as the mechanism responsible for this type of plasticity.
      Similarly, if plastic changes decrease with a drug that inhibits release of excitatory
      aminoacids, or that antagonize the action of NMDA receptors, the mechanism underlying
      plasticity is likely to be mediated by modulation in the release of excitatory aminoacids or
      activity in NMDA-receptors.

      Results from this study will then provide information about the relative involvement of
      intracortical disinhibition, modulation in the release of excitatory aminoacids, and role of
      NMDA receptors in different settings of human plasticity.
