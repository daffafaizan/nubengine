      modifications; however, some patients incur life-disturbing attacks despite compliance with
      these treatments which underscores the importance of pharmacological interventions.

      Methods: In the COMFORTS trial, a multi-center randomized controlled trial, 1375 patients
      with VVS will be randomized into three parallel arms with a 2:2:1 ratio to receive midodrine,
      fludrocortisone, or just lifestyle modifications. All patients will receive recommendations
      for lifestyle modifications. In the pharmacological intervention arms, patients will receive
      5 mg of midodrine three times a day or 0.1 mg of fludrocortisone twice daily. In case of
      intolerance, the dosage will be cut by half. If the patient does not tolerate even the
      reduced dosage, the medication will be discontinued and the patient will be advised to use
      compression garments, practice tilt training exercises, or switch to the other medication.
      The patients will be followed on 3, 6, and 12 months after dose stabilization. Primary
      efficacy outcomes of the study is the time to the first syncopal episode. The secondary
      efficacy outcome are the recurrence rate of syncope, number of syncopal episodes and the
      quality of life of the patients which will be assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Survey
      questionnaire at the enrollment and 12 months after dose stabilization.
