    
      The primary goal of this Phase II clinical trial is to determine the one-year overall
      survival of patients treated for immune deficiencies including HLH, HLH-like disorders, CGD,
      HIGM1, IPEX syndrome, and severe LAD-I with Matched Related Donor (MRD)/ Matched Unrelated
      Donor (MUD) bone marrow transplant using a reduced-intensity conditioning strategy including
      intermediate-timing of alemtuzumab. The donor choice is an unaffected related bone marrow
      donor who is a 6/6 match at HLA-A, -B (intermediate or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high
      resolution using DNA-based typing) OR a 7/8 or 8/8 match for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A,
      -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing), OR an unrelated bone marrow
      donor who is a 7/8 or 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using
      DNA-based typing). The transplant conditioning regimen will include fludarabine, melphalan,
      and alemtuzumab starting at Day -14 (Flu/Mel/Alem). Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)
      prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine and corticosteroids through engraftment.
      Post-transplant supportive care will include infection surveillance and prophylaxis, and
      disease-specific supportive care.
