      adverse events is still challenging.

      STI is an old technique based on the recording of two parameters: electrocardiogram and
      phonocardiogram, and from them measuring the different systolic intervals:

      pre-ejection period (PEP),electro-mechanic activation time (EMAT), Left ventricular ejection
      time (LVET) and systolic time ratio (RTS) were measured.

      The aim of these study is to demonstrate whether systolic time intervals (STIs) can improve
      clinical scores EFFECT (Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment) and GWTG-HF (Get
      With the Guidelines-Heart Failure) for predicting 30 day mortality and readmission in
      patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the ED.
