    
      The current CALIPSO study investigates the efficacy of a continuous lisuride infusion against
      the optimized previous oral therapy in patients experiencing motor fluctuations with OFF
      periods and/or strenuous dyskinesias of more than four hours per day.

      The controlled core study is scheduled to last six weeks. Within the study the previous oral
      therapy will either be continued in a capsule/blinded design (while a placebo infusion is
      going on concurrently) or the oral therapy is substituted by lisuride infusion (while placebo
      capsules are administered at the same time).

      After the controlled core study all patients whose condition has not worsened during the
      study (meaning those patients of the placebo infusion group as well, who were treated during
      the core study just as they were before), will be given the chance to continue with the
      infusion therapy with lisuride in an open extension phase.
