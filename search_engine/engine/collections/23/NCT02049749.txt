      will include 2-6 year old children who receive their primary care at the Children's Hospital
      of Philadelphia, South Philadelphia Primary Care clinic and whose caregiver and/or doctor has
      concern about a behavior problem in the child. The caregivers will also be subjects in the
      study.

      Child-caregiver pairs who agree to be in the study will be randomly assigned to receive the
      CARE training immediately or in 3-4 months.

      The CARE intervention will last 6 weeks and child behavior and parenting will be measured at
      baseline, 6-8 weeks, and 14-18 weeks. Investigators will also measure parent satisfaction
      with the CARE intervention.

        -  Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) is a group parent training program.

        -  The goals of the program are to teach parents skills that help their children
           successfully reach developmental milestones while increasing positive behaviors.

        -  The program also was designed to help parents manage and decrease negative child
           behaviors.

        -  Each training will be led by 2 therapists and 4-10 parents will attend the CARE program
           together.

        -  Children do not attend the training but parents are encouraged to practice the skills
           learned at CARE between the sessions.
