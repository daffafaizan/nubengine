      bullied. Bullying is defined as intentional aggressive behaviour with the intention to harm
      the victim. It is characterized by an imbalance of power between the perpetrator and the
      victim, and is often repetitive although it does not need to be. Studies have shown that
      youth with chronic illness or disability were more likely to be bullied that those without
      disabilities, specifically if the disability was visible. Research has been conducted on the
      prevalence and effects of bullying in youth with disabilities such as cerebral palsy,
      obesity, and chronic pain; however, there is a paucity of research involving youth with
      muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathies. The objectives of this study are to: (1)
      measure bullying frequency, (2) describe the types of bullying experiences; and (3) explore
      barriers and facilitators to dealing with bullying by youth and their parents. The objectives
      will be met using a cross-sectional, multi-centre, mixed methods approach. A survey will be
      administered online at a single time-point to youth and their parents. Then, purposefully
      selected participants and their parents will complete a qualitative interview.
