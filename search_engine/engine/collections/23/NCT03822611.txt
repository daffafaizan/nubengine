    
      Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is a widely used approach to eradicate open defecation
      in rural communities in developing countries. Using emotional triggers, CLTS promotes
      community self-help to build household latrines. In Ghana, where CLTS is part of the
      government's official sanitation strategy, a community is declared "Open Defecation Free"
      (ODF) when 80 percent of households own a latrine.

      There is however evidence that open defecation persists in so-called "ODF" communities,
      especially as the most vulnerable households (the poorest of the poor) cannot afford to
      construct or maintain durable latrines. As a result, subsidies for these vulnerable
      households have been proposed as a strategy to promote the construction of durable latrines
      and help sustain safe sanitation behaviours in communities having received CLTS.
