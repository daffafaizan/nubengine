      diabetics who have primary care providers at 20 S Park St Clinic. Participants will be
      recruited from the Internal Medicine practices at the clinic. The subjects will meet with Dr.
      Zimmermann (Study Clinician) to review time restricted feeding and low-carbohydrate diets as
      well as a strategy for decreasing insulin doses. Calls from Dr. Zimmermann's clinic nurse
      will occur daily until blood glucose levels stabilize to manage insulin decrease.

      Participants will complete monthly logs of food intake times and meet with a dietician twice
      during the 6-month study. Diabetes medication use will be reviewed, and hemoglobin A1c will
      be measured, at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. The participants' non-diabetic medical care
      will continue to be managed through their primary care physicians (PCPs).

      Specific Aims:

        -  Demonstrate feasibility of the low carbohydrate/time restricted feeding (LC/TRF)
           protocol

             -  Feasibility will be assessed based on participant compliance with time-restricted
                feeding and recommended carbohydrate intake, clinician time and clinic resources

        -  Determine effectiveness of the LC/TRF protocol on diabetes care and quality of life

             -  Effectiveness on diabetes care will be evaluated using changes in A1c, insulin use,
                BMI, patient quality of life, and adverse events including hypoglycemia.
