      patients each, treated with IRX4204 at 5 mg/day, 10mg/day, or 20 mg/day. Patients were
      administered IRX4204 orally once daily. Baseline assessments were performed for total motor
      score, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Follow-up assessments of these
      clinical outcome measures were performed at 14 and 29 days of treatment. [123]Î²-CIT SPECT
      imaging for assessment of dopamine active transporter (DAT) expression was performed at
      baseline, and on day 30 of IRX4204 treatment. Patients had clinical hematology and chemistry
      laboratory tests, and recording of adverse events, performed at baseline and at follow up
      visits.
