      respirators need to pass the fittestto identify those individuals who do not achieve the good
      fit necessary for adequate protection. The performance of this respirator was also determined
      by measuring percent leakage under constant airflow[8]. The purposes of this study was to
      evaluate the fitting characteristicof our newly invented silicone N99 respirator and the
      performance against 30 Âµm particles using NaCL aerosols. The study was conducted to achieve
      two specific research objectives

        1. To investigate the fit characteristic of the novel silicone mask and whether the strap
           adjustment can help reduce the face-seal leakage

        2. To determine the level of performance by measure the inward leakage of the generated
           aerosolswith the new filter and used filter for up to 24 hours.
