      Ad-hCMV-Flt3L delivered to the peritumoral region after tumor resection. This study will
      combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer
      approaches delivered by first generation adenoviral vectors. Treatment with HSV1-TK is
      expected to kill transduced brain cells, thus exposing tumor antigen. Treatment with Flt3L, a
      cytokine known to cause proliferation of dendritic cells, should cause the migration of
      dendritic cells to the peritumoral brain and remaining tumor. There, they will be exposed to
      tumor antigens released from dying glioma cells through TK + valacyclovir-induced glioma cell
      death, and thus mediate a specific anti-malignant glioma immune response against remaining
      malignant glioma cells.
