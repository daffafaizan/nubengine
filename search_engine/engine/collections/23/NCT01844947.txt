        -  To explore the safety of sorafenib in combination with vinflunine in patients with
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract and to define a recommended phase II
           dose for this treatment combination

        -  To correlate early tracer 18F-FDG-PET/CT functional imaging readouts with standard
           RECIST (version 1.1) evaluations with the intention to explore new endpoints for
           targeted therapy

        -  To find predictive tumour tissue biomarkers for sorafenib/vinflunine treatment

        -  To evaluate serum and urine markers of apoptosis as potential markers of
           sorafenib/vinflunine treatment

      Rationale/Goal

      To evaluate the tolerability and activity of sorafenib combined with vinflunine in patients
      with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      Tumour biopsies will be collected before and after one cycle of therapy. The translational
      part of this study aims to explore the predictive value of a number of biomarkers related to
      the targeted properties of sorafenib and presumptive markers for vinflunine treatment.

      In addition, the predictive value of an early functional imaging tracer 18F-FDG-PET/CT will
      be evaluated.
