      that worsens when high dose treatment is decreased (GINA guidelines - available at
      https://ginasthma.or), is a major unmet medical need. Major advances in the management of
      severe asthma occurred in the past few years due to the new targeted biological therapies.
      Mepolizumab and Benralizumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies able to block interleukin
      (IL)-5 and the receptor for IL-5, respectively. These biological treatments block the
      eosinophilic driven inflammation. The effects of these treatments on an other key effector
      molecule of the T2-immune response, i.e. IgE, is virtually unknown.

      To explore this issue, we set up a real life, observational, retrospective, multicenter
      study. The study will enroll patients with severe eosinophilic asthma already treated with
      Mepolizumab or Benralizumab. The following variable will be collected before the the
      biological treatment and at 4Â±2 months after the initiation of the pharmacological regimen:

        -  demographic data

        -  age of onset of asthma

        -  smoking habit

        -  concomitant pharmacological regimens

        -  number of asthma exacerbations since last visit

        -  concomitant diseases (particularly gastroesophageal reflux, nasal polyposis, atopic
           dermatitis, obesity, anxiety-depressive syndrome).

        -  White Blood Cell Count and Differential (and in particular the levels of total
           leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils)

        -  Lung function tests (spirometry)
