      into the study. Due to significant recruitment challenges, the study was discontinued after
      six participants were enrolled in the study.

      This was an open-label, multiple-dose, adaptive-design study in participants on hemodialysis.
      Eligible participants on hemodialysis were to remain in the Clinical Research Unit for 2
      weeks (Day -7 to Day 8) and were required to consume a potassium, magnesium, calcium and
      sodium-controlled diet.
