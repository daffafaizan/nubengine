      blood transfusion , determine the Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) pharmacokinetics in burned
      patients, determine if fFVIIa should be used to reduce peri-operative blood loss in patients
      undergoing excision greater than or equal to 20 percent of the total body surface area,
      determine the efficacy of the drug in burned patients undergoing excision of burn wounds.
