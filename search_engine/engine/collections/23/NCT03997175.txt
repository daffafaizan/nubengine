      biodiverse material for 20 minutes each day for two weeks. The other received the a similar
      material and guidance but the microbial community in the material was poor in diversity.
      Bacterial community changes and immune system markers were analyzed and compared between the
      two arms. Potential changes in Interleukin 10 was the primary outcome.
