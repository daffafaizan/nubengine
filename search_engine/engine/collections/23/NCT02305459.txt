    
      Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also called radioembolisation (RE), with
      SIR-Spheres microspheres is an endovascular procedure, included within the interventional
      oncologic technologies to treat primary and secondary liver tumours. Using a microcatheter, a
      precise dose of resin microspheres is released in the hepatic artery, where they are carried
      into the arterioles and selectively lodge in the tumour microvasculature. The microspheres
      are loaded with the radioactive yttrium-90, a high-energy beta-emitting isotope with a
      half-life of 64.1 hours. Following administration, 94% of the radiation is delivered in 11
      days. Previous reports on the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 resin microspheres for the
      treatment of primary and secondary liver tumours are very promising. In order to further
      improve the understanding of this therapy in its true clinical setting, the Cardiovascular
      and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) initiated the CIRSE Registry for
      SIR-Spheres Therapy (CIRT), a phase 4 observational study that aims to collect robust data on
      the real-life clinical practice of radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres microspheres. Further,
      using the quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 with its hepatocellular carcinoma module
      (developed and verified by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer
      (EORTC)), CIRT aims to collect data on the quality of life of patients treated with
      SIR-Spheres microspheres.
