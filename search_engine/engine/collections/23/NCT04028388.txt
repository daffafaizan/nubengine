    
      This is an open label 1:1 randomized Phase IIb trial to determine the efficacy and
      tolerability of oral ModraDoc006/r versus i.v. docetaxel in mCRPC subjects. Cohort 1 will
      receive i.v. docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 Q3W. Cohort 2 will receive 30 mg ModraDoc006 in
      combination with 200 mg ritonavir in the morning and 20 mg ModraDoc006 in combination with
      100 mg ritonavir in the evening (7-12 hours after the morning dose), on Day 1, 8 and 15 of a
      21-day cycle. All patients will also receive 5 mg oral prednisone twice daily. Treatment in
      both cohorts will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      discontinuation for any other reason. The end of the trial is defined as the time point when
      all subjects have discontinued trial treatment and have been given follow-up for safety
      measurements according to the trial assessment schedule.
