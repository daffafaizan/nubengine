           tumor cells (CirTC) at 4 weeks after starting treatment, is a better predictor of
           clinical outcome than measuring either modality alone in patients with metastatic
           colorectal cancer (CRC) who are undergoing first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

        2. To determine if a new method of assessing drug response (measuring tumor metabolic
           response via FDG-PET & CirTC at 4 weeks after starting treatment) better predicts
           clinical outcome than the conventional method (measuring radiological changes in tumor
           dimensions at 10 weeks after starting treatment via the 'Response Evaluation Criteria in
           Solid Tumors' - RECIST).
