      whole-pelvic irradiation followed by a cone-down boost to the prostate improves
      progression-free survival at 5 years by at least 10% compared to TAS and prostate-only
      irradiation in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate at significant risk of nodal
      involvement. II. Examine whether induction and concurrent (neoadjuvant) TAS and radiotherapy
      improves the progression-free survival at 5 years by at least 10% compared to adjuvant TAS
      and radiotherapy. III. Compare treatments with regard to local control, time to distant
      failure, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy with Radiotherapy.
      Flutamide, FLUT, NSC-147834; Goserelin, Zoladex, ZDX, NSC-606864; with irradiation of the
      whole pelvis followed by a boost to the prostate using photons of at least 6 MV. Arm II:
      Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy with Radiotherapy; FLUT; ZDX; with irradiation of the
      prostate using equipment as in Arm I. Arm III: Radiotherapy followed by Adjuvant Antiandrogen
      Therapy. Irradiation as in Arm I; followed by FLUT; ZDX. Arm IV: Radiotherapy followed by
      Adjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy. Irradiation as in Arm II; followed by FLUT; ZDX.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,200 patients will be accrued over 2.5 years.
