      regulates gene expression on the X chromosome. This hypothesis will be examined by
      determining if X chromosome gene expression profiles, derived from lymphocyte RNA, of BRCA1
      mutation carriers (cases) can be distinguished from an age-matched group of women who do not
      have BRCA1 mutations (controls). Neither cases nor controls will have a history of cancer.
      This investigation will provide valuable insight into the biologic function of BRCA1 and its
      role in breast and/or ovarian tumorigenesis. Blood samples from cases will be collected from
      patients who have previously undergone genetic counseling through the Clinical Genetics
      Service at MSKCC and tested positive for a germline mutation in BRCA1. Blood samples from
      controls will be obtained from two sources.

      First from specimens already collected under IRB Protocol #99-030, entitled "Collection of
      Tissue, Blood, and Cells to be Used for Studying the Causes, Prevention, Diagnosis, and
      Treatment of Breast Cancer (T. King, PI). Controls will also be collected from patients who
      have previously undergone genetic counseling through the Clinical Genetics Service at MSKCC
      and tested negative for germline mutations in BRCA1. Isolation of total RNA from blood will
      be performed using the PAXgeneâ„¢ Blood RNA System. This study will use lymphocyte RNA samples
      from 50 individuals with BRCA1 mutations and 50 age-matched controls. Gene expression
      profiling will be performed in the Genomics Core Laboratory of MSKCC under the supervision of
      Agnes Viale, PhD. Class comparison analysis will be performed on the gene expression data in
      the Biostatistics Department under the supervision of Adam Olshen, PhD. It is anticipated
      that this study will be completed in approximately 1 year.
