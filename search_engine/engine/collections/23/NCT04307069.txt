      the onset of regular uterine contractions.

      PROM at term can be managed actively by induction of labor or expectantly by waiting for the
      onset of a spontaneous labor. Several studies have shown an association between expectant
      management and higher rates of maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, especially infections.
      Furthermore, expectant management has been shown to increase the risk for cesarean deliveries
      (CD), chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy and neonatal mortality. It is suggested that the
      risk for those complications increase proportionally with the longer the duration of ruptured
      membranes. Others disagree with those associations.

      In this study the investigators will investigate whether early administration of oxytocin is
      superior to expectant management of 24 hours in patients with PROM at term, in terms of time
      to delivery and maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, regardless of bishop score.
