    
      Observational study in patients undergoing scheduled colonoscopy in endoscopy rooms of the
      Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital. The investigators objectified the level of sedation that was
      performed in these procedures using Bispectral Index Monitoring, as well as the total dose of
      medication required and the level of satisfaction obtained after completing the sedation. The
      incidence of hemodynamic and respiratory complications observed was included, as well as the
      treatment needed to solve them.

      A total of 196 patients were needed to obtain statistically significant results. Qualitative
      variables are expressed in the form of freguencies and percentages and continuous variables
      in the form of means and stnadard deviations. Comparisions of percentages were made by the
      Chi square test and the difference of means in the continuous variables by the t
      test.Stadistical significance will be assumed when p<0.05. All estadistical analyzes were
      carried out using SAS V9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Carey, NC).
