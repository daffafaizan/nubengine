      in dyadic physical interactions are affected by 1) different behavioral interaction
      conditions (i.e., solo task, collaboration task, competition task, or cooperation task); 2)
      the haptic impedance or stiffness of the virtual connection between dyadic peers (i.e., hard
      connection, medium connection, or soft connection); and 3) the skill level of the other
      partner (i.e., novice or expert). The investigators will be using both an ankle robot (M1
      device) and a bilateral lower limb exoskeleton (H3/X2 device).

      For Experiment A , the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers (n = 180) to work in
      dyadic pairs. With the collected data, the investigators will model how humans adapt force
      and impedance and share roles/specialize during various dyadic interaction behaviors, and use
      this knowledge to develop robot controllers that mimic movement error and force adaptation
      for enhanced motor performance.

      For Experiment B , the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers (n = 180), participants
      post-stroke (n = 72) and participants post-SCI (n = 72) to work in dyadic pairs within each
      population. The investigators will test the robot controllers following the models for
      mechanical adaptation and role sharing strategies between peers based on Experiment A. The
      investigators will also monitor single-joint and multi-joint movement error and force
      adaptation in regards to enhanced motor performance. The investigators will assess if the
      robot controllers can pass a "haptic Turing Test", rendering them indistinguishable with
      respect to human peers.
