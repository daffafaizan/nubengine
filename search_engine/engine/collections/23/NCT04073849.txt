      performance enhancement used by athletes wishing to gain an unfair advantage over their
      competition. A common way to achieve this increase is by using erythropoiesis stimulating
      agents (ESA's), namely recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO). Though laboratory tests have been
      developed for the direct detection of all known isoforms of exogenously administered ESAs in
      both urine and blood, athletes have found ways to circumvent these testing measures using
      techniques such as microdosing.
