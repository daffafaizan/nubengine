    
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, single-center clinical trial.
      Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were admitted in the
      People's Liberation Army General Hospital were equally randomized to receive either
      cardiomyopeptidin or placebo, and patients in cardiomyopeptidin group are given the injection
      of cardiomyopeptidinl before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intravenous
      infusion of cardiomyopeptidin was performed 3 days after primary PCI. Myocardial perfusion
      flow grade was evaluated by the result of primary PCI. Myocardial infarct size, microvascular
      obstruction and salvage myocardium were evaluated by enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance
      (CMR). Major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, all-cause death,
      hospitalization for acute heart failure, and revascularization for angina) were observed
      during the 6-month follow-up. CMR is performed to evaluate the effect of cardiomyopeptidin
      before primary PCI on myocardial salvage and microcirculation perfusion in patients with
      STEMI.
