      Barrett's esophagus, with and without associated dysplasia or cancer, and controls without
      BE. Enrollment of controls will be stratified based on use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
      The investigators plan to enroll an approximate total of 150 subjects:

      100 BE patients (with or without associated dysplasia or cancer)

        -  50 subjects with non-dysplastic BE

        -  50 subjects with BE and dysplasia or EAC

           50 controls

        -  25 controls on PPIs (at least once daily)

        -  25 controls not taking PPIs

      Various tests will be performed and samples collected on the day of endoscopy. These tests
      include: saliva samples, electronic nose device testing, tethered capsule sponge testing,
      dietary questionnaires, and collection of blood and gastrointestinal biosamples. Analyses of
      this data and samples will then be performed to address the specific aims above.
