      entry are not accessible to children with mobility limitations. This paper presents a
      game-like computerised test featuring an appealing scenario that is accessible to these
      children. It was developed on a platform that creates 2D vector graphics and contains three
      phases of interactive content accessible through an adapted peripheral. Conventional tests
      were also used to validate the effectiveness of the game. The two types of tests had the same
      degree of predictive power when completed by thirty three preschool children without mobility
      impairment.
