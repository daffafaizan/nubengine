    
      The purpose of this study is to find the dose of a new therapy, CX5461, that can be tolerated
      without causing very severe side effects and to see what effects the study drug has this
      cancer. Participants are given CX5461 and are watched very closely to see what side effects
      they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If serious side effects are seen
      in patients at the first dose level, doses of CX5461 may be lowered in subsequent patients.
      If the side effects are not serious, then more participants are asked to join this study and
      are given higher doses. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but
      temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
