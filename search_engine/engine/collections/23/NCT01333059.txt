      ventilation, longer stay in the intensive care unit (PICU) and total hospital stay. Also,
      extended duration of continuous sedative infusions limits the ability to assess for adequate
      neurologic function.

      There is, however, no published data on the use of daily interruption of continuous sedative
      infusions in pediatric patients, nor are there any recommendations from the leading pediatric
      critical care groups regarding this issue. Infants and children exposed to noxious stimuli
      (endotracheal tube, endotracheal suctioning, mechanical ventilation, indwelling catheters) in
      addition to an unknown environment are less likely to cooperate during normal daily
      interventions in the PICU. Continuous infusions of benzodiazepines and opioids in addition to
      as needed (PRN) bolus doses have been the standard of care in our institution for
      mechanically ventilated patients.

      The study seeks to determine if reducing the total dose of sedatives, by holding them in a
      cyclical manner, will be a safe and effective intervention that will not increase adverse
      patient outcomes. This will be achieved by limiting the patient tolerance to the sedatives,
      decreasing the body total deposit of sedatives and subsequently decreases awakening time when
      patient is ready for extubation.
