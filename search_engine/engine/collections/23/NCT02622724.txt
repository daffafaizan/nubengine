    
      This is a Phase III clinical study to investigate the efficacy and safety of FP-1201-lyo
      (recombinant human interferon [IFN] beta-1a) compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with
      moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Primary objective is to
      demonstrate the efficacy of FP-1201-lyo in improving the clinical course and outcome based on
      survival and need for mechanical ventilation. Currently there are no approved drugs for
      treating moderate or severe ARDS patients.

      FP-1201-lyo is a lyophilised powder form of recombinant human IFN beta-1a reconstituted in
      water for injection and is administered intravenously.

      Recombinant human IFN beta-1a is an approved treatment for patients for other indication and
      its safety profile in such patients is well characterised.
