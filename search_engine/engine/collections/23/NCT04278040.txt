      therapeutic) doses inhalations of alkylating drug (melphalan) are effective in severe
      steroid-resistant bronchial asthma, a form of the disease often characterized by neutrophilic
      type of inflammation. The exacerbation frequency reduced after the treatment, steroid-sparing
      effect was shown, morphological signs of bronchial epithelial regeneration were revealed and
      quality of life of asthmatic patients, treated with ultra-low doses of melphalan, improved.
      In preclinical studies and studies with volunteers, it was found that inhalations of
      ultra-low doses of melphalan do not have cytotoxic properties, but have local and systemic
      anti-inflammatory effects and decrease the activation of lymphocytes due to blockade of heavy
      β-chain of the interleukin (IL)-2 surface receptor. In addition, in ultra-low concentrations,
      alkylating agents are able to disrupt the cell signalling through the receptor for tumor
      necrosis factor, thereby exerting a protective effect from the cytotoxic activity of tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which leads to the anti-inflammatory response. It can be assumed
      that the inhalation use of ultra-low doses of melphalan can be effective in patients with
      bronchiectasis, as in a disease characterized by a neutrophilic type of inflammation, leading
      to the improvement of quality of life, increasing the time to the first exacerbation and
      decreasing of exacerbation frequency.
