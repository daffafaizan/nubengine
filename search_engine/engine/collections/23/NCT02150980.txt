    
      Number of Participants:

      40,000

      Primary Research Objectives:

      To determine among adult individuals admitted to hospital with musculoskeletal trauma (e.g.
      fractures or dislocations):

        1. The incidence of major complications (mortality, re-operation and infection) as a
           composite outcome and as individual components within 30 days post-hospital admission.

        2. The factors (system and patient variables) associated with the composite of major
           complications (mortality, re-operation and infection) within 30 days post-hospital
           admission.

      Secondary Research Objective:

      To determine the rates of major complications within 30 days post-hospital admission by type
      of fracture treatment provided (e.g. splinting versus operative fixation).

      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:

      This study has minimal exclusion criteria by design. All patients 18 years of age or older
      admitted to a recruiting hospital for treatment of an orthopaedic injury that occurred within
      3 months will be eligible for participation. Patients who are diagnosed with an orthopaedic
      fracture, dislocation, or fracture dislocation of the appendicular skeleton or spine will be
      included.

      Study Outcomes:

      The primary outcome is mortality within 30 days from hospital admission. The secondary
      outcomes are re-operation and infection within 30 days from hospital admission.

      Duration of Patient Follow-Up:

      Study participants will be followed until 30 days post hospital admission.
