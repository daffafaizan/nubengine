      Tomography - Computed Tomography (PET- CT) will be performed before and after gefitinib to
      assess the response. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and plasma Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      will be acquired at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after gefitinib treatment. Resected tumor
      will be sectored in details to study the spatial heterogeneity.
