      proteomic profile/pattern in blood that can distinguish men with a clinically
      insignificant/latent prostate cancer from men with more advanced pathological features? We
      will obtain a pre-operative blood sample from men with clinically localized prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy and determine their preoperative small peptide mass
      proteomic profile. The pathological features of the radical prostatectomy will be determined
      and the patient will be classified as having either a pathologically insignificant/latent
      prostate cancer or a significant cancer. We will then analyze whether or not the small
      peptide mass proteomic profile in blood can distinguish these groups before radical
      prostatectomy. In addition, each of these patients will have a blood sample collected at
      least 6 weeks to 12 months after surgery to evaluate and compare changes that occur as a
      result of radical prostatectomy. This will determine the effect of radical prostatectomy on
      the small peptide mass proteomic profile in blood and determine if the proteomic profiles in
      blood collected prior to radical prostatectomy can identify men at increased risk for
      recurrence.
