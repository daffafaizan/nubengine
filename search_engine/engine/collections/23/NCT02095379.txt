    
      Oligosecretary myeloma is a subgroup of multiple myeloma (MM) characterized by low levels of
      serum and urine monoclonal (M) protein below thresholds of measurable disease (a serum M
      protein ≥ 1g/dL, a urine M protein ≥ 200mg/day). Patients with oligosecretary myeloma do not
      have established methods for disease monitoring and clinical informations regarding
      oligosecretary myeloma are still largely unknown.

      In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical course of oligosecretary
      myeloma.
