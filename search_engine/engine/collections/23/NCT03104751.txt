      have adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes following neonatal treatment for CCHD and to develop
      and test interventions that can be applied early in infancy. The necessary first step is to
      systematically describe early neurodevelopment using a complementary set of observational and
      neurophysiological measures that may predict cognitive and motor delays earlier than
      currently possible for infants with CCHD. Each measure provides unique information about
      development and will include (1) neuroimaging for brain maturity and brain injury, (2) hair
      and fingernails for cortisol and saliva for immune system function, (3) heart rate
      variability (HRV) for autonomic nervous system function (ANS), (4) Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development (BSID-III) for cognitive and motor function, (5) a naturalistic play session
      incorporating kicking, general movement analysis, or the Test of Infant Motor Performance
      (TIMP) for motor development, and (6) the mobile paradigm for learning, memory, and
      task-specific coordination. The investigators will look at types of relationships among these
      measures within each time point for description of development and across each time point for
      prediction of development. The investigators' core hypotheses are that infants with CCHD will
      have measurable deficits in cognitive and motor development birth to ~ 6 months of age when
      compared with a healthy control group and that a typology developed from neurodevelopmental
      measures will reliably predict cognitive and motor delay in the first six months of life in
      infants with CCHD.
