      Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are
      at risk for developing tumors in a number of organs, including the brain, spine, adrenal
      glands, eyes and pancreas.

      The molecular hallmark of VHL is inactivation of the VHL gene which leads to accumulation of
      the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF); this, in turn results in overexpression of several genes
      including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1),
      transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-Î±), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and
      erythropoietin, which play an important role in tumorigenesis, tumor growth and metastasis.

      17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) is an inhibitor of the cellular chaperone heat
      shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and its interaction with Hsp90 leads to destabilization and
      degradation of several proteins, that depend on Hsp90 for their stability.

      The alpha subunit of HIF1 is one such Hsp90 client protein' and is susceptible to VHL
      independent, 17AAG-induced degradation.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of 17 AAG administered as a single agent in von Hippel Lindau
      patients with renal tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial is response of renal tumors
      following 3 cycles of therapy.

      To study the safety and tolerability of 17 AAG. To evaluate PD modulation of hsp90, and to
      explore the utility dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in evaluation of blood flow and metabolic
      changes in renal tumors before and during therapy

      Eligibility:

      Adults with clinical diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease Presence of one or more localized
      renal tumors for which surgical resection would be considered the standard approach

      Design:

      Patients will receive 17 AAG as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 300mg/m(2) on days 1, 8,
      and 15 of 28 day cycles.

      The study will follow a two-stage MinMax phase II design and will accrue a maximum of 26
      patients.
