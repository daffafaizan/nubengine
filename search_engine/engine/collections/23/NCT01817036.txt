      concentration ≥75 nmol/L appeared to be optimal for preventing cardiometabolic diseases and
      improving bone health. To achieve this goal, a daily intake of 1000 IU or equivalent amount
      from other sources, is needed, which is twice as much as the RDA recommended by Chinese
      Nutrition Society. Meanwhile,epidemiological evidences show that large proportions of Chinese
      may suffer vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency whereas the current RDA in China might be
      too low to provide adequate vitamin D for people's health.

      In order to fill up this gap, therefore, it is essential to determine the dose-response
      between the doses of vitamin D3 supplements and raised serum levels of 25(OH)D and also the
      dose of vitamin D3 required to achieve circulating 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L.Ultimately, the
      current study will provide important evidence for establishing optimal vitamin D requirement
      for Chinese people
