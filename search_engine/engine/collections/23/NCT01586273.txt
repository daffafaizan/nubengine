    
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a
      non-invasive outpatient modality. In MR-HIFU, a specially designed ultrasound transducer is
      used to focus a beam of ultrasound energy into a small volume at a specific target site in
      the body. The focused beam is intended to produce therapeutic hyperthermia in the target
      field while only harmlessly warming the immediately surrounding tissue. Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging is used during the ultrasound treatment, both to focus the ultrasound beam on the
      target field and to perform real-time thermal mapping at and around the target.

      The Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU system is expected to be efficacious in reducing pain scores in
      patients with painful bone metastases and in reducing their pain medication usage.
