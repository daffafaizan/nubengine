    
      A total of 24 patients with non-pustular palmoplantar psoriasis affecting at least 10% of the
      combined palms and soles area and with a modified palmoplantar pustulosis area severity index
      (m-PPPASI) of at least 8 will be recruited. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive
      either infliximab 5 mg/kg or placebo (normal saline) on weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients assigned
      to placebo during the first 3 infusions will receive infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 14, 16 and
      20 and placebo again at week 22 while patients who were assigned to receive infliximab during
      the first 3 infusions will receive infliximab at week 14 and placebo at week 16 and week 20
      as well as infliximab for the last infusion at week 22. The primary endpoint will be at week
      14. Patients will come back to the clinic at week 26 for a final efficacy and safety
      assessment.

      Efficacy will be evaluated by assessing psoriasis plaque severity on palms and soles
      (physician's global assessment PGA), percentage of palms and soles area affected by psoriasis
      (palmoplantar surface area - PPSA) as well as m-PPPASI (modified palmoplantar pustulosis area
      and severity index). Quality of life will be evaluated at every visit by performing the
      dermatology life quality index DLQI. Safety will be evaluated by repeating chemistry and
      haematology laboratories at regular visits as well as by physical examinations and assessment
      of adverse events.
