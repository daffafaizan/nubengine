      as well. Like many other forms of tumor, it requires an independent blood supply to enlarge.
      This process, angiogenesis, is mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Several studies have confirmed that VEGF-C has a high level in
      patients with uterine leiomyomas, which has also been demonstrated that it was related to
      occurrence and growth of uterine leiomyomas because it's capable of promoting angiogenesis,
      mitogenic, and vascular permeability-enhancing activities. Also, some researchers suggested
      that suppression of prostaglandin synthesis (including PGE2) via cyclooxygenase type-2
      (COX-2) enzyme inhibition may reduce the incidence of some tumor. The aim of this study is to
      verify the effect of anesthetic technique on the change of postoperative serum VEGF-C and
      PGE2, and to explore the potential impact of the anesthetic technique on leiomyomas
      recurrence and growth after the surgery of abdominal myomectomy.
