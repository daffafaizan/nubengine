      Intensive Care Unit at Ohio State University Medical Center. In the intervention arm,
      respiratory therapists' will conduct oxygen titration with the help of a novel, high
      fidelity, electronic health records based, protocol consisting of electronic alerts and
      decision support tool. Oxygen titration in the control arm will be done without alerts and
      will be per "current standard of care".

      Participants for this study will be identified and recruited from patients admitted to the
      Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center and James Cancer Hospital, Medical Intensive
      Care Unit.
