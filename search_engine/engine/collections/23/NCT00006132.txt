      Patients are stratified according to disease (CNS disease with or without cutaneous
      involvement vs disseminated disease with CNS involvement).

      All patients receive acyclovir IV every 8 hours on days 1-21. On day 19, patients undergo a
      lumbar puncture and must have a negative CSF PCR to be randomized. If patients have a
      positive CSF PCR on day 19, they continue to receive acyclovir IV every 8 hours. Treatment
      continues every 7 days with a repeat CSF PCR on the fifth day until a negative CSF PCR result
      is achieved. Patients are then randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral acyclovir three times a day for 6 months. Arm II: Patients
      receive placebo. In case of cutaneous recurrence during the first 12 months of the study,
      patients receive open label oral acyclovir (if CSF PCR is negative) or acyclovir IV (if CSF
      PCR is positive) for 5 days. Patients may or may not continue on study drug following this
      treatment.

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of age.
