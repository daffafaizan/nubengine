      incorporating partnership and communication skills of providers. Two areas of importance are
      promotion of oral health and prevention of iron deficiency. Residents will be randomized to
      one of these two groups and will receive web-based education about that particular topic.
      Residents randomized to group 1 will receive training consisting of 7 modules: 3 on the
      Bright Futures concepts and 4 on oral health promotion. They will be trained in performing an
      oral health assessment, identifying caries, and encouraged to establish a dental home for
      patients. They must communicate with at least one dental practice in the community to
      determine barriers to care, issues regarding insurance, potential solutions to improve
      referral, and access to dental care. Residents in group 2 will complete a single educational
      module on the identification and prevention of iron deficiency. They will be trained to
      identify iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, understand risk prevention strategies,
      improved methods of identification, and treatment.

      Each resident will recruit 3 patients, children between the ages of 12-35 months, for whom
      he/she is the primary care provider. Each parent-child dyad will participate in one
      well-child care visit. Each visit will be observed by a faculty preceptor.

      This study design was chosen to compare a more sophisticated and time-intensive curriculum to
      a more modest one. By having a curriculum with minimal overlap between the two groups, the
      investigators hope to examine the knowledge obtained by the residents, which health promotion
      aspects they address during their encounters, and to compare the establishment of a dental
      home in the two groups of patients.
