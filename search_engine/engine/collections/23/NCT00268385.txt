    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic
      acid [SAHA]) in combination with temozolomide in patients with malignant gliomas.

      II. To characterize the safety profile of vorinostat (SAHA) in combination with temozolomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat (SAHA) in combination with
      temozolomide.

      II. To determine efficacy of vorinostat (SAHA) in combination with temozolomide as measured
      by objective response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association of response to treatment to the molecular phenotype of the
      tumor.

      II. To assess the effects of vorinostat (SAHA) on histone acetylation status in peripheral
      mononuclear cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      PART I: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-7
      and 15-21 OR QD or BID on days 1-7. Patients also receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in course 2, some patients may receive a higher dose of
      temozolomide. Treatment may continue beyond 13 courses at the discretion of the investigator.

      PART II: Patients receive vorinostat and temozolomide as in part 1*.

      [Note: *Beginning in course 2, all patients receive a higher dose of temozolomide.]

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
