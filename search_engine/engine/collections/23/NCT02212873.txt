      children aged from 6 months to 12 years showed a prevalence of 9.8% overweight and 11.8%
      obesity while in a more recent 2011 Global School-based Student Heath Survey showed that the
      percentage of overweight and obese Malaysian school children age 13-15 years old was 25.4%
      and 10.9% respectively . If left unchecked, these children will grow up to be obese adults,
      developed various obesity-related complications such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
      etc. Realising the urgent needs to address the problems, the Ministry of Health Malaysia with
      the cooperation of the Ministry of Education, proposed to implement MyBFF@school in all
      schools in Malaysia. Students participating in MyBFF@school will take part in a structured
      physical activity in the form of small sided football game (SSG), and are to attend
      intensified and interactive nutrition and psychology classes aimed at improving their
      knowledge, self-esteem and self-empowerment.
