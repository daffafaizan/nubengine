    
      Approach / methods: Based on our expertise in GMA and eye tracking, and a successful proof of
      principle (pilot experiment), we will conduct a series of experiments: GMA experts' eye
      movement patterns during clinical reasoning will be assessed to better understand the
      diagnostic category of poor-repertoire GMs (Experiment 1); benefits and potential
      difficulties of different modes of "seeing through the eyes of an expert"-approaches for
      GMA-training will be explored (Experiment 2); we shall evaluate enhancement of clinical
      reasoning as a result of intensive remote GMA training (Experiment 3).

      Level of originality / innovation: "Tracking general movements" will (1) contribute to better
      understand poor-repertoire GMs adding to the clinical necessity to closely follow infants in
      need for continuous or close-meshed clinical surveillance; (2) define the benefits of
      different modes/modalities of expert guidance for GMA, which will form the basis for
      innovative remote clinical GMA training; and (3) create a globally accessible database for
      remote clinical GMA refreshment-training and re-calibration.
