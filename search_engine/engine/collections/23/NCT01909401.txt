      genotype I Hepatitis C who are listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) will be
      enrolled. Those with hepatocellular carcinoma with or without treatment of hepatoma may also
      be included. The MELD score for enrollment will be capped at 16. Patients must have medically
      controlled ascites and those who have moderate or poorly controlled ascites will be excluded.

      Treatment Plan: Fifteen patients with chronic genotype I Hepatitis C will be enrolled. All
      patients will begin with peginterferon and ribavirin for 4 weeks with the addition of
      boceprevir after Week 4 until orthotopic liver transplantation. The dose of interferon will
      be peginterferon 1.0 mcg/kg with weight-based ribavirin (600-1200 mg) with boceprevir 800 mg
      TID (three times per day) until OLT. All patients will be listed for orthotopic liver
      transplantation. HCV RNA will be measured monthly. When they are called in for transplant,
      they will take their last dose of ribavirin just prior to going to operating room. Patients
      will undergo orthotopic liver transplantation under standard protocol by Indiana University.
      They will receive by Dobhoff boceprevir 800 tid for 3 doses post transplantation. Virologic
      failure will be HCV RNA > 100 I.U. at Week 12.
