    
      This randomized, multicenter study compares 2 parallel groups of patients with migraine :

        -  I: patients are treated with relaxation + medical treatment (beta-bloquant or
           Oxetorone)+ patients' education

        -  II: patients are treated only with medical treatment + patients' education.

      Visit 1 : 1 month before randomization for patient's selection and baseline data

      Visit 2 (J0): inclusion (randomization) During the first 2 months patients from group I
      benefit from relaxation consultations.

      Visit 3 (2 months after randomization)and visit 4 (4 months after randomization) : evaluation
      of the efficacy of the two treatment strategies.

      Primary endpoint :

      - number of days with migraine per month from J0 to visit 4.

      Secondary endpoints :

        -  monthly drug consumption

        -  percentage of patients who respond (50 % frequency reduction)

        -  quality of life (SF 36)

      Each day, patients note in a notebook if a migraine appears and its intensity.
