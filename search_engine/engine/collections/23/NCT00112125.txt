    
      IMPULSE Dynamics' FIX HF 5 US Study is a prospective, multi-center, study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signals delivered by the
      implantable OPTIMIZER™ System in patients with NYHA class III/IV heart failure. The study
      will involve the recruitment of approximately 420 subjects at a total of up to 50 sites
      nationwide.

      Those subjects who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria based upon baseline test
      results will be randomized to receive the OPTIMIZER™ System or to a control group. All
      subjects randomized will be followed for 1 year and shall receive the same study related
      assessments throughout the course of the study. In addition, all subjects will continue to
      receive optimal medical therapy for the treatment of their heart failure.

      The primary efficacy assessment consists of a change in exercise tolerance measured by
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and 6 months. Safety variables, such as the rate
      and cause of hospitalizations or death, shall be collected in both groups and shall be
      compared at 12 months.
