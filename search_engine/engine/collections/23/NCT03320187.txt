    
      Objectives: The primary outcome of the study is to compare the changes occurring to the
      cervix through the progression in the Bishop's score between NO donor (nitroglycerine patch)
      vs placebo; in combination with a well-established method of induction (Dinoprostone).

      The secondary objective of the study is to observe and report possible fetal and maternal
      side effects that may be associated. This will establish the safety and tolerability of NO
      donors.

      Research Question: Does the usage of Nitroglycerine skin patch enhance cervical ripening and
      facilitate induction of labor by Dinoprostone?

      Null hypothesis: Nitroglycerine skin patch does not cause advantage for ripening of the
      cervix nor facilitate the process of labor induction.

      Alternative hypothesis : Nitroglycerine skin patch has favorable effect in enhancing cervical
      ripening and the outcome of induction of labor.
