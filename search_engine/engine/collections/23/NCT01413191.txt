      I. To determine the response rate of metastatic uveal melanoma when treated with IMC-A12
      (cixutumumab).

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of IMC-A12 in patients with metastatic uveal
      melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the disease control rate of patients treated with IMC-A12. II. To determine
      the duration of response of patients treated with IMC-A12. III. To determine the
      progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with IMC-A12.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the presence of GNAQ and GNA11 mutations with response to IMC-A12.

      II. To correlate the expression of IGF-1R with response to IMC-A12. III. To determine the
      effect of IMC-A12 on expression of proteins involved in initiation, growth, and spread of
      uveal melanoma cells.

      IV. To determine resistance mechanisms to IMC-A12.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Archived and fresh tumor tissue and serum samples may be collected for correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
