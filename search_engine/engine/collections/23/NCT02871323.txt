      I. To determine the safety profile of anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) therapy in
      patients with myelofibrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Changes in MF symptom burden. II. Changes in spleen size. III. Blood and/or bone marrow
      samples.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of lymphocyte subset response to anti-PDL1 therapy, as measured by
      the percent increase in cluster of differentiation (CD)4+CD25+PD-L1+ T-lymphocytes and
      CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T lymphocytes in post-treatment peripheral blood samples.

      II. To characterize changes in the cytokine profile in response to anti-PDL1 therapy.

      III. To measure soluble PDL1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in post-treatment
      blood and/or bone marrow samples and programmed cell death-1 (PD1)/PDL1 by
      immunohistochemistry on bone marrow samples and correlate with treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD), no new inter-current illness, and
      no unacceptable toxicity, may continue treatment beyond 3 courses.

      Patients will be followed every 3 months for up to two years starting from Day 1.
