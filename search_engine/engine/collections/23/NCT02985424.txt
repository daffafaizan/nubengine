      Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) and Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) are common inflammatory
      conditions. The diagnosis of PMR/GCA poses many challenges since there are no specific
      diagnostic tests. Recent literature emphasizes the ability of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron
      Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) to assess global disease activity
      and/or inflammation burden. 18F-FDG PET/CT may lead to make diagnosis at an earlier stage
      than conventional imaging and assess response to therapy. With respect to the management of
      PMR/GCA, there are three significant areas of concern as follows: Vasculitis process/vascular
      stiffness, malignancy and osteoporosis.

      Methods and Analysis:

      Patients: All patients with the suspicion of PMR/GCR will be offered to participate in the
      study. The current protocol consists of 4 separate studies including: I) The association of
      clinical picture of PMR/GCA with PET detected vasculitis II) Evaluating validity of 18F-FDG
      PET/CT scan for diagnosis of PMR/GCA compared to temporal artery biopsy III) Incidence of new
      diagnosed malignancies in patients with PMR/GCA, or PMR like syndrome with the aim of PET/CT
      scan and Chest X ray/Abdominal ultrasound IV) Impact of disease process as well as steroid
      treatment on bone mineral density, body composition and vasculitis/vascular stiffness in
      PMR/GCA patients.
