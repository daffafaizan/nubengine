    
      The main goal of the project will be to characterize the evoked-force profile during
      conventional and WP-HF NMES.

      The secondary purpose will be to i) investigate the anatomic and metabolic responses of the
      human calf muscle following both NMES protocols by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      31-phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS-P31), ii) study the cortical responses
      for both conditions of stimulation by means of functional MRI (f-MRI).
