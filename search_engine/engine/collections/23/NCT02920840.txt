      8-16%. Many patients fail to achieve complete remission of symptoms under antidepressant
      medication, with about 10% of patients being chronically resistant to several
      psychopharmacological treatments. Development of alternative non-pharmacological treatments
      is therefore essential to improve patient care.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers therapeutic potential in this
      context. Current protocols apply high-frequency rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) to reverse the increased alpha-band oscillatory activity and cortical
      hypo-excitability in patients with depression. However, translation of rTMS therapy into
      routine clinical practice has been limited due to low efficacy and high inter-individual
      variability.

      This study aims to optimize rTMS stimulation protocols for MDD by deterministically coupling
      the timing of TMS to the ongoing oscillatory neural activity in the underlying cortex as
      measured in real-time with high-density surface EEG. It is hypothesized that alpha
      phase-locked rTMS of the left DLPFC reverses increased alpha-band oscillatory activity and
      cortical hypo-excitability more efficiently than current open-loop rTMS protocols used in the
      treatment of MDD.
