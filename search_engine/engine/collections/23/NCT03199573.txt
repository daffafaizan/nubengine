        1. To assess current exposure to sun and UV in programs of children participating in an
           early childhood educational program.

        2. To assess current policies regarding sun protection and sunscreen use in programs for
           early childhood education.

        3. To assess the current attitudes towards sun safety among caregivers and teachers in
           programs for early childhood education.

        4. To explore association of sun protective behaviors with risk factors such as
           socioeconomic status, per student classroom budget, program setting (i.e. urban,
           suburban, or rural), race/ethnicity, size of school program, school budget for supplies,
           and ages of children enrolled in program.

      The sample of stakeholders, who will be surveyed, is consistent with samples used in our
      prior research. A sample size of 250 phone interviews will be adequate to show trends in sun
      safety policies among early education programs. Power analysis is based on the use of sun
      protection, our primary outcome. Our preliminary data show that 15% of schools almost always
      or always schedule outdoor activities to avoid times when the sun was at peak intensity. The
      sample size required to sensitively detect a 20% difference in using sun protection between
      those that comply with recommendations and those that do not is 250 respondents assuming an
      alpha < 0.05 and power >= 0.8 in a two-tailed test on a two-group sample. This sample size
      will adequately power the study for detecting 30% difference in sun protection use between
      the two groups.
