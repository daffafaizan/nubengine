      controlled study design. The trial will be conducted at the Intensive Care Unit of the Puerto
      Rico Trauma Hospital located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Patients with clinical and
      microbiological evidence of an Multi-drug resistant infection related to Hospital-acquired
      pneumonia (HAP), Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Complicated Urinary tract infection
      (cUTI) or Bloodstream infection (BSI) will be considered candidates for the study. The
      pathogen should be resistant to all antibiotics except to polymyxin B. With a predicted
      survival rate of 67% (hazard ratio of 0.33), a significance of Î± = 0.05, power of 80%, and
      assuming a dropout rate of 15%, the estimated sample size is n = 40 patients (20 per group).
      In terms of safety, the most clinically relevant adverse effects are nephrotoxicity and
      neurotoxicity, which will be evaluated and adjudicated. The recurrence of infection will be
      defined as a new superinfection by the same or other species than the initial infection that
      is multidrug-resistant. Length of stay at the Hospital will be measured from the day of
      admission until the day of discharge. Length of stay in the ICU will be measured from the day
      of admission until the day of discharge from the unit. To our knowledge, this will be the
      first prospective, double blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial in representation of
      the critically ill trauma patients infected with Multi-drug resistant pathogens.
