    
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) providing access to quizartinib for participants
      with Relapsed/Refractory FLT3-ITD mutated AML, prior to approval by local regulatory
      agencies. Availability of the EAP is dependent upon physician request, country eligibility
      and local/country regulations. EAP countries included Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark,
      France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,
      Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States. Physicians may request
      access to the EAP for participants who they feel may benefit from quizartinib and meet the
      eligibility criteria.

      Participants may continue quizartinib until there is a lack of clinical benefit or the
      occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. Treatment should be interrupted for allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but may be resumed after the transplant.

      Participant enrollment may continue until 18 months after regulatory approval, depending on
      country regulation; or until such time the marketed medication is available, whichever occurs
      first.

      Participants will be asked to follow the care as outlined by their treating physician.
      Participants will be followed for 30 days after their final treatment or until the patient is
      transitioned to commercially available product. Physicians will be required to report safety
      data to Daiichi-Sankyo Inc.

      Quizartinib is currently under development for the treatment of patients 18 years of age or
      older with relapsed (including after HSCT) or refractory FLT3-ITD mutated AML, and has been
      granted Fast Track Status in the US and an Orphan Drug Indication in the United States,
      Europe and Asia.
