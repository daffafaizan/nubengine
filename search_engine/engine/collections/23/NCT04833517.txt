      advanced prostate cancer, either targeting bone metastases (mainly using Radium-223), any
      type of metastases with PSMA-expression (Lutetium-177 and Actinium-225 labelled radioligands)
      or loco-regionally applying internal radiation (Yttrium-90 microspheres) to metastatic liver
      disease. While in Germany, each form of treatment is used in clinical routine, data is sparse
      regarding the real benefits and risks of respective modalities, also when used in a
      sequential order. As an example, patients receiving Ra223 treatment may later undergo PSMA
      targeted radioligand therapy, with little data available on dependent response relationships
      or cumulative risks. Prospective assessment of outcomes and toxicities in a radionuclide
      therapy registry is apparently superior over retrospective analyses of selected patient
      populations.

      The goal of the REALITY study is to gain a better understanding of the real-life clinical
      application of radionuclide therapies, with a focus on PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in a
      high-volume treatment centre, and the impact of each treatment for patient outcome.

      Based on primary and secondary outcome measures the potential prediction of treatment benefit
      by baseline patient and tumor characteristics, and early changes of biomarkers will be of
      interest.
