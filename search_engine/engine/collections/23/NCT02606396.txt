      gastrointestinal tract. EC involves the endoscopic application of cryogen [liquid nitrogen
      (LN)], which destroys tissue by rapid freezing and slow thawing. Immediate effects from
      tissue freezing include failure of cellular metabolism, membrane damage and local ischemia.
      Delayed effects may include apoptosis of cancer cells and immune mediated tumor destruction.
      EC has been used for the treatment of mucosal EAC and palliation of malignant dysphagia since
      2007 in multiple tertiary centers, including Washington University in St Louis, with positive
      results. EC is an attractive modality for the palliation of malignant dysphagia in EAC due to
      the fact that newly diagnosed patients undergo upper endoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS) as part of initial staging; thus EC could be delivered at the time of the
      staging endoscopy, without burdening the patient with an additional procedure. However,
      prospective studies on the efficacy of EC in the short term palliation of malignant dysphagia
      in EAC have not been performed.

      Thus, the goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of EC in the short term
      palliation of malignant dysphagia in patients with unresectable EAC.
