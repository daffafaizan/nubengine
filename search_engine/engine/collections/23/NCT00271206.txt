      try to quit smoking each year, but less than 7 percent are successful. Many smokers report a
      "high" sensation, followed by a feeling of relaxation. Such positive reinforcement factors,
      combined with nicotine cravings, make it difficult to stop the use of nicotine products. Past
      research has suggested that women may experience fewer nicotine cravings and may be less
      affected by smoking's positive reinforcement factors when compared to men. Fluctuations in
      levels of the female hormones estradiol and progesterone during menstruation may play a role
      in determining how women are affected by nicotine. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the effects of a controlled oral dose of progesterone on smoking behavior, nicotine
      withdrawal symptoms, and nicotine-related positive reinforcement factors in nicotine
      dependent males and females.

      In this 4-day study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 200 mg
      of progesterone, 400 mg of progesterone, or placebo. All participants will abstain from
      smoking for Days 1 through 3. On Day 4, participants will take part in a smoking session,
      during which their smoking habits, including the number of puffs, duration of puffs, and
      number of cigarettes smoked, will be measured. Outcome measurements will include self-reports
      of cravings; carbon monoxide monitoring; and standardized questionnaires to assess nicotine
      withdrawal symptoms.

      This study has been completed with 35 men and 30 women. With the final women completing in
      March of 2008. This protocol is complete and has been published.
