      optimizing health care delivery, and re-engineering delivery systems to maximize case
      identification, as well as access and sustained engagement in antiretroviral treatment.
      Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST) provides a critical opportunity for HIV testing and
      linkage to antiretroviral treatment. The EHOST study is a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge
      trial to evaluate a prescriber-focused intervention to increase HIV testing rates, and
      optimize antiretroviral treatment re-engagement and retention outcomes among individuals
      engaged in OST. The study will encompass all drug treatment clinics currently admitting
      patients for the treatment of opioid dependence across the province of British Columbia,
      which are thought to treat 90% of the OST caseload. The trial will be executed over a
      24-month period, with groups of clinics receiving the intervention in 6-month intervals.
      Evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed intervention will be conducted entirely
      through existing data collection mechanisms, and focuses on three primary outcomes: (i) the
      HIV testing rate among those not known to be HIV positive; (ii) the rate of Highly Active
      Antiretroviral (HAART) initiation among those not on HAART; and (iii) the rate of HAART
      continuation among those on HAART. Despite the randomized delivery of the intervention, a
      difference-in-differences analytical framework will be applied to adjust for potential
      residual heterogeneity in patient case mix, volume, and quality of care across OST clinics.
      Facilitated by established collaborations between key stakeholders across the province, we
      hypothesize that the EHOST intervention will optimize HIV testing and care within this
      marginalized and hard-to-reach population.
