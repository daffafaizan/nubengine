      placed in magnet mode during the time the IMED-4 is activated. The IMED-4 will be activated
      for a time not to exceed 15 minutes. During the time the IMED-4 is active, the CRM device
      programmer will print the voltage sensing of the implanted lead in real-time. The printout
      will be examined for the presence of far-field sensing artifacts.
