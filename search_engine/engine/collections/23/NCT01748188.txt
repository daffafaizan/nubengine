    
      It is a question of valuing the decrease of the pain (by means of the visual analogic scale
      pain score) and the increase of the functionality of the joint (by means of Dash and Constant
      scores) of three different treatments from physical therapy to establish the most effective
      protocol for the treatment of the subacromial syndrome.

      Determine the best physiotherapy treatment for subacromial syndrome with 20 sessions of
      different treatments.

      A group will receive the conventional treatment with ultrasounds without drugs, another group
      will receive dexketoprofen by phonophoresis and the third group will receive dexketoprofen by
      iontophoresis.
