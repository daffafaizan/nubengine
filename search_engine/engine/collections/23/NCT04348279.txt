      palatal soft tissue graft. During the last decades, several materials were used to avoid
      protect against the post-operative problems as bleeding, pain and possible infections. The
      aim of this randomized clinical trial was to assess the usage of polypropylene mesh, compared
      to the conventional custom-made acrylic stent for efficacy in protection of the palatal wound
      and reducing the bleeding tendency and post-operative pain.

      Patients and methods: A single blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial took
      place. Twenty sites were approved to be treated using soft tissue grafting technique with the
      need for a palatally harvested free graft. The palatal wounds were protected with propylene
      mesh and custom-made acrylic palatal sten. Participants were qualitatively assessed for
      bleeding duration, bleeding amount, pain duration, infection possibility, inflammation at 2,
      4, 6, 8, 14 days post-operatively. The patient acceptance was also evaluated.
