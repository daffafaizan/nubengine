      the correlation between genotype (genetic constitution) and phenotype (observable
      characteristics) of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) in children
      diagnosed with LINCL in all stages. LINCL is a form of Batten disease that affects the brain
      of children and prevents it from functioning properly. These children are born with genetic
      changes called mutations that result in the inability of the brain to properly recycle
      proteins in the brain. The recycling failure leads to death of the nerve cells in the brain
      and progressive loss of brain function. Children with Batten disease are normal at birth but
      by age 2 to 4 have motor and vision problems which progress rapidly to death at age
      approximately 10 years old. There are no therapies available to treat the disease. This study
      is designed to run parallel to the gene transfer protocol, which will include 16 individuals
      in two groups: Group A will receive 9.0x10^11 genome copies (gc) of the vector and Group B
      will receive 2.85x10^11 gc; we anticipate that we will be able to capture a one-time genotype
      - phenotype snapshot for all n=32, and an 18 months genotype - phenotype progression
      assessment for n=16.
