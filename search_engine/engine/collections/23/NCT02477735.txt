      Effusion (COME) who will be referred for tympanostomy tube insertion (TTI) (study group) and
      healthy infants that were recruited from the community well-baby clinics (control group).

      To evaluate sleep patterns, parents of the study group will complete two validated sleep
      questionnaires assessing the infant's typical sleep patterns based on parental reports. A
      week before TTI and 1 week to 1 month after the surgery, sleep will be evaluate by actigraph
      for a week long.
