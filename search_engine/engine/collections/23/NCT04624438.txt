      experimental groups or the control group was used. Quadriceps femoris (QF) function and
      cortical excitability were assessed on four occasions: prior to the intervention (pre-test),
      after 3 weeks of training (served for the adjustment of exercise intensity), after 6 weeks of
      training (post-test), and three weeks after the competition of training intervention
      (detraining) (Figure 1). Isometric strength training involves activation of QF applying EMS,
      VOLUNTARY, or the combination of both EMS and VOLUNTARY (COMBINED). The pre-test also served
      to familiarize participants with the training protocols and to determine the intensity of EMS
      needed to achieve 60%MVC. Quadriceps femoris (QF) function was assessed by MVC and RFD-SF.
      Cortical excitability was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the M1
      region. Prior to the pretest, body mass and percent of body fat were assessed using a
      bioelectric impedance method (In Body 720; USA) and body height with a standard stadiometer.
      After the pretest, the participants were randomly assigned to either one of the experimental
      groups (EMS, VOLUNTARY, or COMBINED) and the control group (CONTROL). Experimental groups
      performed unilateral isometric strength training three times per week for 6 weeks. All
      participants were advised to refrain from all resistance training targeting the legs between
      pre-test and post-test.
