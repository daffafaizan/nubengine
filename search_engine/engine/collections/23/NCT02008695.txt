      faced with significant challenges for rebuilding participants' futures. Developing,
      implementing and evaluating microfinance programs that combine youth and adults is an
      innovative strategy to assist households and community efforts by focusing on existing
      strengths. The study will advance knowledge for youth, families and communities impacted by
      armed conflicts in six critical areas:

        -  1) increase the investigators' knowledge of youth and adult resilience (mental and
           physical health, family functioning, social capital) in context of multiple adversities;

        -  2) measurement of resilience from a social ecological and longitudinal, mixed-method
           perspective;

        -  3) expand investigators' understanding of resilience to develop prevention interventions
           for youth in early adolescence (ages 10-15 years), an important time to develop healthy
           transitions to young adulthood (ages 15-10 years);

        -  4) test a youth-led microfinance program combined with an existing and successful adult
           microfinance program, Pigs For Peace (PFP), that is sustainable and appropriate to the
           context of a war-affected population;

        -  5) detail resources and infrastructure needed for conducting research in challenging
           field settings with diverse cultures and languages as well as with limited resources,
           such as access to mental health professionals;

        -  6) provide guidelines for the ethical conduct of research in settings where participants
           of diverse ages and backgrounds may have limited knowledge of human rights and ethical
           research concepts, such as informed consent and assent.
