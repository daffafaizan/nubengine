      and overall recovery. Numerous multimodal pain management strategies have been employed with
      varying success; however, narcotics remain the mainstay of treatment. Beyond the acute side
      effects of narcotics, including altered mental status, depression of respiratory drive, and
      constipation, there is a substantial risk of long term dependency. Recently, loco-regional
      blockade and non-narcotic adjuncts have received increasing support within the literature.
      Gabapentin has been used extensively as a non-narcotic adjunct to analgesia regimens in the
      acute and chronic settings, however its ability to better control pain secondary to traumatic
      rib fractures has never been studied .

      The primary aim is to assess the efficacy of gabapentin as an analgesic after rib fractures.
      Secondary aims are to assess the effect on pulmonary function and other known complications
      following rib fractures.

      The hypothesis is gabapentin will improve pain control as measured by lower pain scores and
      lower narcotic needs. The investigators plan to test this hypothesis by recruiting trauma
      patients with rib fractures, and randomly assign them to gabapentin versus a placebo.
