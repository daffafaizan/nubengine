        -  Compare the overall response rate, failure-free survival, and survival of patients with
           inoperable stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel and
           carboplatin with concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D XRT) vs
           gemcitabine and carboplatin with concurrent 3-D XRT.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the pattern of failure (locoregional vs distant failure) in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Determine the feasibility of delivering 3-D XRT to patients in this multicenter study.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients then receive
           paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once weekly and
           3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D XRT) once daily 5 days a week. Treatment
           repeats weekly for 7 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by
           carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses.
           Patients then receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes twice weekly and 3-D XRT as in arm
           I. Treatment repeats weekly for 7 courses.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years, and then
      annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 82 patients (41 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 9 months.
