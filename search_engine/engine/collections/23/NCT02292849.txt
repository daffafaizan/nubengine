      increased screening in the older adult population, detection of depression has increased
      which has established a growing need for mental health resources. Unfortunately, there are
      limited resources to keep up with the steady increase of individuals in need. Training peers
      to work with older depressed adults in techniques such as behavioral activation provides an
      alternative model to help moderate the increased need and provide a unique intervention of
      care. Developing an innovative peer facilitated program has the potential to enhance the
      delivery of quality health care.

      The specific aims of the study are 1) to train peer coaches and implement Peer to Peer in the
      community 2) to examine depression ratings over time.
