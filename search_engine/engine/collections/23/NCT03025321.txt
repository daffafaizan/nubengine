      cathodal/right anodal) over the DLPFC after one week in detox. The participants will receive
      this two times daily for 5 consecutive days. It is expected that this particular tDCS method
      will reduce relapse probability, as was previously seen in alcohol addicted patients.
      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that this therapeutic effect is associated with diminished
      craving and enhanced cognitive control. Craving, temptations and relapse, will be explored by
      means of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The mixed results in previous studies of tDCS
      on craving may be explained by the fact that craving in addiction is a momentary phenomenon
      which is difficult to reliably measure with more traditional methods like retrospective
      self-reports, for which EMA provides a solution. Cognitive control will be measured by means
      of inhibitory control during a Go/NoGo task and reward processing during a gambling task. The
      tasks will be performed at baseline, one day after the tDCS sessions and at three months
      follow up.
