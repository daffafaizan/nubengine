    
      Lipedema is associated with reduced quality of life of patients due to persistent pain (in
      stages I, II or III).

      Because the biological cause of lipedema is not known, there is no basic specific therapy.

      The Treatment with complex decongestive therapy is lengthy and usually does not lead to a
      significant improvement in the lipedema of the legs.

      An alternative may be given by the surgical treatment by means of liposuction.

      However, there are currently only low meaningful data from published studies, which show a
      potential for the effectiveness of surgical treatment of lipedema.

      A direct comparison of the Liposuction with complex decongestive therapy in a randomized,
      controlled, multicentre study is necessary to establish a meaningful database.

      The purpose is to determine whether surgical therapy of lipedema (stage I, II or III) using
      Liposuction the pain in the legs compared to the use of complex decongestive therapy relevant
      improved.

      The primary endpoint is the relevant reduction in the average pain of last four weeks in the
      legs (â‰¥ 2 points on a numerical rating scale; German Pain Questionnaire) 12 months after
      completed liposuction treatment (intervention group) or after randomisation (control group)
      compared to the time of randomization.
