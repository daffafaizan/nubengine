      study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma who will be
      treated with gemcitabine or other nucleoside analogs. Study participants will receive an IV
      injection of 2.59 MBq/kg Â± 10% of [18]F-FLT (range: 100 to 350 MBq). If clinically indicated,
      dynamic PET scan imaging may start immediately before the injection, followed by half-body or
      limited frame scanning, using either a PET/CT or PET scanner. The first [18]F-FLT PET scan
      for each subject will occur within 4 weeks prior to commencement of his/her treatment. Study
      subjects will have a follow-up [18]F-FLT-PET scan at the time of disease progression, to a
      maximum of two [18]F-FLT PET scans. The same imaging procedure will be followed for both
      [18]F-FLT PET scans. At the same time as the [18]F-FLT PET scans occur, the patients' index
      tumour lesions will be re-evaluated by the same imaging modality originally used to assess
      the index lesions. Images will be interpreted by an experienced Nuclear Medicine physician
      with regard to normal physiological uptake of [18]F-FLT (RUS, SUV, and T/B). The location and
      relative uptake of normal and abnormal [18]F-FLT biodistribution patterns will be noted and
      correlated with time to disease progression and hENT1 expression in biopsy samples, where
      available. A medical chart review will be done at regular intervals to assess response to
      treatment, time to disease progression, and overall survival. Disease progression will be
      determined using the National Cancer Institute's Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
      Tumours (RECIST).
