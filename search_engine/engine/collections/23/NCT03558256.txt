      clinical trial with 70 MDD cases and 35 matched normal controls.After signed the Informed
      consents, MDD cases will be assigned to two groups randomly by the table generated by
      Microsoft Excel 2010 to ensure the random distribution between groups. The group of each
      patient will be allotted by the research coordinator so that evaluators will be blind about
      it, and patients will be asked to not mention the intervention conditions to evaluators.

      As the research tools, a range of self-rating scales, other-rating scales and behavioral
      tests and EEG will be mainly applied to assess clinical symptoms and brain state of
      participants at baseline (week 0), during the intervention (week 2, 4 and 6), at the end of
      the intervention (week 8), and during the maintenance phase (week 12, 20 and 32).

      After 8-week intervention, all of the participants including MDD cases and normal controls
      will enter the follow-up. Participants of medication group will continue their treatment
      options without changing the types and doses of medication compared with what they used in
      the intervention period. MBCT group is the same that participants will maintain their
      medication treatment and practice MBCT exercises at home.
