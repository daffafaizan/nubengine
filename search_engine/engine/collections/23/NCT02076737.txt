      as CT and abdominal radiography.

      Abdominal MDCT(MultiDetector Computed Tomography) without injection is the gold standard in
      diagnosis of acute flank pain suspect of renal colic due to high sensitivity (96%) and
      excellent specificity (100%).

      The increased use of medical imaging examinations using ionizing radiation (+57 % between
      2002 and 2007) makes it essential to optimize protocols, including CT-scans which represents
      10.1 % of procedures and 58 % of the collective effective dose.

      Model-based iterative reconstruction (MB-IR VEOTM) (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) can use a
      low dose acquisition, reducing the effective dose delivered to the patient almost 80%
      comparing a standard CT with the last algorithm: adaptative statistical iterative
      reconstruction (ASIR).

      MB-IR VEOTM shows great potential for substantially reducing radiation doses at routine
      abdominal CT. ASIR is limited in this regard owing to reduced image quality and diagnostic
      capability. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal dose level for
      MBIR(Model Base Iterative Reconstruction) that maintains adequate diagnostic performance. In
      general, objective and subjective image quality measurements do not necessarily correlate
      with diagnostic performance at ultralow-dose CT.

      Objective:

      Prospective clinical study, equivalence between two CT protocols for the diagnosis of acute
      renal colic.

      Show that a low dose acquisition with model based iterative reconstruction (MB-IR VeoTM) is
      as good as a standard CT with adaptative statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the
      diagnosis acute renal colic
