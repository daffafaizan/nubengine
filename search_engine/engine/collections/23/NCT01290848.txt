      Uxbridge and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario. The Durham Region Health Department,
      the Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport, and 35 schools and community organizations have
      also agreed to collaborate on project activities. The health promotion campaign will occur
      from October 15, 2010 until May 31, 2011. The campaign activities were developed from the
      input of parents and programme/care providers gathered during the planning phase of this
      research.

      The impact of the Take TIME campaign will be evaluated in two ways. The overall readiness of
      the community to support healthy childhoods will be evaluated using the Community Readiness
      Model, which relies on a series of interviews with key individuals in leadership positions.
      Awareness and current behaviour among community members will be assessed through the
      completion of telephone surveys of randomly selected households. Each of these evaluations
      will be completed twice, before and after delivery of the Take TIME campaign. The
      pre-campaign evaluations will be completed in September 2010. The post-campaign evaluations,
      using the same procedures, will be completed in June 2011.
