      will already be scheduled for colposcopy to detect or treat lesions of the cervix. (A
      colposcopy is an exam of the vagina and cervix using a magnifying lens).

      DCF will be done during the routine colposcopy in the outpatient clinic. A digital colposcope
      (DC) device will be used to take a sequence of images of the cervix and vagina. (A DC is a
      digital camera connected to the colposcope with a specialized light source. It will shine
      light on the cervix and acquire a sequence images). The images will tell doctors about the
      cells and structure of the tissue. After the first set of images, acetic acid will be applied
      to the cervix so that lesions show up better, and 1-2 minutes later more readings will be
      taken.

      Small samples of areas of abnormal tissue will be removed during colposcopy. Taking these
      tissue samples is a routine part of this type of exam. If patients are having colposcopy and
      loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP treatment, one sample of normal tissue will be
      taken. (The cervix will be numbed for this procedure.) DCF images will be compared with lab
      findings from these samples. Before DCF is done, as standard of care, patients will have a
      complete history and physical exam, urine pregnancy test, pap smear, and cultures for
      gonorrhea, chlamydia and viral testing.

      This is an investigational study. About 114 women will take part in this study. About 22 will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
