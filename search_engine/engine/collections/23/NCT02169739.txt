      standard medical therapy for 2 years. In addition, the investigators will randomly assign 40
      patients to undergo daily active remote ischemic preconditioning for 1 year, and 20 patients
      to 1 year of standard medical therapy followed by 1 year of daily active remote ischemic
      preconditioning. Patient structured interviews will be performed to assess if the treatment
      is well tolerated and easy for stroke patients to use. Magnetic resonance (MR) pictures of
      the brain will be used to determine if the active treatment stops the progression of brain
      injury. Cognitive tests and wireless sensor technology measures will used to learn what
      happens to the patient's brain and body during the active treatment.

      After a subject consents to participate in the study, he/she will first participate in a
      study screening phase to ensure a basic level of tolerability of Remote Ischemic Conditioning
      (autoRICâ„¢) device. The subject will undergo one full cycle of treatment under observation of
      the study team, including 4 cycles of alternating 5 minute inflation and 5 minute off periods

      If the subject indicates willingness to continue receiving such treatment (screening
      success), she/she will enter the randomized trial phase, and be randomly allocated to the
      treatment or control group.

      If subject indicates unwillingness to continue receiving such treatment (screening failure),
      he/she will not advance to the randomized phase of the trial. Screen failure subjects will be
      followed up with a 3-day post-device screening phone call to ensure safety and obtain
      information regarding any adverse events.
