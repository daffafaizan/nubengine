    
      This is a Phase 1, single center, double-blind (study in which neither the researchers nor
      the participants know what treatment the participants are receiving), placebo-controlled
      (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to placebo treatment),
      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance) study in healthy Japanese
      adult participants residing outside of Japan. The study will consist of a Screening phase, an
      In-clinic treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. The study duration for each participant
      will be approximately 6 weeks from Screening (Day -28 to Day -2) to follow up visit (Day 10
      to 14). Participants will be randomly assign to receive JNJ 53718678 or placebo, at planned
      dose of 250, 500 and 1000 milligram (mg). Planned doses will be stepwise escalated, if the
      safety and tolerability of the preceding dose(s) are found to be acceptable, and the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is not reached. De-escalation may be performed in order to study an
      intermediate dose. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JNJ-53718678
      will primarily be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
