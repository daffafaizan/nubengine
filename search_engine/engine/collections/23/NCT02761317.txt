      cleansing is critical for adequate visualization of colonic mucosa during colonoscopy.
      Inadequate bowel cleansing results in adverse consequences for the examination, including
      lower adenoma detection rates, longer procedural time, lower cecal intubation rates, shorter
      intervals between examinations and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost.
      A history of colorectal resection represents an independent predictor for inadequate colon
      cleansing,hence strategies to improve bowel preparation may be a demanding goal in this
      subset of patients.

      The study compares the efficacy of bowel cleansing between the standard preparation (2 L
      polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, 2 L PEG-ELS), low-volume preparation (10 mg
      bisacodyl plus 2 L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution) and high-volume preparation (4L
      polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, 4L PEG-ELS) in patients with previous colorectal
      resection. Then the investigators can select the optimized regimen for patients with
      colorectal surgery.
