      Arterial conduits in liver transplantation are almost as old as the procedure itself. First
      described by Starzl in 1984, the knowledge remains superficial. Although rarely performed,
      there is no doubt that thousands of patients' lives were saved because of the use of arterial
      grafts. However, arterial grafts are known to be associated with a higher rate of occlusion
      and a lower patient and graft survival when compared to conventional end-to-end anastomosis.
      In our recent retrospective study, the investigators showed that retransplantation procedure
      and aspirin in patients' medication are independent risk factors for the need of an arterial
      conduit. The investigators assume that aspirin could be a surrogate marker for vascular and
      metabolic status. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis the investigators found a four times higher
      occlusion rate compared to non-conduits.

      Whether the site of conduit placement or certain types of material have an impact on
      occlusion and graft survival remains unknown. In addition, several studies discuss that
      antiaggregation or anticoagulation might be protective for occlusion of arterial conduits.
      Currently, there is no study that investigated this problem, most probably because of low
      case numbers.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      The primary goal of this study is to conduct a multicenter cohort analysis to define the
      outcome of different types of conduits and to investigate whether antiplatelet /
      anticoagulantion has an impact on patency rates.

        1. Specific aim #1: To identify independent risk factors for early and late occlusion of
           arterial conduits in liver transplantation.

        2. Specific aim #2: To compare different placement sites (infrarenal, supraceliac, iliacal,
           etc.) of arterial conduits in terms of occlusion rates and graft survival.

        3. Specific aim #3: To investigate whether antiplatelet therapy is protective in terms of
           arterial patency.

      STUDY DESIGN

      This will be a multicenter single cohort study including only cases of deceased donor liver
      transplantation that required an aorto-hepatic or iliac-hepatic conduit for arterial
      reconstruction. Primary endpoint is 30-day conduit patency. Secondary endpoints include
      postoperative complications, death, late conduit occlusion, graft and patient survival.

      SETTING

      This multicenter cohort study will include several high-volume centers worldwide. Each
      participating center requires a prospective database from that data can be extracted. All
      consecutive cases of deceased donor liver transplantation requiring an arterial conduit from
      1st of January 2007 until 31st of December 2016 are included allowing a minimum follow-up
      time of 6 months. Data collection at conduit4olt.org will be prospective, structured,
      anonymized, and encrypted.

      INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW POLICY / ETHICAL POLICY

      Each participating center is responsible to contact their local ethics committee and receive
      approval for participation, if applicable. For example, this project is considered as an
      audit in some countries and thus there is no need for formal approval in the form of a
      protocol submission.

      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Liver transplantation requiring aorto-hepatic or iliac-hepatic conduits

        -  Deceased donor after brain death (DBD) or deceased donor after circulatory death (DCD)

        -  Whole organ as well as split allografts

        -  Primary liver transplantation as well as liver retransplantation

        -  Recipient age â‰¥18 years

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Living donor liver transplantation

        -  Pediatric liver transplantation (recipient age <18 years)

        -  Arterial reconstruction other than aorto-hepatic or iliac-hepatic conduits

        -  Multivisceral transplantations

      ESTIMATED SAMPLE SIZE

      Each center should provide at least 30 cases that meet the inclusion criteria to allow
      adequate event rates for each outcome.

      Statistical methods

      The primary and secondary endpoints will be compared with patient and operation
      characteristics with univariate analysis. ROC Curve analysis will be performed to dichotomize
      continuous variables. Multivariable analysis (binary logistic and Cox regression) will be
      performed to identify independent risk factors. Statistical analysis will be performed using
      R Studio version 1.0.44 (RStudio, Inc. GNU Affero General Public License v3, Boston, MA,
      2016) with the graphical user interface rBiostatistics.com beta version (rBiostatistics.com,
      Zurich, Switzerland, 2016, GNU License).
