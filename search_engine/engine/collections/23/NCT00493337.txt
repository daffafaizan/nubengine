      A large number of pharmacy records based studies demonstrated that adherence to lipid
      lowering treatment in daily practice is substantially worse compared to adherence observed in
      the controlled setting of randomized controlled trials. In addition, the relationship between
      non-adherence with statin-treatment assessed with pharmacy records and cardiovascular
      outcomes has been convincingly demonstrated. This implies that pharmacy records can and
      should be used to identify non-adherent patients and thus patients at risk for major
      cardiovascular events. Using this data, community pharmacists can play a more substantive
      role in developing the concept of pharmaceutical care. The objective of the study is to test
      the effectiveness of a community pharmacist-led intervention to increase adherence to lipid
      lowering treatment.
