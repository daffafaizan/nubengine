      detection. On this new machine the investigators will analyse the ability of the machine to
      show the delivery of blood to the heart muscle. Results will be compared with the results
      from the gold standard test for myocardial perfusion imaging, which is an imaging test that
      shows the blood supply to the heart muscle. Further analyses will record the amount of
      radiation, which is how the CT machine acquires images, and compare the amount of radiation
      necessary to produce images to previous CT systems. With this new CT system there should be
      reductions in the amount of radiation dose compared to previous systems.
