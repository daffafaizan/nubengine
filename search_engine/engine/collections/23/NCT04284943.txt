      gastrointestinal tract. Billroth I procedure restores the normal configuration of the
      gastrointestinal tract and Billroth II and Roux-en-Y procedure involve the creation of
      duodenal switch which is thought to be responsible for metabolic effects by altering enteric
      hormones. Accordingly, several retrospective studies reported that Billroth I reconstruction
      has less effect on diabetes compared to Billroth II and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. While
      little is known about different effects of Billroth II and Roux-en-Y procedure, a study
      retrospectively show that Roux-en-Y procedure has significantly higher rate of T2DM remission
      than Billroth II procedure. Investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial to control
      possible confounders arising from diverse metabolic effects of cancer and minimize
      differences in treatment regimen among patients.
