    
      This is a phase III, national, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel groups, and
      placebo-controlled.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either ibuprofen or placebo. Stratified randomization
      will be used to assign eligible patients to a stratum according to type of surgery and
      centre. Randomization sequence will be generated in the coordinating centre.

      Blinding of the patient and study personnel evaluating response will be warranted by adequate
      drug labelling.

      All patients will receive morphine administered by patient controlled analgesia (PCA)
      following a similar schedule in all centres: 1 mg bolus dose with a close time of 5 min and a
      maximum of 10 mg in an hour and a maximum of 30 mg in 4 hours.
