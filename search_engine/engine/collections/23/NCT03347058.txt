      identify patient-centered and practice solutions across the continuum of care. Immunotherapy
      & Me is an innovative program of customizable resources that seeks to improve the patient
      experience by supporting the unique needs of both immunotherapy patients and the clinical
      staff who care for them. The Cancer Support Community (CSC) will implement this operational
      framework of patient and provider tools at multiple geographically and demographically
      diverse oncology practices.

      The program will include CancerSupportSourceÂ® (CSS), a self-administered screening instrument
      for individuals with cancer that takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and has been
      validated in 300 English-speaking cancer survivors at CSC affiliates nationwide.The
      instrument consists of cancer-related problems (physical, social, psychological, emotional
      and practical) and has been demonstrated to have good internal consistency reliability.
      Patients are asked to rate the severity of their concerns and if they would like to talk with
      a staff person and/or receive additional information about their concerns. This information
      is used to address immediate concerns as well as to develop ongoing educational experiences
      that are tailored and integrated with their care.

      At the end of year one, CSC will evaluate program impact, retool interventions as necessary,
      and pursue additional funding with the goal of extending services at existing practice sites
      - and scaling this turnkey model of immunotherapy treatment support.
