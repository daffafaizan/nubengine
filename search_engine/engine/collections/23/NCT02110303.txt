      disease. Patients will undergo baseline investigations including CT-PET imaging using
      18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-F) tracer to detect potentially unstable coronary plaques. The
      groups will be separated into those with and without 18F-F uptake. Each of these groups will
      be randomised to receive oral ticagrelor or a matched placebo in addition to their usual
      medications. Patients will remain on aspirin but will not be eligible for the trial if taking
      additional antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatments. The treatment will be continued for 1 year.
