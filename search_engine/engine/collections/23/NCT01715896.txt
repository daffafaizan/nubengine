      arthritis (RA), there is still a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects
      with this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of
      remission. The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a
      subcutaneous dose of mavrilimumab with a marketed treatment for RA (golimumab) in 120 adult
      subjects with moderate-to-severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or two
      anti-TNF agents with mavrilimumab. The design of the study was exploratory and not formerly
      statistically powered.
