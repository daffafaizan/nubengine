      hypoglycemia, presenting early in infancy. Patients who fail medical therapy usually require
      resection of the diseased pancreas(partial or subtotal pancreatectomy) to control this
      disorder. Over half of patients undergoing surgery have a focal area of islet cell
      dysfunction that is curable with resection. These focal lesions are areas of adenomatosis
      consisting of a clone of beta-cells that express a paternally-derived mutation of the KATP
      channel due to loss of heterozygosity for the maternal allele. Current imaging techniques
      cannot differentiate focal and diffuse forms of hyperinsulinism, nor can they locate focal
      areas of disease within the pancreas before surgery. L-DOPA is taken up by some
      neuroendocrine cells, including pancreatic islet cells, and stored as dopamine in secretory
      granules. Recent studies show that positron emission tomography (PET) following
      administration of 18F-fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) can distinguish focal and diffuse forms of HI and
      accurately locate focal lesions within the pancreas.
