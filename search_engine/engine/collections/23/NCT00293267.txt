      was followed by an open-label raltegravir phase in which continuing participants from both
      the raltegravir and placebo groups received open-label raltegravir for an additional 84 weeks
      for a maximum duration of up to 240 weeks. Participants who had viral failure after Week 16
      may have received open-label raltegravir until Week 240.
