      that of paclitaxel. It is proposed that by monitoring the influx and efflux of FPAC in vivo
      using PET imaging, we will be able to determine if a tumor retains the drug (is drug
      sensitive) or pumps it out (is drug resistant). The efflux rate of FPAC in the tumor should
      be proportional the amount of Pgp present and therefore should be a predictor of treatment
      failure. If this method is successful at identifying MDR, patients can be spared a course of
      ineffective chemotherapy and can be started on alternative drugs or, if available, an
      effective MDR modulator can be administered prior to treatment.

      In order to validate the biodistribution in non-human primate, 3 normal volunteers will be
      recruited to participate in a dosimetry PET imaging protocol.

      Often, patients with breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy prior to definitive surgical
      removal of the primary tumor. Three patients with breast cancer who are candidates for this
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy will also be recruited to participate in this study, in order to
      demonstrate the feasibility of tumor imaging. As these patients will be receiving
      chemotherapy (likely paclitaxel), a preliminary correlation with FPAC uptake and tumor
      response can also be attempted in this pilot study.

      Primary Objective

      --To obtain human dosimetry and monitor for potential physiologic effects following 4-[F-18]
      fluoropaclitaxel (FPAC) administration

      Secondary Objectives

        -  a.To characterize tracer uptake in tumors and normal tissues and develop robust methods
           for analysis of FPAC kinetics in breast tumors

        -  b.To optimize the imaging protocol for FPAC, and, if feasible, reduce to 1 or 2 static
           scans
