      therapies have been reported for the treatment of plantar fasciitis including extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy. Gastrosoleus muscle dysfunction is one of the most common contributing
      factors to this disease .Despite the long history and the fact that this is a common
      diagnosis made in clinical practice, the exact cause and best treatment for this condition
      still are being explored. Although there is lack of high-quality studies demonstrating the
      efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy of gastrosoleus trigger points in patients with
      plantar fasciitis , this study will be performed to examine the effect of extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy of gastrosoleus trigger points in patients with plantar fasciitis
