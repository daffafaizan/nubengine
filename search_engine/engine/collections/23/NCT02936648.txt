      increase the proportion of Veterans tested for HCV in those born between 1945-1965 and in
      vulnerable, high-risk groups, (2) Increase linkage to specialized HCV care among VISN 1 VA
      Veterans diagnosed with HCV infection, and (3) Evaluate whether race, ethnicity, gender, or
      other markers of social disparity influence completion of HCV testing and linkage to
      specialty care, and whether disparities are reduced by the planned VISN 1 VA HCV Quality
      Improvement (QI) program. The central focus is to reduce delays in diagnosis and linkage to
      treatment evaluation, management of comorbidities and contraindications, and subsequent
      initiation.
