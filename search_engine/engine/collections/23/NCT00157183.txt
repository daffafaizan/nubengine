      with a median survival of 31 years. Lung disease is responsible for the majority of morbidity
      and mortality and correlates with declining quality of life. Respiratory failure is the
      primary cause of death. Daytime respiratory failure (hypoxia with pO2<55 and/or hypercapnia
      with pCO2>50) is associated with a worse prognosis with a 2-year survival of 50%. Nocturnal
      respiratory failure (greater than 5% of the night spent with SpO2<90% and/or rise in
      PtcCO2>10mmHg overnight) is a precursor to the development of daytime respiratory failure. It
      has been postulated that earlier treatment of respiratory failure may improve outcome and
      quality of life.

      Intervention: Nocturnal O2 and bilevel NIPPV in CF patients with nocturnal respiratory
      failure, compared to nocturnal placebo (air). Crossover trial utilising patients as their own
      control.

      Aims: (1) To assess the effects of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and oxygen (O2) therapy on
      quality of life, hospital admission rate, sleep quality and exercise tolerance in CF patients
      with NRF (2) To identify a level of severity of NRF where treatment with NIV is effective
