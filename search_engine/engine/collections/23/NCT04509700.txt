      combination with itacitinib to participants who are currently enrolled in an Incyte-sponsored
      study and receiving the same treatment, who have at least stable disease, who are obtaining
      clinical benefit (in the opinion of the investigator) on the current study treatment, as
      defined by the parent Protocol, and who are unable to access parsaclisib as monotherapy or in
      combination with itacitinib outside a clinical study.Participants will continue on the same
      dose and schedule as the ones being administered in the Incyte-sponsored parent Protocol at
      the time of the rollover. The study will collect and assess safety information with regards
      to AEs.
