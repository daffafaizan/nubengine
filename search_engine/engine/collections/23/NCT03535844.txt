      trial. The study was designed based on previous research which showed that consuming 15 g/day
      of wolfberry for 4 weeks and 14 g/day of wolfberry with meal for 6 weeks increased plasma
      zeaxanthin concentrations and antioxidant status. Also, other studies reported observable
      changes in the endothelial progenitor cells and flow mediated dilation after just two weeks
      of fruit and vegetables or healthy diet interventions. Thus collectively, 16-weeks may be a
      sufficient period to detect the changes in endothelial function, whole body carotenoids, and
      anti-oxidant status, which are the outcomes of interest in this research project.
