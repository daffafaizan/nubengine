    
      This is an observational data collection study evaluating how physicians utilize therapeutic
      sensitivity information ascertained with CANscript, and subsequently describing clinical
      outcomes (clinical response and survival) resulting from their therapeutic selection.

      Potential patients presenting for study enrollment will provide written informed consent and
      will subsequently be screened per inclusion/ exclusion criteria. Once enrolled, a biopsy &
      blood draw will be scheduled to obtain material for CANscript testing. Imaging will also be
      scheduled if a fresh image (obtained within 14 days of planned treatment initiation) is not
      available. Prior to submitting a fresh tissue sample for CANscript, the treating physician
      will select any number of therapies being considered for treatment, and will assign a
      priority ranking to those therapies (priority #1 through priority #N, with #1 representing
      their most preferred therapeutic option for the patient, and #N representing the number of
      their least preferred of the appropriate potential therapies). Prioritized therapies can be
      either single-agent therapeutics or combination regimens. All ranked therapeutic options must
      be available for individual patient at the time of selection. The prioritized list of
      preferred therapies will be sent to the testing laboratory (Mitra Biotech, Inc.) at least 2
      days before the biopsy and blood draw are performed. Fresh tumor and blood samples will
      subsequently be sent to the testing laboratory for receipt within 24 hours of biopsy.
