    
      Design: Prospective controlled non-randomized study. Materials and methods: 30 patients with
      severe brain injury and 15 healthy volunteers will be included in this study.

      The study design is illustrated below:

        1. Clinical assessment (Rancho Los Amigos Scale, Functional Independence Measure, Early
           Functional Abilities).

        2. Somatosensory Evoked Potentials.

        3. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: single and paired stimulation protocols.

      Statistical evaluation: All collected data will be tested with reference to normal
      distribution. If the data is not distributed normally, then we will use either a logarithmic
      transformation before we use parametric statistics, or we will use non-parametric statistics
      for further calculations.Further analysis of the data will be done with the help of variance
      analysis with an inter-individually factor as a group (awake patients vs patients with
      disorders of consciousness vs control persons) and intra-individually factors as 1)
      interstimulus intervals for transcranial magnetic stimulation and clinical scores (RLAS vs
      FIM vs EFA).

      Significance level is set to 0.05 for all effect parameters.
