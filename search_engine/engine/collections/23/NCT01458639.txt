      perfusion imaging compared to xenon (Xe-133) Ventilation Planar and Tc-99m MAA perfusion
      imaging for the diagnosis of PE. Diagnosis of PE provided by review of the subjects'
      documented clinical information after 30 days of follow-up. Primary assessments of efficacy
      will be based on an independent blind reads of the Technegas V/Q SPECT images by three
      different readers and the independent blind reads of Xe 133 V/Q planar images by three
      different readers.
