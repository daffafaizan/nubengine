      conflicts. Sequelae of TBI includes depression in up to 30% of cases. Appearance of
      depression after TBI impairs recovery and results in sub-optimal re-integration into society.
      Treatment of post TBI depression relies on oral medications, whose efficacy and side effect
      profile is sub-optimal. Exercise training is effective in spontaneous depression as a stand
      alone treatment and in conjunction with oral medications, and this may represent an
      alternative treatment option in the TBI population. Further, the pathophysiology of
      depression after TBI has yet to be examined with the full scientific rigor required. This
      project proposes to use exercise training of moderate intensity as a treatment for depression
      after TBI, while measuring biological markers as a way to investigate efficacy and provide
      insight into the pathophysiology.
