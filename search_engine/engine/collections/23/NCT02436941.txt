        1. Perform retrospective research studies on diseases treated with proton therapy and
           conventional photon radiation.

        2. Maintain regular and life-long contact with patients in order to obtain current
           identification, contact information, and self/parent-reported health status. This
           information is used to generate better understanding of treatment strategies and, in
           turn, increase benefits to patients.

        3. Enable physicians to review of medical record information and so to identify subjects
           who may be eligible to participate in future research studies. This requires obtaining
           permission from registered participants that they may be contacted and asked if they are
           interested in participating in studies for which they may be eligible, as determined by
           their medical information contained in the registry.
