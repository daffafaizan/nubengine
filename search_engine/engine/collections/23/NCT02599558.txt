      patients with eosinophilic esophagitis Dietary studies were initially reported in children,
      but the results appear to be similar in adult patients. Elemental diets are successful in
      70-95% of patients but are poorly tolerated. A six food elimination diet has been effective
      in about 70% of adult patients with EoE . In these adult studies skin prick testing was not
      helpful in predicting which foods would lead to a flare of disease when reintroduced into the
      diet. Therefore, the current standard of care requires multiple EGDs with esophageal biopsy
      during the dietary restriction and reintroduction phases of this study. Since the
      investigators are making lifelong dietary decisions during this process of food
      reintroduction, it is imperative the investigators be accurate. Unfortunately, these multiple
      EGDs have significant cost and are invasive procedures with some risk. Moreover, there is
      significant indirect costs with travel and time off work for the patients and drivers.
      Previous studies have found the esophageal sponge to be an accurate technique of accessing
      esophageal eosinophilia in EoE . The sponge is swallowed as a 12 mm capsule on a string. The
      capsule rapidly dissolves upon entering the stomach and the sponge then expands and can be
      pulled out the mouth five minutes after ingestion. In previous studies, the procedure was
      very well tolerated and all patients preferred the sponge to endoscopy.

      Therefore the sponge is a well tolerated, inexpensive, very low risk procedure that would be
      an ideal option to replace EGD esophageal sampling in the evaluation of dietary treatment of
      EoE.
