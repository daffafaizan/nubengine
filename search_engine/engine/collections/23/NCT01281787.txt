    
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation is one of the most common complication after thoracic
      surgery for lung cancer, with an incidence ranging from 8 to 20% after lobectomy and up to
      42% after pneumonectomy.

      In a recent study we demonstrated that a high perioperative plasma levels of NT-proBNP is
      able to identify patients at risk for AF (incidence of 65%).

      It has also been demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in
      the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
      (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are able to prevent atrial fibrillation in
      patients with heart failure, after myocardial infarction, in hypertensive patients and after
      electrical cardioversion.
