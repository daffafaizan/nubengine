    
      Main goal: to define the more specific and sensitive cut-off of variability index of the
      oximetry to detect sleep apnea in the hospitalized elderly.

      Secondary goals:

        -  sleep apnea prevalence in the elderly

        -  accuracy of other oximetry parameters (saturation line, oximetry desaturation index,
           autonomic arousals) for detection of respiratory disturbances in sleep apnea in the
           hospitalized elderly

        -  to determine the clinical and biological data associated with sleep apnea in the
           hospitalized elderly

        -  to determine the factors associated with the record failures and its prevalence

        -  to study the prevalence of the Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep in the hospitalized
           elderly

      Study design: simultaneous records by oximetry and ventilatory polygraphy with tibial EMG in
      the hospitalized elderly in a geriatric readaptation unit.
