      couple-centred intervention that entails informational, experiential, and interactive
      components. Six Dyadic Learning Modules (DLM) form the core of the program and are undertaken
      on a weekly basis.

      A funded pilot study examining the feasibility and benefit of Couplelinks.ca utilized a
      non-randomized, pre-post test design to assess the process and outcomes of the intervention.
      Qualitative feedback also informed the evaluation. Preliminary findings were promising and
      provided justification for further evaluation of the program's effectiveness.

      The current study is the next logical step: a larger-scale Phase III study to determine
      whether this BC-specific, relationship-enhancement program leads to improved relationship and
      psychological outcomes for young couples affected by BC. It is a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) comparing level of distress and dyadic adjustment in couples who have participated in
      the Couplelinks.ca educational program to those who have not participated and were instead
      put on a wait-list for participation.
