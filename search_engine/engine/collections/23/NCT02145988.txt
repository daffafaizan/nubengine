    
      Subjects in this study will be screened consecutively and eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive aspirin tablet 80 mg once daily and either the investigational drug
      (DLBS1033 tablet 490 mg three times daily) or its placebo, for 12 weeks.

      Diabetic subjects who have been being under therapy with aspirin can directly start with
      study treatment. For those who are currently not under therapy with aspirin, there will be a
      run-in period during which they will receive (or be switched to) aspirin treatment, for two
      weeks. After then, they will receive study medication.

      Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and
      safety will be performed at baseline and at the interval of six weeks over the twelve
      week-course of therapy.
