      from the relative obscurity to become the most common cause of liver disease in pediatric
      patients. Currently, over 17% of US children and adolescents have a BMI at or greater than
      the 95th percentile for age and gender and 20% of children in weight management programs are
      estimated to have NAFLD. Untreated NAFLD can lead to fibrosis and to established cirrhosis in
      children as young as 10. Fish oils are a rich source of omega-3-acid ethyl esters or n-3
      long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and increasing evidence suggest they may safely
      improve hepatic steatosis. Given the prevalence of obesity, of NAFLD, and the severe,
      progressive nature of this condition, effective treatment strategies are urgently needed. We
      plan to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of fish oil supplements in
      reducing persistent elevation of ALT levels and hepatic steatosis on abdominal CT-scan among
      urban youth (BMI>=95th percentile). This preliminary data will provide the necessary
      information to calculate the sample size for a phase 2 trial.
