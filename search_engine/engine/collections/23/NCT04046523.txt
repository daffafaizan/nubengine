      such as brain edema, arachnoid cyst, craniosynostosis or, in very-low-birthweight infants,
      post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Some current methods of ICP are invasive and, in the case of
      lumbar puncture, require anesthesia, which can distort the measurement by 5-10 mmHg. The
      golden clinical standard is direct measurement using a surgically-implanted intraventricular
      drain connected to an external pressure transducer ("ICP probe"). However, this method
      carries risks such as hemorrhage, malfunction, obstruction or infection . The risk in
      pediatric patients is up to 5% and in adults the risk of fatal hemorrhage is 4-5% in patients
      with subdural and intraparenchymal monitoring devices. Due to these risks and the financial
      burden on patients, there have been attempts to develop tools for non-invasive ICP
      estimation. This study will test the use of a video ophthalmoscope that will calculate the
      relative waveform of intracranial pressure and provide information about intracranial
      compliance without the use of anesthesia, invasive methods or contact with the eye.
