      Does a 5 minute rest or no rest before measurement using AOBP provide the most accurate
      reading in patients with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension, and in patients with white
      coat hypertension compared to daytime ABPM?

      Implications:

      Through this study, we hope to:

      (i) Advance the understanding of the role of AOBP in measuring blood pressure. (ii) Determine
      whether a 5-minute rest, or no rest at all is needed prior to AOBP measurement.

      (iii) Assess the relationship of AOBP to daytime ABPM for patient with controlled and
      uncontrolled hypertension and in patients with white coat hypertension.
