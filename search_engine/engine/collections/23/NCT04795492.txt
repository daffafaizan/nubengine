    
      Objective: This study is intended to verify the effect of a remote intervention on adherence
      to drugs and risk factors control in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

      Study design: The study was a multicenter, two-arm, parallel, open-label, prospective
      clinical trial that evaluated the effect of a remote intervention on adherence to drugs and
      risk factors control in patients with stable coronary artery disease with 1 year of
      follow-up.

      Study intervention: Participants in the experimental group received remote guidance from the
      cardiac rehabilitation team in the community hospital every month after enrollment. The
      control group had no special intervention. All patients received follow-up at 6 months and
      1-year follow-up.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome was medication adherence. Secondary outcomes included
      smoking, drinking, blood pressure, body mass index, LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and major adverse
      cerebral cardiovascular events(MACCE). Medication compliance consists of the following five
      medications: aspirin, P2Y12 receptor antagonist, statin, ACEI/ARB and beta-blocker.

      Statistical analysis: Values of analyzed endpoints between intervention group and control
      group will be compared according to the analysis plan. We'll follow a prespecified analysis
      plan and subgroup analysis will be conducted accordingly.
