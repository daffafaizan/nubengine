    
      Patients aged between 18 and 30 years, seeking for bilateral impacted LM3 extraction
      surgeries and meeting eligibility criteria were included to the study. At baseline right and
      left impacted third molars (LM3s) were randomly assigned to one of the treatment group (L-PRF
      and L-PRF + DPSC). Baseline and 6th month clinical and radiographic measurements were
      compared.
