    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      safety and effectiveness of intracoronary stenting with or without abciximab, an
      anti-platelet therapy, and conventional coronary angioplasty with abciximab in patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of
      three treatment groups: coronary angioplasty plus abciximab, intracoronary stent plus
      abciximab, or intracoronary stent plus placebo. The primary measures of effectiveness will be
      a 30-day composite, clinical outcome as determined by the number of deaths, myocardial
      infarctions, or urgent repeat revascularizations. Please see attached results.

      Patients will receive one of three different treatments: Coronary angioplasty plus abciximab;
      Intracoronary stent plus abciximab; or Intracoronary stent plus placebo.
