    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be conducted in
      patients with tendonitis or bursitis of the shoulder, elbow or knee. Eligible patients will
      have tendonitis or bursitis or the shoulder, elbow or knee and will be randomized (1:1 ratio)
      to receive double-blind treatment with either the KTP or a matching placebo patch to be
      applied once daily for 21 days. Patients will return to the clinic for assessments on Day 3,
      Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21; a follow-up assessment will be conducted by telephone on Day 35. At
      each visit through Day 21, patients will rate their average pain intensity during daily
      activities and while at rest using the 11-point scale (range 0 to 10), and will rate their
      functional disability. Patients will also complete an electronic diary in which pain
      intensity and pain relief ratings will be recorded three times daily. The use of study
      treatment and rescue medication will be recorded in the diary each day. Ibuprofen will be
      provided as prn rescue medication.
