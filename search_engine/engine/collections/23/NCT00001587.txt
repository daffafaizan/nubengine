    
      Patients with unresectable primary or metastatic cancer confined to the liver will undergo a
      1 hour hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) via the portal vein and hepatic artery
      with escalating dose melphalan. Patients eligible for this protocol are those with
      non-colorectal histologies and those with colorectal cancer previously treated with
      intra-arterial FUDR. Hepatic and systemic toxicity, response to treatment, duration of
      response, and survival will be followed.
