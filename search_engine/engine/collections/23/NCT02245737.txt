      amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan or a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) sampling at screening to document presence of abnormal levels of brain and CSF amyloid
      for study inclusion. The study includes 2 sub-studies: the participants that undergo a PET
      scan at screening will be included in the PET-substudy, and participants who undergo a lumbar
      puncture at screening will be included in the CSF substudy until each of these substudies are
      completed.
