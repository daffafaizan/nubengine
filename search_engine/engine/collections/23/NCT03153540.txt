    
      This study is a randomized controlled blinded cross-over treatment trial that involves 20
      iTBS treatment sessions (10 active treatment sessions; 10 sham treatment sessions) and the
      study will last between 6 weeks. There will be 20 treatment visits (Monday-Friday) each
      lasting 10-40 minutes. Whether the participant is randomly assigned to active or sham
      treatment, the participant will receive daily 10 minute session of iTBS treatment. Some
      sessions will include behavioral and neurophysiological measures.

      In addition, participants will complete cognitive testing, and neuro-imaging, including
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and
      electroencephalography (EEG) prior to the commencement of iTBS/sham treatment and at
      post-treatment. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated during daily iTBS treatments.

      After 10 iTBS treatment visits over 2 weeks, a clinical assessment will be done to see if the
      participants are responding to the iTBS treatment with a targeted language assessment and
      neuro-imaging as described above. After 2 weeks of "wash-out", where the subjects do not
      receive any treatments, the participants will undergo another 2 weeks of iTBS treatment. On
      the first iTBS session after the 2-week washout period, participants will undergo a targeted
      language assessment and EEG/fNIRS. At the final iTBS session at 6 weeks, subjects will again
      undergo a targeted language assessment, EEG/fNIRS, and fMRI. At that point, after 6 weeks,
      the cross-over study is finished.
