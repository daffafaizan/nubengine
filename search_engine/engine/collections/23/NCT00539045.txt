      stroke, possibly due to formation of blood clots ("left ventricular thrombi"), which may
      break loose from the heart and travel to other organs. While echocardiography is a test
      commonly employed for thrombus detection, prior studies have yielded heterogeneous findings
      regarding prevalence and predictors. Echocardiographic contrast ("perflutren lipid
      microspheres") are FDA approved imaging agents that have been shown to improve thrombus
      detection in selected populations. However, the decision to use contrast is often predicated
      upon results of non-contrast echocardiography, a diagnostic strategy that hasn't been well
      studied. This study is designed to test whether echocardiographic contrast improves thrombus
      detection following myocardial infarction. Participants will undergo non-contrast and
      contrast echocardiography. These will be compared for identification of thrombi and
      assessment of cardiac size and function. Clinical features and results of other diagnostic
      tests will also be reviewed in order to study whether these predict thrombus risk.
      Participants will be contacted at regular intervals by study investigators to determine
      whether thrombi identified by contrast or non-contrast echocardiography predict risk for
      stroke or cardiac events. Findings from this study may improve detection of thrombi, thereby
      improving treatment for patients following myocardial infarction.
