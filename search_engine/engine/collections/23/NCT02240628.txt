      general anesthesia.Propofol injection is commonly associated with burning pain. In a previous
      onsite study we concluded that placing a Synera patch at least 30 minutes before placing the
      IV decreased the pain associated with the Propofol injection. Also,a study documented that
      adding Lidocaine to the Propofol decreases the pain associated with propofol injection. In
      our study here we are trying to evaluate if combining the use of both the Synera patch and
      the Propofol-Lidocaine mixture will further decrease the pain associated with the IV Propofol
      injection.

      All children will receive a Synera Patch, it will be placed on the dorsum of both hands for
      at least 30 minutes.All Children will be Sedated with P.O Versed.

      22 g IV will be started either in the holding area or in the OR. Children will be randomized
      into groups using a computer generated randomization list:- Group 1 will receive Propofol
      -Lidocaine mixture. Group 2 will receive Propofol-Saline mixture. An independent blinded
      observer and an anesthesia member will independently evaluate pain on Propofol injection
      according to pain scale.
