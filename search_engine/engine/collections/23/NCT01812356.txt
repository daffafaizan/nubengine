      procedure for treatment of atrial fibrillation combined with valvular heart disease.

      However, sometimes, it was inconvenient due to excess flexibility, wide lesion related to
      excess low temperature and time-consuming detachment from atrium after cryoablation. The
      investigators introduced Atricure cryoprobe (Nitreos Oxide based) in hope of overcoming these
      shortcomings of ATS probes last year.

      Up to date, the investigators have been satisfactory in terms of the surgical convenience. On
      the other hand, we have the questionability of transmural lesion of Atricure probe because of
      the higher temperature of Atricure probe compared with ATS probe.

      The aim of this study is compare the surgical convenience and early and long-term outcomes of
      cryomaze procedure using nitrous oxide with using Argon gas.

      The investigators will analyze the pathologic findings of atrial tissue after cryoablation
      using two probes and early and long-term outcomes with Holter monitoring. Atrial fibrillation
      burden 3 months and 1 year postoperatively and atrial activity will be checked.
