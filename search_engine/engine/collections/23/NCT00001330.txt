      immunogenetic factors associated with patients who develop scleroderma/systemic sclerosis
      after silicone prosthesis implantation or silicone injection. This will be accomplished by
      comparing these patients to groups of appropriately matched patients with idiopathic
      scleroderma/systemic sclerosis without silicone exposure, and appropriately matched
      volunteers who have received similar silicone implants or injections and have not developed
      symptoms, physical examination findings, or laboratory abnormalities associated with
      autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. Patient and physician questionnaires will be
      self-administered, and will collect data regarding: the number and types of implanted
      silicone devices or injections; the indications for and nature of the surgical procedures;
      peri- and post-operative complications; initial and subsequent clinical presentations; and
      therapy and clinical course of the patients. Routine clinical tests and immunologic
      laboratory evaluations will be performed. Also, studies will be conducted on the proportion
      of circulating activated lymphocytes and levels of soluble mediators of inflammation
      (cytokines, sIL-2R, sCD4, sCD8, TNF), the types of HLA and T cell receptor genes present in
      the patients, and the presence and titers of anti-silicone antibodies and autoantibodies.
