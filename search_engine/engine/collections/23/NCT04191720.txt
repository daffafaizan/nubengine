      anxiety being a common comorbidity. The standard of care for inpatient medical stabilization
      for patients diagnosed with AN is a multidisciplinary approach with emphasis on nutrition,
      psychotherapy, and medical management of complaints. Weighted blankets, an example of deep
      pressure stimulation, have been shown to reduce anxiety. However, not much is known about the
      effect of weighted blankets in the eating disorder population. Therefore, this randomized
      control trial (RCT) protocol outlines a study design for assessing the effect of weighted
      blankets on patients with AN.

      A two-arm RCT design will be implemented for this study. A convenience sample of 24 patients
      will be enrolled with 12 patients in the control and intervention groups based on inclusion
      criteria. The control group will receive Denver Health's standard of care for patients
      admitted to its well-known medical stabilization unit for patients with extreme form of
      eating disorders, while the intervention group will receive both the standard of care and a
      weighted blanket. A mixed-design ANOVA will be performed to explore differences in the Beck's
      Anxiety Inventory and Subjective Units of Distress Scale between the intervention and control
      groups.
