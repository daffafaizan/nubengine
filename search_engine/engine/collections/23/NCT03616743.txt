      pain and smoking (BPS) cessation intervention on the willingness to consider quitting smoking
      in adults with chronic pain seeking treatment in a pain specialty outpatient clinic. The
      investigators hypothesized that participants randomized to the BPS intervention, relative to
      a brief non-tailored control smoking (BCS) intervention, would be more likely to self-report
      willingness to consider quitting smoking. Secondary aims included examining the effects of
      group allocation on the (1) interest in learning about smoking cessation programs; (2)
      willingness to consider scheduling a smoking cessation program; (3) scheduling a smoking
      cessation program; and (4) change scores of the Thoughts About Abstinence Scale (TAAS).
