      profile of oral irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Characterize the
      single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral irinotecan and its metabolites, SN-38 and
      SN-38 glucuronide, in these patients. III. Document any antitumor activity in these patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral irinotecan once daily for 14
      days. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
