      elastography to identify strain traits separating malignant from benign lesions. We are
      registering feasibility of endoscopic strain imaging and compare diagnostic accuracy of EUS +
      elastography with previous data on EUS alone.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Group 1: Focal subepithelial lesions in esophageal, ventricular or duodenal wall
           discovered by endoscopy or other imaging modality.

        -  Group 2: Pancreatic lesion discovered by other imaging modality.

        -  Group 3: Mediastinal or retroperitoneal lymph node or tumor discovered by other imaging
           modality.

      Histology of lesions should not be known at the time of examination. EUS elastography
      findings are evaluated shortly after the examination and categorised by different methods;
      categorical score, VAS, Strain Ratio. The result is then compared to histology or cytology
      results. Patients who do not undergo tissue sampling are followed up to discover disease
      progress.
