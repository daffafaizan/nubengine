      provider communication skills training using a continuous quality improvement (CQI)
      framework, and 2) a brief, multimedia Patient Education Program (PEP) that incorporates plain
      language, graphic design, and audio voice-over to overcome literacy limitations. Our provider
      intervention has demonstrated efficacy to significantly improve CRC screening recommendation
      rates. Our multimedia program has also been field tested among patients with limited literacy
      and was able to improve patient knowledge and intention to receive screening.

      We will implement both provider-only and combined provider-patient strategies within a
      federally qualified health center network to determine the most effective and efficient
      approach to promote CRC screening in these settings. Results from the study, supplemented by
      cost analyses and the process evaluation will directly inform translational strategies for
      cancer prevention within difficult community-based healthcare settings.
