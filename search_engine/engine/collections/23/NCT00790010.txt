        -  Induction Phase: Participants will receive ipilimumab by an infusion into a vein or
           central line at weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10 for a total of 4 infusions. Bevacizumab is also
           given as an infusion into a vein or central line at weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10 along with
           ipilimumab and then every 3 weeks by itself. During all cycles of study therapy, the
           participant will have a physical exam on the first day and undergo blood tests at every
           study visit. At weeks 1, 4, 7, 10 and 12 a urine sample will be obtained for analysis.

        -  Chest, abdomen and pelvic CT scans will be performed at week 12. If the scans at week 12
           show that the participants cancer has remained stable or decreased, they will be asked
           to have repeat CT scans in three months.

        -  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans will be done at week 8 and week 16.

        -  Maintenance Phase: If the scans performed at week 12 show the cancer has improved or
           stayed the same, then the participant will continue to receive bevacizumab every three
           weeks and undergo a CT scan every 3 months. Also, every 3 months the participant may be
           eligible to receive additional doses of ipilimumab in addition to the bevacizumab.
