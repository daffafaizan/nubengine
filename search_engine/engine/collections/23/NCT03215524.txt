    
      This is a randomized phase II open label study of daratumumab, weekly low-dose oral
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with or without pomalidomide in patients with relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma. The study consists of two arms. Patients will be randomized into
      ARM A and ARM B in a 1:1 ratio.

      In treatment ARM A patients will receive daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and
      pomalidomide as per the following schedule:

        -  Daratumumab, IV, at 16 mg/kg, or Daratumumab, SC, at 1800 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for
           Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15 for Cycles 3-6, and Day 1 of each cycle for Cycle 7 and
           beyond for each 28-day cycle.

        -  Cyclophosphamide, orally, at 400 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 28-day cycle. In order to
           prevent myelotoxicity and bladder toxicity, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued after
           cycle 24.

        -  Dexamethasone orally at 20 mg on day of daratumumab administration (pre-daratumumab) and
           20 mg on the following day. On weeks without daratumumab administration, 40 mg
           dexamethasone weekly.

        -  Pomalidomide, orally, at 4 mg on Days 1- 21 of each 28-day cycle.

      In treatment ARM B, patients will receive daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and
      pomalidomide as per the following schedule:

        -  Daratumumab, IV, at 16 mg/kg, or Daratumumab, SC, at 1800 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for
           Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15 for Cycles 3-6, and Day 1 of each cycle for Cycle 7 and
           beyond for each 28-day cycle.

        -  Cyclophosphamide, orally, at 400 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In order
           to prevent myelotoxicity and bladder toxicity, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued
           after cycle 24.

        -  Dexamethasone at 20 mg orally on day of daratumumab administration (pre-daratumumab) and
           20 mg on the following day. On weeks without daratumumab administration, 40mg
           dexamethasone weekly.

        -  Pomalidomide, orally, added at first progression at 4 mg on Days 1- 21 of each 28-day
           cycle.

      Individual subjects will remain on treatment as long as there is no evidence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient/physician decision to discontinue. Disease
      assessment as determined by the Site Investigator will be made according to the IMWG response
      criteria guidelines for MM.
