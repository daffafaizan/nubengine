      European Union. The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS may be used in conjunction with carotid artery
      stent approved for revascularization in patients with carotid disease in the context of this
      study.

      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial of the ENROUTE Transcarotid
      NPS in conjunction with all commercially approved carotid artery stents used for
      revascularization in patients with carotid disease.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions
      (relative to baseline) and debris captured in the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS inline filter
      during a transcarotid stenting procedure.

      A patient is considered enrolled after:

        1. meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria,

        2. the transcarotid arterial sheath has entered into the patient's vasculature. Insertion
           of the venous sheath does not qualify a patient as enrolled.

      Patients who are screened but do not meet all study criteria are considered screen failures
      and may not be enrolled. Patients in whom an arterial sheath is placed but who do not meet
      all study entry criteria are considered enrolled.
