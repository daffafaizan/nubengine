      undergraduate medical students.

      Method A: Theoretical training will be scheduled for 2 hours with lectures in basics of
      emergency ultrasound. After the theoretical education the students will obtain a
      bedside-teaching on intensive care unit for 4 hours.

      Method B: Theoretical training will be scheduled for 3 hours and included lectures in
      echocardiography, lung ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. After the theoretical education
      the students will obtain a bedside-teaching on intensive care unit for 3 hours.

      Method C: Theoretical training will be scheduled for 3 hours and included lectures in
      echocardiography, lung ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. After the theoretical education
      the students will obtain a hands-on-training in healthy volunteers for 3 hours. The acquired
      knowledge and practical skills will be analyzed by a multiple-choice exam (5 MC-questions, 5
      video sequences) and a practical exam (five tasks).

      Any method of training will be proved at the end theoretical and in clinical practice.
