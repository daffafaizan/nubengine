      widespread effects including venodilation, vasodilation, reducing sympathetic outflow,
      blunting hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses, and altering the central perception
      of dyspnea. Although the origins of dyspnea in PAH are incompletely understood and
      multifactorial, right ventricular dysfunction reduces exercise capacity and likely also plays
      a role in the development of dyspnea. Mechanoreceptors situated in the right atrium and right
      ventricle sense elevated pressures and via sympathetic afferents may lead to an augmentation
      of ventilatory response and hence dyspnea. Morphine may specifically antagonize this feedback
      loop by causing venodilation and blunting sympathetics. Morphine also reduces central
      chemosensitivity and perceptions of dyspnea. Therefore, the drug may antagonize both
      peripheral and central drivers of dyspnea in PAH.

      Investigators will conduct a single-center feasibility study of morphine for treatment of
      dyspnea and exercise intolerance in PAH. Participants will complete two 6-minute walk tests
      (6MWT) within one week. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive morphine prior to
      either the first or second 6MWT. Symptoms and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) will be compared
      between the two tests.
