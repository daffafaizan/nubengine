      controller to better titrate vasopressor (e.g:norepinephrine) to maintain MAP within a narrow
      range (±5mmHg of the chosen target).

      The investigators published engineering, animal studies and recently described the
      feasibility of titration of norepinephrine in 20 patients undergoing major noncardiac
      procedures. This initial cohort human study showed the controller was able to keep patients
      within ± 5 mmHg of a target pressure for more than 90% of management time. Cardiac surgery
      represents unique challenges in MAP management as the manipulation of the heart itself, the
      use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardioplegia, and the pre-existing cardiac disease
      all increase the difficulty in maintaining a steady MAP throughout the surgical period.

      In this case series the investigators describe three cardiac surgical procedures managed with
      the CLV system (one coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure done under CPB; one robotic
      minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) procedure (through a
      mini-thoracotomy), and one off-pump CABG) in order to assess its feasibility, efficiency and
      behavior in three high-risk patients before starting a randomized controlled trial.
