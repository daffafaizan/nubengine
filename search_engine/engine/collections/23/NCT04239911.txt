      the experience of home health aides caring for the heart failure patients has the potential
      to improve home health aides' own self-efficacy, heart failure knowledge, and also patient
      outcomes. The intervention for home health aides is comprised of a) classroom education on
      heart failure and b) an electronic tablet containing heart failure educational content and a
      messaging application that connects home health aides and their nurse supervisors. This
      intervention requires feasibility and acceptability testing, as well as preliminary testing
      of its effectiveness among home health aides caring for community-dwelling adults with heart
      failure.
