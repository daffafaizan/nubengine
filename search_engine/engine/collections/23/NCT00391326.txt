      myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Denmark. However, time is lost transferring patients from a
      local hospital to an invasive treatment centre. Time can be saved by redirecting STEMI
      patients to pPCI based on wireless prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission
      directly to a cardiologist's handheld device. To prevent complications during the
      transportation of STEMI patients to the invasive hospital, patients are treated with oxygen,
      aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and nitro-glycerine in the ambulance. However, heparin use is
      cumbersome for the ambulance personnel since it must be kept at 5 degrees Celsius. An
      alternative to heparin may be bivalirudin, since it can be kept at room temperature and thus
      is easily administered in the prehospital setting.

      Comparison: Heparin versus bivalirudin treatment. Efficacy is determined by thrombolysis in
      myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow in the first and final coronary angiogram. Safety is
      determined by the rate of bleeding complication.
