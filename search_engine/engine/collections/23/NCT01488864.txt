      sweats during the climacteric period. Many women abstain from hormonal therapy because of
      side effects or contraindications such as breast cancer or thrombosis.

      Different alternative therapies for alleviation of hot flashes are described in the
      literature. Both pharmacological treatments, different types of natural remedies,
      acupuncture, life-style changes and mind-body therapies are suggested as promising therapies.
      Applied relaxation (AR) is a technique influenced on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) using
      coping mechanism and conditioning. Previous study with healthy postmenopausal women showed
      promising results on hot flash frequency with an average decrease of more than 70 % with
      persisting effect three months after therapy and also HRQoL significantly increased probably
      due to better sleep and diminished vasomotor symptoms. But the method must be further
      investigated before strong evidence-based conclusion can be drawn.

      Cortisol is a potent stress hormone regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The factors
      underlying how alternative treatment works and the mechanism underlying improvements in
      symptoms are not fully understood.
