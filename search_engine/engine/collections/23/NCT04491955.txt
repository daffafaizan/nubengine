        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent small bowel and colorectal cancers are incurable and
           poorly palliated by standard therapies. There is an unmet need for active treatments for
           these tumors.

        -  To date immunotherapies including anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 inhibitors have proven largely
           ineffective for the vast majority of these cancers.

             -  In microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (>95% of these cancers) the
                response rate to checkpoint inhibitors has been <5%.

             -  Preclinical studies suggest that the use of different combinations of multiple
                immunotherapy agents may improve anti-tumor efficacy. These studies have employed
                (1) a vaccine targeting a tumor associated antigen, (2) an IL-15 superagonist
                (N-803, also known as ALT-803), (3) an anti-PD-L1 MAb or a bifunctional fusion
                protein targeting PD-L1 and TGF beta (M7824), and (4) a tumor targeted
                immunocytokine (NHS-IL12).

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria
      (RECIST 1.1) of the combination of (1) CV301, a poxviral based vaccine targeting CEA and
      MUC1, (2) N-803 and (3) M7824; and of the combination of (1) CV301, (2) N-803, (3) M7824 and
      (4) NHS-IL12 (M9241) in subjects with advanced checkpoint naive MSS small bowel and
      colorectal cancers.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age >= 18 years old

        -  Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
           small bowel or colorectal adenocarcinomas.

        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the participant declines standard
           treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.

        -  Subjects must have measurable disease.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II trial of combination immunotherapy, with a brief dose escalation
           portion for Arm 2.

        -  The trial will be conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage design in each Phase II Arm.

        -  Participants will be enrolled on the following arms in sequential order: (1) Arm 1:
           CV301 + M7824 + N-803, (2) Arm 2A and Arm 2B: CV301 + M7824 + N-803 + NHS-IL12; N-803
           dose level will be evaluated in Arm 2A prior to further enrollment in Arm 2B.

        -  The first six participants on arm 1 will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicities
           (DLTs) and accrual will only continue to 9 participants on that arm if less than 2 out
           of the first 6 participants experience a DLT.

        -  In Arm 2B, participants will receive 4 drug treatments (CV301 + M7824 + N-803 +
           NHSIL12), but the dose level of N-803 will first be determined during a 3-level dose
           escalation portion, Arm 2A. Following determination of the MTD or highest safe dose
           evaluated, the 6 participants at that dose level will be included among the initial 9
           participants for the first stage of that arm.

        -  If two or more out of nine participants have objective responses on a given arm that arm
           will be expanded to enroll 20 evaluable participants.
