      (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute ischemic stroke patients who
      are candidates for endovascular treatment provides any additional value. The phase II trial
      will treat consecutive patients who are candidates for IV rt-PA and mechanical thrombectomy
      with just mechanical thrombectomy alone. Such trial will generate the necessary data for a
      definitive phase III trial. The trial is designed based on low rate of recanalization in
      patients with major arterial occlusion with IV rt-PA alone and no difference in rate of
      recanalization or distal embolization in patients who receive IV rt-PA and those who do not
      prior to mechanical thrombectomy. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and cost of
      hospitalization are higher when IV rt-PA is administered prior to mechanical thrombectomy.
      The trial will determine the proportion of patients with slight or no disability (a modified
      Rankin score (mRS) of 0-2) at 3 months after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical
      thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA and compare with historical controls who were
      treated with IV rt-PA to determine futility.
