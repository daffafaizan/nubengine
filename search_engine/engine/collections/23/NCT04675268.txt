    
      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the variability in nocturnal oxygen (and PPG)
      parameters during 7 consecutive nights at home and to identify clinical predictors of
      variability in patients with suspected OSA.

      Data regarding sleep position, alcohol intake and sleep duration will be evaluated (these
      parameters could be important to explain variability).

      Additional objectives are to compare the parameters measured at home with the parameters
      measured during an in-hospital polysomnography.

      The investigators will also evaluate variability in the surrogate AHI described by the group
      based on the measurements at home and the impact of multi-night evaluation of oxygen (and
      PPG) parameters on the recently developed mICS algorithm will be explored.

      This study is a first explorative approach for further (multi-site) work to define the burden
      of OSA associated with cardiovascular or psychofunctional problems.
