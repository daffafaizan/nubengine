      therapy.

      Study participants will provide blood and stool samples in order to evaluate bile acids
      profile and microbiome, before and after the course of metronidazole, and then comparison
      will be made pre- and post-antibiotics.

      The investigators will determine the benefit of oral metronidazole therapy through
      improvement of clinical symptoms and improvement of liver function tests.
