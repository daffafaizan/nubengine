      baseline MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for eligibility for the study. Patients will
      receive POL6326 or placebo in the first week after STEMI. The primary and secondary endpoints
      will also be determined in a follow-up visit after 12 months. An interim analysis will be
      performed after 50% of the patients have completed the 4 months MRI assessment and may result
      in an adjustment of study size. A number of pre-specified subgroups will be investigated.
