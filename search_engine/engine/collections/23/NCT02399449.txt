      approval of the generic, a 'Reflections Paper on Non-Clinical Studies for Generic
      Nanoparticle Iron Medicinal Product Applications' was published by the European Medicines
      Agency. The authors of this paper proposed that generic iron preparations deliver increased
      levels of 'labile iron' to the plasma resulting in oxidative damage and toxicity. As such,
      studies measuring the in vivo levels of free or labile iron from generic versus brand
      iron-preparations were recommended.

      The primary outcome will be the assessment of non-inferiority of the generic colloid product
      against the reference colloid product with respect to non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI),
      after single-dose i.v. administration of brand and generic sodium ferric gluconate injections
      in n=48 healthy subjects.
