    
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of in-vitro introduction of
      gluten on inflammatory response primarily Interferon-Î³ and other cytokines, such as IL-15,
      IL-18 and IL-21, in cultures obtained from small intestinal mucosal biopsy samples of
      subjects who underwent upper endoscopy.

      Secondary goals include comparing the inflammatory response to immunosuppressants and
      cytokines after exposing the cultures obtained from small intestinal mucosal biopsies taken
      from RCD I subjects with intestinal mucosal biopsies taken from subjects with CeD controlled
      on a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD), uncontrolled CeD, Gluten sensitivity and Non-celiac Controls.
