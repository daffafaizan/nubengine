      recommended for infants at risk for developing allergies if they cannot be exclusively
      breast-fed. Although the use of such formulae manufactured from hydrolysed protein is legally
      authorized according to the respective legal framework since many years (currently: Directive
      2006/141/EC), the safety of each hydrolysed protein has to be substantiated by additional
      clinical data according to new legal requirements (Del. Regulation (EU) 2016/127). This study
      is intended to generate clinical safety data: demonstrating adequate growth of infants fed a
      formula manufactured from hydrolysed protein in comparison to infants fed a formula
      manufactured from intact protein. As formula manufactured from hydrolyzed proteins is known
      to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal comfort, it is also fed to infants not at risk
      for developing allergies. Therefore, this study additionally investigates the impact of
      hydrolysed protein on gastrointestinal tolerance.
