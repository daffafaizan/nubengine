    
      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of FP-02.2, a new therapeutic Hepatitis B
      vaccine, administered as an add-on therapy to entecavir or tenofovir. HBeAg-negative subjects
      will be randomized to receive low or high dose vaccine, in the presence or absence of IC31®
      adjuvant, or to receive placebo or IC31® adjuvant alone.
