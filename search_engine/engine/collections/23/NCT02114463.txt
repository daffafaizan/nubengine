      cord hyperexcitability with expansion of the receptive fields of dorsal horn neurons that
      respond to the nearest intact afferents. These neuroplastic changes are believed to be
      responsible for the development of postsurgical chronic pain syndromes, including phantom
      limb and stump pain.At present, there are no randomized studies with sample sizes that ensure
      power, or blinded for end-point assessment,to support the evidence on pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological treatments of Pain after amputation. Consequently, our study was designed
      to arrive at clear conclusions about treatment efficacy and to give stronger recommendations
      for clinical practice.
