      the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in roughly 65% of cases. About one third of patients with
      DLBCL relapse or show primary progressive disease after modern first-line therapy. The
      outcome of these patients is poor in particular if first-line therapy contained rituximab.
      Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently warranted. Thus, it is the goal to further improve
      progression-free Survival (PFS) and overall Survival (OS) by combining R-CHOP with
      copanlisib. Copanlisib is a small molecule pan-class 1 PI3K inhibitor and approved by US FDA
      for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at
      least two prior systemic therapies.
