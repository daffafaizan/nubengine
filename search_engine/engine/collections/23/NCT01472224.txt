      patients with intracerebral hemorrhages. Using transcranial ultrasound makes it possible to
      visualize and follow the bleeding progression through 3 points of the scull where the bone is
      thin enough to allow the penetration of sound waves. This can be done at bedside. Today the
      investigators do not know for sure if clinical parameters determine a haematoma expansion.
      TCU will allow us to follow the haematoma progression serially in the acute phase and relate
      the haematoma expansion to parameters like blood pressure, neurological status (NIHSS-score)
      and radiological signs of ongoing bleeding (spot signs) on CT-angiogram (CTA).

      Hypothesis:

        1. Bedside ultrasound volume assessment is accurate in estimating the haematoma volume
           compared to computer tomography (CT) and can dynamically document the haematoma
           expansion.

        2. The haematoma expansion is accompanied by neurological deterioration and happens only
           with patients with CT demonstrated spot signs.

        3. The haematoma expansion is observed with patients with high blood pressure.

      Aim of study:

        1. To validate the accuracy of ultrasound (US) compared to CT in estimating haematoma
           volume with ICH patients.

        2. To measure ICH volume serially in the acute phase using US and up to 12 hours aiming at:

             -  Describing the timing of the haematoma expansion.

             -  Relating to neurological deterioration, systemic blood pressure and detection of
                spot signs on CTA.
