    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to assess
      the safety and tolerability of PDC-APB by intramuscular (IM) injection compared to placebo.
      In this First-in-Human study it is anticipated that up to 5 dose levels (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 0.125
      mg, .375 mg and 1.0 mg PDC-APB) will be studied in sequential cohorts. Each cohort will
      enroll 8 subjects, 6 subjects randomized to active treatment and 2 randomized to placebo, in
      a double-blind manner. A sentinel group of 2 subjects in each cohort will be randomized to
      active (1 subject) or placebo (1 subject). If the dose is tolerated in the sentinel group,
      the remaining 6 subjects in the cohort will be treated (5 active and 1 placebo).

      Safety will be assessed in each cohort before starting treatment at the next higher dose
      level. If the study treatment is tolerated and there are no findings that necessitate
      stopping the study, the next cohort will be treated at the next higher dose level, in the
      same manner. This process will continue until the highest intended dose (1 mL) is reached, or
      side effects that limit further dose escalation are observed.
