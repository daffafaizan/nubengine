    
      Sunitinib (SutentÂ®; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) is a multitargeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor
      (TKI) with activity against the stem cell-factor receptor (KIT) and platelet-derived
      growth-factor receptor (PDGFR), vascular endothelial growth-factor receptor (VEGFR), glial
      cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (rearranged during transfection [RET]),
      colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 receptor (FLT3).

      Sunitinib is a potent inhibitor of mutant KIT with additional inhibitory effects on VEGF
      receptors that potentially might make it more effective than imatinib against TCs. In the
      current version of NCCN guideline, sunitinib is suggested as one of the potential targeted
      therapeutics for advanced TCs.

      We planned this study to investigate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sunitinib in
      patients with advanced or recurrent TCs in Korean population. In addition, we will collect
      tumor samples and blood samples from patients for the further exploration of predictive
      biomarkers.
