      scheduled for non-emergent cesarean section who are at risk for hemorrhage. Three doses of
      the drug will be administered in an escalating fashion by cohort with the lowest dose first.
      A maximum of 1 gram will be administered. TXA serum levels at several time points after
      delivery will be assayed. A PK model will be constructed for determining the optimal TXA dose
      administered at parturition.
