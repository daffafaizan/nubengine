        -  Determine the effectiveness of carboxypeptidase-G2 rescue in patients who develop life
           threatening methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity following accidental intrathecal MTX
           overdose.

        -  Study the CSF pharmacokinetics of MTX following rescue.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a lumbar puncture as soon as possible after methotrexate overdose
      to remove methotrexate and receive a single dose of carboxypeptidase-G2 intrathecally over 5
      minutes.

      Patients are followed for at least 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
