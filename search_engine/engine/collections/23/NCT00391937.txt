      could result in an obvious improvement of the quality of life. However, because of the life
      expectation and high level of activity of young and active patients, the conventional total
      hip replacement does not offer an optimal solution.

      An alternative to a total hip replacement in young and active patients is the resurfacing hip
      prostheses. The articular surface replacement (ASR) hip prostheses can be placed by the
      conventional positioning method and by using 'computer assisted surgery' (CAS). The
      hypothesis is that the positioning of the femoral component by the conventional positioning
      method will show a larger variation between pre planned and actual position than when CAS is
      used.

      This study will compare the results of those who had an ASR prosthesis placed by the
      conventional positioning method with those patients in whom the ASR prosthesis was placed
      using CAS.
