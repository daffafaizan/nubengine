      electromyography-based monitor (TetraGraph, Senzime AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and two devices that
      are the newer generation of quantitative monitoring using three-dimensional
      acceleromyographic technology: Stimpod (Xavant Technology, Pretoria, South Africa) and
      TofScan (IDmed, Marseilles, France), both of which require minimal setup for use.

      The stimulation pattern of both ulnar and facial nerves will be train-of-four (TOF) delivered
      every 1 minute, and the mean of three consecutive measurements will be calculated as the TOF%
      for that patient. Patients will be tested every 24 hrs, once a day, at the same time, over
      the 72 hrs the study will take place in the ICU.
