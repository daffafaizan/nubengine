      The nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC), Venous occlusion Plethysmography (VOP) and biomarkers
      can be used to evaluate the microcirculation in arterial hypertension (AH). The objective of
      this study is to analyze the behavior of serum inflammatory markers and study the
      microcirculation by nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) and Venous Occlusion Plethysmography
      in patients with resistant hypertension (RH), with stages 1 and 2 hypertension (MMH ) and
      normotensive (CG). A cross-sectional study with 75 patients has been performed: 25 with
      resistant hypertension (RH), 25 with stages 1 and 2 hypertension (MMH) and 25 normotensive
      (CG). All underwent anamnesis, dosage serum markers and conducting NVC, VOP. Hypertensive
      patients without statin use and with controlled or uncontrolled blood pressure were also
      analyzed. For the statistical analysis were used: Kruskal -Wallis ANOVA, Dunn test and ANCOVA
      for correction of confusion factors such as age and BMI.
