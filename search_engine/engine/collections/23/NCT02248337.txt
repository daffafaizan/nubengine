      efficacy, safety and tolerability of a 2L PEG solution plus bisacodil with a 4L PEG solution
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease-related colitis.

      This will be a multicenter, randomized, single-blind study. Adult outpatients with IBD
      colitis undergoing colonoscopy will receive either 2L PEG plus biscodil or 4L PEG. Bowel
      cleansing will be assessed using the Ottawa Scale and rated as adequate if <6. Patient
      acceptance, satisfaction, and related symptoms will be also recorded. The study will also
      focus on the factors affecting quality of preparation in inflammatory bowel disease patients
      such as disease characteristics and administration regimen
