    
      Approximately 120 subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg BID, after a 5-day titration period,
      with or without MTX. All subjects will be permitted to take NSAIDs and/or low-dose oral
      glucocorticoids (prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day or equivalent) throughout the study. The NSAIDs and
      low-dose oral glucocorticoids must be on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to
      baseline. MTX (≤ 25 mg/week) will be permitted if treatment duration is ≥ 6 months and on a
      stable regimen for at least 3 months prior to baseline. In addition, Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), and low-dose glucocorticoids must be continued from Day 1
      through the Week 24 Visit. Change in doses, increase or decrease, and/or discontinuation will
      not be allowed, except for safety reasons or for lack of availability. After the Week 24
      Visit, the doses of MTX, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids may be adjusted as clinically required.
