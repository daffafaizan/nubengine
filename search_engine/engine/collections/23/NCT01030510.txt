      neuromuscular block of rocuronium (1-3). It also provided an improved condition for the rapid
      tracheal intubation (2,4). This beneficial effect was attributed to the increased cardiac
      output and tissue perfusion to muscle, and therefore, a more rapid delivery of rocuronium to
      the neuromuscular junction was achieved (4-5). If so, any drugs which decrease cardiac output
      consequently can prolong the onset time of rocuronium.

      Remifentanil is the first ultra-short acting opioid with a rapid onset. During the total
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, prior administration of
      remifentanil could reduce the propofol infusion pain without other significant complications
      (6). However, remifentanil can decrease the arterial pressure and heart rate (7-8), so that
      it is likely to decrease the onset time of rocuronium for the opposite principle that
      ephedrine increases it.

      The investigators therefore hypothesized that remifentanil could prolong the onset time of
      rocuronium, and evaluated the effect of remifentanil on the hemodynamic profiles (arterial
      pressure and heart rate) during the anesthetic induction sequence.
