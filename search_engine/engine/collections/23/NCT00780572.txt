      despite advances in computerized drug safety measures. Reports on the ability of computerized
      ADE alerts to prevent and mitigate ADEs are lacking. The aims of this project are to 1)
      Assess organizational, social, and cognitive factors that affect adoption of real-time ADE
      alerting technology; 2) Analyze the effect of the ADE alerting technology on management and
      rate of ADEs; and 3) Estimate the cost-benefit of the ADE alerting technology. This study
      will use a patient randomized design of computerized real-time ADE alerts intended for
      primary and secondary prevention of ADEs. The ADE alerts promise to reduce mortality,
      morbidity, and costs due to ADEs. This study will quantify the effect of the alerts in the
      hands of first-year medical residents and pharmacists. The study will explore the
      associations of organizational and soci-cognitive barriers and facilitators with the adoption
      of the ADE alert technology. At the cognitive level, it will explore whether ADE Alerts
      change user bias in diagnosing ADEs or whether the alerts heighten sensitivity to drug
      problems.
