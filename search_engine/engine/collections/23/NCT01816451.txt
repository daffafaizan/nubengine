      individuals were excluded from the program. Two individuals during maximal exercise test
      (VO2) showed clinical impairment test being interrupted by the doctor and the third
      individual presented a plantar fasciitis in the early familiarization. Thirty two healthy and
      active males volunteered to participate in the study. All subjects exercised habitually, with
      at least 1 year experience aerobic training. The Human Ethics Committee of Rio de Janeiro
      Federal University approved this study (no 58659/02471312.8.0000.5257).The subjects performed
      a total of nine visits to the laboratory of the Brazilian Navy at City of Rio de Janeiro for
      physical tests on different days, except between visits I-II and VII-III. The interval
      between visits was one week between visits II-III-IV and VIII-IX, six weeks between the first
      day of training and visits V, four weeks between V-VI-VIII. All subjects from interval and
      continuous groups performed a total of 46 sessions of supervised running program.
