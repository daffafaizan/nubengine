      less evidence of a benefit for patients with mild to moderate disease. However, mild to
      moderate disease still accounts for important disability. Electrodiagnostic studies (EDS)
      have not been shown to accurately predict outcomes for patients with CTS. Recent advances in
      MR permit high-resolution neurographic imaging of the median nerve, and pilot data suggest
      that wrist MRI might be a better predictor of outcome than EDS. Thus, wrist MRI has the
      potential for playing a major role in the treatment of patients with CTS. We will test two
      main hypotheses: 1) that select patients with early, mild or moderate CTS benefit more from
      early surgery than with conservative therapy; and, 2) that wrist MRI accurately identifies
      those patients more likely to benefit from surgery. We will perform a randomized, controlled
      treatment trial nested within a prospective cohort as our study design.
