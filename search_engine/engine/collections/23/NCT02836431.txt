      2µg/kg) and intravenous (1 µg /kg) DEX to determine the early pharmacokinetics (maximum
      concentration (peak) and time to peak) and bioavailability of a single intranasal dose in
      pediatric patients.

      Dexmedetomidine sedation is commonly utilized at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center (CCHMC)
      and other pediatric institutions. This compound is delivered intravenously or intranasally
      for sedation in children with and without congenital heart disease. Intranasal DEX, though
      very effective for sedation, has significant variability in its onset and peak effect.
      Patient care will be significantly improved if factors that determine this variability in
      onset and peak effect can be determined. Investigators will determine the important early
      clinical variables of peak plasma DEX concentration (Tmax and Cmax) and the 0 - 2 hour
      bioavailability of intranasal DEX in children.
