      implanted with the Orion Cortical Visual Prosthesis System. The study will evaluate the
      safety of the device and surgery, as well as reliability of the system and the usefulness of
      any restored vision. Each subject will be followed for 5 years, with their health monitored
      throughout. Research sessions, visual function testing, and subject-reported outcomes will be
      used to evaluate the functioning of the system.
