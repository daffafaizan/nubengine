      their potency. These New Psychoactive Substances are used voluntarily by users wishing to
      test new substances, but also involuntarily because of association (unknowingly users) with
      more "conventional" drugs such as cocaine or heroin in the self-administered powder. These
      intoxications are still poorly known and the investigators believe that the identification of
      New Psychoactive Substances among the drugs consumed, and the association of their
      consumption with the appearance of a particular symptomatology allow the physician to guide
      the diagnosis and facilitate the care of future patients.
