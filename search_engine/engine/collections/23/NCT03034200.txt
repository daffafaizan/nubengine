    
      Primary Objective To demonstrate objective responses using MRI or CT, and/or PET-CT imaging.
      The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6
      and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have
      imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be
      compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.

      Secondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease

      Overall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.

      Study Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including
      PC-PG are rare diseases.

      The current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will
      be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI
      for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the
      quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.

      Because of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some
      information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans
      sent to Cleveland Clinic
