      adults. A disposable device is placed in each nostril at night and attached with adhesive.
      The device acts as a one-way valve, during inspiration the valve opens, with negligible
      resistance to flow. During expiration, the valve closes and airflow is directed through small
      air channels, increasing resistance. The increased resistance helps to maintain the upper
      airway pressure during the critical end-expiratory period when the upper airway has been
      found to be most narrow in the breaths preceding an apnea event. In contrast to Continuous
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) which provides positive pressure during both inspiration and
      expiration, NEPAP creates pressure during expiration. NEPAP is a potential alternative
      therapy which is less cumbersome than CPAP and may increase adherence.
