      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-range at which ABT-888 inhibits poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
           in tumor samples and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with
           refractory solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888.

        -  Determine the time course of PARP inhibition in PBMCs by ABT-888.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of administering 1 dose of ABT-888 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study.

      Patients receive oral ABT-888 once on day 1.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of ABT-888 until significant tumor poly
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition is observed in 3 of 3 patients at 2 dose levels.
      Significant PARP inhibition is defined as â‰¥ 0.69 reduction on the log scale in poly
      (ADP-ribose) level from baseline to 3-6 hours after ABT-888 administration (with 90%
      confidence that it is not due to chance variation).

      Patients undergo peripheral blood collection at baseline and periodically after ABT-888
      administration for PARP inhibition, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies. Once
      significant PARP inhibition is observed in 1 of 3 patients, subsequently enrolled patients
      also undergo tumor biopsy* at baseline and 3-6 hours or 21-27 hours after ABT-888
      administration to determine PARP inhibition in tumor tissue.

      NOTE: *Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergo peripheral blood collection instead
      of biopsy.

      After completion of ABT-888 administration, patients are followed for 7 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23 patients will be accrued for this study.
