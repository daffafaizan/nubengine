      10-20%, and was believed to be under-estimated. Recently, a two-way telehealth system,
      SHARESOURCE software, provide practitioners real-time monitoring and recording of the therapy
      of APD.

      By using this APD with SHARESOURCE software, we want to investigate the non-compliance rate
      of patients undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis, want to see if it can improve
      peritoneal dialysis compliance and outcomes in the observation period.
