    
      The molecule CD32b is thought to be present on many B-cells including the malignant B-cells
      in some types of lymphoma and leukaemia. The study drug, BI-1206, is an anti-CD32b monoclonal
      antibody which attaches to CD32b on the surface of B-cells and is thought to act by
      recruiting host immune cells toward the tumour leading to cancer cell death as well as
      enhancing the anti-cancer effect of other anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituximab by stopping
      them being absorbed by cells.

      The study is a first in man clinical trial of the drug called BI-1206 on its own and then
      also in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab) which is commonly used to
      treat lymphoma and some types of leukaemia.

      The four main aims of this trial are to find out:

        -  The maximum dose of BI-1206 that can be given safely to patients (to a maximum dose of
           800mg) on it's own and in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab.

        -  More about the potential side effects of BI-1206 and how they can be managed.

        -  What happens to BI-1206 inside the body.

        -  The effect of BI-1206 treatment (with or without rituximab) on tumour size and survival.

      Approximately 81 patients with relapsed or refractory CD32b positive B-cell lymphoma or
      leukaemia will be entered into this study. This will include approximately 19 recruited for
      the BI-1206 dose escalation phase (Part A), up to 12 (likely 6) for a combination dose
      escalation and up to a further 50 patients recruited to two dose expansion cohortsÍ¾ one of
      BI-1206 alone and one of BI-1206 plus rituximab (Part B). The final number will depend on the
      number of dose escalations required to reach the MTD.
