      one of two treatment arms. The YOGA arm will involve a standardized 12-week, yoga-based
      intervention. The yoga intervention will consist of three treatment components: 1) in-person
      group yoga taught by a certified yoga therapist; 2) a relaxation audio recording for
      home-use; and 3) a DVD recording to reinforce concepts taught during in-person yoga sessions.
      Patients randomized to the structured exercise program (SEP) arm will participate in a
      12-week exercise program delivered in a group/class format and supervised by a fitness
      instructor. In addition, SEP patients will receive a DVD (for home use) describing the
      benefits of aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia, a one-on-one consultation session with the
      fitness instructor, an individualized exercise prescription, and supervised exercise sessions
      for 12 weeks.
