    
      Multiple osteochondromas is a rare condition where children develop multiple benign
      cartilage-capped bony tumors called osteochondromas on bones throughout the body, resulting
      in pain, deformity, limb length discrepancy, disability, and eventually arthritis and
      possible malignancy. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of two dosage regimens
      of palovarotene with placebo to prevent the formation of new osteochondromas in pediatric MO
      subjects with exostosin 1 or exostosin 2 gene mutations. Osteochondroma formation will be
      assessed by whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary efficacy objectives are to
      compare the effect of palovarotene on the volume of osteochondromas as assessed by MRI; and
      on the annualized rate of new or worsening deformities and MO-related surgeries. The overall
      safety of palovarotene and the effects of palovarotene on linear growth, bone growth plates,
      bone mineral density, quality of life, and pain due to osteochondromas will also be studied.
