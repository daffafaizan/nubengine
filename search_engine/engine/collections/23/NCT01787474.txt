    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety, feasibility, and maximum tolerated dose of membrane-bound
      interleukin 21 (mbIL21)-expanded haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells after induction
      chemotherapy with fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), cytarabine, and filgrastim-sndz,
      Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) (G-CSF) (FLAG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the persistence of adoptively-transferred expanded NK cells. II. Determine the
      immunophenotype and function of expanded NK cells. III. Determine the overall response of
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to this regimen.

      IV. Correlate NK cell persistence, phenotype, and function with overall response.

      V. Estimate the rate at which patients receiving this regimen are able to go to transplant.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of membrane-bound interleukin-21-expanded
      haploidentical natural killer cells followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive filgrastim-sndz subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) beginning on day -7 and
      continuing until absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) are equal or over 1000. Patients also
      receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and approximately 4 hours
      later followed by cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2 (days -6 to -3 for patients over
      age 60). Beginning 2-7 days after the last dose of fludarabine phosphate and cytarabine,
      patients receive membrane-bound interleukin-21-expanded haploidentical natural killer cells
      IV over 30 minutes thrice weekly for 3 doses over 4 days (Monday-Thursday only).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 56 days.
