      postoperative analgesic conditions with less side effects and fewer contraindications than
      central neural blocks,Bilateral PVB has been successfully used in the thoracic, abdominal,
      and pelvic regions(12). Paravertebral analgesia is produced by placing local anaesthetic (LA)
      alongside the vertebral column, close to the exit of the spinal nerves(13)..

      Traditionally, profound intraoperative analgesia has been provided by using high doses of
      opioids to suppress hormonal and metabolic stress responses to surgical stimuli. This regimen
      resulted in improved morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery(14).
