        -  Determine the objective response and time to treatment failure in patients with
           Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia treated with rituximab and fludarabine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine if molecular remissions are achievable in patients attaining a clinical
           complete response when treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 3-6 hours once weekly on weeks 1-4, 17, 18, 30, and 31 and
      fludarabine IV over 10-30 minutes once daily for 5 days on weeks 5, 9, 13, 19, 23, and 27.

      Patients are followed at least every 2 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
