      Primary

        -  To assess the complete pathologic response rate in patients with rectal cancer treated
           with radiation, modified neoadjuvant FOLFOX 6 chemotherapy followed by total mesorectal
           excision and adjuvant modified FOLFOX 6 chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To observe the overall pathologic response rate in these patients.

        -  To correlate pathologic staging with preoperative ultrasound and pelvic MRI staging.

        -  To assess toxic side effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To assess patterns of disease relapse, disease-free survival outcomes, and overall
           survival outcomes of these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients with stage II/III rectal cancer were treated with OXA 60mg/m2 weekly continuous
      infusion 5FU of 225 mg/m2/d d1-5 with pelvic RT of 1.8Gy/d for 28 doses. Adjuvant therapy
      consisted of 6 cycles of biweekly FOLFOX6.

      Surgery: Patients undergo total mesorectal excision by anterior resection or an abdominal
      perineal resection within 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

      Adjuvant therapy: Within 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive modified FOLFOX 6
      chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and
      continuous fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality of life assessment questionnaires at baseline and at each follow-up
      visit.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.
