      collapse until defibrillation. Activating volunteer citizens through the emergency medical
      dispatch center can potentially increase rates of bystander defibrillation and survival. The
      HeartRunner trial will investigage the effect of activating registered volunteer citizens
      through a mobile app integrated with the emergency medical services on 30-day survival
      following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Both arms will receive standard care by the
      Emergency Medical Services. The intervention arm will additionally receive the activation of
      volunteer citizen responders. The randomization will take place independently in 3 different
      strata according to heart runner distance to OHCA (< 3 min, 3-9 min, > 9 min). The trial will
      also assess whether it is safe, both physically and psychologically, to activate volunteer
      citizen responders to respond to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.
