      (DES) during the first 3 months by supporting the vessel wall thereby keeping the artery
      patent. Subsequently, resorption of the scaffold begins and its structure loosens. As a
      result of everolimus release, neointimal growth is inhibited similar to DES. Finally the
      implant is reabsorbed completely in about 2-3 years. BVS in terms of late stent thrombosis
      may be safer than DES. Transiently scaffolded vessels may regain their natural curvature and
      angulation as well as response to nitroglycerine and endothelial function.
