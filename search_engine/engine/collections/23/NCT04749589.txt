      time of diagnosis. The study hypothesis is that, besides leading to anemia, iron deficiency
      might be associated with impaired patient report outcomes in the domains of fatigue, quality
      of life, cognitive impairment and lower physical ability. No previous studies on colorectal
      cancer patients and iron deficiency are available.

      The participants (patients suspected of colorectal cancer after endoscopy) will be tested on
      these parameters. The participants and the investigators are blinded to the patients iron
      status. The study takes place before any preoperative iron treatment. Multivariate analysis
      will be used taking into account, gender, age, hemoglobin, tumor stage.
