      disease treatment, a substantial unmet clinical need remains for implantable
      materials/devices such as vascular grafts and heart valves with improved long-term
      performance and reduced device-related complications.

      To address these limitations new generation of biodegradable polymers using recent advances
      in supramolecular chemistry have been developed to create highly porous vascular grafts
      allowing efficient cell infiltration following by gradual replacement of the polymer material
      with the patient's own native-like vascular tissue resulting in full functional restoration.
      In addition to the ability of reducing postoperative graft-related complications such types
      of implants have a potential to grow to adapt to the overall body growth and therefore may
      represent a completely new modality for the treatment of congenital heart disease. In
      contrast to today's situation with synthetic non-absorbable vascular grafts considered as a
      "standard of care", where the pediatric patients have to be re-operated several times to
      adjust the prosthesis size to the somatic growth of the child associated with substantial
      morbidity and mortality and requiring prolonged anticoagulation treatment, a biodegradable
      polymer implant could represent a "one-time solution".
