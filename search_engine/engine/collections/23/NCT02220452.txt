    
      -  The perioperative period can be a significant source of psychological burden, anxiety
           and fear for patients

        -  Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods have been proposed in order to
           alleviate perioperative stress

        -  Music is one of the non-pharmacological methods which have been used in this context,
           with favorable effects both preoperatively and postoperatively

        -  Listening to music during the preoperative period has proved useful as an adjunct to
           premedication and can even be used instead of premedication. Additionally, listening to
           music postoperatively can also be useful, since it has been related to a more favorable
           recovery profile and possible attenuation of postoperative pain. In this context, music
           has also been used in Intensive Care Units, with measurable effects on anxiety scales
           and hemodynamic parameters. There are also studies investigating the use of music during
           operations under regional anesthesia, which have shown that music listening
           substantially decreases the need for anxiolytic administration throughout the operation

        -  The attenuation of perioperative stress through music listening is probably due to the
           activation of emotional and cognitive processes that evoke feelings of pleasure and can
           distract patients' attention from fear and unpleasant thoughts related to the surgical
           procedure

        -  Although the favorable effects of music listening during regional anesthesia for the
           attenuation of intraoperative stress in conscious patients are more or less expected and
           easily interpreted, less is known regarding the effect of intraoperative music listening
           on anesthetized, unconscious patients

        -  Generally, there is a notion that general anesthesia does not completely abolish
           auditory perception and that some processing of intraoperative events can occur in
           unconscious patients, even in the absence of postoperative recall

        -  The preservation of some form of auditory processing during general anesthesia is not
           necessarily undesirable and can be used to the patient's benefit, since it has been
           shown that subjecting patients to therapeutic suggestions during general anesthesia can
           improve recovery parameters or decrease hospital stay

        -  The investigators hypothesis is that intraoperative music listening can decrease
           anesthetic requirements. Therefore, the investigators will investigate sevoflurane
           consumption necessary to achieve a depth of anesthesia corresponding to bispectral index
           values of 45-55. Female patients subjected to abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease
           will be randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, audiotapes playing relaxing
           soothing orchestral music will be placed on the patients' ears after induction of
           general anesthesia while in the other group the same set of audiotapes will be used
           without however playing any music

        -  Sevoflurane consumption will be estimated by weighing the sevoflurane vaporizer in a
           high-precision scale before induction and after completion of the surgical procedure.
           Patients will also be queried regarding recall of any sounds or intraoperative events,
           dreaming while anesthetized and they will be asked to rate their satisfaction from
           anesthesia. Recovery parameters will also be investigated, such as postoperative nausea
           and vomiting and the intensity of postoperative pain. To ensure homogeneity,
           standardized analgesia will be administered in the two groups

        -  Since prolactin is related to the neuroendocrine response to stress, blood will also be
           sampled at predetermined timepoints during anesthesia, to detect potential differences
           between the two groups

        -  The clinical interest of this study lies in the fact that if a non-costly intervention
           such as music listening during anesthesia can lead to reduced requirements of anesthetic
           agents or to reduced need for postoperative analgesia, this theoretically can be
           translated to a reduction in anesthetic cost. In addition, improvement in recovery
           profile parameters could lead to a quicker discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit
           with reduction in turnaround times and overall time optimization.
