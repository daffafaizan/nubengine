      adolescents from secondary schools in Norway. Adolescents (aged 14-15 years) were the unit of
      analysis, and schools (clusters) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

        1. the physical active learning group (PAL-group), where the schools each week include one
           additional physical education (PE) lesson, 30 minutes of physical active learning, and
           30 minutes of physical activity (intervention condition);

        2. the don't worry - be happy group (DWBH-group), where the schools include one new
           activity class (60 minutes: Be Happy class) and one additional PE-class (60 minutes:
           Don't Worry class) per week (intervention condition);or

        3. current practice (control condition). An identical set of outcome measures are taken
           from all participants at baseline, and approximately 12 months after the baseline
           measures, when the participants were at the end of year 9
