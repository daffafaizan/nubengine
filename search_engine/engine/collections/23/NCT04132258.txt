      context of chronic bowel disease (IBD) or spondylartrhopathy (SPA). This damage is still
      poorly described in the literature. It can occur in isolation or in association with a fold
      pustulose table, which differs from the classic fold pustulose described by Cribier et al in
      autoimmune diseases by the presence of staphylococcus aureus in the pustules. Some authors
      also describe associated paradoxical psoriasiform reactions or an impetigo. In our
      experience, this condition is more frequently found in patients treated for IBD or SPA and
      has a clinically characteristic fissure appearance. Thus, the semiology but also the
      epidemiology of this crusty rhinitis is still poorly described.

      The objective of this study is to study the associated characteristics of crustal rhinitis in
      a cohort of patients treated with biotherapy for chronic inflammatory disease (IBD, SPA,
      psoriasis).

      Patient recruitment will take place over a one-year period, in a multi-centre manner (Angers
      and Nantes University Hospital) with prospective data collection in the form of a
      questionnaire and clinical evaluation during a dermatology consultation planned in the
      traditional care pathway for the follow-up of patients with skin manifestations during
      biotherapy treatment.
