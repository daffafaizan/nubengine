    
      Outline: This study is a single-arm, open, exploratory clinical trial;

      Subjects receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV Day1 and Day8 every 21 days repeated for 4 cycles;
      cisplatin 35mg/m2 IV Day1 and Day2 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles.

      Teriprizumab at recommended phase II dose is given every 3 weeks for 4 doses starting with
      Cycle1 Day1(C1D1).

      Subjects will then have surgery to remove their primary tumor within 6 weeks after their last
      dose of neoadjuvant therapy.

      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0-1

      Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined by the following laboratory values at study
      entry. All screening labs should be performed within 28 days of C1D1.

      Hematopoetic:

      Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL Absolute lymphocyte count ≥350 mcL Platelets
      ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L

      Renal: Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min

      Hepatic:

      Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.25 X ULN OR ≤ 2.5 x ULN for subjects with Gilbert's disease
      Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 2 X ULN

      Coagulation:

      International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is
      receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended
      use of anticoagulants Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject
      is receiving anticoagulant therapy and as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of
      intended use of anticoagulants
