      flavopiridol in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. 2. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on day
      1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression. A cohort of 3-6
      patients receives treatment at each dose level of flavopiridol. If dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT) occurs in no more than 1 of 6 patients, subsequent cohorts of 6 patients each receive
      escalating doses of drug on the same schedule. Intrapatient dose escalation to the next level
      is permitted in the absence of DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 27 months.
