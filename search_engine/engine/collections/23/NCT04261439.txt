    
      This is a phase I/Ib, open-label, global, multi-center study of subcutaneously administered
      NIZ985 alone and in combination with Spartalizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and
      lymphoma who have progressed after obtaining a previous response to anti-PD-1/ Check Point
      Inhibitor (CPI) therapy.

      The study consists of two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. Two separate arms will
      be examined during the escalation portion: 1) evaluation of NIZ985 as a single agent.
      Spartalizumab may be added at the time of the first disease re-evaluation and 2)
      administration of NIZ985 and Spartalizumab as a combination starting from Cycle 1Day 1.
