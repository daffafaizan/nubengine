      to this therapy. There is growing evidence that combining CPIs with other forms of
      immunotherapy has the potential to improve the desired effects of both CPIs and
      immunotherapies. This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of the immunotherapy
      ilixadencel when used in combination with a CPI. A Dose-escalation Committee (DEC) will
      monitor the study for any significant safety issues during Phase 1b.
