    
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common cause of end-stage renal disease. MEDiaN study
      investigators hypothesize that dysregulated mitochondrial fuel oxidation is a major driver of
      diabetic nephropathy. The sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i)
      empagliflozin has been shown to slow the progression of DN in patients with diabetes.

      The MEDiaN study aims to examine the state of fuel metabolism in participants with DN before
      and after the use of the SGLT-2i empagliflozin. The goals of the MEDiaN study are to better
      understand the contribution of fuel metabolism to the development of DN, and to determine if
      changes to fuel metabolism can have a positive impact on this disease.

      The MEDiaN study is a single-center single-arm open-label intervention study to examine the
      effects of empagliflozin 10mg daily taken for 30 days on fuel oxidation patterns in
      participants with type 2 diabetes and DN.

      The MEDiaN study plans to recruit 40 participants aged 21 to 100 years of age with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. Participants will receive treatment with oral
      empagliflozin 10mg daily for 30 days. The state of fuel metabolism will be examined through
      metabolomics analysis of blood and urine samples before and after empagliflozin 10mg daily
      taken for 30 days.
