      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) DHA to Arachidonic acid (AA) ratio in 160 cognitively healthy older
      individuals in response to DHA supplementation. Randomized clinical trials have yielded mixed
      results on the effect DHA supplementation on cognitive outcomes. This study asks the critical
      question of whether DHA gets into the brain in sufficient amounts after supplementation, and
      whether APOE genotype affects brain penetrance.

      This trial will also test the effect of DHA supplementation on changes in brain structural
      and functional connectivity assessed by MRI, and changes in cognition after two years of
      supplementation in all 320 participants.
