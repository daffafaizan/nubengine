      irritability, bodily discomfort, and insomnia. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of dronabinol in reducing withdrawal symptoms.

      During this twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, study visits will occur
      twice each week. During study visits, participants will receive either placebo or medication.
      Throughout the study, all participants will receive individualized psychotherapy sessions. At
      each study visit, vital signs, self-report ratings, and urine samples will be collected.
      Participants will have a follow-up evaluation at month 6.
