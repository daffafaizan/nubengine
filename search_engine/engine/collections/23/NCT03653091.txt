    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled prospective multi-center clinical
      investigation of subjects with T2D sub-optimally controlled on two oral anti-diabetic
      medications, one of which must be metformin, comparing the Fractyl DMR procedure using the
      Revitaâ„¢ System to a sham procedure. All subjects will participate in a 4 week oral
      anti-diabetic medication run-in period before the procedure to confirm inadequate blood
      glucose control in conjunction with medication compliance and nutritional counseling.
      Subjects who meet all criteria after screening are randomized 2:1 (DMR to sham), with double
      blinding (subject and endocrinologist/Sponsor). The endoscopist is not blinded.
