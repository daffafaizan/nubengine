      epilepsy). The cause of which is multifactorial. Multidrug resistance (MDR) causes decreased
      uptake of medicines in tissues. MDR occurs because of overexpression of a family of
      transporter proteins that act as a physiological defense mechanism that pumps toxins out of
      cells. Two groups of transporters, P-glycoprotein (PGP) and multidrug resistance-associated
      proteins (MRP), are important gatekeepers in the blood brain barrier. PGP and MRP are
      overexpressed in the brain tissue of pharmacoresistant patients with partial epilepsy and
      many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are substrates for PGP, MRP or both.

      It is logical to try to apply these observations to clinical practice. We hope that through
      co-administration of an inhibitor of transporter proteins, we can increase the CNS
      concentrations of AEDs, and subsequently improve seizure control. However, before this, it is
      critical to demonstrate that a transporter protein inhibitor can increase the concentration
      of AEDs in human brain.

      Probenecid is an MRP inhibitor while phenytoin is an MRP substrate. Evaluating whether
      probenecid can increase the CNS concentration of PHT can potentially be achieved
      noninvasively by using pharmaco-EEG.

      We plan to estimate the effect of probenecid (a transporter protein inhibitor) on the
      quantitative EEG recordings when it is administered to patients with pharmacoresistant
      epilepsy and in normal healthy volunteers.

      We plan to recruit two groups of 10 subjects each, normal volunteers and patients with
      pharmacoresistant epilepsy. They will undergo two treatment regimens; EEG recording after
      administration of intravenous phenytoin only and again after pre-dosing them with probenecid.
