    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the activity of combination of PS-341 (bortezomib) and irinotecan in patients
      with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (SCCHN) and the response rate of single agent PS-341 (followed by irinotecan at time of
      progression).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To continue exploring the toxicity of PS-341 alone and the combination of PS-341 and
      irinotecan in this patient population.

      II. To evaluate time to progression, overall survival and response to irinotecan and PS-341
      when given after PS-341 alone.

      III. To evaluate the relationship between pre-treatment nuclear localization of NF-kB, and
      NF-kB regulated gene expression in tissue (Cyclin D1, IAP1, Bcl-XL, Topo I), and serum (IL-6,
      IL-8, GRO-1 and VEGF) and response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and irinotecan
      IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive bortezomib as in arm I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon disease progression, patients may cross
      over to arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.
