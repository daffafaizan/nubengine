      start informing patients of their options. Many patients begin the labor process with a plan
      in place for their analgesia. Unfortunately, internet resources regarding labor analgesia
      that are available to the lay parturient are poor and often lead to misconceptions about the
      options and their risks. A significant number of patients refuse neuraxial analgesia based on
      misunderstandings, concerns about the procedure, or a lack of faith in the provider. Some
      women want a "natural childbirth" and/or control over their labor experience. Our study aimed
      at providing information and alternatives for labor analgesia in a simple written format.

      The investigators will provide information of available labor analgesia options (epidural,
      combined spinal/epidural, spinal, remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia, and intravenous
      opioids) to expecting mothers. Using a pamphlet written in English or Spanish disseminated to
      pregnant women in clinic and upon arrival in the labor and delivery unit, the procedures and
      their risks and benefits will be explained in simple terms. In the Labor and Delivery Unit
      the patients will have an opportunity to ask questions of the anesthesia care giver regarding
      the options for analgesia. After delivery while on F Green, patients will be asked to
      complete a questionnaire addressing their thoughts about the pamphlets and their overall
      satisfaction with their labor analgesia. The analysis will focus on the utility and effect of
      education materials on maternal informed consent for labor analgesia, on maternal choice of
      analgesia modality, and on maternal anxiety regarding their labor analgesia plan.
