      evaluation and therapeutic orientation of several kidney diseases. Although it is considered
      a safe procedure, BRP complications can occur and, most of the time, are related to the risk
      of bleeding and the main consequence of BRP. Complications include macroscopic hematuria and
      hematoma requiring blood transfusion, surgical intervention, or invasive procedure. Since
      hemorrhagic complications continue to be the highest risk after BRP due to severity and
      potential life-threatening risk, there is an effort to minimize the risk of bleeding by
      checking blood clotting markers prior to the procedure, uncontrolled hypertension and the use
      of antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants. The relevance of this study is to seek better
      evidence for clinical practice, considering the lack of Brazilian studies on the subject and
      the positive impact on patient comfort, besides the reduction of costs for the institution
      and overload in the work of the multidisciplinary team. In addition, it will contribute to
      the strengthening of the use of NOC in clinical practice and to the improvement of nursing
      knowledge.
