      in which patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest without ST-elevation on their first ECG
      will be randomized to either a strategy of immediate coronary angiography (treatment group)
      with possible coronary intervention or a strategy of delayed coronary angiography (control
      group). The study will include in total 1006 patients with Restoration of Spontaneous
      Circulation (ROSC). Randomization will be done via a web-based module after ECG is taken at
      the first medical contact but no later than after arrival at the emergency room. Coronary
      angiography should be performed within 120 minutes from randomization in the immediate
      angiography group. In the delayed angiography group, angiography with possible coronary
      intervention will be performed at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist and
      should preferably not be performed until three days after the cardiac arrest. This strategy
      is in accordance with standard practice. In case of recurrent chest pain, ST elevation,
      circulatory instability or cardiogenic shock, cross over to early angiography may occur. The
      quality of life and health economics will be evaluated at 6 months. The patients will undergo
      extensive neurocognitive tests and health instruments, these will be analyzed and presented.
