      least 2 trials of an antidepressant at an adequate dose) and currently meet DSM-IV criteria
      for depression qualify for this study. At the initial visit, each subject is given an MRI in
      order to perform a volumetric analysis of their hippocampus and a blood sample is taken in
      order to determine their genotype for the 5-HT1a(serotonin) promoter. Each patient is then
      aggressively treated (open label) for depression with the goal of remission. A second MRI
      scan is completed 6 months after sustained remission or 12 months from baseline if remission
      is not met or sustained.

      The investigators will select healthy volunteer controls with no personal or first relative
      history of depression and match with the subjects based on age and handedness. Genotyping and
      and MRI scan will be performed on the healthy subjects in order to compare all parameters.

      Hypothesis: It is anticipated that the hippocampal volume will be smaller than those of
      matched controls. It is also anticipated that the Homozygous G(-1019) genotype will be more
      prevalent in the patient group than in the healthy subjects.

      In addition, it is hypothesized that the investigators should find a small increase in
      hippocampal volume after long-term treatment. Also, most non-responders will be of homozygous
      G(-1019) 5-HT1a genotype and will have the greatest degree of hippocampal atrophy. Moreover,
      it is hypothesized that patients carrying a long allele of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism for 5-HTT
      might show a better response to antidepressants in general. Finally, it is anticipated that
      the TPH*A variant of the gene coding for tryptophan hydroxylase will be associated with
      poorer outcome.
