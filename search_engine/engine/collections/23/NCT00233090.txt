      treatment for fatigue post TBI.

      Background: After TBI, fatigue is one of the most common complaints, as documented in our
      work and that of many other researchers. People with TBI experience fatigue that seems to
      them out of proportion to whatever work they are doing or effort they are making. Fatigue
      after TBI is associated with decreased participation in normal activities in the community
      and has been linked to depression.

      Need for Research: Research on use of drugs to treat post-TBI fatigue is inadequate. While
      studies of fatigue in people with other chronic conditions suggest that modafinil helps
      relieve fatigue and has fewer side effects than some other drugs used in treating fatigue,
      the use of modafinil has not yet been tested in people with TBI.

      Current and Future Research Activity: More than 100 men and women volunteers who complain of
      post-TBI fatigue will be randomly assigned to a 4-week period of taking modafinil or a
      placebo. At the beginning and end of the study, the severity of their fatigue and associated
      symptoms (e.g., cognitive function, mood, pain, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, health
      status) will be assessed, as well as their participation in activities and perceived quality
      of life. It is hypothesized that modafinil will reduce the symptoms of fatigue and will
      increase level of activity and perceived quality of life to a significantly greater extent
      than will the placebo.
