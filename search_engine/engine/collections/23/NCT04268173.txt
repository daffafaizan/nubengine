      academic, public health, and non-government sectors. The main community partner Vivent
      Health, formerly known as the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin (ARCW), is a unique,
      state-wide organization that provides harm reduction services, including syringe services and
      confidential HIV and HCV testing, to clients at 10 fixed sites and numerous mobile units
      reaching all 72 Wisconsin counties. Based on investigator's preliminary studies and prior
      collaborations, investigator has selected 6 counties in rural Wisconsin, three of which
      investigator will deploy and evaluate the Client-Centered Prevention Home intervention model
      at Vivent Health field offices located within these service areas. Participants in the
      intervention will undergo a 12-week intensive multilevel harm reduction case-management
      intervention geared towards coordinating referrals to reduce substance use disorder and
      increase engagement in the substance use disorder care cascades, and reduce vulnerability to
      HIV, STIs, and HCV and increase in engagement in the HIV, STI, and HCV care cascades.
      Participants in the intervention arm will work with Prevention Navigators to undergo a risk
      assessment and identify problems and create goals that they want to achieve. Each session
      after that will be used to review the needs assessment and goals. During their last meeting,
      participants and prevention navigators will develop a discharge plan that will enable the
      participants to work on their goals on their own. Participants at all six sites will undergo
      rapid testing for HIV, HCV, and STIs, and fill out survey questionnaires to evaluate risk
      behaviors, intervention effectiveness, and general needs of the communities. There are three
      groups in this study which consist of intervention, delayed intervention (3 month wait-list
      period before intervention begins), and a nonintervention control group.
