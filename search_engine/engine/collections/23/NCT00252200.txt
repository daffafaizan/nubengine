      prevent renal insufficiency after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Patients included are those
      with greater than mild renal insufficiency preoperatively as defined by having a creatinine
      clearance of less than 50 mL/minute determined by the Cockroft-Gault formula. The infusion of
      nesiritide (BNP) 0.005 mcg/Kg/minute or placebo begins 1 hour before surgery and runs for 24
      hours started after the induction of anesthesia prior to cardiopulmonary bypass.
