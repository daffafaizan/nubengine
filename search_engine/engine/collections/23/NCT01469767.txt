    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of short-term treatment with fluocinonide
      cream 0.1% (Vanos®) in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Our hypothesis is that
      subjects will have a reduction in Investigator's Global Assessment scores at Day 7 and Day 14
      compared to Baseline.

      Secondary objectives include the use of actigraphy monitoring to determine the ability of
      Vanos® cream to reduce itch, and thus nocturnal scratching, in AD. Our hypothesis is that
      subjects will have a reduction in nocturnal scratching activity, as measured by actigraphy
      movement count per hour, at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline. Other secondary outcome
      measures include Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, body surface area involvement
      and Visual Analog Scale for itch. The investigators hypothesize that each of these measures
      will be improved at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline.
