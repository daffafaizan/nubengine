      The aim of this study is to:

        -  evaluate a hypoxia imaging agent, HX4, in patients with solitary tumors (i.e., locally
           advanced head and neck cancer)

        -  gain information on bio-distribution of [F-18]HX4

        -  compare the PET images of [F-18] FMISO to [F-18]HX4 for resolution, signal to background
           ratio, and tumor/blood ratio
