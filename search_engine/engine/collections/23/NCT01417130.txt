    
      ADAPT was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the safety and
      efficacy of naproxen and celecoxib for the primary prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
      dementia and for attenuation of age related cognitive decline in persons over 70 years of
      age. The ADAPT treatments were stopped on 17 December, 2004, after the substantial majority
      of participants had been given treatments over an interval of one to three years.
      Participants remained under observation until May, 2006, using double-masked methods of case
      identification that were identical to those of the original ADAPT protocol. Results from the
      entire period of observations in ADAPT were ambiguous and suggested a need for additional
      longitudinal data to learn whether the dual-inhibitor NSAID naproxen can effect a long-term
      reduction in the occurrence of AD dementia.

      This ADAPT Follow-up Study (ADAPT-FS) is following-up the participants originally enrolled in
      ADAPT after a further interval of four years, thereby identifying additional individuals with
      AD dementia in each treatment assignment group, and then using time-dependent methods to
      estimate and contrast incidence rates by treatment assignment. The study is also extending
      prior observations on trajectory of cognitive performance on several psychometric measures,
      thus testing the hypothesis of differences in such trajectory by treatment assignment in
      ADAPT.

      ADAPT-FS is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and is being conducted at the
      Roskamp Institute in Tampa, FL; the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System in
      Seattle, WA; Boston University School of Medicine, in Boston, MA; the Johns Hopkins Medical
      Institutions, in Baltimore, MD; Sun Health Research Institute, in Phoenix, AZ; and the
      University of Rochester, in Rochester, NY.
