      Alternative techniques have been in development over the last twenty years, with the hope of
      optimizing operating times, total ultrasound energy used, patient safety, patient
      satisfaction and visual recovery associated with cataract surgery.

      Divide-and conquer is the parent nucleofracture technique.The subluxation technique is a
      newer technique that is less frequently used because of an increased risk of corneal
      endothelium damage.

      The aim of this comparative study was to evaluate corneal edema immediately after surgery
      performed with the subluxation technique versus divide-and-conquer. Corneal edema was
      determined by measuring central corneal thickness (CCT).
