      cancer treated with fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium (Orzel). II. Evaluate the
      toxicity profile of this regimen in this patient population. III. Compare response rates
      obtained in this study with those observed in recent phase III studies in younger patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fluorouracil-uracil and oral leucovorin calcium (Orzel) every
      8 hours for 28 days. Courses repeat every 35 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
