      cohort of French pregnant women designed to study the association between vitamin D status
      during pregnancy and the risk of pre-eclampsia. Vitamin D concentration at first and third
      trimester of pregnancy as well as in cord blood is available for 1400 women. Investigators
      will include 200 children born from these women. Children will undergo lung function tests
      and prick-tests and parents will answer the ISAAC questionnaire that is a standardised
      questionnaire designed to evaluate asthma and rhinitis symptoms. The main outcome of this
      study will be specific airway resistance. The investigators will look for an association
      between specific airway resistance and vitamin D concentration measured during the first
      trimester of pregnancy in their mothers.
