      suctioning of infants, a higher concentration of chlorhexidine for peripartum vaginal and
      postpartum newborn cleansing results in reduction in maternal child transmission (MCT) of
      HIV. The in vitro data suggest that a higher concentration of chlorhexidine in the primary
      wash solution is much more likely to have a virucidal effect perinatally and thus reduce MCT.

      Perinatal intervention consists of the following: 1) cervicovaginal wash of the entire birth
      canal with a chlorhexidine solution at the time of each vaginal examination of a mother in
      labor; 2) immediate suctioning of the nasal and oral passages of the infant at the time the
      head emerges (fluids to be tested for viral load at future date); and 3) thorough washing of
      the baby with a chlorhexidine solution immediately after delivery. Blood samples are
      collected from some infants for measurement of chlorhexidine levels approximately 2 hours
      post-washing. During the 24 to 48 hours following delivery, infants are examined and mothers
      are queried using standardized questionnaires for subjective complaints related to the
      chlorhexidine washes. Speculum-aided vaginal exams are done for any persistent (greater than
      24 hours) or severe complaints.
