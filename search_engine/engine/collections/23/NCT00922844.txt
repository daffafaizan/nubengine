      anesthesiology both isoflurane and sevoflurane are frequently used. At present the number of
      studies comparing the influence of isoflurane and sevoflurane on blood pressure and systemic
      vascular resistance is limited. Moreover, the results presented in the available literature
      are inconsistent. The decision as to which of both volatiles should be used during cardiac
      surgery is not evidence-based, but is based on personal preference of the anesthesist. The
      most reliable way to compare the effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane on blood pressure and
      systemic vascular resistance is a randomized controlled trial in patients during
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
