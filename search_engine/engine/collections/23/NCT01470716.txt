      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type, and it accounts for 85% of cases.
      Unfortunately, the majority of patients with NSCLC have metastatic disease at diagnosis.
      However, even patients with resectable disease have poor survival. The need to improve
      survival rates in these patients prompted research exploring the role of systemic therapy in
      operable NSCLC. In the 1990s, several clinical trials of preoperative chemotherapy (also
      known as induction chemotherapy) followed by surgery or radiation in patients with locally
      advanced NSCLC showed improvements in survival. Erlotinib is an orally administered tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The presence of somatic
      mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR strongly correlates with increased responsiveness to
      EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recently three randomized phase III trials showed that
      first-line use of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC significantly improved
      response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to platinum-based chemotherapy.
      These findings prompted this phase II trial of preoperative Erlotinib in patients with
      operable stage II and IIIA NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.
