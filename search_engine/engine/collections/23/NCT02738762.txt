    
      -  At admission (day 0) a plasma glutamine level is measured. The measurement can be
           performed from blood taken for the first arterial blood gas analysis. Patients are
           eligible for the study when the plasma glutamine level is lower than 420 µmol/l.

        -  After informed consent is obtained patients are randomised to receive enteral glutamine
           or not ( the control group). Enteral glutamine supplementation is started (day 1) at a
           dose of 3 sachets per day given at 6.00, 14.00 and 22.00 hr. A sachet contains 9 grams
           of L-glutamine ( Glutaperos®, GLNP Life Sciences).

        -  Enteral glutamine supplementation will be given for a maximum of 10 days or until the
           patient is discharged from the ICU.

        -  Plasma glutamine levels will be measured four times a day, at 06.00, 12.00, 18.00 and
           00.00 hours, concurrently with the standard arterial blood gas analyses so no extra
           blood is taken from the patient.

        -  On day 3 at 12.00 hours the dose of glutamine will be increased to 3 times 2 sachets if
           plasma glutamine level is still below 420 µmol/l.

        -  From day 3 ( 12.00 hrs) until day 10 ( end of study) the dosage of enteral glutamine
           will be evaluated daily at 12.00 hours. When the plasma glutamine level is higher than
           420 µmol/l the dosage of enteral glutamine will be adjusted according to the schedule
           below.

        -  In patients who randomized to the control group, the plasma glutamine level will be
           measured daily at 12.00 hr concurrently with standard arterial blood gas analysis
