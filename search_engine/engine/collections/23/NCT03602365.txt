      each subject.

      Each subject will me asked to lie in supine posture for 20 mins followed by duplicate
      measurements of VO2. The GJ will be started in supine posture for 20 min followed by
      duplicate measurements of VO2. The subject will then be asked to sit in a chair for 20 min,
      followed by duplicate measurement of VO2, The GJ will be started for 20 min in seated posture
