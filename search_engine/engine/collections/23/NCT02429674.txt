      associated symptoms of sleep disturbance are best treated using an empirically supported
      psychotherapy that is augmented with a sleep improvement module. Twenty adolescents (ages
      12-17) who meet criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive
      disorder not otherwise specified, or adjustment disorder with depressed mood and also report
      elevated levels of sleep disturbance will receive Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed
      Adolescents (IPT-A) with an adjunctive sleep module that is integrated throughout the
      treatment. Identifying the best approach to treating both the adolescent's depression and the
      commonly associated symptom of sleep disturbance will have significant implications for the
      long-term outcomes of depressed adolescents. Moreover, identifying unique symptom and
      biological profiles at the outset of treatment may enable doctors to predict treatment
      outcome.
