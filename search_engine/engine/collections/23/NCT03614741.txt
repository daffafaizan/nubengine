      thromboprophylaxis and SLEDD will be studied in the Tampere University Hospital intensive
      care unit. After inclusion the subjects will be randomly assigned into study group (30
      patients) and control (30 patients).

      All subjects receive a bolus of tinzaparin 4500 IU into the inlet line of dialyzer at 5
      minutes after the start of blood pump. Afterwards the subjects in the study group will
      continue to receive continuous tinzaparin infusion (concentration 100 IU/ml) 500 IU/h over
      seven hours. No other heparin product (including arteria flush lines) nor dilution fluids at
      the dialyzer are allowed during the study period of 24 hours. Each SLEDD treatment will be
      performed with Cordiax 5008S (Fresenius) for 8 hours. After the study period of 24 hours
      thromboprophylaxis will be prescribed according to the normal practice in the ICU.

      The primary outcome measure is plasma anti-FXa concentration at 4 hours from the onset of
      SLEDD. Plasma Anti-FXa will be drawn at timepoints 0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours
      from the onset of the dialysis.

      The clotting formation in RRT system will be evaluated by clotting scoring. In the case of
      serious clotting RRT treatment is stopped and the new RRT is started. The study will end to
      the new RRT.
