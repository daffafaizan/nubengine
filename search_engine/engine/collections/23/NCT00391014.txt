      autologous stem cell transplant. Taking into account that Saprophytic Aspergillus is usually
      acquired by inhalation, to protect the bronchial tree just before the tissue invasion is
      quite attractive. In haematologic patients, as well as those ones subjected to an Allogeneic
      haematopoietic progenitor cell transplant, there is another group of patients at high risk of
      Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA). These are those patients with acute myeloid leucemia
      (AML), submitted to induction, intensification or consolidation polychemotherapy. The IPA
      incidence rate in these patients, whenever during their evolution, reaches 18-20%, with usual
      treatments. Furthermore, unlike allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cell transplant
      patients, neutropenia was the only IPA risk factor. Nowadays, pharmacologic prophylaxis
      against IPA, in patients with allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cell transplant and
      patients affected by AML in induction or intensification therapy is far from being optimal,
      because of problems related to tolerance and drug interactions .

      The Nebulized Liposomal Amphotericin B (Ambisome) prophylaxis against IPA has shown good
      tolerance, safety and efficacy in lung transplant recipients.

      Extrapolating the results obtained in lung transplant recipients, we get the conclusion that
      it would be essential to study safety and tolerance of nebulized AMBISOME in the group of
      patients with different peculiarities, mucositis secondary to chemotherapy, and high
      incidence of IPA in order to reach the goal of evaluate its efficacy as prophylaxis against
      IPA in this kind of patients
