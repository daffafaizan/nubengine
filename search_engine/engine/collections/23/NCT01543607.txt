      to evaluate and stent a bile duct blockage. During the ECRP and just prior to the stent
      placement subjects will undergo the placement of a radiofrequency ablation catheter into the
      bile duct blockage. Heat will be applied to the bile duct in order to open the blockage and
      prevent the re-growth of tissue into the stent; after the radiofrequency ablation, stent will
      be placed. Three days after the procedure subjects will receive a phone call from the
      research coordinator to check any adverse or unwanted effects of the treatment. The study
      procedure (radiofrequency ablation) takes place over 10 minutes during ERCP. The subjects
      will undergo routine follow up for their medical problems. No follow up visits are required
      as part of the study.
