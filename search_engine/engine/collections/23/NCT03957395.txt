    
      Patients with FBSS and CRPS are evaluated for VAS,, dissability scale, Quality of Life (QoL),
      sleep disorders and mental disorders.

      All patients undergo percutaneus (1 or 2) 8-contact SCS electrode implantation with trial.

      All patients are blindly randomized to tonic or burst or high frequency or off stimulation.
      After 2-week period each participant is adequately switched to another type of stimulation
      for next 2 weeks. Alltogether crossover takes 8 weeks: four 2-week periods of tonic, burst,
      HF and off stimulation. At the end of trial period patients are subjected to the mode of
      stimulation which is the most efficent. The final 2-week stimulation is performed with final
      renewed evaluation for VAS, amount of taken medications, dissability scale, Quality of Life
      (QoL), sleep disorders and mental disorders. Follow-up observation will last up to 12 months.
