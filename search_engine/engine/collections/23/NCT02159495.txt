      expanded T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral
      vector to express a co-stimulatory CD123-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as
      a truncated EGFR (CD123CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt+ T cells [CD123+ CAR T cells]) following
      lymphodepletion for patients with CD123+ relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      (arm 1), or CD123+ persistent or recurrent Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm
      (BPDCN) (arm 2). II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for both arms (AML and
      BPDCN). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess activity in the form of CD123+ CAR T cell
      persistence, 6 month progression free survival (PFS 6mo) rate, and 1 year overall survival
      (OS) rate, and describe the immunogenicity of CD123R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ T cells. TERTIARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. To assess impact on hematopoiesis, change from baseline in numbers of CD123+
      blood cells, CD123 expression on malignant cells and hematopoietic cells, and the clinical
      efficacy of EGFRt mediated CAR T cell ablation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous or allogeneic (related or unrelated
      donor) CD123+ CAR T cells. Patients undergo a lymphodepleting regimen 3-10 days prior to
      CD123+ CAR T cell infusion as determined by the principal investigator and the protocol team.
      Patients receive either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3; fludarabine
      phosphate and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3; fludarabine phosphate IV on days -5 to -3
      and cyclophosphamide IV on days -4 and/or -3. Patients receive autologous or allogeneic
      CD123+ CAR T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients with evidence of disease at > 28
      days, continuing expression of the CD123 antigen, and not having experienced a dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) may receive a second infusion of CD123+ CAR T cells after 28 days. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, then every 2 days for up
      to 14 days, every week for 1 month, every month for 1 year and then yearly for 15 years.
