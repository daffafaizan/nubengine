      measurement. The experimental condition is the standardised therapy session using therapy
      animals (AAT), while the control condition is the comparable "standard" therapy session
      without the presence of an animal.

      Over a period of four weeks, patients have four standardised therapy sessions per week, that
      alternate in a way that two sessions in two consecutive weeks are similar except for one is
      with the presence of animals and one without. In this way, data is collected over 16 therapy
      sessions (8 experimental, 8 control) for each patient.

      Each therapy session lasts about 20 minutes.

      The study takes place at REHAB Basel. Animal-assisted therapies are held in a special room at
      REHAB Basel in the presence of one or more small animals that will be selected by the
      therapist.

      Patients are allocated randomly to start with either the experimental or the control
      condition.
