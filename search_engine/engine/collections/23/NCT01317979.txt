      T2DM patients who receive metabolic surgery for the treatment of their diabetes. This study
      will recruit 200 obese T2DM patients who receive gastrointestinal metabolic surgery in our
      center and follow up them for one year. The Inclusion criteria are those with T2DM more than
      6 months, age between 18 to 65 and HbA1C > 8%. All the pre-operative clinical parameters will
      be collected prospectively, including C-peptide and stimulated C-peptide. The genetic
      polymorphism of these patients will also be analyzed and collected. The success of T2DM
      remission will be assessed at 12 months after metabolic surgery will be composite endpoint of
      CVD risk factor resolution; specifically, the proportion of patients with HbA1c < 6.5%. The
      clinical predictors will be analyzed by uni-vriate and muti-variate analysis. In the first
      year project, we will included 100 patients and will include another 100 patients at the
      second year. This project will apply for the budget of 1st year.
