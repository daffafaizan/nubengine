      with a placebo as the control. Following a screening exam, the duration of the trial will be
      1 month. Oral examinations will occur at Visit 1 (baseline), and Visit 2 (4 weeks post
      screening). Also, at these visits, subjects will be asked keep a diary for the one month and
      their thoughts about the effect of the mouthrinse on their breath and their mouth feeling of
      "freshness". They will also be asked about the taste and consistency of the mouth rinse.
      Plaque accumulation will be measured by the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein method
      of quantifying plaque formulation (PI). Gingival health will be measured using the Modified
      Gingival Index (MGI)
