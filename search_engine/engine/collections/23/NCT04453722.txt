      the Oxalert EPO. All patients will wear the Oxalert for 24 hours preoperatively in the
      monitoring only mode (no alerts), throughout hospitalization up to six days, and for 24
      post-discharge hours. Randomization will be to Oxalert in monitor-only mode or to its normal
      mode which provides progressive audible and tactile alerts for hypoxemia.
