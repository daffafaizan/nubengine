      unknown partner and personal or partner pregnancy plans. Eligible women will participate in
      comprehensive safer conception counseling including offering daily, oral TDF/FTC as PrEP. The
      primary outcomes are to evaluate uptake of and adherence to periconception PrEP among
      HIV-exposed women in rural Uganda.

      To accomplish this, women will participate in quarterly study visits, HIV and pregnancy
      testing, questionnaires and safer conception/adherence group counseling sessions.
      Participants will be eligible to initiate PrEP at any time during the first 6 months of the
      9-month (maximum) study follow-up period. Participants who initiate PrEP will use an
      electronic pill cap to measure daily adherence and will be asked to give blood samples to
      measure plasma TFV at quarterly study visits.

      Women who become pregnant or test positive for HIV during the 9-month follow-up period will
      complete exit activities (questionnaire and in-depth interview) and be referred to
      appropriate antenatal and/or HIV follow-up care.
