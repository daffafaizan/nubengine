      psychosocial impairment. Intralesional corticosteroid have been a mainstay in the treatment
      of hypertrophic scars. However, there are many disadvantages of corticosteroid injection such
      as severe pain, skin atrophy, skin thinning, steroid acne, telangiectasia and
      hypopigmentation.

      Recent reports propose new treatment methods for hypertrophic scars with the use of
      fractional ablative lasers to create zones of ablation of the skin that may assisted the
      penetration of drugs to the skin.
