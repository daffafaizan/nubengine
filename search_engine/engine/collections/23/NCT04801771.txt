    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common implant and follow-up
      protocol. The objective will be to follow fifty-seven (57) adolescents and young adults
      (10-21 years of age), with Down syndrome, moderate to severe sleep apnea, and
      post-adenotonsillectomy, for 12 months after undergoing implant of the Inspire Upper Airway
      Stimulation (UAS) System. The study is being conducted in order to evaluate objective change
      in cognition and expressive language after implant and therapy with the Inspire UAS System.

      Prior to implant subjects will be required to meet eligibility criteria, complete quality of
      life questionnaires and undergo neurocognitive testing (NCT) and expressive language
      sampling. Eligibility criteria will be determined via review of medical records, an in-lab
      polysomnography (sleep study), and a drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE).

      After implant of the Inspire UAS System, subjects will undergo five (5) study visits. Four
      (4) of the visits will include an in-lab sleep study (PSG). Follow-up expressive language
      sampling and neurocognitive testing will be performed at 6 months post-implant. Follow-up
      quality of life questionnaires will be completed at 12 months post-implant.

      Subjects will conclude their participation in the study at the end of their 12 month study
      visit.
