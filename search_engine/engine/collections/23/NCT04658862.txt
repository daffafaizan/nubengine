      gemcitabine into the urine. Urothelial carcinoma, specifically transitional cell carcinoma of
      the upper and lower genitourinary tract, has demonstrated meaningful responsiveness to
      deoxycytidine analogues. Gemcitabine has also demonstrated efficacy and a tolerable safety
      profile in NMIBC and metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Study consists of screening phase of 42
      days, treatment phase and follow up phase. The total duration of study will be up to 8 years.
      Efficacy evaluation includes disease assessment (Cystoscopy/TURBT Biopsy/Pathology) and
      Patient Reported Outcomes (Quality of Life Assessments) and safety assessments includes vital
      sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examinations, clinical
      laboratory tests, cystoscopic examination, anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessments, concomitant
      treatments/procedures and adverse event monitoring.
