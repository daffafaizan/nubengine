      by RD) while receiving standard of care cancer treatment (Radiation + Temozolomide). Study
      dietitians will place patients on a strict and controlled diet that manages daily
      macronutrient breakdown and increases the ratio of dietary fat relative to protein and
      carbohydrate consumption. Dietitians will provide guidance and teaching of the diet, as well
      as, monitoring and diet adjustment to ensure metabolic ketosis. Dietitians and study
      physicians (and their staff) will monitor subjects for safety, nutrition, quality of life,
      and standard of care tumor assessments over the course of the study.
