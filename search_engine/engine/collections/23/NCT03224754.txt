      population of Mississippi and the percentage of malignancies in these cases.The specimens
      will be searched through the University of Mississippi Medical Center's Pathology Laboratory
      Information system (Copath), from April 2010 to December 2016. The retrospective cases will
      be retrieved using natural language search. The total number of thyroid FNA will be retrieved
      and the percentage of cases with AUS/ FLUS will be calculated. Followup of these cases will
      be done looking for additional fine needle aspirations of the thyroid or thyroidectomy
      specimens. Cases with diagnosis of AUS/ FLUS will have correlation with the diagnosis on the
      thyroidectomy specimens if available in our system.
