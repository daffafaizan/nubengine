      research associate (CRA) on the use of PikoLogic® for home disease management prior to
      discharge from the hospital. The CRA will also confirm COPD discharge education was completed
      by a discharge coordinator and the patient understood the instructions. The CRA will review
      "seek medical care if:" and "seek immediate medical care if:" instructions at discharge. The
      discharge CRA will also evaluate subjects for their ability to use the PikoLogic® correctly
      and will score the patient using an objective and subjective measurement tool. A modified
      Discharge Knowledge Assessment Tool© will be utilized.1 Objective measurements will include
      training time and patient compliance with PikoLogic® prior to discharge. Subjective data
      scores and objective measurements will be utilized for program implementation evaluation.
