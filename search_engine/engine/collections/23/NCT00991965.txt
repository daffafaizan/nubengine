      bone (from another site on your body) to replace missing bone in your jaw. INFUSE® Bone Graft
      is commercially available and is made up of 2 parts - recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein-2 (rhBMP 2) placed on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). The rhBMP-2 is a
      genetically altered protein which recruits bone-forming cells to the surgical area and
      changes local cells to bone. ACS is made from Type I collagen from bovine (cattle) tendon. It
      helps to hold the rhBMP-2 in place and acts as a support for the growing bone. The sponge
      itself will reabsorb in time as the new bone forms.

      The purpose of this research study is to shorten the treatment time course for the patients.
      This post-market study has been designed to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      INFUSE® Bone Graft, along with dental implant placement, in a single procedure.
