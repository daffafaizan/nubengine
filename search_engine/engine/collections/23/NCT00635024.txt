      Primary

      * To evaluate the hematological response rate of anti-thymocyte globulin given in combination
      with melphalan in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the toxicity and tolerability of this combination in these patients.

        -  To assess time to disease progression in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  To assess survival of patients treated with these drugs. OUTLINE: Patients receive
           anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6 hours and melphalan IV on day 1. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 6 courses. Patients then receive melphalan alone as above for another
           6 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.
