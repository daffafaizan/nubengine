      with SBRT, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of pre-operative modified
      FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
      The investigators hypothesize that pre-operative modified FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT will
      improve the rate of R0 resections compared to historical controls treated with standard
      gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and fractionated radiation prior to surgery.
