      Dysport速/Azzalure速, Ipsen - Galderma. These formulations behave distinctly in different ways
      electrophysiologically and clinically and results obtained with one formulation cannot be
      extrapolated to the other. There are only few clinical research directly comparing the two
      formulations in the treatment of forehead lines.
