    
      This study is a randomized, therapy-controlled trial in a primary care setting at a
      university hospital. Patients presenting to our outpatient clinic with initial symptoms of
      coxarthrosis will be assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. After patient
      consent, 6 weeks of treatment will ensue. During the six weeks of treatment, patients will
      receive one of two treatments, conventional physiotherapy or whole-body-vibration exercises
      of one hour three times a week. Follow-up examinations will be performed immediately after
      treatment and after another 6 and 20 weeks, for a total study duration of 6 months. 20
      patients will be included in each therapy group.
