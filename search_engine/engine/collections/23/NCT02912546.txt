    
      Material and methods:

      Eighteen stroke patients, eighteen hypertensive patients and eighteen healthy subjects (men
      and women) will be enrolled. The investigator will use a 1.5 Tesla MRI device with a large
      magnet bore (70 cm) allowing positions change. Two measures will be performed, one in supine
      position and the other in head down position (-20Â°). A 3D FSE ASL sequence will be acquired
      and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) maps will be reconstructed. Volume of interest (VOI) will be
      placed on cortical grey matter (frontal and posterior gyrus), on subcortical deep grey matter
      (caudate nuclei, thalami) and subcortical white matter (semi oval centers). Differences in
      CBF values (in mL/100g/min) will be analyzed using SAS 9.3 software for Windows (SAS
      Institute, Cary North Carolina, USA).

      Expected results and hypothesis:

      CBF is expected to significantly vary between the supine and head down positions. It is
      expected to at least increase in the head down position, for stroke patients. For healthy
      subjects and hypertensive patients, cerebral autoregulation may limit CBF increase although
      an increasing trend for CBF is expected.
