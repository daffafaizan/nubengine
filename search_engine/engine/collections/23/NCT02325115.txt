      females and 256 males) working adults including 217 soldiers from Paris Fire Brigade, 93
      nurses and 9 individuals from a research laboratory. The PRS population was comprised of 121
      remitted schizophrenia patients (39 females and 82 males) who were all clients of the
      rehabilitation centre for psychotic disorders (Le Vinatier hospital), situated in Lyon,
