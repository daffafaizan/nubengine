      older individuals. Current estimates indicate that as many as 50% of American women and 20%
      of men over the age of 50 will be at risk for osteoporotic fractures during their lifetimes,
      and that these fractures are associated both with higher risk for further fractures and with
      higher mortality rates. Osteoporosis and subsequent fragility fractures can be prevented if
      diagnosed and treated appropriately. The first step of treatment guidelines for individuals
      with reduced bone mineral density (BMD), as identified with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) scan, is the implementation of lifestyle measures to reduce bone loss. These include
      the supplementation of dietary calcium and vitamin D to maintain appropriate calcium intake
      and reduce resorption of mineralized calcium from bone. Pharmacological treatment can be used
      for the treatment of osteoporosis in individuals who have reduced BMD (less than -2.5
      T-score) and for those who have sustained a fragility fracture. The bisphosphonates are first
      line agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. Coral-derived calcium is a novel formulation
      of calcium supplement, which has not yet been rigorously investigated as an efficacious
      nutrient for the skeleton. Ibandronate is a commonly available bisphosphonate prescribed for
      the treatment of osteoporosis. Vitamin D is a nutrient required to absorb vitamin D from the
      diet.
