      during COH cycle resulted in a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate in patients with
      poor embryo quality, with repeated IVF failures and in poor responders. This protocol
      combines the effect of the microdose flare on endogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      release with the benefit of an immediate luteinizing hormone suppression of the GnRH
      antagonist.

      The basic hypothesis of this approach can also benefit IVF patients with good prognosis
      without compromising the ability to use gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist to
      effectively trigger ovulation, while completely eliminating any threat of clinically
      significant ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

      The purpose of the study is to compare cycles consisting of ultrashort flare GnRH agonist
      combined with flexible multidose GnRH antagonist with those using the flexible multidose GnRH
      antagonist protocol

      1. To compare the IVF outcome variables and ongoing pregnancy rates.
