      efficacious for use in clearing common warts.

      The primary objective of this study is to gather lesion clearance data on common warts after
      application of pulses from the Nanopulse System and determine the optimal number of
      treatments necessary. Clearance will be measured by clinical observation.

      Other objectives of the study include gathering efficacy data on the use of the Nanopulse
      System for treating common warts in terms of:

      1.) Safety in a clinical setting in terms of minimal adverse events over the course of the
      trial; 2.) Cosmetic results during the healing process and cosmetic outcome; 3.)Effects of 1,
      2, 3 or 4 treatments in terms of clearance and cosmetic outcome for each treated wart;
      4.)Subject impressions immediately following application of pulses; 5.)Subject satisfaction
      with the treatment and cosmetic outcome during and following the healing process; 6) Device
      performance and clinical feedback under actual clinical conditions and to gather information
      on design features that may be modified to optimize the device.
