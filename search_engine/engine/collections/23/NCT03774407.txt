      therapy for female MS patients. The goal is to recruit 20 patients from the MS clinic in the
      neurology department of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. This study has been
      planned in collaboration with reproductive endocrinology, endocrinology, gynecology and basic
      science. The 1mg transvaginal dose was chosen after careful search of the literature and
      consultation with collaborators.

      Single-group pilot study.

      Subjects:

      Patients with relapsing remitting MS and urogenital symptoms (frequency, urgency, frequent
      urinary tract infections, incontinence) will be invited to participate in the study.
      Enrollment will be during their scheduled clinic appointment. Some candidates (patients of
      the primary investigator) may be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the study.

      The clinical trial will be explained to potential participants in detail, reviewing the
      objectives and methodology of the study. There will be adequate time allotted to answer any
      questions or concerns from the potential participants. Those patients interested in
      participating in the study will be asked to sign the consent form. In order to remind
      patients about their follow-up visits, lab work, etc., they will be contacted routinely.
      Participants will be instructed to call in case of questions or concerns.

      Patients will be evaluated clinically during their scheduled follow up in which a full
      neurological exam will be performed during each visit. Patients will be instructed by the
      primary investigator how to correctly use the vaginal cream. This will be done at their
      enrolment and reinforced by the principal investigator, during their follow up visits.
