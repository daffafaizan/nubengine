      of Veterans at high risk may be growing. Although the months following discharge from
      psychiatric hospitalization are a period of acute risk for Veterans, there is a dearth of
      empirically supported treatments tailored to psychiatric inpatients and no studies examining
      treatments for psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans. This randomized controlled trial will
      test the efficacy of an adaptation of Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation
      (MI-SI) on the severity of suicidal ideation in psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans at high
      risk for suicide. Participants will be recruited from the Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Unit at
      the Syracuse VA Medical Center. To meet high-risk criteria, Veterans must score over two on
      the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), which is prospectively predictive of death by suicide.
      Participants will complete a screening assessment to confirm eligibility and a baseline
      assessment of risk factors for suicide. They will be randomized to receive Motivational
      Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI) or a revised version (MI-SI-R) plus
      treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU alone. The MI-SI groups will receive two sessions of MI-SI
      during hospitalization and one telephone booster session after discharge. Participants in all
      conditions will be asked to complete telephone follow-up interviews at 1, 3, and 6 months
      after discharge. Change in the severity of suicidal ideation will be measured using the SSI.
