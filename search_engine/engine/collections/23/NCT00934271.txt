      fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in Rigshospitalet/National University Hospital,
      Copenhagen, Denmark. All patients had MR control regularly to monitor tunour control, and
      biochemical control assessed by growth hormone measurements during an oral glucose tolerance
      test. Furthermore all other pituitary axes were tested for sufficiency and concomitant
      medication likewise registered. The 7 year interim analysis demonstrated an acceptable tumour
      control and biochemical remission profile, and most patient had subsequent withdrawal of
      somatostatin analogue- and growth hormone receptor antagonis therapy. The observational study
      will continue with a new update in approx 2 years
