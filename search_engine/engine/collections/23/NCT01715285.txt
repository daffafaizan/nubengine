      physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in
      a clinical trial)-controlled study designed to determine the efficacy of abiraterone acetate
      and low-dose prednisone in participants with mHNPC. The study consists of 4 parts: Screening
      Phase (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1); Double-blind treatment Phase
      (consists of 4-week dosing cycles wherein abiraterone acetate will be administered as 1,000
      milligram [mg] along with 5 mg prednisone or only placebo orally); Follow-up Phase (every 4
      months up to 60 months or until death, lost to follow up, withdrawal of consent or study
      termination) Open-label Extension (OLE) Phase. Participants in the Double-blind Treatment
      Phase will have the opportunity to enroll into the OLE Phase. The OLE Phase will allow
      participants to receive active drug (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) until Long-term
      Extension (LTE) Phase for an additional period of up to 3 years. Participants will
      discontinue study treatment at disease progression or unacceptable toxicity unless, in the
      Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit
      from study treatment. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the active treatment
      group (abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus prednisone 5 mg daily plus ADT) or the control
      group (ADT plus placebos).Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by overall survival and
      radiographic progression-free survival. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
