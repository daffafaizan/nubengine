    
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the combination of enfortumab vedotin +
      pembrolizumab versus standard of care gemcitabine + platinum-containing chemotherapy, in
      subjects with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      Enfortumab vedotin may be administered for an unlimited number of cycles until a protocol
      defined reason for study discontinuation occurs. Pembrolizumab may be administered for a
      maximum of 35 cycles or a protocol-defined reason for study discontinuation occurs, whichever
      is first. Cisplatin or carboplatin plus gemcitabine may be administered for a maximum of 6
      cycles or a protocol-defined reason for study discontinuation occurs, whichever is first.
