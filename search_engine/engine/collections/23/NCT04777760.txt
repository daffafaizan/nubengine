      indicates that PS does not demonstrate statistically significant beneficial effects on
      reducing the mortality and the rate of BPD in term and late preterm infants with meconium
      aspiration syndrome(MAS). Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that preterm infants with
      NARDS do not benefit from one dose of PS. And the speculation can explain why not all preterm
      infants with respiratory distress can be beneficial from PS. In the era of pre-NARDS, the
      preterm infants fulfilling the definition of NARDS may have been considered as NRDS in the
      first three days after birth.

      According to the diagnostic criteria of NARDS, a key procedure for diagnosis of NARDS is to
      exclude the newborn infants with NRDS. But no detailed procedures are available to
      differentiate NRDS from NARDS.
