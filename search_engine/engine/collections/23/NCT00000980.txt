      of cryptosporidial diarrhea. Some reports suggest that spiramycin is useful in improving the
      symptoms of cryptosporidial diarrhea in some patients. Results of one study, however, showed
      no significant difference between spiramycin and placebo (inactive medication). A later study
      indicated that the absorption of spiramycin is significantly decreased when food is present.
      Thus, the results of the trial may have been due to poor absorption of spiramycin.

      Patients are observed for 3 days to establish baseline conditions. They are informed that the
      treatment period is 21 days during which they receive 15 days of spiramycin and 6 consecutive
      days of placebo; they are not told which 6-day period they receive placebo. All patients
      receive 15 days of spiramycin. Patients who do not have a favorable response are treated with
      a higher dose of spiramycin for an additional 15 days. Responders at either dose are followed
      weekly for 4 weeks. Should a relapse occur, patients receive an additional 15 days of
      therapy, at the dose of spiramycin that initially produced a response, following
      reestablishment of a baseline with 6 days of placebo. Nonresponders to the higher dose are
      taken off the study.
