      of virus in the body. Studies obtained entirely from analyses of peripheral blood led to a
      shift in the understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that lymphoid
      tissues are a major reservoir for HIV and the primary site of virus replication. The proposed
      studies will provide the first comprehensive assessment of HIV-1 expression and lymphocyte
      response in both blood and lymphocyte tissue compartments. The data obtained will provide new
      insight into HIV-1 pathogenesis and provide a more rational basis for treatment decisions
      concerning early therapy of HIV-1 infection.

      Patients are admitted to the hospital for insertion of an angiocath to collect blood samples
      periodically over 48 hours on the day study medication from the parent study is initiated.
      After discharge, additional blood samples are obtained over a 6-month period. Within 7 days
      prior to a scheduled biopsy, patients have physical examinations and laboratory evaluations
      done. All patients undergo some combination of the following during the 2-week prestudy
      evaluation period and at Weeks 4 and 24: a) superficial lymph node biopsy from cervical,
      axillary, or inguinal area; b) rectal biopsy; and/or c) tonsillar biopsy. The tissue samples
      provide an assessment of viral and cellular dynamics.
