      carried out. In the cross-sectional study, patients known to CHB carriers will be identified
      from the registries of the Ap Lei Chau, Aberdeen and Sai Yung Pun General Outpatient Clinics
      and Queen Mary Hospital. The biomathematical modelling will use a simulated cohort of
      patients aged 18 or above with CHB infections who may receive treatment in Hong Kong.
      Published data on the benefit of anti-viral treatments and the cross-sectional study data on
      preference-based health utility values of different stages of CHB infections will be used to
      estimate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies using Markov modelling.

      Interventions: Each subject in the cross-sectional study will be interviewed. Five strategies
      for management of CHB infections: 1) No treatment, 2) Interferon monotherapy, 3) lamivudine
      monotherapy, 4) adefovir and 5) combined treatment of lamivudine and adefovir, will be tested
      in the biomathematical modelling,.

      Main Outcome Measures: Health-related quality of life measured by the SF-36, preference-based
      health utilities measured by the SF-6D. quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost of
      different treatment strategies for HBV infection.

      Hypothesis: HRQOL and health utilities of patients with different illness stages, and the
      QALYs gained and cost-effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies will be established.
      The results will provide information on the health burden of CHB infections, and evidence on
      the cost-effectiveness of anti-viral treatments in preventing disease progression can be
      directly compared.
