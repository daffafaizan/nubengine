      for strata 1 requiring a low volume of liver to be irradiated, and a variable dose defined
      based on the effective liver volume irradiated in the second strata, which will require more
      liver volume to be irradiated, based on our prior experience. Both stratas one and two will
      be accrued concurrently. Biologic response will be assessed using standard contrast CT scans.
      Correlative studies of biological markers, perfusion CT, and microbubble contrast enhanced
      ultrasound will also be performed.
