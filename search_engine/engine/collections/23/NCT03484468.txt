      creating corneal flaps since 1989, and science go on until United states Food and Drug
      Administration approved the IntraLase laser for flap creation in January 2000 femtosecond
      lasers work by emitting light pulses of short duration (10-15 s) at 1053 nm wavelength that
      cause photodisruption of the tissue with minimum collateral damage . This enables no blade
      incisions to be performed within the tissue at various patterns and depth with high
      precision.

      Aim of the work To evaluate and compare the variation in corneal flap thickness created from
      use of a femtosecond laser and a MORIA microkeratome when making a 110-µm- and 90- µm thick
      corneal flap and to identify the potential factors that affect corneal flap thickness.
