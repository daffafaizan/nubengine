      I. To estimate the antitumor activity of belinostat and carboplatin in patients with
      persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer, measured by objective response rate and the frequency of progression- free survival
      at 6 months.

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of belinostat in combination with
      carboplatin in this cohort of patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive belinostat IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and carboplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are clinically responding or who,
      in the opinion of their physician, would continue to benefit from treatment may continue
      treatment beyond 6 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
