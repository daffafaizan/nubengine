      codeine to morphine. The metabolism of codeine to morphine is catalyzed by the cytochrome
      P450 enzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) of which there are over 70 genetic variants leading to differing
      metabolic capabilities within populations. It is hypothesized that the changes in PPT/PTT
      will vary based on the individuals ability to convert morphine to codeine.

      Ineffective analgesic management of patients with sickle cell disease remains a major problem
      in the management of the disorder in both adults and children. The pharmacological treatment
      of acute and chronic pain conditions resulting from vaso-occlusive crises in children with
      sickle cell disease typically involves the use of opioids. In the outpatient setting, this is
      most commonly achieved with administration of codeine and/or tramadol, both substrates of
      cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Currently these drugs are used in this patient population
      without any information concerning the patient's capacity to metabolize these CYP2D6
      substrates which may lead to over and under treatment of pain depending on their CYP2D6
      activity. The proposed objectives in this application will address this issue by the
      development of a pharmacodynamic assessment tool that will objectively assess the response to
      morphine in terms of analgesic response (pharmacodynamic assessment). This new tool might
      also serve as a non-invasive technique for CYP2D6 phenotyping if CYP2D6 substrates are used
      for pain therapy by assessing specifically morphine response. Development of this novel
      assessment tool will result in improved opioid analgesic therapy in this population. Future
      anticipated studies will examine the application of this technique in the determination of
      opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia.
