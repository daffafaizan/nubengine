      disease specific survival and resulted in increasing cohorts of BC survivors who are prone to
      develop late complications from treatment, including damage caused by radiation therapy (RT)
      to the heart. Older RT techniques for treating the breast resulted in excess cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. Improved RT techniques minimize irradiation to the heart. Data from
      various trials have yielded conflicting results on the extent to which these contemporary
      techniques have actually decreased cardiotoxicity. Long term follow-up and large cohorts are
      needed in order to evaluate the risk for cardiotoxicity, when based on its clinical
      manifestations. The current study is aimed to evaluate various imaging methods as potential
      surrogates to assess the degree of damage caused to the heart by RT in BC survivors many
      years before it becomes clinically apparent.This includes Multi-detector computed tomography
      (MDCT) - based on high resolution computed tomography of the heart following injection of
      contrast medium which evaluates the degree of stenosis of the coronary arteries.

      One hundred patients treated for breast carcinoma, fifty with left breast and fifty with
      right breast cancer, will be included in the current study and compared for the incidence of
      cardiac damage. Since the radiation dose to the heart is substantially lower in patients
      irradiated for right-sided tumors, comparing the incidence of findings indicating cardiac
      injury in the two groups will define the contribution of RT to these findings. For each
      patient included in the study, the incidence of cardiovascular disease will be correlated
      also with the volume of heart irradiated, the radiation dose delivered to that volume, the
      concomitant administration of cardiotoxic systemic agents, as well as to patient's age when
      irradiated and risk factors for developing coronary artery disease.
