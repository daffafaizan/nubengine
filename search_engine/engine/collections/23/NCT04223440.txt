      infraspinatus. This complex system fulfils a double role: stabilization/coaptation (raising
      the arm) and arm mobility (especially external rotation). Rupture of rotator cuff tendons is
      frequent (> 80% among chronic shoulder pain). They go with a decrease in muscle volume
      (amyotrophy) and irreversible fat infiltration. The treatment is medical and then surgical
      (if necessary). The degrees of atrophy and muscle infiltration (especially infraspinatus) are
      the criteria of choice for surgery. Actually, they are assessed in MRI according to the
      classification of Fuchs; it is operator dependent, qualitative and poorly reproducible with a
      strong inter-observer variability. Our team highlighted (2016) the possibility of using
      texture analysis software to objectively measure the proportion of fatty tissue on MRI
      sections of the cuff rotator muscles. This work also showed the possibility of using mode B
      ultrasound for morphological imaging and shear wave elastography to estimate the elasticity
      of the infraspinatus. The project aims to evaluate the contribution of texture analysis on
      MRI sections, and the technical feasibility, reproducibility, and clinical relevance of
      quantitative ultrasound and elastography to characterize the composition and volume of
      infraspinatus muscle in postero-superior rotator cuff tears. The perspectives are to optimize
      the imaging to allow a quantitative, objective and reproducible analysis of the muscle tissue
      and its characteristics.
