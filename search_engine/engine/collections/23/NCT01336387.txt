      I. The primary objective is to determine the toxicities and recommended phase II dose of
      9cUAB30. The co- primary objective is to characterize the urine and plasma single dose and
      steady state pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 in normal volunteers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 with toxicity. II. To compare observed
      toxicity between placebo controls and each dose level. III. To assess for any change in
      single dose PK after repeat dosing (Day 1 vs. Day 36).

      IV. To assess the following potential biomarkers of UAB30:

        -  Telomerase activity (measurement of telomeric repeats) in PBMCs.

        -  Gene expression of DNA methyltransferase in PBMCs.

        -  Gene expression of CYP2B6 in PBMCs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30* orally (PO) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Participants receive placebo* PO on days 1-28.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      *NOTE: Participants receive doses on days 8, 15, 22 and 29 after they have fasted for 12
      hours.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 7 and 30.
