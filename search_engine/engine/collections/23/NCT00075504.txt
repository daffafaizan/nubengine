      I. To determine the objective response rates for the combination of triapine and gemcitabine
      in patients with primary tumors of the biliary ducts and gall bladder.

      II. To assess the toxicities and recovery from toxicities for patients with biliary duct and
      gall bladder tumors treated with the combination of triapine and gemcitabine.

      III. To determine the survival and progression free survival of patients with biliary and
      gall bladder tumors treated with the combination of triapine and gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      bilirubin levels (normal vs abnormal).

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine) IV over 4 hours followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR)
      receive 1 additional course beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
