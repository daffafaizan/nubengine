      According to previous studies, neuropsychological rehabilitation may improve cognitive
      performance in MS. However, the quality of previous studies is low and, accordingly, the
      evidence on the effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation is low to modest.

      Objective: To study whether neuropsychological rehabilitation improves cognitive performance,
      QoL and perceived cognitive deficits in patients with MS.

      Methods: Altogether 100 patients with MS are randomised either to intervention or to control
      group in three different study sites. All the study subjects are assessed with
      neuropsychological tests as well as self-rating questionnaires evaluating mood, QoL,
      cognitive deficits, fatigue and impact of the disease at baseline, after three months
      (immediately after intervention) and after six months. Patients in the intervention group are
      offered with neuropsychological rehabilitation conducted once a week during thirteen weeks.
      Patients in the control group do not receive any intervention.

      Results: The effects of intervention on cognitive performance, QoL and perceived cognitive
      impairments are evaluated using appropriate statistical procedures and comparing the
      differences between the intervention and the control group.

      The present status: The baseline assessments have been performed and the intervention will be
      conducted between September and December, 2011.
