      roughly half of these antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate. Although unnecessary
      antibiotic prescribing for viral infections has significantly decreased, there has been a
      substantial increase in prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat ARTIs when
      narrow-spectrum antibiotics are indicated. Primary care providers, patients, and caregivers
      would benefit from studies assessing the implications of alternate antibiotic regimens for
      these common infections. Specifically, it remains unclear if treating common ARTIs with
      broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to an improvement in patient outcomes compared to treatment
      with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, particularly considering the increasing threat posed by
      antimicrobial resistance. Because of the lack of large comparative effectiveness studies with
      patient-centered outcomes addressing this issue, professional guidelines and expert
      recommendations are conflicting, and, as a result, practice patterns vary considerably.
      Therefore, using patient-centered outcomes, we aim to compare narrow-spectrum and
      broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of common ARTIs in children. To accomplish this,
      we will perform a prospective cohort study of children receiving antibiotics for ARTI across
      a comprehensive pediatric healthcare network. We will conduct telephone interviews with
      parent's of children who receive antibiotic treatment for an ARTI. We will assess previously
      identified patient-centered outcomes included a health-related quality of life measure,
      occurrence of side effects, missed school/daycare, parent missed commitments and/or required
      additional childcare and symptoms were still present on day 3 after diagnosis.
