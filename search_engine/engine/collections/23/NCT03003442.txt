      metabolism, and mood state. It is thought that they may also aid recovery from challenging
      physical and psychological tasks following both acute and chronic supplementation. The
      present study will investigate the effects of a multivitamin/mineral supplement (SupradynÂ®
      Energy 3RDA) following a single intake and following daily intake for 4-weeks on subjective
      ratings of 'fatigue/stress', metabolism and blood biomarkers of cell damage following both
      exercise and demanding cognitive tasks, in healthy young male and female volunteers.
