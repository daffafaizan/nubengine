      themselves will be asked their choice for CPR preferences for their loved ones. This will
      occur during the first six months of the study.

      After six months, surrogate decision makers of patients admitted to an ICU and unable to make
      decisions for themselves will view a video decision aid for CPR and then asked their choice
      for CPR preferences for their loved ones.
