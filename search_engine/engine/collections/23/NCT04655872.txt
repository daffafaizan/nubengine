      pharmacokinetics of TPN171H in approximately 6 healthy male subjects receiving a single oral
      10 mg dose of TPN171H containing approximately 100 microcuries of [14C]-TPN171H. Subjects
      will be checked in to the research unit from approximately 24 hours prior to dosing and
      remain in house until greater than 80% of the administered radioactivity is collected from
      bodily excreta or until less than 1% of the administered radioactivity is recovered from
      excreta in two consecutive time intervals, and blood sample radioactivity concentration at
      two consecutive time points less than 3 times the plasma background value. This study will
      investigate the main biotransformation and elimination pathways of TPN171H in the human body
      and will seek to identify compound's major metabolites.
