      will compare the outcomes of the current rehabilitation pathway with a newly developed (based
      on systematic review and delphi study) rehabilitation pathway for patients with a single
      level lumbar arthrodesis. The usual care group (n= 30) will be compared with the intervention
      group (n= 30).
