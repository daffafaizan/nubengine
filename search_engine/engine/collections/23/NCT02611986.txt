      of the success of direct laryngoscopy in daily clinical practice. The use of
      videolaryngoscopy is increasing as a technique for rescue intubation as well as for elective
      intubation. Current airway management guidelines recommend video-assisted laryngoscopy as a
      choice for basic airway management. This is a proposed comparison study of a video
      laryngoscope, use in the daily anesthesia practice, and its likely increased success compared
      to direct laryngoscopy. An international, multi-center, prospective randomized comparative
      trial (RCT) is proposed testing the superiority of oral tracheal intubation with the McGrathÂ®
      MAC versus conventional laryngoscope in adult patients under general anesthesia.
