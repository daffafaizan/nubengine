    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the safety and recommended phase II dose of umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived
      natural killer (NK) cells preloaded with the bispecific antibody AFM13 (AFM13-NK), followed
      by intravenous anti-CD30/CD16A monoclonal antibody AFM13 (AFM13) in patients with
      refractory/relapsed CD30-positive lymphoid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate and partial
      response (PR) rate.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response. III. To evaluate the event-free survival (EFS)
      rate. IV. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) time. V. To quantify the persistence of
      infused donor CB AFM13-NK cells in the recipient.

      VI. To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of AFM13-NK.

      Patients receive standard of care fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and standard of
      care cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days -4 to -2, AFM13-NK IV over 4 hours on day
      0, and then AFM13 IV over 4 hours on days 7, 14, and 21.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, 8 weeks, 100 and
      180 days and then every 3-6 months for 2 years.
