      leucine-matched collagen supplementation on muscle mass and function after a 10-wk resistance
      training program. Initially, all participants will be submitted for a 2-wk familiarization
      period, and then randomized into two groups (N = 11 / group): whey protein group and
      leucine-matched collagen group. The following variables will be assessed from pre-to
      post-training: anthropometric, muscle thickness from vastus lateralis and biceps brachii
      muscles using ultrasound, training load, mean power and peak torque for unilateral arm
      flexion exercise using a isokinetic dynamometer, countermovement vertical jump, nutritional
      intake, and testosterone-to-cortisol ratio . Shapiro-Wilk and Levine tests will be used to
      test the normality and homogeneity of the measurements, respectively. Two-way ANOVA (group x
      time) tests for repeated measures will be performed to assess changes over time and between
      groups for all dependent variables. Violation of sphericity will adjust using Greenhouse-
      Geyser correction. The Bonferroni post-hoc test will detect specific differences between
      groups. When appropriate, the percentage of change (∆%) will be reported according to the
      following equation: ∆% = [(pre-average post average) / pre-average mean] × 100. Values will
      be express as mean ± standard deviation. O significance level α will be 0.05.
