      certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

      Yervoyâ„¢ (Ipilimumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, a protein receptor
      that downregulates the immune system.

      CDX-1401 is a vaccine made of a fully human monoclonal antibody linked to NY-ESO-1 and is
      designed to deliver NY-ESO-1 to professional antigen presenting cells for generating robust
      immune responses against cancer cells expressing NY-ESO-1. CDX-1401 is administered with
      poly-ICLC, an adjuvant that enhances vaccine-induced immune responses.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of varlilumab and ipilimumab,
      with or without the addition of CDX-1401/poly-ICLC, in patients with melanoma.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the Phase I portion of the study will be assigned to one of
      two possible dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab. The first
      phase of the study will test the safety profile of the combination and determine which dose
      of varlilumab will be studied in Phase II of the study.

      During Phase II, up to 48 patients whose tumors do not express NY-ESO-1, will receive the
      recommended dose of varlilumab determined from Phase I with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab. Up to 24
      patients whose tumors express NY-ESO-1 will receive the recommended dose of varlilumab
      combined with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab and 1 mg CDX-1401 along with 2 mg poly-ICLC.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
