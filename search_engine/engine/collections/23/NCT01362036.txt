    
      The hematopoietic properties demonstrated in the preclinical and clinical studies support the
      investigation of TXA127 to stimulate stem cell and progenitor cell proliferation. This is an
      exploratory study in a limited population of low or intermediate-1 MDS subjects who have
      platelet counts of â‰¤50 x 109/L to evaluate the effects of TXA127 on platelet response and on
      granulocytic and erythroid response.

      Platelet response will be defined as complete and major as below:

        -  Complete platelet response: increase of platelet count to >100 x 109/L

        -  Major platelet response: increase of absolute platelet count by >30 x 109/L Other
           responses will be according to modified IWG MDS criteria (2006). Daily subcutaneous
           dosing of TXA will be carried out both in the clinic at scheduled visits and at home
           between clinic visits for a period fo 28 days.
