      consent will be enrolled in the Validation study.

      At enrollment, patients will receive a stroke nurse assessment in the Emergency Department
      (ED) and clinical information documented on an ACVS Assessment Form/SpecTRA Case Report Form.
      Patients will provide 6 mL of blood drawn into a purple-top EDTA tube that will be processed
      for proteomic analyses. These blood draws may or may not occur with the standard-of-care
      blood draw in the ED or stroke unit. Clinical orders include medical imaging (MRI +/-
      CT/CTA), cardiac monitoring (24hr +/- extended event monitoring). Patients will be referred
      by the attending ED physician to a stroke clinic for neurological consultation within 48
      hours - 7 days, whereby diagnosis of (i) possible ACVS; (ii) definite ACVS or (iii) mimic
      will be made. At the stroke clinic a cognitive screening test will be administered either as
      part of usual clinical care by treating physicians, nurses, or a study coordinator. A re-
      assessment will be repeated at 90 days by phone. MRI will be reviewed initially for clinical
      interpretation at the neurological consultation for evidence of brain ischemia (DWI+) and
      later by neuro-radiologists for definitive diagnosis in study purposes. Final adjudication of
      TIA and aetiology will be done by the non-blinded principal investigators at each site based
      on diagnostic results plus 90-day and up to 2-year outcomes.
