      minority community, for the purpose to facilitate understanding the pathogenesis and natural
      history of rheumatic diseases in this community. Patients will be evaluated with a history
      and physical examination and routine laboratory studies will be obtained as needed to assess
      diagnosis, disease activity, disease complications and to monitor for treatment related
      responses and toxicities. Patients eligible for other research protocols will be offered an
      opportunity to participate in these studies by signed informed consent. Any medical care
      recommended or provided to the patient will be consistent with routine standards of practice
      and will be provided in consultation with the patient s referring physician. All patients
      referred to this study must have a primary care provider provide a referral. The
      establishment of this protocol will provide a means to evaluate and treat patients from the
      minority community, and to generate hypotheses and protocols based on this clinical
      experience that will address questions of health disparities in the rheumatic diseases.
