      immunogenicity of repeat dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated
      Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated with expression of the
      MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature. Part 1 will evaluate escalating dose
      levels of ONT-10 administered subcutaneously Q2W over 8 weeks (for a total of 4 doses) or QW
      over 8 weeks (for a total of 8 doses) to identify a MTD and/or RD for each dosing schedule,
      for further evaluation in Part 2 of the study. Part 2 will evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of ONT-10 administered over 8 weeks at the
      Q2W and QW MTD/RD in cohorts of 15 patients each.
