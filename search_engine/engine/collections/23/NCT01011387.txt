    
      The investigation is designed as a prospective, open, non-controlled clinical investigation.

      Wounds to be treated under this protocol should be Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) or post
      amputation wounds associated with diabetes in hospitalized subjects or subjects treated at
      home. One ulcer or post amputation wound per subject will be treated for a maximum duration
      of 4 weeks. All subjects will receive negative pressure treatment with the NPWT system, -120
      mm Hg.

      In total, 10-15 subjects at two sites will be enrolled provided that they fulfill all the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and have signed and dated a written
      informed consent.

      The subjects will be consecutively allocated to a specific subject identification code and
      the recruitment will be competitive.

      The primary variable wound healing and granulation tissue formation will be assessed by
      digital planimeter, digital photography and visual estimation.

      Pain level and subject/investigator convenience will be assessed by convenience surveys.

      An evaluable subject is defined as a subject completing the investigation with 4 weeks of
      treatment, a subject healed before 4 weeks of treatment or if the investigator judge that the
      wound has adequately responded on NPWT before 4 weeks and that continued treatment can be
      made with alternative treatment.
