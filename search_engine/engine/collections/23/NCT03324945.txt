      of neurocognitive deficits experienced during and after the administration of chemotherapy
      for cancer. The incidence of CICI is significant, affecting anywhere from 25 to 75% of
      survivors, and the biologic basis is unknown. This novel study is designed to address the
      questions of incidence and biological cause for CICI, while gaining a better understanding of
      the structural and functional effects of chemotherapy on the brain. In order to address these
      important objectives, a diverse team of experienced investigators has been assembled to
      design and implement the proposed protocol. The research team for this project seeks to
      accomplish the proposed objectives through following mechanisms: 1) assessment of the
      neurocognitive domains affected in CICI using a tailored battery of cognitive tests to define
      CICI; 2) measurement of serum markers of oxidative stress and correlation of these markers
      with neurocognitive test results; and 3) exploration of structural and functional changes in
      the brain during cognitive tasks and correlation of results with markers of oxidative stress
      and neurocognitive test results.
