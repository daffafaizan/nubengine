      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate, as assessed by RECIST criteria, in patients with
           recurrent locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with irinotecan
           hydrochloride and etoposide after prior exposure to anthracycline, taxane, and
           capecitabine therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the median time to progression in these patients.

        -  To determine the response duration and survival in these patients.

        -  To measure the type and rate of grade 3 or greater toxicity of this treatment regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 15 and oral etoposide on
      days 1-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
