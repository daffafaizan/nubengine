      shown to have an antidepressant effect. Initial studies comparing electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT) and rTMS suggest that rTMS has been as effective as ECT in treating non-psychotic
      depression. Given the high degree of ongoing dysfunction in depressed adolescents despite
      optimization of treatment with antidepressant medications, new concerns regarding suicidal
      thoughts and behaviors in adolescents treated with antidepressant medications, and the more
      interventional nature of ECT, the use of rTMS as adjuvant therapy may be of significant
      clinical benefit. Thus far, research using rTMS to treat depression in adolescents has been
      limited. The primary aim of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of using 10
      Hz rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) as adjuvant treatment
      for depression in adolescents.
