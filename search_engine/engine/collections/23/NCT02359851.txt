      I. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced uveal melanoma
      receiving pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced uveal melanoma
      receiving pembrolizumab.

      II. To evaluate safety, tolerability and adverse experience profile of pembrolizumab in uveal
      melanoma.

      III. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced uveal melanoma receiving
      pembrolizumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      patients with advanced uveal melanoma receiving pembrolizumab as stratified by programmed
      cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GNA)Q/GNA11
      mutation status.

      II. To evaluate ORR in patients previously treated with ipilimumab or with mitogen-activated
      protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
