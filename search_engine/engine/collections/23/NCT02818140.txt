      despite a multimodal analgesic regime, and the patients receive considerable amounts of long
      lasting opioids. For the patients this greatly increase the risk of experiencing the adverse
      effects of opioids.

      The ultrasound-guided (USG) transmuscular quadratus lumborum (TQL) block is a single dosage
      of local anesthetic (LA) delivered in the plane between the psoas major muscle and the
      quadratus lumborum muscle. LA spreads cephalad into the thoracic paravertebral space to reach
      the somatic ventral rami (intercostal nerves) and the thoracic sympathetic trunk. The TQL
      block can reduce visceral pain and pain originating from the abdominal wall and has an
      expected duration of analgesic efficacy of 24 hours.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the active USG TQL block together
      with the multimodal analgesic regime to reduce postoperative opioid consumption and pain
      compared to placebo USG TQL block and the multimodal analgesic regime in a randomized and
      placebo controlled design.
