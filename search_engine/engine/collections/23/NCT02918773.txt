      and light source of a smartphone to capture reproducible images of the ear canal and tympanic
      membrane. Previous studies with this device demonstrated that images taken with both the
      smartphone otoscope and a camera-fitted conventional analogue otoscope were equivalent with
      respect to image quality and that the smartphone otoscope was acceptable as an educational
      and diagnostic tool to health professional students. A pilot study with a similar design to
      this study conducted in two offices of an ambulatory pediatric clinic demonstrated a trend
      toward decreased antimicrobial prescription filling among families whose children were
      examined with the smartphone otoscope compared to those who were examined with a conventional
      otoscope. To further assess this trend, this study proposes an evaluation of the impact of
      device use on antimicrobial prescribing for children with an otic complaint in a pediatric
      emergency department (PED) setting. This study will enroll 20 clinicians for the 6-month
      study period; 10 who will be randomly assigned to use a smartphone otoscope for the 6-month
      study period and 10 who will be assigned to use a conventional otoscope for all otoscopic
      exams. Data will be abstracted via retrospective review of the electronic medical record of
      encounters in with an otoscopic exam was performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation.
