      age, sex, mode of delivery, maternal disease and Apgar score were found to be matched in the
      two studied groups indicating successful randomization as seen in these balanced demographic
      variables between the groups.

      The studied population included 44 preterm infants. Then they were allocated randomly to one
      of 2 groups in order by admission:

      Group A: included 22 patients on whom the recruitment maneuver was applied guided by lung
      ultrasonography.

      Group B: included 22 patients on whom the recruitment maneuver was not ultrasound guided.
      This is considered the control group.

      Anthropometric measurements, gestational age, sex, mode of delivery, maternal disease and
      Apgar score were found to be matched in the two studied groups indicating successful
