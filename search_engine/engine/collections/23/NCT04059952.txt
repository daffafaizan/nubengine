      patients with unipolar and bipolar depression receiving ECT. Patients will be scanned before
      and after a full course of ECT and clinical measures for depression severity and memory will
      be obtained at the same times.The project has the following aims and hypothesis: (1) to
      determine the therapeutic antidepressant mechanism of action of ECT at the circuit level (2)
      to determine the mechanism of action of iatrogenic amnesia caused by ECT at the circuit level
      (3) to study the use of fcMRI as a state biomarker for depression (4) to study the use of
      fcMRI as a predictor of response for depression.
