    
      RATIONALE:

        1. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can occur in up to 4% of cases. GI bleeding is associated
           with significant morbidity which may include transfusion and possible re-operation

        2. Leaks at the gastrojejunostomy can be potentially life threatening and ranged from 1% to
           2%.

      HYPOTHESES:

      The smaller circular stapler may be associated with a lower rate of intraoperative
      intraluminal bleeding and postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding than the larger one.
