    
      Study Design: This is a Phase I open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and immune
      response of a multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine as a booster vaccination in uninfected
      adults. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe as a booster vaccine and elicit
      immune responses to HIV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      a VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP booster vaccination in uninfected subjects who previously received 3
      injections of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP more than one year prior to the study vaccination. The
      secondary objectives include immunogenicity evaluations and adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)
      antibody titers, and social impacts. Exploratory evaluations include epitope mapping and
      other immunogenicity evaluations.

      Product Description: VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP is a recombinant product composed of 4 adenoviral
      vectors (Ad) (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and
      HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively.

      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers who previously received three injections of
      VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP at a dosage of 4 mg or 8 mg in the VRC 004 study (03-I-0022): subjects in
      these groups were between 20 and 39 years old at time of enrollment in VRC 004; those who
      participate in VRC 009 will be approximately 1-3 years older at the time of enrollment into
      VRC 009.

      Study Plan: Up to thirty-two volunteers will receive one 1 mL injection of the study agent at
      a dosage of 1 x 10(10) PU IM in a deltoid muscle. Safety and immunogenicity will be evaluated
      by follow-up visits over the subsequent 24 weeks. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC) sample for immunogenicity studies collected at Week 4 after vaccination will be
      obtained by apheresis if the subject is willing and eligible for apheresis and an apheresis
      appointment can be conveniently scheduled in the interval specified; otherwise PBMCs will be
      obtained from 80 mL blood collected by phlebotomy.

      Study Duration: Subjects will be evaluated at 6 or more clinical visits for 24 weeks after
      the study injection.

      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the vaccine administered at a dose of 1 x
      10(10) particle units (PU) by intramuscular injection. Secondary endpoints are immunogenicity
      as indicated by HIV-specific antibody and cellular immune responses through Week 6, Ad5
      antibody titer at Week 0 and Week 4 and social impact at Week 24. Exploratory analyses of
      immunogenicity at Weeks 12 and 24, Ad5 antibody titer at Week 24 and epitope mapping of the
      CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses at Week 4.
