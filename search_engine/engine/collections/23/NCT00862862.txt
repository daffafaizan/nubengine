      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Inpatients of The Nebraska Medical Center will be included
      if they are 19 years of age or older, prescribed intravenous vancomycin therapy with a dosing
      interval of 24 hours or less, and therapy is continued for at least 3 doses or five half
      lives. Exclusion criteria consists of an estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min,
      concurrent use of dialysis, and pregnancy.

      Interventions: For the prospective component eligible patients will be consented and
      enrolled. A vancomycin trough level will be determined as normal standard of care thirty
      minutes prior to the appropriate vancomycin dose, followed by a vancomycin peak level one
      hour after the end of the infusion. Serum concentration time data will then be used to
      calculate an AUC. The retrospective component of the study will involve a chart review of
      patients treated with vancomycin in which a serum trough and peak level was obtained and
      calculation of the AUC as described.

      Evaluations: Serum concentration time data will be used to calculate an AUC for each patient
      enrolled in the study and from all charts reviewed that meet criteria. MIC data will be
      determined for Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from The Nebraska Medical Center. The
      two sets of data will then be used to calculate an AUC:MIC ratio. The AUC:MIC data will be
      compared to the goal ratio of greater than 400. Additionally, using the AUC data from our
      patients and the MICs derived from a large national surveillance data base, a Monte Carlo
      analysis will be completed to determine the probability of achieving therapeutic ratios.
