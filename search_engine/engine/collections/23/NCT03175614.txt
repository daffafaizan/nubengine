    
      -  Objetive: To develop and validate an application for the use in Smartphone in which the
           management of a SmartBand is included and evaluate the effect of adding this tool of
           information and communication technology (ICT), to a standardized intervention reduce
           weight, reduce sedestation time, increase physical activity and decrease total caloric
           intake in obese and sedentary subjects.

        -  Design and setting: A clinical of two parallel group, multicenter, randomized, aimed at
           assessing the effects of adding an ICT tool (intervention) to support behavioral and
           educational recommendations (control) in physical activity and weigh loss. Population:
           700 obese and sedentary subjects will be included, 20 to 65 aged, selected by random
           sampling in 5 centers.

        -  Measurements and intervention: physical and sedeentary acivity will be assessed with an
           accelometer and IPAQ and Marshall Questionnaires, the nutrition by a food frequency and
           adherence to the Mediterranean diet survey and weight loss with body mass index and
           waist circumference. Vascular function with a wrist-worn tonometer (blood pressure,
           augmentation index and pulse rate) will be evaluated and also the Cardio Ankle Vascular
           Index and carotid intima media thickness. The advice on nutrition (plate method) and
           exercise will be common to both groups. The intervention group will be added a training
           for 3 months in use of ICT tool described, designed to foment a healthy and low-calorie
           diet and increased physical acivity and decreased sedentary.
