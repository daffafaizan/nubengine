    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate two-year disease-free survival in patients with resectable esophageal and
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer treated with perioperative bevacizumab and leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess, by pathological examination after surgical resection, complete and partial
      response to neoadjuvant therapy.

      II. To characterize overall and progression free survival. III. To compare baseline and
      post-chemotherapy/bevacizumab tissues for biomarkers predicting response or resistance to
      this approach.

      IV. To investigate safety in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on
      day 1. Patients also receive FOLFOX chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours
      on days 1-2. Treatment with bevacizumab repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses and treatment
      with FOLFOX repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Patients then undergo planned surgical resection 4-6 weeks after 6 courses of
      chemotherapy and at least 8 weeks since the last dose of bevacizumab.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 8-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive bevacizumab IV,
      oxaliplatin IV, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV as in neoadjuvant therapy.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
