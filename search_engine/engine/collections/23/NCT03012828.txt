      debilitating, disease caused by a parasitic worm, Onchocerca volvulus.

      Five dose levels of moxidectin will be administered to healthy volunteers and ECG assessments
      undertaken at pre-specified pharmacokinetic time points to correlate QT interval with
      moxidectin concentration in plasma.
