    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of the Phase I portion of this study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of temsirolimus in combination with AVASTIN in subjects with
      chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC.

      II. The primary objective for the Phase II portion of this study is to evaluate the objective
      response frequency (PSA and RECIST-Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined) of
      the combination of temsirolimus and AVASTIN in patients with chemotherapy refractory
      metastatic CRPC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of the combination of temsirolimus and AVASTIN on time to clinical
      progression and overall survival in patients with chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC.

      II. To further evaluate the safety of temsirolimus given in combination with AVASTIN in
      chemotherapy refractory metastatic CRPC patients at the dose established in our phase I
      safety phase.

      III. To determine the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and status of single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in CRPC patients. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes once weekly and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes once every two weeks . Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days.
