      consent to being in the study, they will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:
      stitches, skin glue, or medical tape. There will be about 30 kids in each group, and thus 90
      kids total in the study.

      In the Emergency Room, a lidocaine ointment will be placed on the child's cut to decrease
      pain. The cut will be cleaned out with sterile saline. Then, depending on which method is
      used, the cut will be closed with either stitches, skin glue, or medical tape by their
      doctor. The participants will be asked to answer a short questionnaire. Finally, they will be
      given discharge instructions and sent home. At 3 months, the investigators will call parents
      for a quick questionnaire over the phone and parents will be asked to take a picture of the
      patient's scar and send it to the study staff.

      Once all 90 pictures have been collected, two Plastic Surgeons will be asked to rate the
      scars in terms of how they look. The Plastic Surgeons will not know which method was used to
      close which cut. Once all of the scars have been rated, the averages of scars will be
      compared for each closure method. The investigators will also look at how much each method
      cost, how much extra pain medications or sedation each group used, and which method was liked
      best.
