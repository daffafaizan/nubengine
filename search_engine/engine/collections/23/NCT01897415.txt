    
      This phase I study is being conducted to establish safety and feasibility of intravenous (IV)
      RNA mesothelin re-directed autologous T cell administration in patients with
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Subjects will be enrolled serially. For subject safety, the preceding subject must have
      completed therapy and be 28 days from their last infusion before the next subject can be
      treated.. Subjects will be treated with IV administration of 1 to 3e8/m2 RNA CAR T cells
      three times weekly (M-W-F) for three weeks.

      Main eligibility criteria: Subjects with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)
      who have chemotherapy-refractory disease. Inclusion criteria include patients older than 18
      years of age diagnosed with metastatic PDA with ECOG 0-1 performance status and 3 month
      expected survival. Exclusion criteria include a pericardial effusion, active autoimmune
      disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active anti-coagulation therapy, known HIV or
      HTLV I/II positivity, prior treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies or history of allergy
      to murine proteins.
