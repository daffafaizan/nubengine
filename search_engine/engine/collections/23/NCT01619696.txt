    
      The objective of the present project is to validate the feasibility of a multimodal
      radiological pathway while on chemoradiotherapy, in order to validate potentially predictive
      factors for chemoradiotherapy sensitivity of rectal adenocarcinomas.

      It is based on a structured clinical and radiological pathway for patients, using diffusion
      MRI and F misonidazole PET.

      Validation of these new tools is already needed in clinical practice since future
      institutional trials will be based on treatment individualisation, using preoperative
      predicting factors.
