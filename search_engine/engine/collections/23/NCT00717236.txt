      period followed by an open-label extension phase. In the double-blind phase, eligible
      patients are randomized (4:1 ratio) to receive either certolizumab pegol (CZP) or Placebo up
      to and including Week 10. The randomization will be stratified according to the three
      factors: concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX, Yes or No), prior anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (anti-TNF) use (Yes or No), and disease duration categories (< 2 years or â‰¥ 2 years). From
      Week 12 all patients remaining in the study receive open-label CZP for a minimum 16
      additional weeks until CZP is commercially available.
