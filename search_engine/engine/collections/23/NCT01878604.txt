      lipid-lowering strategy, we propose to do the following studies:

        1. To establish a China HoFH registry, and collect DNA and blood samples from all available
           family members of each proband (pedigrees);

        2. To detect gene mutations known to cause FH and identify family suitable for future whole
           genome sequencing aimed to identify novel genes controlling cholesterol levels.

      3.To establish the relationship between types of gene mutations and lipid and atherosclerosis
      profile, as well as responses to lipid-lowering agents.
