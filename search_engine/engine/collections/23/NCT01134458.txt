      CVD outcomes have largely focused on single risk factors and do not contextualize the
      information with a patient's global risk. An easy, accessible strategy to address global CVD
      risk based on personalized risk communication feedback with assistance with initiating and
      maintaining health behaviors has several advantages, but has not formally been tested. A
      patient's perceived risk of stroke or heart attack is an important factor in understanding
      motivation for risk reducing behaviors. Lower perceived risk has been associated with poorer
      adherence to recommended health behaviors. Additionally, a person's beliefs about his or her
      risk for a disease increased the likelihood of a more informed and activated patient, and
      figures prominently in models of health behavior (e.g., Health Belief Model). People tend to
      underestimate their own risk; Therefore providing accurate risk communication has the
      potential to activate patients to initiate and maintain behavior changes.
