      this intervention after administration of CAR T cell therapy. This research study looks to
      systematically investigate the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy following CAR T cell
      therapy (axicel or tisacel) in refractory lymphoma. CAR T cell therapy involves genetically
      modifying T cells to target tumor cells for death. Radiotherapy is a standard treatment
      offered with refractory lymphoma and uses high-energy x rays, or particles, to destroy or
      damage cancer cells. Few have received CAR T cell therapy prior to radiation therapy and this
      study aims to gather more information on radiotherapy following CAR T cell therapy as a
      treatment option and its potential to improve participants immune system's response to cancer
      cells as well as its interaction with CAR T cell therapy to better treat refractory lymphoma.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, enrollment, biopsy following
      radiation, post-treatment period, and long-term follow-up.

        -  Participants will receive radiotherapy at a dose and schedule determined by the study
           doctor.

        -  Participants will be followed for up to 24 months after completion of study treatment.

      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.
