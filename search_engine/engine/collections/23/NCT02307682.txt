      1:1:1 ratio. Subjects in all treatment arms received 3 monthly loading doses (Day 0, Week 4
      and Week 8), followed by a maintenance regimen, until the end of the study (Week 96/Exit).
      All subjects attended pre-specified visits every 4 weeks.

      Subjects in the brolucizumab 3 mg and brolucizumab 6 mg arms followed a q12w/q8w maintenance
      regimen. Within the q12w/q8w regimen, the initial treatment after the loading phase was q12w
      (1 injection every 12 weeks). If disease activity was identified by the masked investigator
      at any of the disease activity assessments, dosing was adjusted to q8w (1 injection every 8
      weeks) ("q12w/q8w regimen"). Once subjects were adjusted to the q8w interval, they stayed on
      that interval until the end of the study.

      Subjects in the aflibercept 2 mg arm followed a q8w maintenance regimen until the end of the
      study.

      Results reported up to Week 48 are based on the database locked for the primary analysis at
      Week 48. Results reported after Week 48 are based on the database locked at the end of study
      (final analysis).
