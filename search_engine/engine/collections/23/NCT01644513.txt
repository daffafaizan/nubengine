    
      The study is designed as a single-center, observational case control evaluation to compare
      the genetic profiles of two groups of patients categorized according to anti-VEGF treatment
      response as either "positive" or "suboptimal" responders following treatment with either
      bevacizumab or ranibizumab anti-VEGF agents. Positive and suboptimal responders will be
      compared to determine if genetic variant distribution or total genetic load is associated
      with anti-VEGF treatment response.
