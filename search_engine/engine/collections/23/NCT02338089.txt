      prolonged periods. The increased incidence of uterine atony and PPH following exogenous
      oxytocin administration during labor augmentation is related to myometrial oxytocin receptor
      desensitization to oxytocin.

      Human clinical trials have shown the benefits of pulsatile oxytocin administration for labor
      induction and augmentation, which include requirement of less total oxytocin, similar uterine
      contractility and similar rates of cesarean delivery. However, the outcome of the effect on
      PPH is not currently known.

      Characterization of the effect of pulsatile oxytocin on the desensitization of myometrium
      when compared to the effect of continuous oxytocin, may provide guidance for the delivery of
      pulsatile oxytocin for labor induction and augmentation to protect against the otherwise
      higher risk of PPH. Furthermore, the delivery of pulsatile oxytocin may be considered in
      subgroups who are already at higher risk of PPH, and require labor augmentation.

      The investigators' previously validated in-vitro model provides a solid foundation for the
      study of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions, without any confounders that
      could be encountered in clinical settings.

      The results of this study will provide insight into the level of desensitization of human
      myometrium following exposure to pulsatile oxytocin. Based on oxytocin dose-response curves
      after pretreatment to continuous oxytocin and pretreatment to pulsatile oxytocin, we will be
      able to determine the extent of desensitized myometrium following each delivery method.
