      trial. The primary end point is post-treatment result after triple or quadruple therapy.
      Secondary endpoints included the nature and frequency of side effects compared between the
      two arms. The study protocol was approved by the ethical review committee of the university.

      Patients with dyspeptic symptoms who had H pylori infection, diagnosed through positive Stool
      for H pylori antigen or presence of H. pylori organism in the histopathology of gastric
      mucosal biopsy, attending outpatient department of two campuses of the University Hospital
      were included in this study.. Group A received standard triple therapy for H. pylori
      eradication for a total 14 days and group B received bismuth-based quadruple therapy for H
      pylori eradication for the same period. The triple regimen was defined as a combination of
      amoxicillin 1 gm twice a day, clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and omeprazole is given in 40
      mg twice a day dose. Quadruple therapy included colloidal bismuth subcitrate 240 mg twice
      daily, in addition. H. Pylori status was checked routinely after 6 weeks by Stool sampling
      for H, pylori antigen. Subjects were counseled to stop taking PPI or any antibiotic 2 weeks
      before stool H. pylori antigen testing. Eradication of H pylori was defined as lack of
      detection of H pylori antigen in the stool via ELISA method after triple or quadruple
      therapy.
