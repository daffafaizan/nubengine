      known heart disease or prior stroke and without a clear indication or contraindication to any
      of the study medications. Eligible and consenting individuals were randomized to receive
      either active study medications or placebo (dummy pills) and will be monitored for an average
      of 5.7 years. The rates of heart attacks, strokes, deaths and other cardiovascular events
      will be compared between subjects receiving the active drugs and those on placebo. The study
      included people from 21 countries, which were monitored by an international group of
      scientists and physicians. The study was coordinated by the Population Health Research
      Institute at McMaster University. The study is expected to demonstrate that combined lipid
      lowering and blood pressure lowering will substantially lower the risk for cardiovascular
      diseases and may substantially change our approach to cardiovascular prevention.
