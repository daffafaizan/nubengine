    
      Both primary and secondary objectives will be assessed in a questionnaire. Primary Objectives
      To assess the impact of research biopsies on patients quality of life.

      Secondary Objectives To assess the impact of diagnostic biopsies on quality of life in
      comparison to research biopsies.

      To assess the true complication rates associated with biopsies. To compare types of biopsies
      - surgical versus radiological with respect to implications on quality of life.

      To assess the individual potentially modifiable factors of reason for biopsy; perceived risk;
      perceived benefit; wait time for biopsy; wait time for results; complications; and altruism
      and association with anxiety.

      To determine which factors are associated with a higher and lower likelihood of achieving
      serial biopsies.
