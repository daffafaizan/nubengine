      Objective 1: Paired analysis of (total) serum vancomycin concentrations in neonates using the
      currently available immunoassay (Cobas c702) versus a reference liquid chromatography-tandem
      mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS).

      Objective 2: The determination of vancomycin protein binding and its covariates in neonates.
