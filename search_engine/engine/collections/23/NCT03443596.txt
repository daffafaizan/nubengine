    
      Specific aims-

        1. To determine the tolerability of intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering with intravenous
           Labetalol infusion (assessed by achieving systolic BP 140-160mmHg range within 6hours of
           symptom-onset and maintaining it for 72hours post-ictus) in subjects with acute ischemic
           stroke (AIS) who are treated with intravenous thrombolysis,

        2. To quantify the effect of intensive BP lowering on cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured
           by computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging.

        3. To obtain preliminary estimates of clinical impact of intensive BP lowering in acute
           phase and functional outcomes at 3months.

      Hypothesis- Investigators hypothesize that early and intensive BP lowering in AIS is safe in
      patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-TPA). Furthermore, such
      reductions in BP would not produce any significant reduction of CBF on CT perfusion or
      adversely affect the functional outcomes at 3 months

      Methodology - AIS patients presenting within 4.5hours of symptom-onset with measurable
      neurological deficits (NIHSS >4points), treated with intravenous thrombolysis and having
      elevated BP (systolic BP 160-185mmHg) would be included. In this randomised open label pilot
      study (with blinded end-point analysis), study participants in target group would receive
      intravenous Labetalol infusion for 72hours (target systolic BP 140-160mmHg).Close
      neurological monitoring and serial CT perfusion studies would be performed to evaluate the
      short-term clinical effects and changes in CBF. Functional outcomes would be evaluated by
      modified Rankin scale at 3months.

      Conclusion This pilot randomised study would provide preliminary data about the safety of
      intensive BP lowering in AIS and form a basis of designing a larger phase III study.
