      symptoms, and progression free survival in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer treated with one of two doses of ZD 1839 or placebo combined with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Patients receive gemcitabine and cisplatin
      combined with lower dose oral ZD 1839 (arm I), higher dose oral ZD 1839 (arm II), or placebo
      (arm III).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,029 patients (343 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
