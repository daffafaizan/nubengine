    
      Subjects will be randomized to one of four groups:

        1. moderate neuromuscular block (NMB) + 10 mm insufflation pressure (IP);

        2. moderate NMB + 15 mm IP;

        3. deep NMB + 10 mm IP; or

        4. deep NMB + 15 mm IP.

      A moderate NMB block will be defined as 2-3 twitches in the train of four (TOF) and a deep
      NMB will be defined as 0-1 posttetanic count. The surgeons will be asked to rate their
      satisfaction with the surgical conditions using a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 1
      (extremely poor) to 5 (optimal conditions). The first rating will occur at the beginning of
      the procedure when the NMB level is stable at either a deep or moderate block and the
      intra-abdominal pressure is either 10 or 15 mm Hg (per randomization). The surgeon will be
      blinded to the insufflation pressure at this point. If the surgical conditions are rated as
      extremely poor or poor, the level of the neuromuscular block can be increased and/or the
      insufflation pressure can be increased to 15 mm Hg.
