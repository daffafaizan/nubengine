      and radium-223 or the combination of pazopanib and radium-223 as a treatment for any disease.
      Sorafenib and pazopanib are both approved as single agents for the treatment of metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, radium-223 is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced
      prostate cancer and has shown to have effects on prostate cancer.

      Currently, there are limited options for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer who also
      have bone metastases. Bone metastases are related to a higher incidence of skeletal
      complications, including skeletal pain, fractures, spinal cord compression, and an increase
      in the amount of calcium in blood. Such skeletal complications could result in radiation or
      surgery to the bone. Since radium-223 is shown to be effective for patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer who also have bone metastases, researchers want to explore radium-223 with
      VEGF-targeting therapies to understand how the drug combinations affect safety, quality of
      life, incidence of skeletal complications, and the progression of cancer.
