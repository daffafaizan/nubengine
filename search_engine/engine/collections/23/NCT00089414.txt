      menstrually-related mood disorder (MRMD), but not women lacking this disorder, experience
      mood deterioration within approximately one to two weeks after exposure to either estradiol
      or progesterone in the context of gonadal suppression (induced by use of the depot
      gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate). Preliminary results of protocol
      00-M-0103 suggest that this hormone-induced depression occurs consequent to changes in
      gonadal steroid levels and not to simple exposure to basal levels above a critical threshold.
      Additionally, continued administration of hormone for three months resulted in no further
      symptoms subsequent to the initial precipitated episode. These data suggest the potential
      therapeutic benefit of extended oral contraceptive (OC) regimens with reduced pill-free
      intervals in MRMD to minimize the mood destabilizing effects of changing hormone levels. In
      this protocol we examine whether the effects of 15 weeks of continuous oral contraceptive
      administration causes a remission of symptoms in women with MRMD.
