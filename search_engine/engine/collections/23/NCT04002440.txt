      SHARESOURCE connectivity platform incorporates innovative technology (two-way remote
      connectivity, touch screen controls, voice guidance) to record patient treatments which are
      then able to be transmitted to their dialysis clinic for review and monitoring in near
      real-time. This has tremendous potential clinical utility given the struggles to achieve dry
      weights for most peritoneal dialysis patients using other systems, where typically,
      management regarding fluid balance is reviewed and revised only monthly. The new technology
      is the only device cleared in the US with patient-centric features. Abstracts available have
      demonstrated that AMIA can improve efficiency of patient training and focus PD nursing time
      towards proactive tasks to help patients. There has also been insight into how remote patient
      management systems like AMIA can be used to objectively monitor patient compliance or
      catheter function above and beyond subjective endorsement from patients. However, with new
      technology comes new training for patient and staff (nurses, physicians) without
      understanding if interfacing with this new patient-centric featured technology improves
      patient-centric clinical outcomes. The new AMIA and SHARESOURCE programs may also require
      additional nurse and physician provider time to monitor data in real-time and to react to
      these data, which may incur additional expense to medical practices. Thus, it is imperative
      to demonstrate the utility of the AMIA and SHARESOURCE programs for important improvement in
      patient management, which may ultimately translate into improved clinical outcomes (e.g.
      fewer hospital admissions, less heart failure, improved quality, and length of life).
