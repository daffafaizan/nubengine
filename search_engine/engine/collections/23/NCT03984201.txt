      for treatment-resistant depression and has been utilized to treat persons suffering from
      chronic pain. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for 40 min over the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been very successful in real
      world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of the treatment
      (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently, researchers have aggressively
      pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with some preliminary
      success. This study intends to further modify the parameters to create a more rapid form of
      the treatment and look at the change in neuroimaging biomarkers.
