      Vitamin D is an important hormone that has multiple genetic effects in different tissue types
      that are mediated by signaling through the vitamin D receptor.

      Recent studies have shown that vitamin D signaling results in decreased innate immunity and
      increased adaptive immunity.

      Multiple epidemiologic studies have suggested that vitamin D may play a role in decreasing
      the risk of developing multiple types of cancer, including skin cancer.

      In the context of the relative success of novel immune-related therapies including PD1
      inhibitors, which improves immuno-surveillance, and ipilimumab, which suppresses T cell
      response, there is increased promise for treatment strategies that activate innate immunity.
      This led us to ask the question of whether vitamin D could increase immune surveillance for
      melanoma via increased activity of the adaptive immune system.

      Prior studies performed by our group and others have suggested that vitamin D may play a role
      in decreasing melanoma risk. An epidemiologic study from the Women's Health Initiative showed
      that women with a prior history of NMSC who received calcium and vitamin D supplementation
      had a lower risk of subsequently developing melanoma. At the same time, women with a lower
      serum vitamin D level had a higher risk of developing melanoma. Furthermore, a recent
      clinical study showed that vitamin D supplementation increases serum vitamin D levels and
      ultimately results in increased vitamin D receptor signaling in benign nevi.

      Taken together, this findings led us to ask whether oral vitamin D supplementation could
      impact immune signaling in benign nevi and potentially underpin a theoretical
      chemo-preventive role for vitamin D in melanoma.
