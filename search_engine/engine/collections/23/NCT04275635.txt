      elongation in young patients, but this treatment is limited by the need for contact lens
      wear, which is the common cause for keratitis in children, and therefore cautious use is
      recommended. There is a need to identify the patients that could benefit most from this
      treatment. In order to do so, we conduct a retrospective study and create a large database (n
      = 10,000) of de-identified data to train an algorithm for identifying fast progressing
      myopes. In addition, we will perform a prospective study to validate this predictive
      algorithm and determine the effectiveness of Orthokeratology among different individual
      patients in China.
