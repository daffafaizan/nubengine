      positive (ER+) or progesterone-receptor positive (PR+)] and patients with such cancers are
      candidates for endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy is a central component of the treatment
      of hormone-sensitive breast cancer in the adjuvant and, increasingly, neoadjuvant settings.
      Knowledge of hormone receptor expression is essential for selection of appropriate therapy.
      Measurement of hormone-receptor expression [estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor
      (PR)] using in vitro assays of the tumor tissue at the time of primary diagnosis is standard
      of clinical care. However, the presence of these hormone receptors predicts for clinical
      benefit in only 30-50% of women with advanced disease receiving first-line endocrine therapy
      and 15-30% receiving second-line therapy (1-3). Thus, the presence of a hormone receptor does
      not indicate that the receptor is functional and essential to the growth of the cancer cell,
      nor does it imply that interference with receptor function will result in tumor cell kill.
      There are several shortcomings of the in vitro assays and neither quantitative nor
      qualitative receptor assays performed on samples of tumor tissue completely predict the
      response to antiestrogen therapy in breast cancers. In addition, none of the current clinical
      tools (serologies, prognostic factors, or radiologic studies) can accurately predict for
      clinical benefit from endocrine therapy. Accordingly, better methods for predicting clinical
      response to antiestrogen therapy need to be developed.
