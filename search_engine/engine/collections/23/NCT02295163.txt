      locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Hot flushes and night sweats are one of the
      main side-effects of ADT. There are no successful and well-tolerable treatment options
      available. A possible treatment for hot flushes is stellate-ganglion block (SGB), used as a
      means of interrupting parts of the sympathetic nervous system involved in temperature
      regulation.
