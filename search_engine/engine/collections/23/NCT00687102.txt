      brain. Although previous studies have examined the effects of HT on age-related cognitive
      changes, there is little information on the effect of a new class of estrogenic agents,
      selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), on cognitive aging. The two most commonly
      prescribed SERMs are tamoxifen, for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, and
      raloxifene, for maintaining bone density. In the face of potential widespread use of SERMs in
      healthy women, information on the effects of these agents on memory and other cognitive
      functions is essential.

      The principal goals of Co-STAR are to compare the effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene

        -  on age-associated declines in measures of verbal and nonverbal memory in women over age
           65

        -  other cognitive abilities and mood

        -  with those resulting from more common forms of HT, specifically ET (conjugated equine
           estrogen) and ET plus progesterone

      Co-STAR results will be compared to results from the Women's Health Initiative Study of
      Cognitive Aging (WHISCA), a study involving 6-year longitudinal assessment of cognitive
      outcomes in 2969 women randomly assigned to receive active treatment (Premarin or Premarin
      plus medroxyprogesterone acetate) or placebo. A comparison of the Co-STAR treatment groups
      with the group of WHISCA participants receiving placebo will provide insights into the
      effects of SERMs relative to no treatment. A comparison of the Co-STAR treatment groups with
      WHISCA treatment groups receiving ET or ET plus progesterone will provide insights into the
      effects of SERMs relative to common HT treatments.

      Co-STAR participants will be recruited from The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Study of
      Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) NCT00003906, a multi-center, 5-year, randomized clinical
      trial among 22,000 women at increased risk for breast cancer, to compare the effects of
      tamoxifen and raloxifene on risk for breast cancer.
