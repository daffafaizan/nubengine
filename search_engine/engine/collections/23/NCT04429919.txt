    
      This is a Phase IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study to
      evaluate the efficacy (by changes in Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale [PI-NRS]) and
      safety (by monitoring adverse events) of AP-325 in subjects with PPNP.

      The clinical trial will be conducted in Germany, Spain and Czech Republic.

      Eligible subjects will undergo a 2-week run-in period consisting of a washout-period of
      prohibited medications in the 1st week and a baseline period in the 2nd week. If subjects
      have at least 5 self-reported pain assessments in the baseline period (documented in a diary)
      and meet the required pain criteria, they will be randomized to AP-325 or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio.

      Subjects will take the IMP (AP-325 or placebo) for 10 days (double-blind treatment period;
      Days 1-10) and then be followed up for a further 26 days (drug-free period; Days 11-36). An
      end of study visit will be performed on Day 36.

      At least 94 subjects (47 for each treatment) need to be analyzed for the primary endpoint at
      Day 10 to reach the power estimate (114 subjects should be screened for the study).

      AP-325 100 mg (4 x 25 mg capsules) or Placebo (4 capsules) will be orally taken once daily in
      the morning before meals for 10 consecutive days.

      Pain will be assessed, and quality of life will be investigated using standardized and
      validated questionnaires [Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS), patient global
      impression of change (PGIC), neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI) questionnaire, daily
      sleep interference scale (DSIS) score, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)].
