      alcohol to the brain where it slows down the messages in the brain (alcohol is a depressant).
      Alcohol affects a person's memory, behaviour, concentration, alertness (your thought process
      is slower), and coordination (your movements become clumsy). The intended effect of
      tasimelteon is to cause sleepiness. Sleepiness may result in similar effects on memory,
      concentration, alertness, and coordination as alcohol. There is the possibility taking
      tasimelteon and alcohol together can make these effects stronger or worse.
