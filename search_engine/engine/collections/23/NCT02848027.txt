    
      Single-center, laboratory blinded to include up to 400 subjects with knee osteoarthritis in
      unilateral or bilateral knees treated with Regenexx速 SD in the osteoarthritic knee/s.Initial
      study procedures include baseline evaluation of medical history, knee history, knee
      examination, medication use, MRI, and subject-reported outcomes.

      Subjects will be enrolled within the 120 days prior to Regenexx速 SD injection. A preoperative
      visit will occur at the time of enrollment. Collection of synovial fluid from the OA knee/s
      will serve as the experimental condition, i.e. the osteoarthritic knee.Each osteoarthritic
      subject will undergo withdrawal of knee joint synovial fluid for each knee being treated
      (0.3-0.5 ml) which will be analyzed by the research laboratory via multiplexed enzyme linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dimethylmethylene blue assay (DMMB) at pre-injection (2-8
      days before Regenexx速 SD treatment) and post-injection (2-8 days after Regenexx速 SD).
      Documentation of osteoarthritic joint characteristics and injection procedure details will be
      recorded throughout the study.

      The unaffected knee joint will undergo no treatment, but bilateral knees may be treated.

      Components of the synovial fluid will be correlated to post-treatment clinical outcomes,
      which include patient-reported questionnaires as well as assessment of post-injection
      complications, adverse events, re-injections and surgical interventions. Patient-reported
      clinical outcomes are comprised of the IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation, the Lower Extremity
      Function Scale, Numeric Pain Scale and a Patient Reported Percent Improvement form.
