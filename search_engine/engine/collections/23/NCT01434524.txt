      rate after hepatectomy for liver neoplasm in the Livact group compared to that in the Control
      Group. The investigators believe that BCAA seems to be a remarkable benefit for liver
      resection, especially on its reduction in the recurrence of liver cancer. This treatment
      regimen has potential to offer benefits for clinical use selectively, especially for patients
      with chronic liver diseases.
