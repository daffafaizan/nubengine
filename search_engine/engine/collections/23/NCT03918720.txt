      order to promote health, prevent disease, and the proper use of services. It consists of four
      seminars per year on common health problems, mental health and cognitive health, etc.

      The Self-Care Enablement Programme is to enable participants to keep themselves healthy, to
      build up self-efficacy and proper help-seeking skills, and to generate a spirit of mutual
      support among families. Two programmes will be delivered yearly, each with six 2.5 hour
      workshops facilitated by professional and lay leaders.

      The Health Ambassador Programme aims to train up a group of adults recruited from the
      Trekkers families to act as a lay-advisor to other families on health issues. Participants
      who have completed the Health Literacy and Self-care Enablement programme will be given
      priority to take part in the Health Ambassador training programme.

      The outcome measures are health enablement, health status, health-related quality of life,
      life style, cardiovascular risk factors, illnesses rates, and health service utilization
      pattern. All subjects in the cohort study will be surveyed on enrolment, and then yearly for
      5 years. An age-gender appropriate health assessment will be carried out at baseline and at
      the end of five years for each subject. Changes in the outcomes will be evaluated and
      compared between groups. The impact of the health intervention programmes will be assessed.
