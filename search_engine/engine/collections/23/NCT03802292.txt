    
      This is a first-in-man, phase 1, single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in
      healthy volunteers. It will be conducted at a single centre and will enroll approximately 64
      subjects. Subjects will either receive a single dose of study drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.
      Eight dose levels of YQ23 will be evaluated.

      Each dose level group will be divided into 2 cohorts, with each cohort being dosed at last 24
      hours apart. The leading cohort will comprise of 2 subjects, with 1 subject receiving YQ23
      and 1 subject receiving placebo. The remaining cohort will comprise of 6 subjects, with 5
      receiving YQ23 and 1 receiving placebo.

      Safety assessments will be performed throughout the dosing and follow-up periods, and
      multiple PK samples will be collected.
