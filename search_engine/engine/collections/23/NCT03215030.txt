      dexamethasone. The study will determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-573 as single
      agent and in combination with dexamethasone in participants with relapsed/refractory MM. The
      study consists of 2 Phases, 1 and 2.

      The study will enroll approximately 51 and 100 participants in Phase 1 and 2 respectively.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups in each
      Phase:

        -  Phase 1 Schedule A: TAK-573 0.001 to 14 mg/kg

        -  Phase 1 Schedule B: TAK-573 TBD

        -  Phase 1 Schedule C: TAK-573 TBD

        -  Phase 1 Schedule D: TAK-573 TBD

        -  Phase 2: TAK-573 TBD

      The Phase 1 portion of the study will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to evaluate
      once-weekly up to 4 different schedules of administration of TAK-573 starting at 0.001 mg/kg
      for DLT evaluation and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or an optimal biological
      dose (OBD) for assessments in Phase 2.

      The Phase 2 will further assess the safety profile of TAK-573 and its efficacy at MTD or OBD.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The maximum treatment
      duration in this study is up to 12 months and overall time to participate in the study is
      approximately up to 40 months.
