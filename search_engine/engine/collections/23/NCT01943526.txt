      natalizumab, with each participant to be followed for 3 years. This study is designed to
      address the long-term safety profile and the long-term impact on disease activity and
      progression of natalizumab with marketed use. Collection of efficacy and safety data at 6-
      monthly intervals to coincide with regular clinic visits and routine clinical practice will
      therefore be undertaken during the iTOP observational period.
