    
      MLD is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by
      deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A (ASA). MLD is a rare orphan
      disease that occurs in most parts of the world. The estimated overall incidence of the
      disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live births that varies by
      geographic location. There are no approved therapies for MLD.

      This study is a multicenter open-label study designed to evaluate safety and efficacy
      outcomes of HGT-1110 administered intrathecally in children with MLD who have participated in
      the dose escalation study, HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028), through Week 40 and are receiving study
      drug every other week (EOW).

      Treatment groups will be identical to those in HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028), ie, participants
      assigned to Cohort 1 in Study HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028) will continue to receive a dose of 10
      milligrams (mg), participants assigned to Cohort 2 in Study HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028) will
      continue to receive a dose of 30 mg, and participants assigned to Cohorts 3 and 4 in Study
      HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028) will continue to receive a dose of 100 mg. Participants in Cohort 4
      are to exclusively receive drug product produced with Process B in Study HGT-MLD-070
      (NCT01510028) and will continue receiving this drug product in this study. Participants
      enrolled in this study from Cohorts 1 to 3 in Study HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028) were
      transitioned to Process B after all necessary approvals were obtained. In HGT-MLD-071, all
      participants in the 10 mg dose cohort who experienced disease progression, as determined by
      the Investigator, increased to the 30 mg dose after agreement by the Medical Monitor. Based
      on the interim analysis results from HGT-MLD-070 (NCT01510028 [Cohorts 1-3]), the dose of
      HGT-1110 will be increased to 100 mg for all participants in HGT-MLD-071 after all necessary
      approvals were obtained.
