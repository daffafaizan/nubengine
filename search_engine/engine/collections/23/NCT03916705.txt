      Approximately 30 participants with self-reported chronic low-back pain (LBP), defined as pain
      for ≥ 1-year in duration and pain on at least ½ of the days in the past 6-months, will be
      enrolled.

      This trial will consist of two separate enrollment phases. Phase 1 consists of enrollment at
      baseline followed by 3 separate ultrasound measurements. Phase 1 ends after a 4-week no
      treatment run-in phase.

      Phase 2 begins twice-weekly HVLA-SM treatments to the thoracolumbar region for 8-weeks. Two
      ultrasound imaging evaluations will occur at visit 1 (pre and post-treatment). Pre-treatment
      ultrasound evaluations will be obtained at 4-weeks and 8-weeks.

      The primary outcome is shear strain (adjacent tissue layer mobility measured with ultrasound)
      at the level of the lumbar L2-L3 vertebrae bilaterally. Ultrasound measures will be obtained
      with a Terason t3000 system using a 12L5 linear array probe with 10 MHz setting. Because
      shear strain may differ between sexes, we will attempt to recruit equal numbers of male and
      female participants.
