      I. To assess oncology providers' self-reported need for training on evidence-based tobacco
      cessation strategies and assess their level of interest in future training on evidence-based
      tobacco cessation strategies.

      II. To test the feasibility of the implementation of evidence-based tobacco cessation
      strategies in community oncology clinics.

      III. To test the feasibility of surveying community oncology patients after a clinic visit to
      assess provider behavior regarding screening and brief intervention for tobacco use.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a survey over approximately 10-15 minutes related to their provider's
      cessation advice and assistance with quitting.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.
