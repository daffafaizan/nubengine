      live in endemic areas and for travellers. There is clearly a great need for a safe effective
      malaria vaccine.

      The purpose of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of two candidate malaria vaccines
      (FP9-PP and MVA-PP). These live viral vector vaccines were administered in a 'prime boost'
      regime in the preceding trial VAC027.1.

      Volunteers will now be exposed to 5 infective bites from mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum
      malaria.

      This trial will:

        1. Measure efficacy as the time in hours from malaria exposure to blood film positive for
           malaria parasites

        2. Examine immunogenicity before and after malaria infection

        3. Measure longer term vaccine efficacy by re-challenging any protected volunteers 6 - 12
           months later
