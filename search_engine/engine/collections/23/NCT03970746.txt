    
      The therapeutic cancer vaccine, PDC*lung01 will be administered at two dose levels (low dose
      (LD) and high dose (HD)), as single agent or during maintenance treatment by pemetrexed (for
      adenocarcinomas in Cohorts A1 and A2) or added to the SoC (cohorts B1 and B2) i.e. anti-PD-1.

      In cohorts A1 (low dose cohort) and A2 (high dose cohort), NSCLC patients will be treated at
      each of the six PDC*lung01 treatment visits with low dose/high dose administered successively
      by subcutaneous and then by intravenous route.

      In cohort B1 and B2, the first PDC*lung01 injection will start within 48 hours after the
      first infusion of anti-PD-1. The fourth PDC*lung01 injection will occur within 48 hours after
      the infusion of the second cycle of anti-PD-1.

      For each patient, the study will be divided into three consecutive parts:

        -  Pre-screening (for HLA-A*02:01 positivity), only patients with positive HLA-A*02:01
           status will be proposed to be screened.

        -  Active period comprising a screening period, a treatment period (visits V1 to V6, during
           which the patient receives PDC*lung01 vaccine, at each visit) and an end-of-treatment
           (EoT) visit (V7, 4 weeks after the last injection),

        -  Follow-up period which starts after the EoT visit and lasts up to two years after the
           first IMP administration.
