      Emerging models of breast cancer suggest that breast cancers arise from a population of stem
      cells that are present in the normal mammary gland. The stem cell produces a clone of cancer
      cells.

      Researchers are now attempting to isolate and characterize breast stem cells and determine
      what events may initiate the tumorigenic process.

      Objectives:

      To identify and characterize breast stem cells from normal breast tissue from women who are
      free of breast cancer.

      To compare characteristics of breast stem cells between women at increased risk for breast
      cancer and women at average risk for breast cancer.

      To correlate breast stem cell number or characteristics with mammographic density.

      To establish cell cultures of breast stem cells from women at increased risk for breast
      cancer and women at average risk for breast cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Women who are at average or increased risk for breast cancer and over age 18 will be
      eligible.

      Design:

      This is a pilot tissue acquisition trial. Breast biopsies will be obtained from all subjects
      and breast cancer risk demographics will be collected at one time point. We aim to enroll 20
      average risk and 20 increased risk women.
