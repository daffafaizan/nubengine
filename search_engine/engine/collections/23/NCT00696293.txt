    
      This is a two-part study. Step 1 is an 8-week long open-label trial of duloxetine (DUL) +
      clinical management (CM), titrated up to 90 mg/day, for older adults with comorbid major
      depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic low back pain (CLBP). At week 8, if subjects have not
      responded, the dose of duloxetine is increased to 120 mg/day. Duloxetine will be increased
      and continued at 120 mg/day (or highest tolerated dose) for both randomized study groups
      (during step 2) to assure medication parity.

      Step two starts at week 9 and includes those subjects whose MDD and/or CLBP has not met
      criteria for response during Step 1. At week 9 subjects will be randomized to receive
      treatment with either: 1) DUL 120 mg/day (or the highest tolerated dose)+ Problem Solving for
      Depression and Pain (PST-DP) or 2) DUL 120 mg/day (or highest tolerated dose) + CM. Step 2
      will be delivered over the course of 8-10 sessions.
