    
      Patients who have been admitted to the hospital, or who have frequent urgent care visits, who
      also suffer from COPD exacerbations will be given a home monitoring system. Daily, the
      patient will respond to a series of questions. The results of the question answers will be
      remotely monitored by a nurse case manager.

      The objective is to measure compliance, resource use, and the ability for early recognition
      of an exacerbation of their COPD, and early implementation of therapy.
