      postprandial lipoproteins responds to dietary fats of differing fatty acid composition by
      comparing meals rich in saturated fatty acid (SFA) (from dairy cream) versus polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA) (from soybean oil). The information derived from these studies will
      provide mechanistic insight into postprandial lipid metabolism and will support efforts to
      identify optimal dietary oil intakes for people.
