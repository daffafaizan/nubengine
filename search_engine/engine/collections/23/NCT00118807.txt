    
      Children aged 0.5-10 years presenting at health centres with fever or history of fever and
      other symptoms suggestive of malaria will be screened; children found to have uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria will be randomized to receive treatment with AS/AQ, SP/AQ or
      SP/CQ. A drug dispenser will supervise the first dose of medication and subsequent doses will
      be given to the child's parent to be administered at home, unsupervised by the study team.
      Patients will be visited at home three days later. Unused medication will be counted and the
      mother will be asked about the number of doses the child received and any side effects.
      Children will be seen again 2 and 4 weeks after treatment to collect finger prick samples for
      packed cell volume (PCV) and malaria microscopy. The primary endpoint is clinical failure by
      day 28. Analysis will be by intention to treat.
