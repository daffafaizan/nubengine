      shoulder girdle injuries in adults. Old-established treatment practices, based on no
      randomised controlled trials, are used for clavicle fractures. By tradition, midshaft
      clavicle fractures have been treated conservatively with arm immobilized to a sling for few
      weeks. The goal of treatment is to restore painless function of the upper extremity.

      There have been some recommendations for operative treatment, such as skin compromising in
      fracture area, open fracture, floating shoulder, neurovascular symptoms in upper extremity,
      or multiple injuries. Recently, increasing interest has emerged in the surgical treatment.
