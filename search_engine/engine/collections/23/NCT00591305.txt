      and elsewhere in the throat causing less damage to surface tissues than other commonly used
      lasers. In our proposed clinical study, we seek to compare treatment efficacy for RRP by
      combining PDL with DIM, versus PDL-only treatment, in a total of 30 children with laryngeal
      papilloma. We will determine whether this combined treatment would be effective and safe in
      preventing or delaying the RRP recurrence while preserving voice quality. 30 children will be
      divided randomly into two treatment groups, 15 in each. The experimental group will receive
      one-time PDL treatment, followed by 3-month oral administration of DIM and an additional 12
      months with no treatment. The other group will be treated with PDL-only, as a control, and
      take a placebo pill for 3 months. All of the patients will be followed for a total of 15
      months. We will compare lesion recurrence and laboratory tests between the two groups, to
      determine efficacy and safety of the new treatment. This is the first study to combine new
      PDL laser technique with DIM, to develop a new, voice-preserving and long-term effective
      method of managing laryngeal RRP in children.
