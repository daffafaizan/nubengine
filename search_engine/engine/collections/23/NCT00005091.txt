      with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Evaluate the quantitative and
      qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess the time to progression and
      survival status of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for
      5 days. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
