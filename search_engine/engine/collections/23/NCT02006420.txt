      Scleroderma in particular causes skin thickening and hardening.

      Currently, evaluation of degree to which skin is affected by scleroderma is measured by a
      combination of a physical exam and skin biopsy results.

      The investigators propose to measure skin hardness using ultrasound elasticity imaging, in
      the form of acoustic radiation force impulse/shear wave velocity imaging (ARFI/SVI).

      The investigators hypothesize that ARFI/SVI may be able to distinguish normal skin from skin
      affected by scleroderma (and other rheumatologic conditions). And, this ultrasound technique
      might measure the amount of fibrosis in the dermis (skin).

      Such a radiologic biomarker could be used to help confirm the diagnosis of scleroderma. In
      addition, it may be usable for following patients over time and measuring their response to
      therapy and progression of disease.
