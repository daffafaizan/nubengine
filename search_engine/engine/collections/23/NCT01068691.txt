        -  To evaluate the level of blood pressure control using ambulatory blood pressure
           monitoring in patients who have undergone surgery for a type A thoracic AD or AH.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To study aortic stiffness within this patient population and determine its predictive
           parameters.

        -  To determine the prevalence of OSAS among this patient population and study the
           relationship between respiratory data and blood pressure values.

        -  To determine the respective roles of blood pressure level, aortic stiffness, and
           respiratory and biological parameters upon the postoperative aortic diameters of
           patients who have undergone surgery for type A thoracic AD or AH.
