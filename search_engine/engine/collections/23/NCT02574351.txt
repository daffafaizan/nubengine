      least in part, related to a defective number or function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). That
      is in the obese asthmatic subject a defective Treg profile would augment the inflammation of
      asthma (a synergistic effect). Alternatively, that Treg dysfunction in obesity might affect
      asthma independently (an additive effect). To test these hypotheses, the investigators plan
      to conduct an observational controlled study to compare Treg profile in obese and
      normal-weight individuals with and without asthma.

      This is an exploratory study to investigate the following:

        1. To determine whether Treg number and function differs between obese and normal-weight
           individuals with and without asthma.

        2. To determine whether serum leptin levels differ between obese and normal-weight
           individuals with and without asthma.
