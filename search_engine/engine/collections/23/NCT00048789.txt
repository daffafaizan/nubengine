      versus host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
      Extracorporeal exposure of human mononuclear cells to ultraviolet A radiation following
      photosensitization with 8-methoxypsoralen has proven to be an effective treatment for
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Small, single institution studies have suggested efficacy in other
      T-cell mediated diseases such as solid organ rejection and graft versus host disease. This a
      phase 2 study of ECP for treatment of chronic graft versus host disease. Eligible patients
      must have objective evidence of chronic graft versus host disease that is refractory to
      conventional therapy or must have steroid-dependent disease that does not permit steroid dose
      reduction. The primary objective of this study is to better define the safety, efficacy and
      mechanism of action of ECP for treatment of patients with chronic graft versus host disease.
