    
      -  The subject will be instructed to maintain 90Â° hip flexion in the supine position.

        -  Then asked to actively extend the knee joint.

        -  The degree of achieving active knee extension will be measured using a universal
           goniometer.

        -  The average of three active knee extension measurements will be recorded used as the
           hamstring muscle length for the data analysis (Dong-Kyu Lee, et al., 2018).

        -  This test will be done for the same limb with opposite leg extended and with opposite
           flexed.
