      I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation
      therapy for lung cancer associated with the development of radiation pneumonitis.

      II. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation
      therapy for brain cancer associated with the development of radiation necrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine, blood, and tissue profiles of patients undergoing
      radiation therapy for lung and brain cancer associated with survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Collected blood, urine, and tissue samples are analyzed for biomarkers via metabolomic and
      epigenetic profiling using massspectrometry, array, and sequencing-based technology.
