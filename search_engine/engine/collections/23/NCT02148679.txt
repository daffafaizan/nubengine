      total duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered
      sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD)-compliant meals in older
      adults (age >= 65 years) following discharge from a hospital admission for acutely
      decompensated heart failure. 66 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by
      gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (< vs. â‰¥ 50%).

      107 subjects yielded 66 randomized subjects.

      Study subjects will receive either pre-prepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or
      attention control for 4 weeks after hospital discharge. The three study sites will be
      Columbia University Medical Center, the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Health System, and the
      University of Michigan Health System. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food
      diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until the completion of the study
