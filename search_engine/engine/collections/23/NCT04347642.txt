      paraumbilical port 12 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

        -  G1: 12mm Umbilical port will be inserted in the umbilical region, with open access and
           using a Hasson port. Pneumoperitoneum will be done by this Hasson port.

        -  G2: 12 mm paraumbilical port will be inserted laterally to the midline, with close
           access and using and optical port, traversing the rectus abdominal muscle.
           Pneumoperitoneum will be previously done using a Veress needle.

      Incisional hernia at the level of this port insertion will be assessed by physical
      examination and, in case of doubst, by ultrasonography, 12 months after surgery.
