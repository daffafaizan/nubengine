      critically ill patients in a medical ICU of a middle income country with limited access to
      ICU resources.

      Methods: Consecutive critically ill medical patients treated in a recently established
      medical ICU in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, were prospectively recorded and a subsequent
      cost utility analysis of intensive care in comparison to hospital ward treatment from the
      perspective of health care system was performed. Incremental cost effectiveness was
      calculated using estimates of ICU versus non-ICU treatment effectiveness based on a formal
      systematic review of published studies. Decision analytic modeling was used to compare
      treatment alternatives. Sensitivity analyses of the key model parameters were performed.
