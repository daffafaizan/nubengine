    
      For integrative investigation of the effects of priming solution and postoperative fluid
      management on the complex interrelation between microcirculation and reactive oxygen species;
      sublingual microcirculation using microcirculation imaging system (IDF, Cytocam, NL) will be
      displayed and measure ekstra vascular lung water (EVLW) using PiCCO and plasma levels of
      oxidative stress markers will be measured. Sublingual tissue microcirculation will be
      evaluated in all patients at different time points as before induction (T0), after induction
      (T1), before cross clamping-hypothermic period (T2), after cross clamping (T3), before end of
      pump (normothermic period, heating) (T4), acceptance to intensive care unit (T5), third hour
      after surgery (T6) and twenty forth hour after surgery (T7).
