      stays) may affect cognitive function. For logistical reasons and to control the experimental
      set-ups, most of these examinations are carried out in the laboratory. By testing under such
      controlled conditions, researchers can remove any co-foundational factors and isolate the
      cause of stress, thereby better understanding the mechanisms by which impairment can occur.
      However, when people are exposed to such environments in the "real world" (such as altitude),
      they often experience a number of other additional stressors at the same time, which can also
      affect their performance. Surprisingly, however, little attention has been paid to the study
      of these additional stressors in combination.

      Although the oxygen content remains constant at various altitudes (20.93%), the air pressure
      decreases exponentially as the altitude increases. As a result, the oxygen partial pressure
      in arterial blood and tissue is reduced (hypoxia), leading to a deterioration in both
      physical and cognitive performance. Hypoxic conditions also alter the perception of pain,
      which may be particularly relevant for patients suffering from hypoxic conditions. According
      to the authors' knowledge, there is limited literature investigating and comparing simulated
      and real psychophysiological responses.
