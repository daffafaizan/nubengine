      weight-loss treatment. Its mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated. GLP-1 infusion in
      humans suppresses hunger-inducing MMC contractility.

      Therefore, we will recruit 15 healthy subjects which will participate to this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover trial. The subjects will receive both treatment arms: 5
      consecutive days of placebo injection or 0.6 mg liraglutide injection. On the 4th day, the
      injection will be combined with a motility study (fasted state), and on the 5th day with an
      ad libitum buffet.

      The primary outcome of this study is to investigate whether liraglutide decreases MMC
      activity, measured by a solid-state, high-resolution manometry catheter (only on 4th day of
      the treatment arm). The amount and preference for certain types of food is tested during an
      ad libitum free choice buffet (only on 5th day of treatment arm). The effect on
      gastrointestinal hormone release will be measured by taking blood samples at regular time
      points (both 4th and 5th day of treatment arm). In parallel with the blood sample collection,
      glucose whole blood levels are measured. Hunger-related sensations are scored on a visual
      analog scale of 100 mm at regular time points (both 4th and 5th day of treatment arm).
