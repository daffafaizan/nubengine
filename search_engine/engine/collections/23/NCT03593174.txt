      Removable Rigid Dressing (RRD) -type compression modality immediately following a tibial
      amputation as an alternative to the elastic bandage, which is the usually-used modality. This
      pilot study will verify the feasability of implantation of this type of dressing, and to
      collect data on the main dependant variables of this research projet in order to eventually
      estimate the expected effect on a larger population.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. To explore the efficacy of the RRD in comparison to the elastic bandage on the size of
           the stump, associated complications and necessary time to fitting of the prosthesis.

        2. Verify the facilitators and obstacles to implantation of the RRD as a post tibial
           ambutation dressing modality as an alternative to the elastic bandage.
