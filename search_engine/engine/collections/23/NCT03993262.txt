      like the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor or LGI1 (Leucin-rich glioma inactivated protein
      1). So far, no specific therapy exists for this disease. Actual treatment includes
      combination therapies aiming for a reduction of pathogenic antibodies and containing the
      autoimmune process. In first line, patients are treated with plasmapheresis and cortisone. In
      second line, Rituximab and/or cyclophosphamide are administered. The response to these
      treatments are, however, often delayed and insufficient.

      Therefore, we need a specific therapy aiming at the antibody-producing plasma cells.

      Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor which interferes with NF-kB (nuclear factor kB) and the
      ubiquitin proteasome signaling pathway. Bortezomib acts preferably on cells with high protein
      synthesis - like plasma cells - and induces cell death in these cells. Bortezomib is used
      since more than a decade in chemotherapy of the multiple myeloma. Additionally, it is
      reported for systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus erythematodes that bortezomib leads to a
      depletion of plasma cells and therefore reduces the number of pathogenic antibodies and
      improves clinical outcome. The therapeutic potential of bortezomib for NMDAR encephalitis is
      described in a first case series with 5 patients.
