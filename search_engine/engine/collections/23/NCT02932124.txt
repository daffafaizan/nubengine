      investigators examined the outcome after using mechanical CPR on return of spontaneous
      circulation (ROSC) in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Investigators
      compared mechanical CPR (Intervention group) to manual CPR (control group). According to
      preclinical risk factors, investigators calculated the predicted ROSC-after-cardiac-arrest
      (RACA) score for each group, and compared it to the rate of ROSC observed. Using multivariate
      analysis, investigators adjusted the influence of the devices' application on ROSC for
      epidemiological factors and therapeutic measures.
