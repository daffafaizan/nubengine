      up to 42 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (a minimum of 27 will be entered if
      all dose levels are explored without reaching a dose limiting toxicity at any level). The
      primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of external beam radiation
      to the para-aortic lymph nodes using IMRT and amifostine. Patients will be stratified
      according to gross tumor volume (GTV) prior to dose escalation.

      Within each GTV stratum, the dose escalation will be determined as follows: Accrue 3 patients
      in the first dose level based on the determined stratum. A Dose Limiting Toxicity is defined
      as the development of > Grade 3 acute GI toxicity, per the RTOG acute toxicity scale. If no
      DLT is observed at the first dose level, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose level.
      If one patient experiences DLT at a given dose level, 3 additional patients will be enrolled
      at that dose level. If 0 of these 3 additional patients experience DLT, dosing of the next
      dose level is begun. If 1 or more of these 3 additional patients experience DLT at the
      highest dose level below the maximally administered dose, this dose becomes the recommended
      dose. At least 6 patients must be entered at this recommended dose. The Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity.
