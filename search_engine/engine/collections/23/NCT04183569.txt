      understand what genomic markers, transcriptomic or proteomic would identify those patients
      ahead. This would ultimately help to identify whether dysregulated biological pathway could
      be targeted specifically among patients with personalized treatment.

      Like its counterpart systemic Lymphoma Diffuse large B cell, the sequential analysis of the
      same patient at diagnosis and relapse can also identify candidate genes and biological
      pathways involved in recurrence and help to design new therapeutic strategies.

      Another objective is ultimately the development of an integrative bioinformatics tool for
      anticipating the therapeutic response. The tumor model used is certainly a rare cancer but
      prototypical ABC lymphomas allowing access to relapse hardware and relative homogeneity that
      will allow a study of a smaller number of cases for the development of correlations models
      genomics / proteomics. This is a pivotal project integrating proteomic data and Molecular
      Biology (mutation, expression) based on the pooling of skills of clinical teams, biological
      and bioinformatics to validate a predictive model for treatment response able to integrate
      prognostic markers known as TNM the dual expression MYC / BCL2 and forward to predict the
      therapeutic response using this modeling by CBIB. We would then validate the model
      established in this series of training on a range of national validation as part of an
      observational study with GFELC (Groupe Français d'Etude des Lymphomes Cutanés).
