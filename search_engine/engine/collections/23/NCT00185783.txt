      than 750,000 cases of severe sepsis occur each year in the United States. Mortality among
      patients with severe sepsis ranges from 7% to 50%. Initiation of antibiotic therapy within
      the first hour of diagnosis as well as fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization are
      primary goals of therapy.

      Steroid administration has been shown to improve outcome in the subset of severe sepsis
      patients suffering from relative adrenal insufficiency. Although initial studies using high
      dose short course steroid therapy did not demonstrate efficacy, more recent studies of low
      dose longer duration hydrocortisone administration demonstrated a significant reduction in
      mortality at 28 days. The mechanism by which steroid administration affords protection is
      unclear. We hypothesize that steroid administration changes white blood cell gene and protein
      expression in severe sepsis patients from an immuno-inflammatory profile to a pattern
      consistent with healing.

      Our first specific aim is to obtain plasma and total cellular RNA from leukocytes in the
      blood of ten patients admitted to Stanford Medical Center with the diagnosis of severe sepsis
      and adrenal insufficiency. Significant and distinct variations in whole blood leukocyte gene
      expression patterns occur depending upon the method of RNA isolation. We will attempt to
      demonstrate that our sampling method provides reliable and consistent data.

      Our second specific aim is to begin an analysis of gene expression patterns in white blood
      cells before and after steroid administration in patients suffering from severe sepsis with
      relative adrenal insufficiency. We will use a protocol for assessment of gene expression that
      was developed by members of our research team.
