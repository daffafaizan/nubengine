      30) with 2-4 months old babies who applied to Akdeniz University Hospital Healthy Children
      Polyclinic. Personal Information Form, Shaken Baby Syndrome Information and Attitude
      Assessment Data Form (Pre-Test) and Shaken Baby Syndrome Information and Attitude Evaluation
      Data Form (Post Test) will be used to collect data. Simple randomization will be used to
      evaluate the intervention and control groups. In order to identify mothers in intervention
      groups, sealed-envelope randomization method was used. Mothers and statistician group will be
      unaware of the evaluation. The researcher will not be blind because of the role he plays in
      the research.

      Following the pretest, the intervention group will be trained to prevent shaken baby
      syndrome. Expert opinion was obtained from 10 expert faculty members for the content of the
      training. After the training, the booklet prepared in line with expert opinions will be given
      to the mother in the intervention group. The booklet will remain with the mother.
      Tele-consultancy will be given to the mother for 2 months after the pre-test. The control
      group will also be tested beforehand and will not be intervened afterwards. 2 months after
      the pre-test, a post-test will be applied to the control group and training will be given to
      prevent shaken baby syndrome. A training booklet will be given to the mothers in the control
      group after the final test.

      Statistical analysis will be done using SPSS 23.0 and statistical significance will be set at
      p <0.05.

      Support will be received in the analysis phase of the Statistical Information Unit of Akdeniz
      University.
