      the symptomatic treatment- the disease is worsens with an inevitable progression, thus
      causing complications that lead to the loss of patientÂ´s manual skills and independent gait.
      At present, the treatment of PD with the use of medications is based on dopamine precursors
      and dopaminergic agonists but as the disease advances, other symptoms that do not respond to
      dopaminergic stimulation do appear.

      For this reason, it is a priority to find a way to focus on neuroprotection during the course
      of the disease. There are evidences of neuroprotecting therapeutic alternatives in such
      substances as erythropoietin (EPO).

      Positive results on the neuroprotective/neurotrophic efficacy of EPO in neurological and
      psychiatric diseases have been obtained from treatment trials, but nevertheless, it is
      indispensable demonstrate that with the proposed medication doses it's well tolerated by PD
      patients.
