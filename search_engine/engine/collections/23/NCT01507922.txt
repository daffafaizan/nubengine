      Fenoverine 100mg capsule three times a day and Trimebutine 150mg tablet three times a day.
      Because one is capsule and the other is tablet, double dummy design will be used. Efficacy is
      evaluated at the end of 8 weeks and safety will be followed for 4 more weeks after the end of
      the scheduled medication.
