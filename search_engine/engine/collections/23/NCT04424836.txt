      (Group K), the data of patients who received COT with a reservoir mask were included.

      In HFNC support, the current air temperature is 31-37 degrees, the flow rate is 30-60 lt /
      min, and the FiO2 value is targeted so that saturation is 93% and above. Initially,
      continuous treatment was applied intermittently after the partial oxygen pressure / fraction
      of inspired oxygen(fio2) ratio exceeded 250 and clinical well-being occurred.

      In patients in Group K, fingertip saturation was targeted as 93% and above, and a COT was
      applied with a reservoir mask with a flow rate of 6-15 l / min.

      The flow rate was calculated using the formula of FiO2 (%) = 21 + 4 * (liters / min) in
      patients undergoing COT. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was applied to patients who could
      not be provided with adequate clinical and laboratory well-being in both groups (partial
      oxygen pressure / fraction of inspired oxygen ratio below 150) and invasive mechanical
      ventilation if this was insufficient.
