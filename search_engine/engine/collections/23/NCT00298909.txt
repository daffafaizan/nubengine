      cholesterol (< 1,03 mmol/L) on lipid profile and endothelial function as measured by
      flow-mediated dilatation of radial artery. Secondary goals are the assessment of biochemical
      markers of atherosclerosis, expression of monocyte surface markers, oxidative stress and
      thrombogenicity.
