      be evaluated in an exploratory 16-week comparative treatment efficacy trial in 44 adult
      former smokers with established COPD of moderate severity. This trial employs a longitudinal
      randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled design using biomarkers of airway
      inflammation as the primary outcomes of interest.
