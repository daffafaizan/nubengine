      spondyloarthropathy. In a substantial number of cases however, these medications remain
      ineffective. At present, the scientific community has limited understanding of why some
      patients are resistant to this medication. The purpose of this study is to understand if the
      gut flora may associate with treatment response.

      Spondyloarthropathies are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases in terms of
      epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis. Recent studies have also associated
      spondyloarthropathies with intestinal dysbiosis.

      This study is of observational character and integrated in the routine clinical care of
      patients with spondyloarthropathies at the Rheumatology Clinic, Skane University Hospital,
      Lund, Sweden. Study participants are asked to deliver blood and fecal sampling at two
      time-points together with clinical evaluation of disease activity. With an estimated
      inclusion of 50 patients, at least 20 responders and 20 non-responders are expected to be
      included and to be compared to each other.

      Our primary goal is to investigate the association between change in intestinal microbiome
      and clinical response to therapy.

      In our secondary analyses we will investigate if intestinal microbiome and intestinal
      inflammation at baseline may predict response to, and adherence to, therapy in these
      patients.

      If successful treatment response of spondyloarthropathy is associated with specific
      alterations of the gut flora, these results may guide future studies on the impact of
      dysbiosis and probiotics on this disease.
