      chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment generally consists of
      immunosuppression to modify the dysregulated immune responses. Vedolizumab, an inhibitor of
      α4β7, is a highly effective therapy for treating IBD, that minimized adverse effects through
      its gut selective inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking. However, the mechanism of action
      remains incompletely characterized especially in those previously treated to other biologics
      and why some patients are either vedolizumab non-responders or fail to respond over time. We
      would like to address the question whether anti-TNF non-responders as well as those that
      either do not respond or fail overtime to respond to vedolizumab identifies a specific
      population with difficult to treat disease that have alternate trafficking patterns and
      whether prior exposure to anti-TNF alters the mucosal immune responses, and/or trafficking
      patterns when compared to anti-TNF naive patients that may help explain impaired response to
      vedolizumab induction therapy.
