    
      A randomized, double blind pilot study; physicians and patients will be blinded as to which
      treatment group they will be placed, nutrition therapists will perform randomization and
      placement into each treatment group for this research study, along with the development of
      daily meal plan as they typically do when not involved in this study, and therefore they will
      not be blinded.

      Research Procedures

      Patients will be placed into one of two groups:

        1. Control: Intake 35-50 grams of fat per day between meals and snacks - this is the
           typical amount used within our current inpatient re-feeding meal plan, still within a
           healthy range as it is at the lower end of normal, which given that these patients
           typically consume a "low fat" diet prior to admission that this amount has been the
           standard of care for treatment thus far, if they require any supplemental feedings for
           incomplete meals it will be with the standard lower fat content supplements

        2. Treatment: Intake > 50 grams of fat per day between meals and snacks - still within a
           healthy range as it is at the higher end of normal, if they require any supplemental
           feedings for incomplete meals it will be with a higher fat content supplement as
           dictated by the nutrition therapists

      Study instruments - questionnaires distributed and collected on the initial day of admission,
      on every third day of inpatient stay and on the day of discharge by the nutrition therapists.
      Due to the lack of research on this method of treatment, there are no questionnaires which
      have been tested for validity and reliability; therefore we have created our own, which we
      plan to assess during this pilot study. We also plan to follow-up with the patient and
      parent(s) at 1 month post-discharge (+/- 1 day) to assess how their re-feeding treatment has
      been going, along with to assess how they feel and ask about any symptoms they are
      experiencing.

      Tests and procedures - all patients with Nutritional Insufficiency/Eating Disorders admitted
      to the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital follow the Nutritional Insufficiency Protocol,
      with all screening tests and inpatient evaluation and follow-up occurring regardless of
      whether they are involved in the current pilot study. As per protocol, these patients will be
      on strict bed rest with a 24 hour companion supervising the patient at all times, especially
      monitoring intake and timing of completion of all meals, snacks and/or supplements. It is
      also standard per protocol that they receive Neutra-phos which is a potassium phosphate and
      sodium phosphate supplement, twice daily for the initial 5 days of treatment. The screening,
      daily inpatient evaluation, and study questionnaire distribution will be completed on
      admission, every 3 days, and at discharge
