    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention) study in which 590 patients will be randomly assigned
      to receive either DRV/rtv 800/100 mg daily or DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily along with the
      selected OBR. An OBR will consist of at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs) selected by the investigator. The study will include a 4 week screening period,
      48-weeks of treatment period and 4-weeks of follow-up. The study will also consists of
      extension phase after Week 48: in regions where DRV is not yet commercially available or
      reimbursed by the health care system, patients who complete the 48 weeks of treatment with
      DRV/rtv and who continue to benefit from this treatment, will have the opportunity to
      continue DRV treatment as a 600 mg twice daily dosage until DRV is reimbursed and available
      via the public and/or private health care system or until its development is discontinued.
      Safety evaluation will consists of adverse events (including specific toxicities), clinical
      laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, physical and skin examination.
