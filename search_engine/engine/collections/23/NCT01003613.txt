    
      This is a prospective, randomised, control trial of 50 participants. Twenty five patients in
      each arm. Twenty five patients undergo standard pterygium excision with the fibrin glue
      (Tissucol) conjunctival autograft . Twenty five patients undergo pterygium surgery with
      fibrin glue (Tissucol), and subconjunctival injection of 0.1 ml of Tranilast 1.0% in the head
      of pterygium 30 days before surgery. Participants will be reviewed, selected, and consented
      on a pre-assessment day. Surgery will be performed 4 at a time on an all day surgery
      operating list. Randomisation of the surgery type will be done at the time of surgery after
      the pterygium has been excised and the autograft taken. The surgeries will perform by a
      single surgeon (Almeida Jr, GC). Follow-up will occur at week 1,4, 26, 52. Slit lamp
      examination will indicate pterygium recurrence. Corneal recurrence will consider when it 0.5
      mm of invaded conjunctival tissue,in the clear cornea from the anatomical limbus. The
      conjunctival recurrence will consider of any size conjunctive fibrovascular invasion inside
      the graft. The localization and of immunohistochemical will be perform for TGF-B.
