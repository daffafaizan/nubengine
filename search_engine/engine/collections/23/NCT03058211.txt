    
      Area: Intensive care unit (ICU) of the participating hospitals. Patients: Forty patients with
      CAP without heart disease history will be included consecutively (20 patients with
      pneumococcal CAP and 20 patients with non-pneumococcal CAP).Ten healthy volunteers (controls)
      are included.

      Variables: Epidemiological, clinical and hemodynamic variables are recorded. Presence of MI
      and CVE measured by echocardiography and by biomarkers will be evaluated during the ICU stay.
      Presence of scarring miocardic by MRI technique will be determined at month 6 since ICU
      admission.

      Statistical analysis: Categorical (Fisher's exact test) and continuous variables( Wilconxon
      and Anova) will be used to determine differences between them. The Pearson correlation, ROC
      (discriminatory power) and logistic regression analysis(independent association) will be used
      to determine the association between variables and outcome. A p-value of 0.05 will be
      considered significant.
