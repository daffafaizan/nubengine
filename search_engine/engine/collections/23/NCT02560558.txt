      Belatacept be given as an infusion every 4 weeks. The investigator wants to assess if the
      patients who have been stable for one year after transplant can be safely transitioned to an
      8-week Belatacept infusion schedule. Renal function and any episodes of acute rejection will
      be closely monitored.
