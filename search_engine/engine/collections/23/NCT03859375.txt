      departments. Preparation of the skin with disinfectants belongs to the standard of care prior
      to any surgical intervention but disinfection practices are heterogeneous across different
      hospitals and countries. Although the efficacy and effectiveness of preoperative surgical
      site preparation is dependent on both the antiseptic agent used and the application method,
      it is unclear how many paints of an antiseptic are needed to ensure adequate infection
      protection.

      An adequately powered study including different standard antiseptic agents (i.e.
      chlorhexidine in alcohol (CHX) and povidone iodine in alcohol (PI)) is therefore required to
      compare the protective effect of different numbers of paints.
