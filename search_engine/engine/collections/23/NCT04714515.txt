      antivirals, antibacterials, and anti-inflammatory compositions are being tested with the
      intention of repurposing against COVID-19. In this study, investigators have evaluated the
      effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Montelukast (ML) in an individual and
      combination therapy.

      Investigators have performed an observational study of 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients
      while assessing the safety and efficacy of HCQ, ML, and IV as individual therapy and in
      combination with each other. ECG, interleukin levels, LFTs, blood profiles were continuously
      monitored throughout the study.

      The aim was to observe participants treated with ML and monitor the inflammatory markers to
      see whether they increase or decrease and whether an increase in survival rate is observed.
      The findings have shown that combinational therapy of ML with continuous observation of
      liver/kidney profiles and QTc prolongation can provide robust recovery with suppression of
      cytokines.
