      infected persons. Transmission can be oral, sexual, via blood transfusion, organ
      transplantation, intrauterine, or perinatal. Infection with CMV preadolescence frequently
      leads to an asymptomatic infection followed by a lifelong persistence of the virus in the
      body. Infection post adolescence typically leads to symptoms that resemble those of
      mononucleosis (e.g., fever, fatigue, hepatitis, etc.) In contrast, CMV infections in immune
      compromised patients can be life threatening. A major cause of virus-associated morbidity and
      mortality in solid organ transplantation patients is illness caused by CMV (i.e., CMV
      syndrome or CMV disease).

      The risk of progressing to CMV disease post-transplant is strongly correlated with the
      serological status of the donor (D) and recipient (R); the highest risk group is R-/D+.
      Patients at risk for CMV disease can be managed either preemptively (i.e., patients are only
      treated with antiviral agents after evidence of CMV infection arises), or prophylactically
      (i.e., all patients are treated with antiviral agents regardless of CMV infection status).
      Monitoring of the CMV viral load of transplant patients during antiviral therapy provides an
      effective aid in the management of patients with CMV disease. The artus® CMV RG PCR test is a
      nucleic acid amplification-based assay for the quantitation of CMV DNA using PCR in the
      Rotor-Gene™ 6000 Instrument (also known as Rotor-Gene Q) with software version 2.0.2.3 or
      higher. In the present study the artus CMV RG PCR test result will be evaluated for its
      ability to safely and effectively monitor transplant patients during antiviral therapy and
      will be compared to the COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® CMV Test
