        1. Primary outcome measure: 3-month change in the number of sites with probing depth (PD)
           5-9 mm and positive to bleeding upon probing (BoP). Sites characterized by PD 5-9 mm and
           BoP+ will be therefore identified as "experimental sites".

        2. Secondary outcomes: 3-month changes in the following clinical parameters assessed at
           experimental sites: clinical attachment level (CAL), PD, number of sites harboring
           supra-gingival plaque.

        3. Other evaluations: Pocket microbiological (subgingival plaque) samples at one
           (interproximal) experimental site for analysis of periodontal pathogens at baseline and
           3 months following treatment.

      STUDY POPULATION Forty (40) adults, aged 18-75 years, will be entered into study
      (randomized). It is expected that at least thirty-two (32) subjects will complete the study.

      Randomized subjects who deviate from the protocol (major protocol deviation) and, for this
      reason, are excluded from the analysis, will be replaced to guarantee that the sample
      required for the analysis (32) is reached.

      Inclusion Characteristics

        -  Signed Informed Consent Form.

        -  Male and female subjects, aged 18-75 years, inclusive.

        -  Good general health (free of systemic diseases such as diabetes, HIV infection or
           genetic disorder, ongoing malignant disease of any type that could influence the outcome
           of the treatment and might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives).

        -  Moderate to severe periodontitis

        -  At least 8 experimental sites (PD 5-9 mm and BoP+).

        -  Availability for the 3-month duration of the study for an assigned subject.
