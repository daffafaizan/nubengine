           Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

        2. Fasting : Participants fast for five days, without any food, except unlimited mineral
           water. Participants will do some fitness regimen (such as meditation and mild physical
           exercise ) during fasting.

        3. Re-feeding: Gradually distribute participants with rice flour, porridge and juice in the
           next 3 days.

        4. Follow-up :The health checklist is similar with that during fasting on the first month.

        5. Data processing, statistics and analysis. Diet monitoring: The intake of glucose
           decreases, while the burning of fat increases, which can down-regulate glucose level in
           blood, up-regulate ketone level in urine. Thus, the fasting situation of participants
           can be monitored by the variation of blood glucose and urine ketone.
