    
      The Neuro RX Gamma system is a headset which emits pulsed near-infrared energy synchronously
      or asynchronously through diodes placed on the scalp and inside a nostril.

      A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to
      participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups -
      treatment synchronized, treatment asynchronized or sham (placebo). A dedicated caregiver will
      apply the device to the subject for 20 minute daily sessions at home, 6 days a week for a
      total of 12 weeks. The subject and caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for
      follow-up assessments after 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Participants will have the choice
      of opting into a substudy involving the collection of rest EEG recordings during the baseline
      and weeks 3, 6 and 12 visits.

      60 patients will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites in Ontario, Canada.
