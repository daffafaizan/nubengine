      lenses, combining neurobiological, sociological and epidemiological research methods and
      levels of observation. The neurobiological perspective will investigate the rewarding effects
      of vaping, using neurobiological and neuropsychological measurements on e-cigarette users, as
      compared to nicotine-na√Øve participants.

      The researchers will use established fMRI paradigms to measure the reward potential of
      e-cigarettes: First, craving will be investigated in an experimental approach by presenting
      conditioned stimuli to participants; and second, motivation for e-cigarettes compared to
      combustible cigarettes or money will be measured in an experimental work task. In addition, a
      dot-probe-task will be used in combination with eye-tracking to measure the attentional bias
      for e-cigarette stimuli. As part of the neuropsychological assessment outside the fMRI, the
      approach bias for smoking cues will also be investigated. The aim is to examine whether
      chronic use of e-cigarettes leads to similar conditioning processes and comparable aspects of
      motivation as that of traditional tobacco cigarettes.

      The investigators will examine the punishment potential of e-cigarettes in a secondary
      research question, using questionnaires on withdrawal and on the consequences of smoking,
      both for traditional tobacco and for e-cigarettes.

      The results of this project are relevant for the development of preventive healthcare and new
      treatment options. The neurobiological approach will also provide implications for
      individualized therapy by identifying consumer groups with different neuronal patterns.
