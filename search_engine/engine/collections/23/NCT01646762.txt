      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) of single agent nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)
      (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the adverse events associated with use of single agent nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To evaluate overall survival, time to progression, and duration of response among
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma undergoing treatment with single agent
      nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.
