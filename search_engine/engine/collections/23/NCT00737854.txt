      premalignant and are often a source of morbidity. recent study does not support that non
      reticular OLP are more predisposed to malignant change. Moreover , immunosuppressive therapy
      did not influence the risk for oral cancer. in general ,all treatment should be aimed at
      eliminating precancerous lesions ,alleviating symptoms ,and potentially decreasing the risk
      of malignant transformation. Although the cause of OLP is unknown , it is generally
      considered to be an immunologically mediated process that microscopically resembles a
      hypersensitivity reaction .it is characterized by an intense T cell infiltrate localized to
      epithelium-connective tissue interface. the purpose of the study is to determined the
      efficacy of free soft tissue graft in treatment of precancerous and symptomatic lesions of
      OLP. so removal of the lesions up to submucosa will be done. the graft sliced from healthy
      mucosa also up to submucosa . then graft will be sutured in position.

      According to other authors, basal epithelial layers of the graft remain intact and represent
      the focus of reepithelialization. new epithelial cell migrate over the basal membrane and
      appear to guide it and by proliferation ,will generate new epithelium. so the wound is
      re-epithelialized by proliferation of surrounding healthy epithelial cell, therefore, not
      contaminated by modified antigens of the cell membrane that are theoretically responsible for
      lymphocyte aggression so the healthy graft remains free of lesions and appears clinically
      healthy.
