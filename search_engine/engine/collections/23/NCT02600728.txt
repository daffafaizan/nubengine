      contribute to progressive impairment in gait performance. The use of declarative memory cues
      in order to promote the engagement of attention and activation of the next movement in gait
      may minimize the consequences of lack of automatic control.

      Objectives: To verify the long-term efficiency of a new strategy based on declarative memory
      cue to improve the gait performance and independence in daily life activities (DLA) in
      patients with PD.

      Design: Parallel prospective, single blind, randomized clinical trial. Setting: Brazilian
      Parkinson Association. Participants: Forty-four patients with PD in stages 2-3 of disease
      evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr Classification Interventions: The experimental training
      (ET) consisted of eight gait training sessions, twice a week, using the declarative memory
      cues strategy (DMCS). The control training (CT) consisted of a similar gait training without
      DMCS.

      Primary outcome measure: Gait performance in terms of speed and stride length. Secondary
      outcome measure: Independence in DLA according to Section II of the Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale.

      Randomization: Participants were randomized into a control group (CG), which performed the
      CT, and an experimental group (EG), which performed the ET, through blinded drawing of names.

      Statistical analysis: The gait performance and ADL independence before, 2 and 60 days after
      the end of training were compared for CG and EG using Repeated-measures analysis of variance
      (RM-ANOVA).
