      glucose concentration. Hypoglycemia is a common, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous
      side effect of treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially with insulin or sulfonylureas.

      Dasiglucagon (ZP4207) is a stable peptide analog of human glucagon, available in a
      ready-to-use liquid formulation. Dasiglucagon is in development for the treatment of severe
      hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. Dasiglucagon is a specific and full glucagon
      receptor agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and
      elimination (minutes).
