    
      Part 1 (dose escalation) will enroll subjects with an advanced solid tumor that is refractory
      or intolerant to standard of care therapy, where the tumor is pancreatic adenocarcinoma (no
      molecular typing) or any other solid tumor that has a documented activating mutation,
      amplification, or fusion of HER2, ERBB3, FGFR1, FGFR2, or an activating mutation in KRAS.

      Subjects will be assigned sequentially to increasing eFT226 doses. The starting dose of
      eFT226 is 0.005 mg/kg administered IV weekly in 21 day cycles. eFT226 doses will be escalated
      in subsequent cohorts after subjects enrolled in a given cohort have completed the 21-day
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. Dose escalation in Part 1 will enroll
      subjects based on 3+3 design, whereby 3 subjects will be initially enrolled and treated at
      each dose level.

      To obtain as robust a data set as possible regarding PK, safety and tolerability in a diverse
      population prior to selecting the RP2D, the MTD and MTD-1 cohorts may be backfilled up to 15
      subjects total in each cohort.

      Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) of the study will provide cohort expansion to further explore the
      safety, pharmacology, and clinical activity of eFT226 monotherapy in subjects with previously
      treated advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 2 will be based on results observed in Part 1
      and will be defined by amendment to the protocol.
