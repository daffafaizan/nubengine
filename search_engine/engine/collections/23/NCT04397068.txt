           information to develop a customized IOL calculation for eyes undergoing phacoVTX.

        -  Evidence for recording lens thickness (LT) parameter in the IOL strength calculation in
           KWS (in the calculation of the ELP in the light of the Olsen formula, using the
           C-constant) in order to be able to make an even more accurate prediction of the
           post-operative diopter target of the patient.
