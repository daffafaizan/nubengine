      studying with what degree of accuracy it can be use to recreate vision tests that are used by
      eye doctors to screen and diagnose patients. VR provides advantages that could be used to
      improve eye care once the technology is tested and compared to the currently used vision
      tests - such as limiting the costs, duration and tedium associated with existing forms of
      vision screening tests. By doing so, the researchers hope to expand access to eye care by
      lowering the cost burden associated with vision tests. In this study, the research team will
      have subjects go through the VR versions of the test that are used in practice, and analyze
      their results in comparison to one another. After informed consent is obtained, the research
      team will collect subject demographic information (date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race)
      and clinically relevant medical history. Afterward, the research team will proceed to the
      virtual reality tests: vision field perimetry, Amsler, Snellen chart, contrast- sensitivity
      and currently used office tests. The participants will undergo all the tests, VR and non-VR,
      which will be delivered in a randomized order. The entire sequence will last 30 minutes to
      one hour for a single test. The VR component will last about 5 minutes, this being the only
      addition to the scheduled vision tests. The sequence of VR / non VR testing will be
      randomized. Based on the previous studies that compared Humphrey MATRIX visual field and
      Swedish Interactive algorithm, the effect size is determined to be at least 30 subjects, and
      the goal is to reach N=1,000 participants.
