    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study designed
      to assess the efficacy and safety of romiplostim (formerly, AMG 531) treatment in
      thrombocytopenic MDS patients. The study is composed of a 26-week placebo controlled test
      treatment period (romiplostim versus Placebo), a 4 week interim wash-out period, a 24-week
      placebo controlled extended treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period followed by an
      End of Study (EOS) visit. During the interim wash-out period, a bone marrow biopsy will be
      performed in the absence of growth factor to assess changes in the marrow. In the extended
      treatment period, safety assessments will continue and participants will be allowed to
      receive any standard of care treatments for MDS. Patients will be followed for survival for
      an additional 60 months following the End of Study (EOS) visit.
