      prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was
      superior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC.
      Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been shown to have higher response rates in NPC than
      noncisplatin regimens. However, the patients' compliance was unsatisfactory because the
      obvious gastrointestinal toxicity of cisplatin. Nedaplatin is the new second generation
      platinum and it has slight gastrointestinal reaction. Our trial is in order to study the
      effectiveness of nedaplatin or cisplatin with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      chemoradiotherapy in treating patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.
