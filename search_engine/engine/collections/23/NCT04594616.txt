      for adults with MDD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects (N=112) will be randomly assigned
      to 8 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD either immediately, or after a 8-week long
      waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT
      for MDD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with MDD, and that it will lead to
      greater reductions in MDD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist
      control).
