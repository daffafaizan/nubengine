      experience dry mouth may be more susceptible to dental decay because they lack the protection
      provided by an adequate flow of saliva. These patients are likely to have high levels of the
      decay causing bacteria, mutans streptococci.

      The purpose of this research is to test the ability of a novel xylitol delivery vehicle to
      reduce mutans streptococci in patients with dry mouth over a two week period. The delivery
      vehicle is a slowly dissolving xylitol disk (lozenge) that adheres to soft tissues inside the
      mouth. Participants will place disks on both sides of the mouth three times a day.
