      small municipality with elevated smoking rates. Up to 800 participants (one per household)
      will be able to redeem their coupon online or by phone, and receive nicotine patches via
      postal mail. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline survey containing items
      relevant to predicting smoking cessation. Participants will be asked to complete a six-month
      follow-up survey to assess changes in smoking status.

      Research Question: Will the concentrated distribution of nicotine patches in a region of high
      smoking rates lead to large reductions in smoking rates?
