    
      Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate the feasibility of magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) in
      children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with and without brain tumors.

      Specific Aim 2: Characterize the MRF signature of low-grade gliomas

      Specific Aim 3: Determine whether MRF can identify occult tumor in subjects with low-grade
      glioma.

      Specific Aim 4: Determine whether MRF can identify treatment effects in low-grade gliomas.

      Specific Aim 5: Explore whether common brain tumors can be differentiated by comparing
      pre-operative MRF signature with pathologic diagnosis.

      Outline: This study will examine the feasibility of MRF in children and AYA and determine
      whether quantitative measures of T1 and T2 relaxation times can be derived in subjects <35
      years of age. Approximately 80 subjects will be evaluated and include subgroups where MRF may
      be of particular utility, including children and AYA subjects with brain tumors and subjects
      with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Additional aims will investigate the utility of MRF in
      these groups.
