      injection therapy (MDII). In the seventies, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)
      was introduced. CSII has been gaining popularity, perhaps because of technical advances
      resulting in improved patient comfort. In children five randomised studies(1-5) were
      completed to compare MDII and CSII. No data were gained about quality of life and impact of
      disease.

      In our trial we focussed on quality of life next to metabolic control.

      The trial was an open-labelled,randomised trial. Both efficacy and safety data were
      collected. The trial started with a 14 weeks run in phase, during all patients started
      MDII.In the following randomisation phase patients were randomised to continue MDII or to
      CSII.This phase lasted 14 weeks.In the phase thereafter all patients used CSII for 14 weeks.
      The trial was concluded by a 14 weeks allocated patient preference phase.

      Patients were type 1 diabetic children 4-16 years old with poor metabolic control.hypothesis:
      better metabolic control in CSII, better quality of life in CSII.
