      morbidity and mortality in women. Work to improve epidemiological knowledge, prevention,
      screening, risk stratification and treatment of ischemic heart disease in women has a
      potential impact on all the issues listed.

      There is therefore a double challenge:

        -  A public health issue to alert the female population on cardiovascular risk and its
           consequences, while the female population does not feel concerned by the potential
           danger.

        -  A challenge for health professionals so that they have the same thing vis-Ã -vis the
           cardiovascular prevention among women and whatever their field of practice.
