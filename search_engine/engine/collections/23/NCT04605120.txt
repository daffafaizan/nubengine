      do not respond to conservative treatment. Historically, the reference technique for cervical
      fusion was the use of iliac crest autogenic bone graft (ICBG). However, the use of ICBG has
      several drawbacks, including the morbidity of the donor site, the increase in operating time
      and the variable quality of autograft. Alternatives to ICBG for cervical fusion include the
      use of allografts, graft extensions and osteobiological materials to improve fusion rates.

      This is a prospective, single arm, single center clinical study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of a Supercritical CO2 viral-inactivated allogenic bone paste in cervical interbody
      fusion. Patient eligible for 1- or 2-level ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion)
      combined with bone graft after failure of well-conducted medical treatment will be screened
      for the study.

      Subjects will be followed up postoperatively per standard of care at 3 months, 6 months, 12
      and 24 months at the clinic. The following outcomes will be measured: overall success, Neck
      Disability Index (NDI), VAS neck and arm pain, SF-12 health survey, major complications,
      subsequent surgery rate, and fusion rate on radiological examinations. The primary endpoint
      is a FDA composite definition of success comprising clinical improvement and absence of major
      complications and secondary surgery events.
