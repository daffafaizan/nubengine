      phase. Participants who met the entrance criteria, who were currently suffering from nasal
      congestion every night or almost every night, reported trouble with their sleep and had
      baseline nasal openness scores at bedtime during the qualification phase of â‰¤ 70 on a
      100-point VAS on at least four of seven qualification nights were randomized to one of two
      treatments for use at home. During the two-week in-home treatment phase, daily diaries
      measuring the perception of nasal breathing and nasal congestion using a VAS were completed.
      Participants returned to the study site after 7 and 14 days of nightly nasal strip use,
      respectively. At the two return visits, a validated subjective questionnaire, the NRQLQ,
      measured response.
