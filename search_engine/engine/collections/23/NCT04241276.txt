    
      Patients will be randomised to receive gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine +
      nab-paclitaxel + ATRA. Treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles. ATRA will be
      administered for 6 cycles whereas gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel will be administered until
      disease progression. Treatment may be discontinued earlier due to unacceptable toxicities or
      death or because the patient requests to be withdrawn from study treatment. If treatment with
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is stopped prior to the patient completing 6 cycles of treatment
      with ATRA (if allocated), the patient may continue on treatment with ATRA alone until the 6
      cycles are completed, at the discretion of the treating physician.
