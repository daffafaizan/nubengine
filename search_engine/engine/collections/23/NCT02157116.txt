      will be administered approximately 24 hours following the end of the day 1 chemotherapy
      infusion. Cycles will be repeated every 2 weeks for 3 cycles. Patients deemed to be
      resectable will undergo surgical resection followed by postoperative thoracic radiotherapy.
      Patients deemed inoperable will additionally receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Response,
      using radiographic and/or pathologic means, will identify two cohorts; responders and
      nonresponders.Gene expression profiling will then be performed on pre-treatment specimens to
      identify signatures that predict for chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance.

      The target enrollment is 45 patients.
