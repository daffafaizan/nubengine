    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group study to compare the
      efficacy of the automated abdominal binder (inflated to 40 mm Hg) versus sham treatment
      (abdominal binder inflated to 5 mm Hg) in improving orthostatic tolerance in patients with
      primary autonomic failure disabled by orthostatic hypotension.

      Potential participants will be admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center for
      evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be randomized to the
      active or sham binder group. Patients will then be asked to participate on three separate
      study days, two days apart: one day for baseline measurements (placebo pill t.i.d), one day
      for treatment with 10 mg midodrine t.i.d (standard of care), and one day for treatment with
      active or sham binder combined with placebo pill t.i.d. The order of the study days will be
      randomized. On each study day, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured while sitting,
      lying down, standing and walking during the Morning Orthostatic Trial, and posture and
      walking tests.
