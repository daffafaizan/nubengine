      manic, depressive or mixed episodes. During these episodes, formal thought disorders are
      observed, associated to emotional perturbation, behaviour troubles and some psychotic
      symptoms. During mania, the type of thought disorders observed are derailment, flight of
      ideas, with an increase in the amount of spontaneous speech and loss of goal. These
      observations of the patient's speech and language behaviour probably result from an
      underlying disturbance in semantic networks dealing with semantic associations. These
      networks have been studied extensively in schizophrenia but remain unknown in bipolar
      disorder. In this context, the aim of our study will be to have a better comprehension of
      formal thought disorders in bipolar disorder by cognitive exploration of semantic activation
      and inhibition.
