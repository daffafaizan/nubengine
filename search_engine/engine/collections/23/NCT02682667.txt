      -Immunotherapy is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. GMB investigators are
      studying immunotherapy for the treatment of diverse malignant and premalignant conditions.
      These studies require the collection of biospecimens for research purposes.

      Objectives:

        -  To collect and bank blood, apheresis products, tumor, body fluids, and other
           biospecimens from patients with cancer or a premalignant disease or at risk of cancer
           from an immunodeficiency.

        -  To collect and bank biospecimens as directed by companion GMB immunotherapy clinical
           trial protocols.

        -  To conduct nucleic acid, protein, and immunological and biological research studies on
           samples collected.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients must be 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of cancer or a premalignant
      condition or an immunodeficiency that increases the risk of being diagnosed with a cancer or
      premalignant condition.

      Design:

        -  Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled.

        -  Patients will undergo sampling of blood, apheresis products, tumor, effusions, ascites,
           urine, bone marrow, serum, plasma, skin, mucosa, or other tissues for banking and
           laboratory studies.

        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.
