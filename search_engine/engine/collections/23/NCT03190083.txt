      The primary objective of the study is to measure the frequency with which DBT alters the
      surgical plan to mastectomy versus lumpectomy. Only positive findings, like an additional
      site of cancer or DCIS, will be taken into account when estimating the frequency of changes
      to surgical management.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To measure the frequency and nature of additional findings like atypical pathology
           (Atypical ductal/ lobular hyperplasia, papilloma, Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) ,
           requiring surgical intervention).

        2. To identify variables on 2D (e.g. dense breasts, architectural distortions, non
           calcified masses) that might predict which patients would benefit from DBT.

        3. To measure the proportion of patients undergoing additional work-up following the DBT,
           and the subset of these patients with benign findings (i.e. False Positives).
