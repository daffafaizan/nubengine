      mass (LV mass) after RD using MRI, renal perfusion and renal oxygenation after RD using
      dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI)and blood oxygenation level dependent MRI (BOLD MRI),
      the evaluation of safety of RD, in terms of structural changes in the renal arteries and
      kidney using Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Secondly the evaluation of changes in
      various biological functions assessed by analysis of blood and/or urine samples. Thirdly the
      quantification of changes in blood pressure. Finally the changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV)
      and heart rate variability (HRV).

      Study design: Observational exploratory-study.

      Study population: Adults with a systolic BP ≥160 mmHg (≥150 mmHg for type 2 diabetics) with a
      stable drug regimen including 3 or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic,
      or inability to follow a stable drug regimen due to unacceptable side-effects of
      antihypertensive medication.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The effect of RD on: radiological variables: left
      ventricular wall mass, renal perfusion, renal oxygenation and the anatomy of the renal
      arteries. Secondly the effect of RD on biological variables assessed by analysis of blood
      and/or urine samples. Thirdly the changes in blood pressure. Finally the changes in PWV and
      HRV after RD.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The risks associated with the tests and procedures performed for the clinical
      study are limited. There are no known risks associated with MRI when appropriate safety
      guidelines are followed. Based on the experience form our previous studies, we do not expect
      any potential risks regarding the cessation of anti-hypertensives.
