    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two dosing regimens of MN-001 in patients with Interstitial Cystitis
      (IC). Patients will be screened for study eligibility within seven to nine days of
      randomization. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 500 mg
      MN-001 bid, 500 mg MN-001 once daily or placebo. Patients will be dispensed study drug
      beginning at Baseline (Visit 2) and will return to the study center for Visit 3 (28 days ± 2
      days after Baseline), and Visit 4 (56 days ± 2 days after Baseline), at end of study for
      safety and efficacy assessments. The patient will be contacted by telephone at Week 6 (42
      days ± 2 days after Baseline) for an interim follow up. Study drug will be dispensed at
      Visits 2 and 3. Safety assessments will include adverse events, physical examinations,
      clinical laboratory testing, and changes in vital signs. Efficacy assessments include
      percentage of patients at least "moderately improved" for each treatment group using the
      patient reported Global Response Assessment (GRA) (see Appendix 1). Secondary assessments
      include a decrease in bladder pain/urgency based on change in the patient rating from
      baseline to endpoint using the GRA (see Appendix 1), modified Pelvic Pain and
      Urgency/Frequency (PUF) Patient Symptom Scale (see Appendix 2) and the O'Leary Sant IC
      Symptom and Problem Index.
