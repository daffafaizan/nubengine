      amyloid-imaging using F18-based PET-tracers have become a part of the diagnostic repertoire
      in specialized memory clinics allowing a neurobiological, biomarker-based validation of
      Alzheimer´s disease (AD) diagnosis. This has led to a substantial increase in the specificity
      of the diagnostic procedure. However, the problem remains that the diverse factors, which
      influence disease progression are largely unknown, while tools for diagnosis have improved
      substantially.

      We will identify patients for participation in a long-term clinical follow up study.
      Biomaterial (CSF, blood) will be obtained at baseline and subjected to a detailed protein
      analysis. In a subset of patients, a lumbar puncture will be repeated to compare baseline and
      follow up CSF. Within this study, a panel of proteins, comprising Aβ- and Tau-species as well
      as inflammation, glial and synaptic markers, potentially involved in disease progression will
      be measured in biomaterial from baseline and from follow up assessment. Clinical data will be
      correlated with the panel of disease and progression markers.
