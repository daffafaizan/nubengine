      administration of an Edmonston strain measles virus genetically engineered to express human
      thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) (oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium
      iodide symporter [MV-NIS]) in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck
      cancer. II. To determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral administration of MV-NIS in
      patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer and metastatic breast
      cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of
      this approach by following, radiographic response, and time to progression. TERTIARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination
      and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with
      MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT)
      imaging. II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence
      following intratumoral administration. III. To determine humoral and cellular immune response
      to the injected virus. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oncolytic
      measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intratumorally (IT) on day 1. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1
      year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
