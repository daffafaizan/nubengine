      For the pathogenesis of inner ear hydrops resulting in Meniere's attacks, plasma vasopressin
      elevation due to stress and V2 receptor overexpression in the inner ear could be essential as
      a basis of this disease. In the present study, we'd like to find the effective and feasible
      way to reduce plasma vasopressin level in patients with Meniere's disease.

      METHODS:

      We estimate to enroll 200 Meniere's patients to four study groups in a randomized controlled
      trial at Osaka University Hospital during this study period 2010-2015. Patients are diagnosed
      as Meniere's patients according to the 1995 AAO-HNS criteria. Group-I consists of 50 patients
      who receive just traditional oral intake medication including anti-diuretics. Group-II
      consists of 50 patients who receive both medication and water intake (at least 2.0 litters
      per day). Group-III consists of 50 patients who receive both medication and tympanic tubing
      (under local anesthesia). Group-IV consists of 50 patients who receive both medication and
      sleep well (regular sleep program under dark everynight). Additional factors to medication in
      each group are supposed to have influence on hypothalamus. We follow up all these patients at
      least 12 months and evaluate stress, psychological and dizziness conditions using a couple of
      questionnaires. We also examine changes in plasma vasopressin level of patients in each
      group.

      ESTIMATED RESULTS:

      Through this study, we can understand the most effective and feasible way to reduce plasma
      vasopressin level in patients with Meniere's disease. Much more Meniere's patients may be
      rescued without invasive surgery.
