    
      This is a 36 month exploratory Investigational Study compliant with the NSF Human Subjects
      regulations (45 CFR 690) trialing a new device for the SCI populations to aid in ambulatory
      function in a home setting. Ekso Bionics will enable up to twelve (12) subjects with SCI to
      use an Ekso device in their home for a 12-month period. Qualified subjects will help Ekso
      Bionics determine the practical use of the device in the home environment and will enable
      Ekso Bionics to gather data to develop a device for use in a home environment. The study will
      require a trained spotter to be present at all times that the device is being used. The study
      will also evaluate the effectiveness of a non-medically licensed spotter to assist the
      subject.
