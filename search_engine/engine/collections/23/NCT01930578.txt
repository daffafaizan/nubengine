      to the volume of fluid within the body. The acute change in fluid status of the human body
      alters the body resistance. This change can be measured accurately with bioelectrical
      impedance and previous experiments confirmed this observation. However, previous experiments
      using a piglet model and subsequently humans, suggested that the changes observed is a result
      of changes in salt instead of body water.

      An experiment has shown that bioimpedance analysis (BIA) was able to detect changes in total
      body resistance when different electrolyte solutions were infused. The changes in resistance
      were related to changes in osmolarity and electro-ionic state, not to volume of water
      infused. Therefore, BIA measures principally the electro-ionic state. Thus a measurement of
      fluid volume can be indirectly obtained from BIA. However, in the non-steady state such as
      acute fluid volume expansion, the measurement of water volume cannot be performed accurately.

      In this study, we will be administering sodium bromide in oder to measure extracellular water
      via the bromide solution technique. Despite the interesting observations, the human study
      described above was underpowered. Therefore, we aim to validate the observations that have
      been previously made through carrying out an appropriately powered study with an adequate
      sample size to validate the observations noted.
