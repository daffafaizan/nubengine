      guardians giving written informed consent will be screened for study eligibility. Patients
      who meet the eligibility requirements will participate in a 16-week, flexibly-dosed,
      open-label trial of buspirone. The dose of buspirone will be adjusted over the first 12 weeks
      of the study and a stable dose will be maintained for the final four weeks of the trial.
      Adverse effects will be reviewed at each visit and standardized measures of anxiety will be
      conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16.
