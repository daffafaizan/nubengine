      (DVT), is a major health problem in the world. There have been many clinical studies
      evaluating PE and/or proximal DVT, although data on isolated distal DVT (IDDVT) has been
      quite limited. However, IDDVT was reported to account for about half of all the diagnoses of
      DVT detected on ultrasound in daily clinical practice, and optimal management strategies for
      these patients are becoming clinically more relevant. The current American College of Chest
      Physicians (ACCP) guidelines suggest the same approach for IDDVT patients with cancer as
      proximal DVT patients with cancer. However, whether anticoagulation therapy should be
      continued indefinitely remains uncertain and the duration of treatment in these patients
      might vary widely in daily clinical practice. Recently, some observational studies reported
      that IDDVT patients with cancer have a high risk of VTE recurrence, suggesting the benefit of
      prolonged anticoagulation therapy. In this open-label, superiority trial, we will randomly
      assign IDDVT patients with active cancer to receive either edoxaban for 3 months (short DOAC
      group) or edoxaban for 12 months (long DOAC group).
