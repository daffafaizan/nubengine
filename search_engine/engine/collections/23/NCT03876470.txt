      cascade before and after implementation of the collaborative care model. Additionally,
      participants will complete questionnaires at three time points: at the initiation of
      hepatitis C treatment, at treatment completion, and at the assessment of sustained virologic
      response. Questionnaires will assess quality of life, mental health, chronic liver disease
      outcomes, and substance use. A subset of participants will also complete semi-structured
      interviews at each of the three time points. Then, a smaller subset of participants will be
      selected for a detailed ethnographic case study focusing on treatment experiences, quality of
      life, forms of social support, and illness experience.
