    
      1. Select 8 hospitals to form a multi-center team, and enter the keyword "mitral valve
           replacement" in the case system of 8 hospitals to collect information on 2000 heart
           surgery patients.

        2. Mainly collect information on preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative test
           indexes (blood routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation function, blood gas),
           cardiac color Doppler, blood transfusion and prognosis of patients undergoing cardiac
           surgery, using statistical methods for analysis. Identify key observations.

        3. Gradually incorporate and exclude data, and use statistical methods to conduct
           preliminary analysis on the collected data.

      The AI prediction model was established by machine learning algorithm to predict
      intraoperative blood transfusion, verify the specificity and sensitivity of the blood
      transfusion prediction model, and scientifically guide clinical blood use.
