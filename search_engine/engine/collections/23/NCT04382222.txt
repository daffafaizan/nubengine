      0,4-1,3% at birth. Although prenatal detection rates vary widely, morphological (structural)
      cardiac malformations are among the most frequently missed abnormalities by prenatal
      ultrasonography.

      However, identifying fetal cardiac abnormalities early in pregnancy is essential. Early
      diagnosis allows extensive cardiac ultrasound, genetic testing and planning delivery in a
      paediatric-cardiac centre offering optimal neonatal care.

      It also may allow the future parents to consider and decide for a termination of pregnancy in
      case of a severe fetal heart malformation with poor prognosis.

      The investigator conducts a retrospective study on 2500 cases of congenital heart diseases
      over 20 years. Detailed data for this were made available by the EUROCAT Antwerp registry, a
      population-based database with controlled, reliable and robust data.

      The study wants to reveal the prevalence and prenatal diagnostic sensitivity of congenital
      heart defects in the EUROCAT regions Antwerp (Flanders) and especially the evolution of the
      prenatal diagnostic rate over time.

      In the second phase, a similar study in two adjacent regions, Hainaut (Wallonia, Belgium) and
      Groningen (The Netherlands) will follow.

      On condition of correct statistic processing, these data will be suitable to compare the
      prevalence and to benchmark diagnostic rates of congenital heart defects in these three
      regions.
