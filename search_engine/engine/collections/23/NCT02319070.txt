      episodically on demand (OD) for the treatment of acute bleeds or prophylactically to prevent
      them.

      The last years there has been an interest to study the comparative effectiveness of OD vs. SP
      (Secondary Prophylaxis) treatment strategies so as to create an evidence based platform to
      guide both clinical decision making and quantify the economic aspects of each treatment
      alternative. In Greece relevant information is lacking, thus it is imperative to study how
      patients on different treatment strategies are managed in a real-life setting in Greece,
      including the main factors associated with increased health care utilization, clinical
      success and patient well being.
