      was achieved in 68% of group 1 patients and 75% of group 2 patients (NS). All-causes death
      and cirrhosis-related death were not different in group 1 and group 2 patients: the five-year
      survival rate was 58% in group 1 and 69% in group 2 patients (NS). Through multivariate
      analysis, the independent predictors of long-term survival were absence of ongoing alcohol
      consumption (p<0.001), recovery from Pugh C (p=0.046), and baseline Pugh score<8 (p=0.029).
      Liver transplantation was associated with a higher rate of de novo malignancies (30.4% vs.
      7.8%, OR=5.1, p=0.001).
