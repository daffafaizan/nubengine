      determine the patients' prognosis. Most patients have hemodynamical changes in circulation
      with increased cardiac output and decreased systolic function in stress. Endothelial
      dysfunction is a parameter for bad prognosis in cardiovascular disease. The
      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system plays an important role in natrium and volume
      regulation. Descriptions of changes in the peripheral circulation and oxygenation have been
      deficient up to now.

      Patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are betablockers and/or aldosterone
      antagonists routine treatment - effects on peripheral hemodynamics and oxygenation in
      relation to central hemodynamic changes are deficient.
