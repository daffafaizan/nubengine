      group, per subject one site). Control group consisted of the sites treated with OFD and test
      groups sites were treated with OFD with autologous PRF or PRF with SMV. Site-specific plaque
      index (PI), sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL)
      and intrabony defect (IBD) depth reduction was measured at baseline and 9 month after
      surgery.
