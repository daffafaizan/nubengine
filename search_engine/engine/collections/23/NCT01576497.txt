      syringe was provided as same performance. However, one syringe is falsely made as suction
      syringe (fake one). During EUS-FNA, two syringe is randomly assigned and loaded by a nurse.
      Thus, operator was blinded which syringe is with suction or without suction.

      First hypothesis: There is difference in the diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic masses
      according to EUS-FNA with suction or without suction/ different number of to-and-fro motion.

      Second hypothesis: There is difference in the amount of blood in samples obtained by EUS-FNA
      with suction or without suction/ different number of to-and-fro motion.
