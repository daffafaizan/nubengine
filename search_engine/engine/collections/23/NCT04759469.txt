      (HIIT) and moderate-intensity interval training (MIIT) effect on functional capacity (as a
      cardiorespiratory parameter), and on glucose control and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (as
      metabolic parameters) in T2D patients, and to test exercise acceptability within these
      patients. Methods: 60 participants had participated in this study. Their ages ranged from 45
      to 65 years. They were randomized into two equal groups (30/group); group (A) did HIIT and
      group (B) did MIIT. Both groups received 12 weeks of training. Measurements for six minute
      walking distance (6MWD), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and HbA1C levels were done before and
      after the study. Physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) were filled by the patients by the
      end of the study; testing exercise enjoyment.
