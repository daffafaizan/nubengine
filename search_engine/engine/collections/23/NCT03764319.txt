    
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a rigorous low breathing frequency and
      ultra-low tidal volume ventilation strategy on clinical outcome, compared to standard
      ventilator settings following the recent guidelines in patients with severe ARDS treated with
      ECMO.

      The hypothesis is that a low breathing frequency and ultra-low tidal volume ventilation
      strategy is more protective for the ARDS challenged lung and reduces the duration of
      mechanical ventilation and so increases the ventilator free days in patients with severe ARDS
      treated with ECMO.
