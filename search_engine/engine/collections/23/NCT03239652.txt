      Furthermore, investigator's microspheres has advantageous characteristics in
      biodegradability, drug delivery capability, and cost-effectiveness. After the clinical trial,
      we anticipate introducing a new microsphere for Lower Urinary Tract Symptom/Benign prostatic
      hyperplasia patients, which is beneficial to the participants in precise medicine as well as
      in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry.
