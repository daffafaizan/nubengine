      24-week study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) as additional
      medication to Methotrexate (MTX) in Chinese subjects with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
      who have an incomplete response to Methotrexate. This study is designed to determine whether
      CZP 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) in combination
      with MTX demonstrates superiority, in terms of greater improvement in relief of the signs and
      symptoms of RA, compared with MTX alone. Approximately 535 subjects will be screened to
      randomize 400 subjects into this study, at approximately 25 centers in the People's Republic
      of China. There will be 2 treatment groups, with 300 subjects in the CZP+MTX group and 100
      subjects in the PBO+MTX group. For each subject, the study duration will last a maximum of
      approximately 38 weeks. Subjects who complete study RA0044 and subjects who fail to achieve
      an American College of Rheumatology 20 % Response Criteria (ACR20) response at Week 12 that
      is confirmed at Week 14 and thus are withdrawn from this study at Week 16, are permitted to
      receive treatment with CZP in the open-label extension study, RA0078. The secondary
      objectives are to assess the dose regimen of CZP in combination with MTX compared with MTX
      alone in the safety and tolerability, ability to improve physical function, and health
      outcomes measures in Chinese subjects with active RA; also to characterize the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and immunogenicity of CZP in combination with MTX.
