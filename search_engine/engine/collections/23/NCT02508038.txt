    
      CONDITIONING REGIMENS: Patients with high-risk leukemia will receive myeloablative
      conditioning with anti-thymocyte globulin intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days -12
      through -9, Fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 through -5, Thiotepa IV every every 12
      hours on day -4 and Total Body Irradiation (TBI) on days -3 through -1. All other patients
      receive reduced intensity conditioning consisting of anti-thymocyte globulin intravenously
      (IV) over 4-6 hours on days -12 through -9, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 through
      -5, thiotepa IV over 4 hours every 12 hours on day -4, and melphalan IV on days -3 and -2.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TCR-alpha/beta+ and CD19+
      depleted KIR/KIR ligand-mismatched haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation on day 0. If the graft contains less than 4 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, a second
      HSC graft may be administered.

      PROPHYLAXIS FOR GVHD: Patients receiving a graft containing > 25 x 10^3 CD3+ TCR alpha/beta+
      cells receive mycophenolate mofetil IV twice daily over 2 hours on days 1 to 30 with a rapid
      taper. Patients with TCR alpha/beta+ cells exceeding 100,000/kg also receive tacrolimus IV
      continuously or orally (PO) every 12 hours on days 0-90 with a taper at the discretion of the
      Principal Investigator.

      ZOLEDRONATE ADMINISTRATION: Patients will receive five doses of Zoledronate (IV) at 28 day
      intervals beginning on Day +28 post-HSCT.

      Follow-up assessments will occur after transplantation.
