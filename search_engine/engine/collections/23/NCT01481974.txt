      important advance toward the goal of reducing transplant related morbidity, mortality and
      associated costs by minimizing the effect of ischemia and re perfusion injury of the liver
      graft. Additionally, the reduction in serum creatinine and reduced need for post operative
      dialysis observed in some studies has implications in protecting the kidneys from the
      nephrotoxic affects of the immunosuppressant agents, especially during the early
      post-operative period. Routine use of prostaglandins (PGE1 and PGI2), however, was limited by
      its instability and short half life.

      Treprostinil, as a prostanoid (prostacyclin analog), is expected to facilitate restoration of
      the blood supply to the revascularized graft and provide the well-characterized protective
      effects of this class of compounds in liver transplant patients. Treprostinil has the
      advantage of a longer elimination half-life than other prostanoids previously tested in these
      patients. Treprostinil is expected to significantly protect the graft from ischemia and re
      perfusion injury.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of
      Treprostinil in orthotopic liver transplant patients as a first step to evaluate its use in
      prevention of ischemia and reperfusion injury of the grafted liver.
