      Primary

        -  Estimate the objective response rate in patients receiving vinflunine and cetuximab as
           second-line therapy for stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of overall response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive vinflunine IV over 15-20 minutes on day 1 and cetuximab IV over 60-120
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease may receive
      additional courses beyond 4 courses at the discretion of the principal investigator.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 6 months.
