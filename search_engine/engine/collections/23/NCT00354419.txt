      I. The objective of this study is to determine the lowest dose of total body irradiation
      combined with cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin that will achieve sustained
      engraftment in patients with severe aplastic anemia transplanted with unrelated umbilical
      cord blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of total-body irradiation (TBI).

      MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 to -4, -6
      to -3, or -5 to -2 and antithymocyte globulin IV on days -6 to -4, -5 to -3, or -4 to -2.

      TBI: Patients undergo TBI twice daily on days -3, -2, and/or -1.

      UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANTATION (UCBT): Patients undergo UCBT on day 0. Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts
      recover.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally (twice
      daily for patients >= 6 years of age or 3 times daily for patients < 6 years of age) on days
      -1 to +180 and mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally (twice daily for patients >= 50 kg or 3
      times daily for patients < 50 kg) beginning 4 hours after UCBT and continuing until
      approximately day +0.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
