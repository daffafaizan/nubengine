    
      AB-SA01 consists of three bacteriophages (viruses) that target Staphylococcus aureus
      bacteria.

      The safety of AB-SA01 will be assessed when topically administered once daily to the volar
      aspect of the forearm at a dose of 10^8 plaque forming units (PFU) per phage for 3
      consecutive days, and then at a dose of 10^9 plaque forming units (PFU) per phage for 3
      consecutive days. Both AB-SA01 and placebo will be administered to each subject to provide
      his/her own control for evaluation of skin reactions. The right or left placement of the
      placebo will be randomized and double-blinded.
