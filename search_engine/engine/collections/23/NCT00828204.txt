      using a prefilled syringe, followed by 3 Avonex injections using the single-use autoinjector.
      The Extension Study was designed to provide continuation of treatment with the Avonex
      single-use autoinjector to eligible participants who completed the Main Study for up to an
      additional 12 weeks, and to obtain additional safety and preference data for the Avonex
      single-use autoinjector.

      Participants were enrolled under the initial study protocol (Initial Subject Subset); the
      study was subsequently suspended. Changes were made to the protocol (including modifications
      to the autoinjector needle), and additional participants were enrolled (Main Subject Subset).
