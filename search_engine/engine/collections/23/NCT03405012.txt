    
      Study Design:

      This is an observational, open-label, non-randomised, single centre, 48-week study to explore
      the utility of a novel scanning platform exploring bone turnover during an immediate or
      deferred (for 48 weeks) switch from Eviplera® to Odefsey® in HIV-1 infected men aged 40 years
      or older, and stable on Eviplera®.

      Participants:

      HIV-1-infected males, aged ≥40 years, on Eviplera® >24 weeks, with plasma HIV RNA (pVL)
      <50cp/mL and without any known history of osteoporosis.

      Groups to be Compared: 1. HIV-1-infected males aged ≥40, stable on Eviplera® (rilpivirine
      (RPV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) and remaining on EvipleraÒ for
      48 weeks on study; 2. HIV-1-infected males aged ≥40 years, switched to Odefsey®
      (RPV/FTC/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)) at study enrollment.

      Study Hypothesis: We hypothesis that there will be ongoing subclinical loss of bone at the
      hip and lumbar spine as measured by 18F-fluoride-PET/CT in those remaining of Eviplera®, and
      in those switching to Odefsey® there will be reversal of some of this subclinical loss at 24
      and 48 weeks post switch.

      Primary Outcome Measure(s):To determine the change in regional bone formation at the hip and
      lumbar spine as measured by 18F-fluoride-PET/CT at 24 weeks post switch from Eviplera® to
      Odefsey®.

      Secondary Outcome Measure(s): 1. Change in regional bone formation at the hip and lumbar
      spine as measured by 18F-fluoride-PET/CT at 48 weeks post switch from Eviplera® to Odefsey®;
      2. Assess safety and tolerability of switching to Odefsey®; 3. To compare DXA changes at the
      hip and lumbar spine to those detected on 18F-fluoride-PET/CT; 4. Measure changes in
      plasma/serum bone biomarkers over 24 and 48 weeks; 5. To measure the changes in FRAX® score
      at week 48.
