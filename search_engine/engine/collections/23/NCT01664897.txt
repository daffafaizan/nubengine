      I. To assess the efficacy of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with refractory
      or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of erlotinib in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate inhibitory effect of this drug on spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and its
      down-stream targets such as mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (JNK), mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk).

      II. To evaluate its role in janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) pathway and to investigate erlotinib-mediated cell death and/or
      differentiation.

      III. To quantitate concentrations of plasma erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
