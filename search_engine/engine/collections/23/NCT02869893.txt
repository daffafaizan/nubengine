      which leads to loss of acinar volume and secretory capacity, and ultimately pancreatic
      insufficiency (PI). CP and congenital PI affect the pediatric population, and are both
      increasingly recognized in children. PI has serious negative implications on a child's growth
      and health but, if diagnosed early, PI can be treated, minimizing the detrimental effects of
      PI. Currently, direct pancreatic function testing (PFT) via collection of pancreatic fluid is
      the "gold standard" for diagnosis of PI but it is an invasive testing that may require
      sedation or general anesthesia. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) with
      secretin administration (MR-PFT) and MR elastography (MRE) may allow non-invasive, and
      potentially early diagnosis of CP and PI. Currently, however, normative data with which to
      compare MR-PFT and MRE results in pediatric patients with suspected CP/PI is not available.

      Aims: The investigators propose to determine the normal range for secreted pancreatic fluid
      volume in response to secretin administration and determine the normal range for pancreatic
      parenchymal stiffness in a pediatric population that is not affected by pancreatic disease.
      To date, the investigators have validated their MRCP technique and have successfully
      performed both MR-PFT and MRE in CP patients; however normative data is essential for
      validation of our non-invasive technique.
