      the disease are coming forward with continuing effects of the disease over a month, with
      chronic complaints like mental fog, delayed latent periods in recalling events of recent
      past, tachycardia, extreme fatigue, inability to perform daily physical tasks and likely to
      develop stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger and frustration.
      This condition is defined as post-COVID-19 syndrome and increasingly affecting a high number
      of people as the pandemic evolves.

      The post-COVID-19 syndrome has become a usual situation in the evolutionary course of the
      disease with its own entity. The National Health Service (NHS) of UK has recently published a
      clinical guide for long-term management of the effects of COVID-19 with a comprehensive plan
      for the assessment and care of patients who present or develop symptoms from the fourth week
      after diagnosis.

      The effective long-term management of the effects of COVID-19 is a challenge that requires
      awareness. The RECOVE project aims at determining the role of exercise in the treatment of
      post-COVID-19 syndrome ambulatory patients.
