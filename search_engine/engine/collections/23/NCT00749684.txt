      high-dose therapy scheme with interferon-α-2b (IntronA®):

      Adjuvant treatment with interferon-α-2 has been demonstrated in a number of studies to have
      an antiproliferative effect on malignant melanoma. In these cases a response rate of up to
      20% could be achieved with a dose of 10 million IU or more 3x/week or daily. Kirkwood et al.
      showed in a study carried out in ECOG (the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, study no.
      1684) that there was a clear and significant survival advantage versus the observation group
      with the following dose:

      20 mio IU/m² interferon-α-2b (IntronA®) 5x/week iv over the course of one month followed by
      11 months with 10 mio IU/m² 3x/week sc.
