      the K3 Promoter on traumatic/congenital amputees and dysvascular/diabetic amputees.
      Assessments will be made after a 30-day accommodation period with each foot prosthesis. In
      order to randomize the treatment and factor out habituation to the testing site and the
      protocol, two cohorts will be used. Half of the volunteers will be randomly assigned to be
      fitted with the K3 Promoter by their regular prosthetist or will continue wearing their
      current foot prothesis. Both cohorts will have a 30-day accommodation period. Subjects in
      either cohort will then visit the CGMA to be tested. Volunteers will then use the other
      prosthesis for 30 days. After that second 30-day period, height and weight will again be
      recorded, and the tests will be repeated. Because of anticipated difficulty with scheduling,
      volunteers will be given a +3 day grace period on the 30 day-accommodation time.
