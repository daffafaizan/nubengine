      peri-implantitis at a private dental clinic in Stavanger, Norway. Forty patients diagnosed
      with peri-implantitis on at least one implant will be randomly allocated by tossing a coin
      into test or control group. Patients with cement-retained and screw-retained
      supraconstructions will be included.

      Treatment of peri-implantitis will be performed by one operator (AS) at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-
      and 12-month follow-up visits. Local anesthesia will be used when needed. In the test group,
      implants will be treated with titanium curette, ultrasonic device and a specially designed
      nozzle mounted on a hand piece (Perio-Flow) connected to an airflow unit.

      In the control group, implant with peri-implantitis will be debrided with titanium curette
      and ultrasonic device only. Test and control debridement will be performed without time
      limit. The treatment will continue until the operator is judging the implant surface to be
      free for supra- and subgingival deposits.
