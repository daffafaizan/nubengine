    
      This study is a prospective, randomized crossover study. The primary aim of this study is to
      assess the safety and effectiveness of using the Hyper-CL™ lens +salt solution (5% NaCl) as
      compared with using regular contact lens + salt solution (5% NaCl) in subjects suffering from
      corneal edema. Safety will be assessed by evaluating the rate of adverse events and adverse
      device effects occurred throughout the study period. Effectiveness will be assessed by
      measuring changes in corneal thickness and visual acuity.

      Subjects with corneal edema will be the study population. Only subjects who have signed the
      informed consent form and meet all the eligibility criteria listed below will be qualified
      for enrollment. The study will encompass a total of up to 80 subjects who will complete the
      Protocol follow-up schedule.

      Each subject will be treated with:

      Treatment A: Hyper-CL™ lens + salt solution + antibiotics drops (7 days) Treatment B: Regular
      soft contact lens +salt solution+ antibiotics drops (7 days) One week (7 days) of washout
      without any treatment will be between treatments. Subject will be equally allocated to one of
      the following 2 crossover regimen based on a randomization scheme with blocks stratified by
      center: A-B; B-A
