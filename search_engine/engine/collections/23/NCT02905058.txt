      proposed including NSAIDs, anxiolytics, and local anesthetics in the form of intracervical
      gel, cervical and para-cervical block, but there have not done enough studies about their
      effectiveness. According to the review published in the Cochrane, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and misoprostol are not effective on reducing an IUD insertion pain.
