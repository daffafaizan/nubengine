      reduce the progression of metabolic syndrome to chronic diseases such as coronary heart
      disease. The rationale for conducting this research study is that there are few effective
      strategies that target changes in body composition and metabolism as a means to attenuate
      metabolic syndrome. The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the
      overall objective of this research by pursuing the following three specific aims.

      Specific Aim 1: Quantify the extent that linoleic acid reduces trunk adipose mass in women
      with metabolic syndrome.

      Specific Aim 2: Measure changes in visceral adipose tissue

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the time-dependent effect of linoleic acid to increase adiponectin
      levels.
