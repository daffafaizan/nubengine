      study began with an initial two-week observation period. Subjects then were randomly assigned
      to one arm of the study for 5 weeks. The carbohydrate:protein:fat ratio for the control diet
      is 55:15:30 whereas for the test diet it is 40:30:30. Following a five-week washout period,
      subjects were assigned to the other arm of the study. All meals were provided by the SDTU. A
      six-day rotating meal plan has been devised. At the beginning and end of the 5-week diet
      period, the subject was admitted to the SDTU (Special Diagnostic and Treatment Unit), was
      provided with the meals appropriate for the test or control arm of the study, and had blood
      drawn at various times during a 24-hour period. In addition to measurement of GH and IGF-1,
      IGF-binding proteins 1 and 3, ghrelin, and body composition were determined.
