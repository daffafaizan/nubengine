    
      This is a multi- centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial in
      participants aged 18 to 65 years with chronic liver disease. It is designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of both 4.5mg and 6mg of GRI-0621 when administered once
      daily for 28 days.

      A total of 60 participants will be randomised to received 4.5mg or 6mg of GRI-0621 or
      matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The investigational product will be administered orally
      once daily in the morning for a duration of 28 days. Participants will return to the clinic
      for follow-up safety and efficacy assessments on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additionally, PK
      sampling will be performed on Days 7 and 28, and samples for immunological assays to assess
      the activity of NKT cells will be drawn on Days 0 (baseline) and 28. An end-of-trial
      follow-up visit will be performed 14 days after the last dose of the investigational product
      on Day 42.

      The primary efficacy objective will be measured by the change from baseline to Day 28 in
      serum ALT levels. The baseline ALT level will be calculated as the mean of the Day -7 to -1
      and Day 0 serum ALT results.

      Safety and tolerability will be measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events and
      changes in physical examination findings, physical measurements, vital signs, ECG findings
      and standard laboratory safety parameters (including hematology, clinical chemistry,
      coagulation parameters and urinalysis).
