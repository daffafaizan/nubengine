      routine breast MRI examination at MSKCC. This will add extra 10 min scanning time to the
      routine examination. High resolution (submillimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic
      quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular
      volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE MRI data. These results will be correlated
      with pathology to determine new pharmacokinetic threshold so that the negative predictive
      value for benign lesions is close to 100%. The improvement in diagnostic specificity may help
      to reduce unnecessary biopsies in the future.
