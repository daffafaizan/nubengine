        -  Compare the response rates in pediatric cancer patients with treatment-related
           neurocognitive sequelae treated with dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall-XR®) vs
           methylphenidate (Concerta®).

        -  Compare the durability of response at 12 weeks in patients who show a response at 3
           weeks after treatment with these drugs.

        -  Determine whether patients who have no response to one of these study drugs can respond
           to the other study drug.

        -  Determine the prevalence of depression and possible response to neurostimulant therapy
           in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dextroamphetamine-amphetamine once daily for 3 weeks.
           Patients who achieve response (based on neurocognitive testing) continue treatment for a
           total of 12 weeks. Patients with no response after 3 weeks cross over to arm II after a
           48-hour washout period.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral methylphenidate once daily for 3 weeks. Responding
           patients continue treatment for a total of 12 weeks. Patients with no response after 3
           weeks cross over to arm I after a 48-hour washout period.

      Depression and neurocognitive function are assessed at baseline, 3 weeks, and end of study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 177 patients (approximately 88 per treatment arm) will be
      accrued for this study within 3 years.
