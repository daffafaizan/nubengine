    
      NEFECON is an add-on treatment to other medications for nephropathy symptoms and kidney
      function, including ACEI and/or ARBs. Rigorous blood pressure control will be achieved over a
      6-month Run-in Phase in which ACEI and/or ARB will be dosed to target a blood pressure of
      <130/80 mm Hg and UPCR <0.5 g/g. Patients who complete the Run-in Phase, and despite
      optimized ACEI and/or ARB therapy, have a UPCR ≥0.5 g/g OR urine protein ≥0.75 g/24hr will be
      eligible for randomization and entry into the treatment phase of the trial. Patients will
      remain on their ACEI and/or ARB dosing regimen for the duration of the trial.

      Patients entering the treatment phase will be administered NEFECON (8 mg/day OR 16 mg/day) OR
      placebo for a phase of 9 months. A 3-month follow-up phase will follow on from the treatment
      phase, of which the first 2 weeks will be used to taper the dose of those patients that
      received 16 mg/day dosing to 8 mg/day, with the placebo and 8 mg/day groups receiving placebo
      to retain blinding.
