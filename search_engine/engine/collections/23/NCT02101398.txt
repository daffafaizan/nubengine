      however some aspects as the positioning of the electrodes on the head are still unclear. That
      is why we compare the effects of four different positionings of the electrodes (two anterior
      over Broca's area and its homologue and two posterior over Wernicke's area and its homologue)
      to a sham stimulation in order to observe if a more important effect of one or another
      positioning could be found.
