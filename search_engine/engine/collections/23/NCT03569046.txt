      mastoidectomy) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized into two equal groups (40
      patients each). A standardized general anesthetic technique was used in both groups. Group I,
      received general anesthesia combined with ear block using 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine and
      (Group II), received general anesthesia alone combined with ear block using 10 ml saline.
      Propofol 2-3 mg /Kg was administered to induce anesthesia, which was maintained using
      isoflurane. Hemodynamic variables, surgical conditions including the quality of the operative
      field, intraoperative fentanyl, vasodilators (propranolol and nitroglycerine), isoflurane
      consumption, recovery time, postoperative pain, total analgesics consumption and
      postoperative complications were recorded
