    
      Design: CCTG 594 is a controlled, unblinded, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a clinic-based HIV ALERT specialist on improving endpoints of
      retention in care and maintenance of ART as compared to the current standard of care (SoC) in
      HIV primary care clinics.

      Duration: Each subject will receive follow-up of at least 48 weeks.

      Sample Size: A total of 300 subjects will be randomized, 150 per arm.

      Study Population: Eligible subjects will include 1) newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals
      entering primary HIV care at one of the CCTG clinics, or 2) previously diagnosed HIV-infected
      individuals who are "out of care" defined as having no visit with a prescribing HIV provider
      in the last 180 days and not on a stable ARV regimen.

      Stratification: Subjects will be stratified based on study site and if they are newly
      diagnosed or returning to care.
