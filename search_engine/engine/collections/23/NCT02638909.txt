    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study of ceritinib in adult patients
      with ALK- and ROS1 activated colorectal, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, hepatic, gastric, or
      esophageal adenocarcinoma. An estimated 500 patients will be screened for ALK and ROS1 by
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) per institutional
      standard of care (SOC), and/or ALK/ROS1 by next-generation sequencing (NGS). At least 30
      identified patients will be treated with ceritinib per protocol. Treatment with ceritinib
      will continue until patient experiences unacceptable toxicity that precludes further
      treatment, discontinues treatment at the discretion of the investigator or patient, starts a
      new anticancer therapy and/or dies.

      Male and female patients aged 18 or over that have colorectal adenocarcinoma,
      cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, hepatocellular, gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma that
      contain an activated ALK gene due to rearrangement, mutation, amplification, translocation or
      other mechanisms. Patients must have been pretreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
