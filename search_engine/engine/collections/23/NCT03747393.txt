      knee OA. The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines leaves open the question of the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early referral to PT alongside the core set of
      management strategies for patients with knee OA. Prior studies have failed to include robust
      cost-effectiveness analyses to understand the policy implications of a recommendation to
      routinely refer patients with knee OA to PT in addition to implementing the core set of
      recommended management strategies. A comparative effectiveness parallel-group randomized
      controlled clinical trial examining these questions will be extremely informative for future
      updates of the VA/DoD Practice Guideline.

      The core components of the clinical practice guidelines include education on nutrition and
      the role of obesity in OA, as well as the role of physical activity and exercise. The
      physical therapy component will be based on best current evidence, and consist of manual
      therapy, education for self-management, and exercise.
