      in poor compliance with chemotherapy. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists prevent vomiting in
      acute phase emesis after chemotherapy in 73 - 92% of cisplatin-treated patients when
      coadministered with steroids, but they appear to lack efficacy in the delayed phase emesis.
      Ramosetron, a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, has been shown to have equivalent efficacy and
      tolerability and a longer duration of effect than granisetron in preventing acute vomiting in
      patients undergoing cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Acute phase emesis was prevented in
      84.8% of patients receiving ramosetron plus dexamethasone, but the CR rate of total phase
      emesis was less than 60%.
