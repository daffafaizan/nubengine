      physiological indicators after training with the Bubble positive expiratory pressure (Bubble
      PEP) inpatients with COPD. This is a randomization control trial design survey using
      convenient sampling and will be to select 94 inpatients with COPD in the division of chest
      ward of two teaching hospital in New Taipei City. The subjects who meet the conditions for
      admission are explained, and they need to sign a consent form confirming that they understand
      the risks. More, they are randomly divided into the experimental group (experimental group
      n=47) and the control group (control group n=47). The experimental group receives the Bubble
      PEP training; the control group receives the division of chest ward routine care. The study
      employs a structured questionnaire including a basic demography, COPD domain, COPD assessment
      test (CAT), cough and sputum assessment test, and check the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)
      using it for data collection. The study needs to be approve by the Institutional Review
      Board. The two groups agreed to participate in the study, after completing the subject
      consent form before the intervention, they also received the pre-test as a benchmark for the
      intervention effect. After completing the 7-day and 30-day intervention, the post-test was
      performed immediately to understand the intervention immediate effect.
