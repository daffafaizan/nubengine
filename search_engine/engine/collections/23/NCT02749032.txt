      (3 treatments, 3 treatment periods and 6 sequences), stratified (background medication:
      metformin vs. diet-only), placebo-controlled study, comparing periods lasting 6-9 days on
      treatment with repeated doses of vildagliptin, sitagliptin, or placebo, with wash-out periods
      between treatment periods lasting 21 days minimum.

      Experimental procedures. Meal tests were performed in the morning after an overnight fast.
      The standardized mixed meal was composed of 2 eggs (100 g), 1 slice (50 g) of whole grain rye
      bread, 1 slice (50 g) of rye flour bread, 10 g of fat-reduced margarine, 20 g of boiled ham,
      and 25 g of diet jam, amounting to 450 kcal, 50 % carbohydrate, 20 % protein, and 30 % fat
      (based on calorie count). Patients were allowed to drink tea (black or fruit-based) or
      de-caffeinated coffee ad libitum.

      Blood sampling. Plasma glucose was determined in capillary samples taken from hyperaemic ear
      lobes. Venous blood was collected from indwelling venous cannulas placed in a distal forearm
      vein, for the determination of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1 (total), GLP-1 (intact),
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (total), GIP (intact), and free fatty
      acids. After drawing basal blood specimens at -15 and 0 min, blood was taken at 15, 30, 45,
      60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min.

      Laboratory determinations. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, total GLP-1 (C-terminally directed
      assay), intact GLP-1 (sandwich ELISA), total GIP (C-terminally directed assay), intact GIP
      (N-terminally directed assay) and glucagon were determined.
