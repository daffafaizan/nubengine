      conventional and self-ligating fixed orthodontic brackets during leveling and alignment
      stage.

      Materials and Methods: A total of 22 patients (16 females and 6 males) aged 19Â± 2.53 years
      who presented with mild lower arch crowding were selected to participate in the study. A
      split mouth study design was applied for each patient. Two different fixed appliance brackets
      were used in the lower arch (self-ligating brackets on one side and conventional brackets on
      the other side of the same patients). PBF was measured for the lower right and left sides
      using Laser Doppler Flowmetry at different time intervals (20min, 24h, 72h, 1 week and 1
      month) after the fitting of 2 alignment archwires; 0.016" NiTi and 0.016X0.022" NiTi. A
      repeated measures analysis of variance test and a Bonferroni post-hoc comparison test were
      applied to detect differences in PBF between the 2 groups.
