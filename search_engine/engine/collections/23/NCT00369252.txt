      advanced incurable solid tumors. The objective of this study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of nimotuzumab that can be
      given in a weekly schedule in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumor cancer.
      This study will also examine the safety, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of
      nimotuzumab in this patient population.
