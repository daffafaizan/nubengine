      pathway of tryptophan metabolism in peripheral macrophages of patients with schizophrenia. To
      do this, we will measure the gene expression of several major enzymes in this pathway in
      macrophages, including the key enzyme involved in tryptophan to kynurenine metabolism, IDO,
      by means of quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The focus
      on enzyme mRNA expression as opposed to serum or cerebrospinal fluid levels of metabolites
      provides a possibly more sensitive characterization of the activation of this metabolic
      pathway.

      Primary hypotheses: We hypothesize that patients with schizophrenia will differ in their
      expression of macrophage IDO mRNA, reflecting activation of this pathway compared to normals.
      We further hypothesize that patients with deficit syndrome will have higher degrees of enzyme
      activation.

      Secondary hypotheses: Serum tryptophan levels will be lower in patients with schizophrenia
      compared to controls, and they will correlate with measures of dysphoria. Serum kynurenine
      levels will be elevated in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in deficit syndrome
      patients. mRNA expression levels of enzymes downstream from IDO will differ between patients
      and controls. Measures of immune activation will be influenced by medical disease burden
      (medical comorbidities).
