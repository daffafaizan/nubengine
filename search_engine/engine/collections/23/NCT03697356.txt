      Phase II clinical studies, so the most effective regimen has not been established. However,
      in patients without experience of treatment with rituximab monotherapy targeting CD20 antigen
      expressed on lymphocytic cells, the response rate is reported to be approximately 25% -45%.
      Combined chemotherapy including rituximab is recommended as a primary treatment.

      In Korea, there are few studies on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and a relatively large
      number of patients have studied the data of 71 patients in 2014, retrospectively. In the
      present study, we found that the combined chemotherapy regimen with rituximab significantly
      improved the overall response rates. Bortezomib may also be effective in the treatment of
      Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Based on this, clinical trials of combined chemotherapy with
      rituximab or dexamethasone have been conducted and 80-90% reported However, lenalidomide 15mg
      alone was administered, lenalidomide was effective in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia with a
      29% overall response rate.

      The authors concluded that the combination therapy of rituximab, bortezomib, lenalidomide,
      and dexamethasone is an effective treatment regimen that can improve the overall response
      rate including complete remission. Patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia diagnosed in
      Korea we planned this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance
      therapy with chemotherapy with chemotherapy including rituximab, bortezomib, lenalidomide,
      and dexamethasone
