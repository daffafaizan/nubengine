    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved know
      the identity of the intervention) study to evaluate the clinical use, safety and ease of care
      of two patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems to deliver pain medication either through
      the skin or intravenously. The fentanyl hydrochloride PCA system, which delivers the
      medication through the skin, and morphine intravenous (IV)- PCA, which requires injection
      into a vein, are used for management of moderate to severe acute pain in postoperative
      patients who have undergone elective major abdominal or orthopedic surgery. These patients,
      who are expected to require postoperative pain relief with strong opioids for at least 24
      hours, will control the delivery of medication for up to 3 days. Assessment of effectiveness
      include: patient's global assessment of pain control (poor, fair, good, excellent); Pain
      Intensity, measured on a visual numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain
      and 10 means the worst possible pain; Ease-of-Care questionnaires including Patient
      Ease-of-Care questionnaire, Nurse Ease-of-Care questionnaire, and Physical Therapist
      Ease-of-Care questionnaire; and, total number of doses delivered by patients in the fentanyl
      transdermal PCA or morphine IV PCA treatment groups. Safety evaluations include vital signs
      (pulse, blood pressure) and oxygen saturation, respiratory function, and the incidence of
      adverse events. The study hypothesis is that fentanyl transdermal PCA is not inferior to
      morphine IV PCA treatment in patient's global assessment of method of pain control during the
      first 24 hours after surgery. Transdermal PCA: 40 micrograms fentanyl per on-demand dose,
      each delivered over 10 minutes for a maximum of 6 doses/hr for 24 hours (maximum of 80 doses,
      3.2milligrams). Morphine IV PCA: morphine doses with a maximum of 20 milligrams per 2 hours
      for 24 hours (maximum 12 doses, 240 milligrams).
