      learn and achieve scholastic success. However, there is a gap in the knowledge pertaining to
      the selection of appropriate cognitive tasks for studying relationships between diet and
      cognitive control, particularly among young children. Accordingly, this study aims to study
      the relationship between diet and cognitive function using a standardized neuropsychological
      assessment and a modified cognitive task battery.
