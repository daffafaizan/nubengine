      the inability to correlate the extent of loss of immunologic function with the number of
      HIV-infected CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood. Few studies exist that measure viral burden
      in lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals. Researchers hope to find out whether the amount
      of HIV virus or markers for the virus in the body's lymph tissue is a better measure of
      disease progression than the amount of virus or markers for the virus in the blood.

      Sixteen antiretroviral-naive patients are randomized to either remain antiretroviral-naive
      (no treatment) or receive zidovudine daily (treatment). Additionally, 16 patients with 26 or
      more weeks of ongoing zidovudine (AZT) therapy are randomized to either continue on their
      prestudy AZT regimen or add didanosine (ddI) daily to their baseline AZT dose. Patients
      remain on their assigned treatment arms for 8 weeks. A lymph node biopsy is performed on day
      0 and at week 8. Patients are evaluated at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9.
