      created in Jaseng Hospital. T-MSAT(Motion style acupuncture treatment using traction) is a
      kind of MSATs, and a treatment that improves musculoskeletal problems by pulling the
      patient's body through the device and giving instructions for walking while being
      acupuncture.This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain to move the part of
      their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians' observation. This
      treatment is known to relieve pain and improve musculoskeletal disfunctions. However, there
      has been no specific studies for the effect of this treatment.

      So, investigators conduct a randomized controlled trials to verify the effectiveness and
      safety of T-MSAT. From September 2020 to March 2021, investigators recruit 100 inpatients who
      are suffered from acute low-back pain with the numeric rating scale(NRS) over 5 by traffic
      accident(TA). For experimental group(n=50), investigators conduct T-MSAT three times(on 2nd,
      3rd and 4th day of hospitalization) and other Korean medical treatment. For control
      group(n=50), just Korean medical treatment except T-MSAT is conducted. For these two groups,
      investigators compare NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Range Of
      Motion(ROM), , Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey(SF-12),
      and PTSD Checklist for DSM(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      DSM)-5(PCL-5)
