    
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicentre study of AZD9291 administered orally in
      combination with novel therapeutics (AZD6094 or selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886)) to
      patients with EGFRm+ advanced NSCLC. The study has been designed to allow an investigation of
      the optimal combination dose and schedule whilst ensuring the safety of patients with
      intensive safety monitoring. There are three main parts to this study; Part A, Combination
      dose finding and Parts B and D, Dose expansion. Part C, AZD6094 dose finding sub-study in
      advanced solid tumour patients is ongoing in Japan.

      AZD9291 (osimertinib) is a potent irreversible inhibitor of both the single epidermal growth
      factor receptor sensitising mutation positive (EGFRm+) (tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]
      sensitivity-conferring mutation) and dual EGFRm+/T790M+ (TKI resistance-conferring mutation)
      receptor forms of EGFR. AZD9291 therefore has the potential to provide clinical benefit to
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring both the single
      sensitivity mutations and the resistance mutation following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI.
      AZD9291 (osimertinib) was awarded FDA accelerated approval in November 2015, followed by
      conditional approval in the EU, full approval in Japan and additional markets in 2016, for
      the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M+ NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI
      therapy.

      Enrolment into the patient cohort that evaluated AZD9291 treatment in combination with
      MEDI4736 as 1st line treatment has been terminated due to an increased incidence of ILD-like
      events (interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis), and is no longer being evaluated in this
      study.
