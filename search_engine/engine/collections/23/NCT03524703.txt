      Previous studies showed that chewing gum helped to improve swallow frequency and latency.
      However, its short-term effect on alleviating dysphagia symptom after anterior cervical
      surgery is still unknown. A randomized, parallel controlled, superiority trial is performed
      in patients with postoperative mild-moderate dysphagia. Dysphagia severity will be assessed
      using dysphagia short questionnaire (DSQ) score in the chewing gum group and control group
      during 7 days after surgery, and the changes in DSQ score between two groups will be
      compared, to estimate the effect of chewing gum on alleviating dysphagia symptom.
