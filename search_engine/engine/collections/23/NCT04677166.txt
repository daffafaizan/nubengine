      shown superior outcomes regarding graft take and need for repeat grafting when compared with
      standard gauze dressing. However, to date, no study has compared standard NPWT to NPWT
      coupled with instillation for post-operative treatment of extremity skin grafts. This study
      is designed as a randomized, controlled pilot study to compare treatment standard NPWT with
      NPWT coupled with instillation on skin graft take.

      Patients will be selected based on inclusion criteria and randomized to either the treatment
      (NPWT coupled with instillation) or the control group (standard NPWT). Depending on the group
      to which they are randomized to, patients will have standard NPWT or NPWT coupled with
      instillation applied intra-operatively after application of split thickness skin graft for
      treatment of extremity wound.

      Patients randomized to control group will receive V.A.C Ulta NPWT at 125mmHg continuous
      pressure for duration of four days.

      Patients randomized to treatment group will receive V.A.C VeraFlo therapy. Protocol will
      consist of the following:

        -  Instillation solution: normal saline

        -  Dwell/soak time: 30 seconds

        -  Cycle Time: 4 hours

        -  Pressure: 125mmHg

      The devices will be kept in place for four days, at which point, the wound vacs will be
      removed and the percentage of skin graft take will be evaluated with use of photometric
      analysis. The skin grafts will be subsequently dressed with gauze as appropriate. Patients
      will be followed up in clinic to assess outcome of skin graft take.
