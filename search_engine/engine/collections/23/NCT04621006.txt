      and the Unit of Thrombosis Research at the University Hospital of Southern Denmark - Esbjerg.

      A total of 47 participants with active disease are to be followed in a prospective cohort
      study for 26 weeks. The study will describe differences between active and inactive disease.

      Data obtained from all participants are

        -  demographics

        -  assessment of quality of life (SIBDQ questionnaire)

        -  assessment of disease activity (SCCAI questionnaire, PRO 2 questionnaire, endoscopic
           Mayo score, histologic score by the Nancy index, c-reactive peptide and fecal
           calprotectin)

        -  assessment of the concentration and activity of the contact activation system proteins

        -  assessment of misfolded alpha-1-antitrypsin.

        -  assessment of ER stress (GRP78/BiP)

      The endoscopic and histologic assessment serve as the gold standard.

      Medias analyzed are blood, stool and colonic tissue.
