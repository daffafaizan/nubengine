    
      -  Therapy to prevent GVHD will consist of an infusion of tacrolimus intravenously and
           sirolimus orally once per day starting 3 days before stem cell infusion. This will take
           place in the hospital where the patient will remain for the duration of the transplant.

        -  Sirolimus will continue for 9 weeks at at stable dose, then will be tapered by 1/3 on
           week 9 and 1/3 on week 17. It will be stopped on week 26 if there is no significant
           evidence of GVHD. These dose modifications will occur at home and patients will be seen
           weekly for the first 2 months after discharge.

        -  If GVHD is present, the tapering schedule wil be slower and based upon the patient's
           clinical condition.

        -  Tacrolimus will be given orally once the patient is discharged from the hospital and
           will be tapered at the same schedule as sirolimus. Blood levels of both tacrolimus and
           sirolimus will be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly.

        -  During the year following stem cell transplant, blood work will be performed to evaluate
           the immune system and GVHD.
