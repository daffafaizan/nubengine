    
      All patients will be examined by a geneticist or a neuropediatric. All clinical data will be
      collected.

      Strategy of the molecular study :

        1. for all multiplex and consanguineous families a linkage analysis (loci ATCAY and ABC7
           and others AC known genes) will be performed.

        2. For all sporadic patients as well as linked multiplex and consanguineous families :
           sequencing of all coding exons of the gene ATCAY and others AC known genes.

        3. For all sporadic male patients and linked families : sequencing of all coding exons of
           the gene ABC7.

        4. For all patients with suggestive features : sequencing of all coding exons of the gene
           GPR56, VLDLR, NHE6 or other candidate gene.

        5. In consanguineous families : linkage analysis using SNP-array and analysis of candidate
           genes present in the regions of extended homozygosity

        6. linkage analysis in dominant families and analysis of candidate genes in the linked
           regions.

        7. If a new AC locus is identified (using linkage or CGH array), this gene will be
           sequenced in all patients.
