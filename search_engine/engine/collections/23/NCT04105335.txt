    
      Phase 1a comprises three planned dose cohorts (ascending dose, 3+3 design, at the following
      dose levels: 70 mg/m2 QW, 98 mg/m2 QW, and 130 mg/m2 QW) of MTL-CEBPA combined with standard
      dose of pembrolizumab (given every 3 weeks). The aim is to assess the safety and tolerability
      of MTL-CEBPA in combination with pembrolizumab, recruiting patients whose disease progressed
      on standard of care therapy or for whom no therapy is available.

      In the first dose cohort the first participant enrolled will receive MTL-CEBPA treatment at
      the 70mg/m2 QW dose level. Pembrolizumab (200mg) will be administered on Day 2 of the first
      cycle and subsequently every 3 weeks whilst participant is on treatment. MTL-CEBPA and
      pembrolizumab will not be administered on the same day.

      Phase 1b of the study will further evaluate safety, tolerability, and assess the clinical
      activity of MTL-CEBPA and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in combination.

      Participants will receive MTL-CEBPA at a dose considered most appropriate, with regards to
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy, for further development (based on data from Phase 1a of
      the study).

      Patients with the following (but not limited to) solid tumours will be specifically targeted:
      breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gall bladder, HCC, neuroendocrine, and cholangiocarcinoma.
