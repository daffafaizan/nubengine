      standard therapy in reducing the risk of recurrence in patients with resected stage 0 and I
      (Ta, T1, and Tis) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to receive
      multivitamins or placebo orally once daily for 3 years. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 2 years, then every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
