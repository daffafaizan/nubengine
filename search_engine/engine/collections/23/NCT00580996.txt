      This has been termed the Gastropressor Response. In this study, we are testing the null
      hypothesis that the blood pressure increase with oral water ingestion will not be diminished
      if a full prior water dose is given a few hours earlier. In this 2 day study, subjects will
      be asked to drink with 1 oz or 16 oz of water in the morning followed a few hours later by 16
      oz water while the blood pressure is monitored. On the 2nd day, the other dose of water will
      be given to start, with 16 oz again as the second dose.
