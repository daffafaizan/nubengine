      a significant burden for individuals and the National Health Service [There are 27,000 new
      cases reported per annum in the UK. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as the ideal
      comprehensive intervention since it addresses the complex interplay of medical, psychological
      and behavioural factors facing CHF patients and carers.

      Study Aim Primary objective to describe the exercise intensity, defined by oxygen uptake
      (VO2) in terms of the individual physiological thresholds, in CHF patients undergoing CR
      according to current guidelines Primary end point: VO2 Secondary objectives Secondary
      objectives of this study are:-

        1. To measure resting and exercising energy expenditure in order to a) establish the value
           of 1 MET (resting metabolic rate) for patients with CHF, and b) to establish the MET
           value (defined as multiples of resting metabolic rate) for exercises performed in CR
           sessions

        2. To measure affective responses (feeling very bad - feeling very good; levels of energy -
           tiredness and tension - calmness) to exercise during CR sessions

        3. To measure weekly physical activity level in CHF patients undergoing Phase III and IV
           CR.

      For the secondary analysis the following secondary end points and parameters will be
      established

        1. MET values, defined as multiples of resting oxygen uptake or resting metabolic rate (1
           MET), for different CR exercises

        2. Ratings of affective response on the Feelings Scale (FS) and ratings of perceived
           activation on the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS).

        3. Average daily activity over 7 day period in terms of steps per day and periods spent
           sitting, standing and walking
