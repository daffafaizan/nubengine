      patients transplanted with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells have an important role in
      controlling leukemia recurrence. Although adoptive immunotherapy using in vitro expanded γδT
      cells has achieved significant results in patients with solid tumors, infusion of donor γδT
      cells in leukemia patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to
      prevent leukemia recurrence has not been reported. . This clinical study intends to initially
      observe the safety and effectiveness of donor γδT cell infusion to prevent
      recurrence/refractory leukemia salvage allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to
      further improve the transplantation effect of these patients
