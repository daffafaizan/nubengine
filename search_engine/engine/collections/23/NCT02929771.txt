      protocol for a study into the effectiveness of immersive VR in minimizing procedural pain and
      distress in children with cancer. The research objectives are to: (1) pilot implementing
      immersive virtual reality (VR) for effectiveness testing in a future RCT (measured as
      implementation outcomes); (2) determine treatment effect sizes (measured as preliminary
      effectiveness outcomes), between VR, programmed to distract children during an SCP needle
      insertion, and an active control intervention (i.e., watching a video with headphones); and
      (3) assess impact of child and parent factors potentially associated with VR treatment
      effectiveness. Both the intervention and control groups will receive standard medical care
      (e.g., topical anesthetics). A convenience sample of 40 children and adolescents with cancer
      (20 participants per treatment arm; 10 boys and 10 girls per treatment arm) will be
      recruited. In addition, each child will act as their own control. A washout period of 1 month
      will be used to control for any carry-over effect between conditions. In addition to usual
      care, children in the experimental condition will wear the VR headset plus headphones. In the
      control condition, children will watch a video (i.e., an age-appropriate video selected by an
      oncology-affiliated child life specialist) on an iPad, while wearing the same headphones as
      in the experimental condition. Implementation outcomes include accrual and retention rates,
      acceptability and technical difficulties. Effectiveness outcomes include child pain,
      distress, and fear, as well as parent distress.
