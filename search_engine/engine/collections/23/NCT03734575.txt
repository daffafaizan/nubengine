      prostate tissue biopsy cores using the ClariCore System via a transperineal approach.
      Ultrasound images corresponding to each needle insertion and T2-weighted MR scans will be
      saved for the purpose of further algorithm development that will provide physicians with real
      time tissue classification in conjunction with location information from the ultrasound
      imaging.
