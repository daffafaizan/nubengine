      of time. We will compare dexmedetomidine to the traditional therapy for treatment of acute
      delirium. Dexmedetomidine does not affect breathing. The traditional drugs might make one
      sleepy and may slow down breathing. The traditional therapy in this institution for acute
      delirium is _the use of Haloperidol, and/or benzodiazepines. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic
      drug that has calming effect. Benzodiazepines are sedatives with calming
      effect.Dexmedetomidine is approved by the Food and drug Administration (FDA) to sedate
      patients on a breathing machine for 24 hours.
