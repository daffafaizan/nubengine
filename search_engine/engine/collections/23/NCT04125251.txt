      Program (BISP) Cash Transfer (CT) beneficiaries and their husbands in improving maternal
      mental and child health and its combined effect in empowering women and couples. The
      Formative phase of the project was dedicated for the development and modification of National
      level LSB curriculum for men and women. The formative phase was carried out in Thatta
      (Sindh), Rahimyar Khan (Punjab), Lasbela (Baluchistan) and Peshawar (KPK).

      The intervention phase will be conducted in district Thatta, where BISP beneficiaries along
      with their spouses will be offered a LSB training. This intervention will be offered by
      community teachers to ensure sustainability and community trust. The participants will be
      recruited for baseline assessment followed by a comprehensive LSB intervention.The end-line
      follow up assessments (five months of intervention) will be done after the deliver of
      intervention. A qualitative summative inquiry will be done at the completion of the project
      to explore the overall impact of the LSB intervention. Since the project is being implemented
      with the BISP, the cost of intervention can be estimated for the scalability and
      sustainability.
