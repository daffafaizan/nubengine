      These data are analyzed. The information from this database (scene of accident, weather,
      daytimeâ€¦) is compared to secondary data collected from the University Hospital of Innsbruck.
      The comparison of both databases was approved by the Austrian Data Protection Agency. The
      goal of the study is to give detailed information of circumstances leading to accident and
      give medical information of the patient's condition and his outcome.

      The method to collect data and to analyze is the same than in AN4757 315/4.4 (NCT03405467).
