      traumatic brain injuries. There are no evidence based guidelines for the management of acute
      post concussive headache. The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of routine
      administration of analgesia on concussion headache and classify headaches using the IHS
      criteria.

      Method A 4 arm open label pilot RCT study was conducted. The treatment arms were: (i)
      acetaminophen,(ii) ibuprofen, (iii) acetaminophen and ibuprofen and (iv) a standard control
      group. Eight to eighteen year olds presenting to emergency with headache 24-48 hours after
      their first concussion were recruited consecutively and sequentially randomized. Demographic
      data was collected, headache survey administered and standard concussion education given.
      Headaches were diarized over one week capturing the (i) number of headaches, (ii) headache
      days,(iii) headache intensity and (iv) return to school.
