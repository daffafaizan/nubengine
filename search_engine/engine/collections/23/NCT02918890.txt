      to engage children in fun activities. This study looks at what areas of the brain are
      responsible for recovery after intensive training. We are trying to understand how the brain
      responds to movement training and hope that in the future we can develop new treatments for
      hemiplegia based on what we learn about the brain in this study.

      To study the areas of the brain we will use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to take pictures
      of the brain and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to determine parts of the brain
      involved in using the hand. TMS uses a brief magnetic field over the scalp by using a wand
      that looks like a figure 8. The wand can make brief magnetic fields over a series of spots on
      your child's head to activate the brain cells under the wand. Non-invasive, single pulse TMS
      will be used in this study, which is considered minimal risk and tolerable to children. If
      your child has a recurrent history of seizures after two years of age, he/she might not
      qualify.
