    
      Main objectives:

      To examine the expression of TAL1 and SNAI2 in protein extracts and glioma sections of
      different grades (glioblastomas and diffuse low-grade tumors).

      To examine the effect of overexpression of Tal1 and Snai2 in high grade glioma cultures.

      To show the expression of Tal1 and SNAI2 by tumor cells by FISH technique. Show that TAL1 and
      SNAI2 could be regulated by endothelial cells
