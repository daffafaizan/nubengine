      compromise vascular integrity and cause tissue edema, organ dysfunction and death.
      Adrenomedullin (ADM) has attracted the interest of researchers because of its powerful
      physiological functions. An anti-ADM antibody reduced the norepinephrine infusion rates
      required to achieve hemodynamic targets, increased urine flow and improved creatinine
      clearance, which ultimately resulted in attenuated systemic inflammation and tissue
      apoptosis, during resuscitated cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic shock in
      mice.

      In humans, plasma ADM has been determined only in a small number of sepsis patients, and -
      except from one study - the assays used did not selectively measure the bioactive ADM form
      and have been considered not reliable. Therefore, the potential value of determining plasma
      ADM in such patients cannot yet be ascertained and the optimal cut off needs to be validated
      in future studies
