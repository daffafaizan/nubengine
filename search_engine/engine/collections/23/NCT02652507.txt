      anesthesia. This study is examining the effects of combining dexmedetomidine and ketamine on
      the muscle tone and airway configuration in children under anesthesia. The hypothesis is
      adding ketamine to dexmedetomidine will not significantly reduce airway caliber or morphology
      when compared to previously collected data using dexmedetomidine alone.
