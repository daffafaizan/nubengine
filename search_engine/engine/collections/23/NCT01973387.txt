    
      This is a randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open-label
      (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ibrutinib versus rituximab in adult Asia Pacific region patients with
      relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL with active disease requiring treatment who have failed at
      least 1 prior line of therapy and are not considered appropriate candidates for treatment or
      retreatment with purine analog-based therapy. Approximately 150 patients will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:2 ratio into 2 treatment arms to receive either intravenous rituximab
      (Treatment Arm A) for 6 cycles or oral ibrutinib (Treatment Arm B) until disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. The study will include screening,
      treatment, and follow-up phases. Treatment will extend from randomization until study drug
      discontinuation. Follow-up will consist of 2 phases: post-treatment (from the discontinuation
      of treatment for reasons other than disease progression until the patient has progressive
      disease) and post-disease progression (subsequent anticancer therapy and survival status will
      be recorded until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or study closure). Patients
      in the rituximab arm with disease progression or who meet the International Workshop on
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria for requiring subsequent anti-CLL therapy may
      be considered for cross over to receive ibrutinib 420 mg orally, daily until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal from study, or until study end whichever
      occurs earliest. Efficacy evaluations will assess for disease response and progression in
      accordance with International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria. Serial
      pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug does to the body) blood samples will be collected in
      the ibrutinib treatment group. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
