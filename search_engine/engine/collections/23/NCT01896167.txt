    
      To investigate migraine with aura symptoms during and after hypoxia.

      With magnetic resonance imaging the investigators will investigate changes in

        -  regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)

        -  resting state functional connectivity

        -  circumference of the middle cerebral artery(MCA), internal carotic artery, superficial
           temporal artery, medial meningeal artery, external carotic artery

        -  brain metabolism

      And compare these changes with a aged match healthy control group.
