      present with hypoglycemia during infancy. Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone
      (rhGH) reduces the risk for hypoglycemia and decreases insulin sensitivity. The investigators
      hypothesize, that GHD causes a decrease in the fraction of glucose derived form
      gluconeogenesis and conversely glycogenolysis and insulin sensitivity will be increased, when
      GHD children are compared to healthy controls. The investigators anticipate that total
      glucose production will be unaffected by rhGH therapy. Therefore, the GDH subjects treated
      with rhGH for 8 weeks will have an increase in the fraction of glucose derived form
      gluconeogenesis and a decrease in that form glycogenolysis and decreased insulin sensitivity.
      To test this hypothesis, 10 healthy and 10 GHD children will be studied using the stable
      isotope [U-13C] glucose and Mass Isotopes Distribution Analysis (MIDA). The investigators
      will be specifically measuring the rate of glucose production, gluconeogenesis,
      glycogenolysis, insulin sensitivity and glucagon response after an overnight fast. In
      addition, the investigators will measure changes in protein oxidation, proteolysis and fat
      metabolism using the stable isotopes [15N2] urea, [1-13C] leucine and concentrations of free
      fatty acids and b-hydroxybutyrate. The GHD group will be studied at the time of diagnosis and
      after 8 weeks of rhGH.
