    
      Study settings:

      This study will be carried out on patients enrolled from the Outpatient clinic in fixed
      prosthodontics clinic, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University.

      Participant timeline:

      The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows:

        1. st Visit: Preoperative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, clinical,
           radiographic examination and primary impression for diagnostic cast construction.

        2. nd Visit: Teeth preparation, secondary impression and temporary restoration.

        3. rd Visit : Try in

        4. th Visit: Placement and permanent cementation of the final restoration. Shade match,
           marginal adaptation and patient satisfaction will be evaluated immediately after
           cementation

      Data collection methods

      Primary outcome (Shade match) will be assessed by using Modified United State Public Health
      Service Criteria (Modified USPHS Criteria).

      Secondary outcomes:

      Marginal adaptation will be assessed by modified USPHS criteria. Patient's satisfaction will
      be assessed using nominal scores (non-acceptable, acceptable, good and excellent).

      Data management:

      All data will be entered electronically in an Excel sheet. Patient files are to be stored in
      numerical order in a secured place.

      Statistical methods:

        -  All Data will be collected, checked, revised, tabulated and entered into the computer.

        -  Data will be analyzed using IBM advance statistics (Statistics package for social
           sciences) version 21 (SPSS inc, Chicago, IL)

        -  Categorical data will be described as numbers and percentage

        -  Data will be explored for normality using Kolmogrov-smirnov test and Shapiro-wilk test

        -  Comparison between two groups for normally distributed numeric variables will be done by
           Mann-Whitney test. An equivalence limit will be tested.

        -  A P-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All
           tests will be two tailed.

      Data monitoring:

      Monitoring The main supervisor is responsible of data monitoring if harms arise, interim
      analysis will be done.

      Harms Any adverse effect like pain or even failure will be recorded, documented and treated.

      Audit Auditing of the study design will be done by the evidence-based committee of the
      faculty of Oral and Dental medicine at Cairo University.
