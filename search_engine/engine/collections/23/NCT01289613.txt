      anesthesia using two BIS-Monitors. Side differences of more than 10% were defined as BIS
      asymmetries. An increase of BIS of more than 10% from the value at the time of finishing
      anesthesia administration on only one side followed by movement after stimulation was defined
      as clinically relevant.
