      patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients will receive NK012 as an intravenous infusion
      over 30 minutes on Day 1 followed by a 20-day observation period for a total of 21 days (3
      weeks) per cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately: patients with
      UGT1A1*28 genotype homozygous wild type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/*28) variants as one
      group, and patients with UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (*28/*28) as another group.
