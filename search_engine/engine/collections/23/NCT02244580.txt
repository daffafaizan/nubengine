      with the currently used methods up to 20% of determinations are inaccurate and especially
      Ki67- measures are not very reproducible. Therefore new evaluation systems or new methods are
      necessary to improve diagnostic.

      At least 4 subtypes can be distinguished to date depending on the expression of ESR, PgR,
      Her2 and Ki-67:

        -  Luminal A-type

        -  Luminal B-type

        -  Her2-type

        -  Triple-negative-type

      MammaTyper™ uses a new approach. Instead of detection of the marker proteins, the messenger
      ribonucleic adic (mRNA) of marker proteins is quantitated. This prospectively planned
      diagnostic study will investigate the potential of subgrouping of patients at baseline
      according to results of MammaTyper™ methodology for predicting survival.

      Patients will be subgrouped according to the new marker determination and the DDFS and OS
      will be evaluated and compared to the DDFS and OS of subgrouping with former marker
      determination.
