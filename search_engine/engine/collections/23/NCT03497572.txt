    
      This is a seroprevalence, phase IV, multi -center study to evaluate anti-Leptospira antibody
      persistence in subjects who have received at least the 2nd booster (4 vaccine doses) and no
      more than the 6th booster (8 vaccine doses) of SpiroleptÂ® vaccine.

      The study will be conducted at the Occupational Health Centre of companies employing workers
      at risk of leptospirosis for their occupational activities. Study participants will be
      selected from the company Occupational Health Centre database where each employee is
      registered. All workers are regularly followed-up and their medical and vaccination history
      recorded. Subjects selection will occur according the number of booster doses received
      (having received at least the 2nd booster and no more than the 6th booster). After they have
      signed the informed consent form, subjects will be recruited into the study and if all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are met they will be taken a blood sample.

      Anti-leptospira IgG antibody will be measured by a validated ELISA. Other assay may be
      performed to further characterize anti-leptospira antibodies. Data on subject demographics,
      relevant medical history, vaccination dates, and blood collection will be recorded in an
      appropriate Case Report Form.

      The study does not include any vaccination.
