      enoxaparin, to see if it is safe and effective in preventing stroke and other blood clot
      complications in subjects with atrial fibrillation whose doctors plan to treat them with an
      electrical cardioversion. It is expected that 284 sites will recruit 2200 subjects from North
      America, EU, Russia, Ukraine and Israel. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive
      either treatment with edoxaban, or treatment with warfarin, plus enoxaparin if required.
      Participants will have an equal chance of receiving either treatment. Participants will be in
      the study for a maximum of 82 days. Study procedures will include physical examinations,
      vital signs (pulse and sitting blood pressure), ECG (electrocardiogram), finger prick blood
      clotting tests, blood samples and urine samples.

      The study is expected to show that edoxaban will provide comparable incidence rates to
      warfarin plus enoxaparin, the current standard treatment for both efficacy and bleeding.
