      carcinoma (SCC). Lymph node yield (LNY), which is the number of lymph nodes retrieved after
      neck dissection, and lymph node ratio (LNR), which is the ratio of positive lymph nodes out
      of the total removed, are measurable indicators that may have the potential to be used as
      prognostic factors. The present study is designed to define the exact role of LNY and LNR
      regarding the overall and specific survival of patients affected by oral cavity and
      oropharyngeal SCC.

      This is a multicenter study involving tertiary care referral centers in Europe and North
      America. Patients affected by oral cavity, HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal SCC undergoing neck
      dissection will be consecutively enrolled and followed-up for up to 5 years. Patients and
      disease characteristic will be properly recorded and centrally analyzed. The primary
      end-point is to define reliable cut off- values for LNY and LNR which may serve as
      prognosticators of survival. This will be achieved through the use of ROC curves. Secondary
      outcomes will be the Overall survival (OS), Disease Specific Survival (DSS), and Progression
      Free Survival Hazard Ratios (HR) at 2-, 3- and 5 years, which will be evaluated through the
      Kaplan-Meier method and the difference in survival attested by the log-rank test. Univariate
      and multivariate analysis will be performed to understand the association of various outcomes
      with LNY and LNR.
