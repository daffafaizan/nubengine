    
      Study Design: This will be a patient-and-investigator blinded factorial randomised trial with
      four parallel groups. Participants in all four groups will be instructed to apply cream 3
      times a day for 7 days after surgery. A standard analgesia prescription will be provided with
      laxatives as per routine care. Patients will be provided a questionnaire to complete and
      return on day 14.

      Random Sequence Generation: Computer generated sequence allocating patients to a 1:1:1:1
      ratio using permuted block randomisation in blocks of 12.

      Allocation Concealment: This randomisation code will be seeded to the pharmacist to who will
      package and label the cream according to a code. The creams will be indistinguishable to
      which active ingredient they contain.

      Assignment of intervention: Patients will be assigned in order according to the numbering of
      the cream tubes by the blinded investigator.

      Data recording: Data will be recorded on Redcap database.
