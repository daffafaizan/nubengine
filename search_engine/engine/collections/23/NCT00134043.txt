      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced
      or locally recurrent thyroid cancer treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-14.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are then evaluated for disease response. Patients achieving a
      complete response receive an additional 2 courses of SAHA. Patients achieving stable disease
      or a partial response receive 4 additional courses of SAHA. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed within 4 weeks.
