      consent, will include a period to assess eligibility (screening period) of up to
      approximately 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period and an end-of-treatment visit around 30
      days following the last administration of study drug, and at least one follow-up visit after
      the end-of-treatment visit. Additional follow-up visits may be required until resolution or
      stabilization of adverse events (at least 30 days). Treatment may continue until precluded by
      toxicity, progression, or upon patient's request. If the patient stops study treatment for
      reason other than disease progression, follow-up visit will be performed every 3 months until
      disease progression or initiation of another anti-tumor treatment or death, whichever comes
      first.
