    
      To assess the ability of baseline clinical parameters and imaging modalities to predict short
      and long term left ventricular function and clinical outcome of subjects with impaired left
      ventricular function and / or low-gradient, severe aortic stenosis.

      To assess the impact of aortic valve replacement as compared to medical therapy on clinical
      outcome of patients with impaired left ventricular function and / or low-gradient, severe
      aortic stenosis.

      To assess possible impact of aortic annulus assessment using 3-dimensional imaging modalities
      on the assessment of AS severity and definition of low gradient severe aortic stenosis.
