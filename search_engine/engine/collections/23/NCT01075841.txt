      indication in approximately 50 institutions in Korea.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To obtain safety information on the use of Erbitux in subjects with recurrent and/or
           metastatic SCCHN in terms of frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To gather clinical efficacy information of the treatment

      During the PMS period, each subject's background, subject's medical history (surgery,
      anti-cancer treatment), Erbitux treatment status, concurrent medication, response evaluation,
      status and reason of discontinuation, all AEs (regardless of the causal relationship to
      Erbitux), and abnormal results of laboratory tests will be collected. The PMS will be based
      on all cases treated with Erbitux at least once.

      Erbitux will be prescribed to recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN subjects according to the
      approved national label as in routine clinical practice under the supervision of an
      investigator experienced in the use of antineoplastic medicinal products. Prior to the first
      infusion, subjects will receive pre-medication with an antihistamine and a corticosteroid.
      The initial dose of Erbitux is 400 mg/m2 body surface area and the subsequent weekly doses
      are 250 mg/m2 each administered intravenously via in-line filtration with an infusion pump,
      gravity drip, or a syringe pump. The recommended infusion period for the initial dose is 120
      minutes and for the subsequent weekly doses is 60 minutes with the maximum infusion rate not
      exceeding 10 mg/min, equivalent to 5 ml/min of Erbitux 2 mg/ml or 2ml/min of Erbitux 5mg/mL.
