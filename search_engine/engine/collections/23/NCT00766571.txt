      fistula, radial dysplasia and limb anomalies, and renal anomalies, termed VACTERL
      association, has been used as a clinical descriptor for a specific group of phenotypic
      manifestations that have been observed to occur together. Depending upon the diagnostic
      criteria used, the prevalence may be as high as 1 in 6000 live births. VACTERL association is
      felt to be due to defects in early embryogenesis, and is likely to be genetically
      heterogeneous. The purpose of the present study is to increase the understanding of the
      clinical manifestations and genetic causes of VACTERL association through detailed physical,
      laboratory, and radiological studies. We also plan to examine the spectrum of clinical
      characteristics in VACTERL association to facilitate early diagnosis and clinical management,
      including genetic counseling. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll approximately
      25-50affected individuals along with their family members for a total of 75-150 total
      individuals each year, with an enrollment ceiling of 500 affected individuals. Patients and
      their families will be seen at the NIH clinical center.
