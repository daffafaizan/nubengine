      due to the elimination of suture or staple tracts. These tracts can lead to infection and
      migration of epithelial cells adding to scarring, and cross-hatching scars which remain after
      healing. Absorbable staples can provide a rapid, secure, subcuticular closure of skin as an
      alternative to the traditional, manual staple or suture closure. This study will compare
      INSORB absorbable staples to externally applied standard metal staples with respect to
      effectiveness of incision closure, acute healing, subject comfort level, security and
      appearance after total hip replacement.
