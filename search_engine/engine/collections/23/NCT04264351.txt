      nephrourologic surgery. To study if preoperative frailty is an independent predictor of
      immediate postoperative complications, after 30 days, 6 months and 1 year of follow-up. To
      detect if there are other independent risk factors for complications.

      Methods: prospective cohort study performed at Fundació Puigvert. Enrollment of 850 patients
      ≥70 y/o who undergo scheduled nephrourologic surgery. In the preoperative visit frailty is
      going to be evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the Canadian
      Frailty Scale, the Mini-Cog test (Memory an executive functions), the Pfeiffer Test
      (Cognitive global screening), an involuntary loss of more than 4.5kg or 5% of weight in the
      previous year and physical activity using the Metabolic Equivalents of Task (MET). We will
      analyse the relation among frailty, medical, surgical postoperative complications and
      mortality at 30 days, 6 months and one year after the surgery.

      The results will be adjusted by the possible confounding and interaction variables using a
      multivariate logistic regression model. The confounding /interaction variables will include
      demographic data, clinical and lab data and events arisen during the follow-up period.
