    
      This study seeks to understand the genetic causes of conditions that affect the development
      of the genitals, such as differences of sex development (DSD) and hypospadias, and the impact
      on families of receiving genetic results. The investigators are recruiting individuals with
      DSD and/or hypospadias without a clear genetic cause along with their family members for our
      research study. The investigators will collect samples for genetic studies. The investigators
      will review the clinical record for history, labs and physical exam information. The
      investigators will also build a tissue bank of blood, urine, and discarded tissues from
      surgeries. The investigators will return results of genetic testing to parents/guardians of
      children with DSD/hypospadias and have them complete questionnaires to assess the impact of
      receiving these results.
