      proportion of PLHIV on ART was 65%, however the HIV epidemic is essentially concentrated in
      people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men and sex workers.

      As of today, routine HIV VL monitoring is not yet available in remote settings in Vietnam.
      Despite an initiative we conducted and that documented the feasibility of DBS use in remote
      settings, and although no genuine roll-out of POC machines is yet observed in the field, the
      Ministry of Health of Vietnam has not yet decided to scale-up HIV VL monitoring using DBS.
      More field evaluations are needed to convince the Ministry of Health that DBS can effectively
      be used to scale-up HIV VL monitoring.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of HIV VL
      measurement using the cobasÂ® plasma separation card (PSC) against plasma at the threshold of
      1000 copies/mL (threshold currently used to define failure in Vietnam, following the WHO
      guidelines).
