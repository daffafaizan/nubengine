    
      Base study P05693 (NCT00697255) was planned to include two separate stages (Ia+Ib and II).

      Stage Ia was open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore whether
      the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose recombinant
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) would provide an appropriate response in eligible
      participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

      Stage Ib was open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=3) to explore whether
      the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose Human Chorion
      Gonadotropin (hCG) would provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

      Stage II was planned to be open-label and randomized (n=40) to evaluate whether the intended
      dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by low dose recFSH (n=20) or hCG (n=20) would
      provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      P05713 is a follow-up (FU) study to prospectively monitor pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal
      outcome of women who became ongoing pregnant during base study P05693 (NCT00697255). For this
      trial, no study specific assessments will be required and no treatment will be administered,
      but information as obtained in standard practice will be used. Enrollment will begin when the
      first ongoing pregnancy resulting from the base study has been established (ultrasound â‰¥ 10
      weeks after bolus injection of hCG).
