      retrospectively. Vulvar paget disease patients are frequently treated with surgical resection
      of the affected tissue. During a surgical treatment surgical margins are frequently positive.
      Recidives are seen frequently after surgical treatment or the development of other
      pathologies such as vulvar carcinoma. In this study the outcome of the vulvar paget disease
      will be analysed and compared between the participants. It's primary goal is to create a
      better view on the outcome and the prognosis to prevent e.g. complications in the future.

      All the information of the patients will be gathered retrospectively from their medical file
      , after they gave their consent.
