      changes with age is not well-characterized and even less is known about the factors
      influencing the rate of brain aging. Thus, we are using MRI scans to examine the structure of
      the brain in relation to important lifestyle factors. This will allow us to better understand
      the processes influencing the brain as it ages. In turn, this will help identify specific
      ways to promote healthy brain aging and, perhaps, prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

      Participants complete 4 visits over several months. The first visit entails a clinical
      evaluation and memory testing involving the use of paper and pencil testing. The second visit
      is an MRI brain scan which lasts approximately one hour. The third visit involves drawing
      blood for laboratory testing and blood banking for future lab studies, lasting roughly 4
      hours. The glucose tolerance test is administered. The fourth and final visit is an
      assessment of the participant's metabolism and exercise testing. This visit lasts
      approximately two hours.
