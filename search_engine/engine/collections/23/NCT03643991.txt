    
      The Intervention Group (Cohort 1 - first 15 patients to be enrolled):

        1. Patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) will be asked to sign a consent form
           and will have the study explained.

        2. Nursing staff will complete baseline assessments to measure behavioral disturbances
           using the CMAI and CGI and other distressing symptoms using the ESAS-r.

        3. A weighted blanket, based on admission body weight, will be provided to the patient
           under nursing supervision.

        4. For 3 consecutive days after each use of weighted blanket, nursing staff will complete
           morning assessments to measure behavioral disturbances using the CMAI and CGI and other
           distressing symptoms using the ESAS-r.

        5. At the end of the intervention, nursing staff will complete post-intervention
           assessments to measure behavioral disturbances using the CMAI and CGI and other
           distressing symptoms using the ESAS-r.

      Control Group (Cohort 2 - second 15 patients to be enrolled):

        1. Patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) will be asked to sign a consent form
           and will have the study explained.

        2. The study team will recruit a group of patients with similar characteristics as
           described in the inclusion criteria; however, the patient will not receive the weighted
           blanket, but undergo the same assessments as described in 1-5 (above) and in the
           Schedule of Assessments.
