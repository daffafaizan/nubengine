      8-week intervention (3 session per week) with either high intensity interval training in
      normoxia or hypoxia, constant load exercise training in normoxia or hypoxia, hypoxic or
      normoxic (placebo) conditioning at rest. Exercise capacity, metabolic status, blood pressure,
      vascular function and physical activity will be assessed before and after the intervention.
