        -  NRTI-sparing regimens are attractive options to avoid NRTI-associated toxicity and to
           provide a full active regimen in patients with some extent of NRTI resistance.

        -  Raltegravir (RAL) and Darunavir (DRV) are potent "third drugs" and they provide a
           synergistic inhibition of 2 different steps in HIV replication.

        -  DRV has a high genetic barrier, and could be an excellent accompanying drug for
           Raltegravir, providing a potent, safe and well tolerated dual therapy to patients who
           are failing NNRTI based treatments.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination of Raltegravir and
           Darunavir after 24 weeks of follow up in HIV infected patients failing a NRTI based
           regimen.

        -  To describe plasma pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir when combined with Darunavir 800mg QD
           in HIV-infected patients.
