    
      Polysomnographic (PSG) work-up one night to record nocturnal sleep condition in narcolepsy
      with /without RBD and control subjects including sleep macrostructure, occurrence of sleep
      onset rapid eye movement period(SOREMP), sleep stages distribution, and sleep arousle and leg
      movement and apnea hyponea index would be calculated.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used in human to nonivasiverlyn
      investigate the neural mechanisms. This technique also apply to measures the variations in
      brain perfusion, structure and morphology in narcolepsy patients by assessing the blood
      oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI and voxel-based
      morphometry(VBM)

      This study compare the feature of PSG and fMRI between narcolepsy with RBD, narcolepsy
      without RBD, control subject to evaluates the PSG and cerebral metabolism and functions in
      narcolepsy with/without RBD.
