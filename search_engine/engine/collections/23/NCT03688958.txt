      metastases and tumor resistance to antineoplastic drugs. Anthracyclines (doxorubicin (DOX),
      epirubicin, etc.) are the golden standard in neoadjuvant therapy and are commonly used in the
      FEC/TE (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide/taxotere, epirubicin) combination
      therapy during advanced breast cancer. However, even when treated with this potent
      chemotherapeutic combination, 30% of patients develop chemoresistance and cardiomyopathic
      side effects. Previous studies support that the oral supplement of molecular iodine (I2)
      exerts synergistic antineoplastic and cardioprotective impact when used in combination with
      the DOX in rodent and canine mammary cancer model. The present study performed two randomized
      clinical groups including women with early (stage II) and advanced (stage III) breast cancer.
      In the Early group, women were treated with I2 (5 mg/day) or placebo (colored water) for 7 to
      35 days. In the Advanced group, patients received treatment (I2 or placebo) along with 4 to 6
      cycles of FEC/TE treatment. The study analyzes the clinical response [tumor size, thyroid
      status, side effects (Common Toxicity Criteria V4.0)] and molecular mechanisms in the tumor
      samples (transcriptomic, proteins and immune responses).
