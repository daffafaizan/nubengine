      measurements may vary with race, age, sex, parity and the use of hormone therapy in health.
      It has therefore been recommended to gather normative data on the individual OCT/MfERG
      equipment in each laboratory. This is the reason why we gathered our local normative material
      on both machines. We also assessed our normative material on the OCT in relation to age, sex,
      parity and the use of contraception for future matching with patients.

      It has been hypothesized that para-inflammation states are involved in retinal aging in
      health. We assume that the age-related changes we observed in our normative OCT material are
      related to low-grade chronic inflammation in the retina. We therefore assessed the effect of
      to commercially available anti-inflammatory eye drops- diclofenac and dexamethasone,which are
      often used in inflammation-related states in ophthalmology for their effect on macular
      thickness in health and with aging.

      Uveitis is a frank intraocular inflammation which may lead to macular edema. Macular edema is
      often transient in uveitis and its presence has been previously reported in severe or
      long-lasting uveitis. In some cases mecular edema may become chronic or refractory to
      treatment. However, whether uncomplicated anterior uveitis with no clinically evident macular
      edema leads to macular thickening detectable with the OCT, or whether monolateral uveitis may
      cause bilateral macular thickening is not known. We therefore assesed both eyes of patients
      with anterior uveitis for macular thickening with the OCT.

      To correlate macular anatomy with its function some subjects included in the OCT study were
      also examined with the mfERG. However, at present the MfERG result have not been analyzed.
