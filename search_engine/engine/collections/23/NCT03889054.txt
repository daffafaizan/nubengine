      to a respiratory rehabilitation program with or without a individualized program of health
      education. We try to demonstrate a better improvement in the quality of life after completing
      a joint program of health education and respiratory rehabilitation in this patients than
      those one who only receive respiratory rehabilitation. We also want to demonstrate an
      improvement in lung function, the distance travelled in the 6-minute walk test and in the
      test of the shuttle, the adherence to inhaled treatment, the physical activity, the emotional
      condition, the number of visits to emergencies and hospitalizations and the number of mild,
      moderate and severe exacerbations between both groups.
