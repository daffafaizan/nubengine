      from this pilot study will be excluded from the statistical analysis.

      Sample size: a priori power analysis was performed to evaluate the sample size required for
      the study. MCI and NDFAM were considered separately for sample size calculation. For power
      calculation a two-tailed test was used and a significance level (α) and test power (1-β) were
      set at 0.05 and 0.8/0.9, respectively.

      Randomization: The individuals belonging to MCI and NDFAM subgroup were randomly assigned to
      CS or AC group. The randomization was performed by a statistician blind to participants
      characteristics using the Random Allocation Software. Allocation ratio was set at 1:1,
      stratification was performed for birth cohort (≤1937 and ≥1938), education level (years of
      education ≤5 years and >5 years).

      Participants provided written informed consent before study participation.
