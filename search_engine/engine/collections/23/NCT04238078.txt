    
      The objective of this study is to investigate the taste function and eating habits in
      patients with PCOS in comparison with healthy women at baseline and after routine use of an
      oral contraceptive (2mg ethinylestradiol and 0.03mg dienogest) for three months.

      Patients with diagnosis of PCOS (Rotterdam criteria) will be recruited from Hacettepe
      University outpatient clinics. Along with clinical, hormonal and biochemical evaluation,
      taste function and eating habit tests will be performed at baseline both in patients and
      healthy volunteers. These tests will be repeated in women with PCOS after 3 months of oral
      contraceptive use.
