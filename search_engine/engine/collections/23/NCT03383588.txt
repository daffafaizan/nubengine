      standard intrathecal morphine/fentanyl combination given during spinal anesthesia during
      elective cesarean delivery on postoperative pain control as measured by postoperative usage
      of oral opioids and a postoperative pain assessment scale. Comparing post-op pain scores and
      oxycodone usage in patients who receive just intrathecal morphine to patients who receive
      intrathecal morphine plus subcutaneous bupivacaine .25%, to patients who receive bupivacaine
      .25% with epinephrine 1:200,000.

      After cesarean delivery, all groups will actively control the use of post-operative pain
      medication by indicating to the care nurse whether or not pain medication is desired. Pain
      control for all groups will be the standard pain treatment: ibuprofen for mild to moderate
      pain and percocet (oxycodone) for severe pain.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved bupivicaine as an anesthetic and for
      pain but the FDA has not approved bupivicaine to be given specifically for postoperative
      cesarean pain. Acetaminophen, oxycodone and ibuprofen are being used as part of routine
      clinical care for pain control after cesarean. Fentanyl and duramorph are being used in
      spinal anesthesia and are FDA approved for regional anesthesia and used for this purpose in
      routine clinical care.
