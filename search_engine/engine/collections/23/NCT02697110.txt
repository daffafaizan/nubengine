    
      A two arm cluster randomized control design will be used to select a total of about 400
      participants each of the control and intervention groups. The participants will be drawn from
      primary health care (PHC) centres offering immunization services in Ibadan. In the
      intervention group, mothers will be trained on early brain stimulation using group video
      sessions followed by individualised question and answer sessions. These sessions will take
      place at 6 week and 10 week post natal immunisation visits. The control arm will receive the
      standard of care - routine immunization care- group health talks.

      The child's development will be assessed using the Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children
      (SWYC) instrument.

      Outcome variables will include changes in self-reported early child brain stimulation
      behaviour and increase in the awareness of parents and significant others on the social and
      emotional difficulties of children.
