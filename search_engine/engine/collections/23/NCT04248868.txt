      peripheral vasculature. Because of the unique design of the catheter, with its six expandable
      infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger
      central channel for blood flow, thereby utilizing the body's own endogenous fibrinolytic
      agents to lyse the clot, and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of a
      catheter-administered thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus. Expansion of the multiple
      arms of the basket in the infusion catheter causes fissuring of the clot. The net result is
      that a greater surface area of clot is exposed to both endogenous and exogenously
      administered lytic agents, thereby promoting clot dissolution.

      This study will utilize the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter and the Bashir Endovascular
      Catheter with a short basket (BASHIR™ S-B endovascular catheter) to administer catheter
      directed thrombolysis in patients with submassive PE who have consented and meet all
      eligibility criteria. The Bashir™ and BASHIR™ S-B endovascular catheters represent a new
      methodology for localized catheter-based delivery of thrombolytics. The thrombolytic to be
      used in this study is r-tPA (Genentech Corporation, South San Francisco, USA).

      The design of the Bashir Endovascular Catheter with the multiple infusion limbs creating a
      basket-like formation when expanded, provides an immediate channel for blood flow through the
      thrombus and a greater surface area in the thrombus for the endogenous and exogenous
      thrombolytics to take effect, as described above.
