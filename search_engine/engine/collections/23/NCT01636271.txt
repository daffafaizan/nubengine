      darapladib in subjects with clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease (chronic
      coronary heart disease (CHD) and post Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)).

      The purpose of the integrated efficacy analysis is to test the effects of darapladib on
      select endpoints which are not part of the testing hierarchies associated with the individual
      studies, namely: urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia, stroke,
      subsequent MACE, and heart failure requiring hospitalization, For all other endpoints, the
      intent of the integrated analysis is to provide increased precision of the estimated effects
      of darapladib.
