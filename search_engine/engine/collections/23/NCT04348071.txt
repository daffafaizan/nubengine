    
      This is an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trial, with a focus on the assessment of safety in the
      first 20 participants (Phase 2), followed by a much broader assessment of efficacy, while
      continuing to monitor safety, in an additional 60 participants (Phase 3, total participants
      across Phase 2/3 n=80). Both phases are single arm, open label, and occur at a single site at
      the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH). Data from participants in this study will be
      compared with data from other COVID-19 patients not receiving ruxolitinib. Study participants
      will receive 10 mg twice daily of ruxolitinib for 14 days and will be followed for up to 29
      days.
