      female subjects to determine if mipomersen administered as a single therapeutic (200 mg) SC
      and a single supra-therapeutic (200 mg) IV dose delays cardiac repolarization as determined
      by the measurement of QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval. A total of 60 healthy male and female
      subjects will be enrolled in this 4-way crossover study, randomly assigned to 1 of 8
      treatment sequences, and cross over into 4 treatment periods where each subject will receive
      both a single SC injection and a single IV infusion during each period.
