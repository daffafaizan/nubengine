    
      This is A Phase 1, Open-Label, Multi-Center, Dose Escalation and Expansion Study to Evaluate
      Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of the WEE1 Inhibitor IMP7068
      Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors

      The study will include a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage. The
      dose-escalation stage is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMP7068 monotherapy. The dose-expansion stage will be
      conducted with RP2D to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety and
      tolerability.

      A total of approximately 150 patients will be enrolled in the study.

      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled into Part 1 dose escalation of IMP7068
      monotherapy. A total of 100 patients each with advanced solid tumor will be evaluated in Part
      2 dose-expansion of IMP7068 monotherapy.
