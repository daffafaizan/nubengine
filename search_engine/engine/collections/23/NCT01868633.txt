      operating room for their scheduled cesarean delivery. They will have their routine spinal
      anesthesia with the dosages of drugs used standardized, and a standardized regimen to manage
      hypotension. After delivery of the baby the subjects will be administered either the study
      drug or placebo depending on the randomization. The subjects will then be prescribed a
      standard post-operative analgesia regimen. The subjects will then be interviewed at 12,24 and
      48 hours post cesarean delivery. During the interview the subjects will be asked to rate
      their pain, nausea and vomiting and pruritus. They will also be asked to rate their quality
      of recovery from the surgery using Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire. The subjects will be
      contacted 6 months after the study to rate their pain using a Short-Form McGill Pain
      Questionnaire
