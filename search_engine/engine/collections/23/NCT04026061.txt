      consisting of a selection tool to help persons with dementia find usable apps for
      self-management and meaningful activities and a training that supports informal carers to
      employ errorless learning principles to help people with dementia to learn how to use the
      tablet and the tool.

      An exploratory pilot randomized controlled trial was carried out with a mixed-methods design.
      Twenty persons with mild dementia and carer dyads were randomly assigned to the FindMyApps
      group (n = 10) that used the FindMyApps training and selection tool, or a control condition
      that just got a tablet (n = 10). After informal carers had received the training, the dyads
      in the experimental group started with the three-month intervention. Pre and post-test
      measurements consisted of questionnaires and post-test semi-structured interviews.
