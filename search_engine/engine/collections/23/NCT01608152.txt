      I. Develop a prototype intervention electronic game that implements a baseline testable
      feature set, including features for social networking within a virtual game space, managing
      an intermittent mediated reward cycle, goal setting and tracking, and collaborative problem
      solving.

      II. Evaluate the technical merit, feasibility, user perception and acceptance of the
      prototype system with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCTs) patients in recovery.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients attend a focus group for up to 1.5 hours and provide feedback on design
      elements, specific desirable features, and preferences for the initial prototype.

      GROUP II: Patients have access to the game for 3 weeks and then provide feedback on problems
      or questions regarding the use of the prototype.
