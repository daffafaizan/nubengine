    
      This research study is a non-randomized, open-label Phase Ib clinical trial evaluating
      venetoclax (Ven) administered orally daily in combination with pegcrisantaspase (PegC)
      administered IV biweekly, as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in adult subjects with relapsed
      or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML).

      The trial will consist of dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ven-PegC
      and estimate the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and/or biologically active doses (e.g.
      recommended phase 2 doses [RP2Ds]) of Ven-PegC in patients with R/R AML

      Venetoclax is an FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved drug, but this
      combination ( Ven-PegC) has not been approved by the FDA.
