      management for decades. However, recent prospective adult studies have challenged this
      practice, linking high volume crystalloid resuscitation to increased mortality,
      cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal and hematologic complications. A retrospective study the
      investigators recently performed at their quaternary-care children's hospital echoed these
      results. High quality prospective data is necessary to determine best practice guidelines in
      our pediatric surgery and trauma patients.

      Currently, no standard exists to guide management of crystalloid fluid administration in
      trauma patients. Both liberal and restricted strategies are in use, dependent on physician
      discretion. The investigators propose the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a
      liberal to a restricted fluid management strategy in critically ill pediatric trauma
      patients. The objective of this comparative effectiveness study is to conduct a multicenter
      (around 10 sites) randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether liberal or
      restricted fluid administration leads to better outcomes in these patients.
