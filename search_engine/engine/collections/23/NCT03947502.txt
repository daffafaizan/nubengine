    
      Methodology of the project In group sessions of 14 patients, a health professional explained
      the neurological mechanisms that are behind the perception of pain, fatigue and illness from
      the recent knowledge in neuroscience about brain and pain, as well as the brain's ability to
      change patienÂ´s behaviour thanks to neuroplasticity.

      There will be 5 sessions of 2 hours per week and another one per month. Before the latter, a
      workshop of 2 hours of movement will be given.

      Each week the contents of the class and other complementary materials will be sent to the
      patients.
