      (PrCa) risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a means of offering targeted screening
      for PrCa in men at a genetically higher risk. Initially, 300 men will be recruited via
      participating General Practices (GPs). Men aged 55-69 years who are likely to be eligible for
      the study will be identified by GPs from medical records. Participants will be contacted via
      invitation letters from GPs and if interested in the study will be asked to fill in a
      questionnaire to confirm eligibility to participate. This questionnaire can be completed in
      hard copy and men will also be given the option to fill in an online version. If eligible,
      men will then be sent a DNA collection saliva kit. DNA from saliva will be analysed with SNP
      profiling for the known 170 clinically relevant SNPs. Men with a genetic risk equivalent to
      the top 10% of the population distribution (approximately 30 men in total) will be invited
      for a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsy, plus further biological samples. Biopsy
      results will be correlated with the genetic score. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other
      biomarkers will be integrated into results to assess combined effects of genetic score and
      markers.
