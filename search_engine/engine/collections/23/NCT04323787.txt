      patterns to allow evaluations of safety and observational effectiveness of COVID-19 practices
      and to determine the variations in practice across hospitals.

      Such a set of standards would increase the quality of single and multi-center studies,
      national registries as well as aggregation syntheses such as meta-analyses. It will also be
      of utmost importance in tiring times of public health emergencies and will help understand
      practice variability and outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic.
