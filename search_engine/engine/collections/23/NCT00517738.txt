      health-related quality of life (QOL), as it has been shown with the use of questionnaires
      such as Short-Form-36 (SF-36) and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ). The
      deterioration in QOL is progressively accentuated as liver failure advances. There is a
      positive association between the level of physical activity and the sense of QOL, and
      physical training programs have proved to be useful in improving QOL in cardiovascular and
      pulmonary diseases, and in conditions affecting cognition. Thereby, it is hypothesized that a
      physical training program may improve QOL and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with
      cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Data supporting physical activity as a way to improve
      hepatic encephalopathy derives from experimental models showing that skeletal muscle is able
      to remove blood ammonia, presumably by inducing the enzyme glutamine synthetase. However, it
      is uncertain whether such a program is safe, or if it can lead to an increase in portal
      hypertension and progression of the disease.
