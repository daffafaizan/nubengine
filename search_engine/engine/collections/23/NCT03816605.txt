    
      Women who choose to terminate pregnancy because of maternal factors at the first and second
      trimester, or delivered at term in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University
      were enrolled in the study.

      Samples for measurement were obtained from women undergoing induced abortion or caesarean
      section. The villous trophoblast extracted from the placental villus were treated with
      recombinant FGF19, high glucose medium or both recombinant FGF19 and high glucose medium or
      neither. By the end of culture, mRNA and protein expression levels of IRS-1/GLUT-1 were
      investigated with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
      western-blot, respectively. Clinical data were collected and analyzed.

      Data were analyzed by SPSS20.0 database. The results were expressed as mean Â± standard
      deviations, median or rate. Differences between groups were assessed by Student's unpaired t
      test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square test as appropriate. P values of <0.05 were
      considered significant.
