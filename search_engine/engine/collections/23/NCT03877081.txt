      inflammatory reaction play a key role in its pathogenesis, when this condition is present it
      is highly related to poor clinical outcomes and higher mortality rates. There is no current
      specific treatment, and the therapeutic approach is more orientated to complication
      management. In this study, the investigators propose the use of probiotics to improve the
      clinical evolution of septic acute kidney injury patients.
