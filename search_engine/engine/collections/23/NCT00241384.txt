      each year. Of those, 70% have stage T1 or T2 disease (apparently limited to the prostate
      gland). Clinically localized prostate cancer is a spectrum of disease, ranging from good
      prognosis to poor prognosis. Patients with a PSA above 10 ng/ml or Gleason score of 7 to 10
      are referred to as intermediate risk, with approximately an 80% chance of cure.

      Implantation of radioactive sources directly into the prostate (brachytherapy) delivers a
      high, localized radiation dose while sparing most the of the bladder and rectum.
      Brachytherapy is well established for other tumor sites, and has become a standard treatment
      for prostate cancer.

      Establishing that a good quality implant alone is as effective as implant plus beam radiation
      will allow us to routinely drop the use of beam radiation, a change in policy that will
      decrease the risk of some complications, will be more convenient for patients, and will lower
      treatment costs.
