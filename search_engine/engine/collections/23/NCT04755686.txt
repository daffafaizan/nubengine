      among the oldest and have many complicating diseases. The one-year mortality after hip
      fracture is 20%. Due to the complexity including many comorbidities in these patients, it is
      of great value that the care of these patients is optimal.

      Today, most of the patients with suspected hip fracture in the catchment area of Sahlgrenska
      University hospital, Gothenburg, are transported directly to the radiology unit. Thereafter,
      the patient waits in the emergency room (ER) for an othopedic examination before being
      admitted to primarily a geriatric medicine ward where they wait for the operation. The
      average waiting time in the ER is today around four hours. The current scientific evidence
      for fast-tracking hipfracture patients is limited. The aim of our randomized controlled trial
      is to determine the effect of fast-tracking hip fracture patients at geraitric medicine wards
      compared to standard care regarding complication rate (primary endpoint), lenght of hospital
      stay and time to operation (secondary outcomes).
