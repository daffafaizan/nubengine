      experiments. Vitamin D affects gene expression related to breast cancer and prevents cell
      differentiation, growth and angiogenesis . Low vitamin D may include a high risk of breast
      cancer, but there are also studies reporting that patients with low vitamin D levels at the
      time of diagnosis show more aggressive breast cancer course . Breast cells can produce
      vitamin D by taking part in the formation of 1,25 OH vit D3 in vitamin D synthesis as well as
      in kidney cells. Apoptosis can be caused by vitamin D receptors . There are very few studies
      on the effect of vitamin D replacement on breast cancer-related survival. There are studies
      reporting the incidence of fewer breast cancer with vitamin D replacement in contrast to
      there are studies showing the opposite .Patients achieved pathological complete response
      (PCR) with neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to have better survival. There are studies
      showing that they do not affect the PCR ratio related to the level of vitamin D in breast
      cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In one study, it was shown that it
      increases the response rate when given with bisphosphonate .There is no study evaluating
      pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy with vitamin D replacement in patients with
      breast cancer. The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between the vitamin D
      replacement and pathological response in patients undergoing neo-adjuvant therapy according
      to different molecular subtypes of biopsy-diagnosed breast cancer patients.
