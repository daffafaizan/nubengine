      administered as 2 IVT injections separated by 4 weeks. Approximately 15-29 subjects will be
      enrolled. An interim analysis of the initial set of 15 participants may be conducted. Based
      on this analysis, an additional 10-14 participants may be enrolled at a 1:1 ratio to receive
      one of the two dose levels.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat IVT injections of
      ANX007 in participants with primary open-angle glaucoma. Secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the anterior chamber fluid pharmacokinetics (PK) of ANX007, PD effect of ANX007 on anterior
      chamber fluid C1q activity, and immunogenicity. An exploratory objective will evaluate ocular
      PD effect of ANX007.
