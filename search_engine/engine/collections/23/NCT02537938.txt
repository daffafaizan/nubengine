      pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple (14 days), oral doses of NGP 555 in healthy volunteers.

      NGP 555 has been created for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NGP 555 is being
      developed to prevent Abeta 42 amyloid formation, a protein that is likely a key factor in the
      development of AD.
