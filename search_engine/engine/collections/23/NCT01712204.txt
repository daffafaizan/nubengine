      monoclonal antibody) can reduce the frequency of gout flares during the initial period of
      treatment with urate-lowering therapy and prevent of gout flares in gout patients with
      frequent flares. AC-201 is an oral IL-1 modulator but with a mechanism distinct from that of
      existing anti-IL-1 agents. The active metabolite of AC-201 has been shown in vitro and in
      vivo to inhibit the production and activity of IL-1, down-regulate IL-1 receptors, and
      increase IL1-Ra. Molecular research further suggests that these effects are mediated upstream
      via inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways and binding of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors
      that encode for a range of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8,
      iNOS, and MMPs, which have been implicated in gout flares. AC-201 has also been demonstrated
      to have uric acid-lowering effects in clinical trials. The favorable product profile of
      AC-201 overall provides a strong rationale for investigating its clinical utility as
      prophylaxis against flares when initiating ULT.
