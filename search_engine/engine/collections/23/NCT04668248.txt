      program for providers based on underlying principles of System 1 and System 2 thinking
      reduces prescribing of high-risk medications for hospitalized older adults versus control,
      with the ultimate goal of improving patient safety. Subsequent prescribing for patients cared
      for by other providers and other adoption and implementation outcomes will be measured to
      explore the extent to which the intervention could be used at scale.

      36 interns practicing on the general medicine inpatient service at Brigham and Women's
      Hospital will be assigned to the "twilight" team. Interns who consent will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to one of 2 arms: (a) Arm 1: simulation training and (b) Arm 2: control (online
      educational training).

      Patients who will be included in the analysis will include adults â‰¥65 years old who are
      admitted to the BWH/BWFH general medicine service under the care of one of the consenting
      interns (specifically, with the intern listed as the "Responding Clinician")
