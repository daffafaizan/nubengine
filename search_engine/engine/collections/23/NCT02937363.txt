    
      In a randomized double-blind, crossover design, 12 adult volunteers with G6PD deficiency of
      both sexes will be supplemented with either 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid (experimental
      condition - EC) or placebo (control condition - CC) every day for 4 weeks. Before
      intervention, all participants will be informed about the study protocol, fill a medical
      history questionnaire and sign an informed consent form. Moreover, measurements of
      anthropometric characteristics and physiological parameters, as well as a VO2max test will be
      performed.

      Participants will perform 4 trials of exercise (70% VO2max for 45min and 90% till exhaustion)
      before and after each condition. Blood samples will be collected before, immediately after
      and 1 hour after exercise. Moreover, measurements of anthropometric characteristics and
      physiological parameters will be performed before and after each condition. There will be a
      washout period of at 4 weeks between conditions.
