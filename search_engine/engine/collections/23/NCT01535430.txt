    
      Any patient with a primary or metastatic brain tumor in or near an eloquent area would be
      eligible for participation in the study assuming no contraindications to any of the studies
      or operative procedure.

      Pre-operative:

      Evaluation will include clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, MRI brain with and
      without contrast, fMRI, DTI tractograms, and MEG studies as well as standard pre-operative
      work-up.

      Intra-operative:

      All non-invasive pre-operative mapping data will be incorporated into the operative procedure
      with the imaging tools that we routinely use during neurosurgical procedures. Patients will
      have awake mapping performed. Our usual standards of care will be followed during craniotomy,
      mapping, and tumor resection or biopsy.

      Post-operative:

      Patients will have routine post-operative care and assessment consisting of clinical
      examinations and imaging obtained within 24 hours post resection. They will have routine
      follow-up outpatient appointments after surgery which will include neurologic assessment and
      follow-up imaging (MRI with and without contrast) for their tumors as appropriate. The
      experimental portion of the protocol is incorporating repeat neuropsychological testing and
      mapping studies (fMRI, DTI, MEG) studies at 2 and 6 months post-surgery into their routine
      follow-up.
