      The original goals of this pilot study were to assess whether: (1) manganese-enhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) using mangafodipir trisodium, a contrast agent that enters
      the intracellular compartment, can detect multiple sclerosis-related tissue damage in the
      retina, optic nerve, and brain; and (2) the MRI effects of manganese are detectable in the
      basal ganglia one month following administration. With amendment F, the retina and optic
      nerve portions of the study have been eliminated, and we have modified our focus to
      examination of participants with multiple sclerosis and MRI evidence of abnormal permeability
      to gadolinium. In these individuals, mangafodipir may allow assessment of brain connectivity
      that is not possible to achieve with a gadolinium-based contrast agent, which remains in the
      extracellular space.

      Study Population

      Up to 15 healthy volunteers and up to 15 participants with multiple sclerosis.

      Design

      The first phase of the study involved healthy volunteers and focuses on optimizing our
      imaging protocol. The second phase studies participants with multiple sclerosis. With
      amendment F, the focus has shifted to evaluating participants with multiple sclerosis and
      evidence of gadolinium enhancement on contrast-enhanced brain MRI.

      We have completed enrollment of 15 healthy volunteers. With Amendment G, we will remove
      references to the enrollment and screening procedures for healthy volunteers.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome measure is T1-weighted signal intensity, measured: (1) in the retina,
      optic nerve, and brain at early time points after mangafodipir administration; and (2) in the
      basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and whole brain one month following administration.
