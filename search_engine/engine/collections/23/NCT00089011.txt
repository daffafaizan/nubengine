    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidence of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after
      conditioning with 200 centigray (cGy) TBI alone or Fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)/200
      cGy TBI followed by tacrolimus (Tac)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) immunosuppression in
      patients with hematologic malignancies.

      II. To estimate the incidence of chronic extensive GVHD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidences of graft rejection.

      II. To estimate overall survival 1-year after conditioning.

      III. To evaluate the incidences of grades II-IV acute GVHD.

      IV. To evaluate the rates of disease progression and/or relapse-related mortality.

      V. To estimate the rate and duration of steroid use for the treatment of chronic GVHD.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (nonmyeloablative conditioning with fludarabine phosphate and TBI): Patients receive
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      ARM II (nonmyeloablative conditioning with TBI): Patients undergo TBI on day 0.

      All patients then undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0 and
      receive tacrolimus orally (PO) every 12 hours on days -3 to 180, with taper on day 56, or
      tacrolimus IV if unable to tolerate PO; and mycophenolate mofetil PO every 12 hours on days
      0-27 or mycophenolate mofetil IV if unable to tolerate PO.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
