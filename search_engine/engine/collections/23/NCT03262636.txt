      for measuring cardiac output, hepatic function, liver blood flow and ophthalmic angiography
      and has been in use for over 60 years [14]. This protocol utilizes Patheon's indocyanine
      green, NDC 17238-424. The chemical formula is C45H47N2O6S2Na and the compound has a molecular
      weight of 774.96Da (CAS number 3599-32-4). It has a peak absorption in the NIR spectrum at
      800nm and maximal emission at 835nm. Indocyanine green is rapidly and completely bound to
      plasma proteins (especially albumin) after intravenous (IV) injection in the blood [15].

      Indocyanine Green for Injection USP is a sterile, lyophilized green powder containing 25 mg
      of indocyanine green with no more than 5% sodium iodide. It is packaged with Sterile Water
      for Injection, USP, which is used to dissolve the indocyanine green, and is to be
      administered intravenously
