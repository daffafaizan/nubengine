      from the Inside Out (MIO), the first evidence-based parenting intervention designed to be
      delivered by addiction counselors in addiction treatment settings where parents of young
      children are enrolled in treatment. MIO is a weekly individual parenting therapy developed as
      an enhancement to standard addiction treatment that targets the addicted mother's capacity to
      recognize and regulate her own emotional distress during stressful parenting situations so
      that she can support her child's developing capacity for emotional and behavioral regulation.
      This capacity, called reflective functioning (RF), is a psychological skill that promotes
      abstinence and also helps parents foster their young children's secure attachment. Now that
      MIO has demonstrated efficacy in two randomized efficacy trials, the next step will be to
      conduct a new Stage III community-based efficacy trial where addiction counselors are trained
      to deliver MIO and PE with fidelity in an addiction treatment setting and to evaluate
      treatment outcomes and mechanisms of change in this community setting. At the end of this
      trial, if MIO demonstrates efficacy, all the necessary materials will be ready to train
      addiction counselors across a broad range of treatment settings in a Stage IV effectiveness
      trial. 120 mothers in addiction treatment and caring for children ages 11 - 60 months will be
      randomized to 12 sessions of MIO vs PE with a trained addiction counselor and fidelity will
      be monitored and maintained for treatment duration. It is expected that MIO-assigned mothers
      will demonstrate greater improvement in the primary targeted outcome - reflective functioning
      at week 12 (end of treatment) and week 33 (end of follow up). It is also predicted that
      MIO-assigned mothers will demonstrate greater improvement in secondary outcomes, including
      maternal sensitivity, caregiving behavior, psychiatric distress, depression and substance use
      at week 12 (end of treatment) and week 33 (end of follow up). Finally, it is predicted that
      children of MIO-assigned mothers will demonstrate greater improvement in the secondary
      outcome - attachment security - at week 12 (end of treatment) and week 33 (end of follow up).
