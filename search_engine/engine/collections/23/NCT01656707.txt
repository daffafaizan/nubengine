      poor response to treatment and the prevention of relapse. Results from the study may support
      Adaptive Treatment as an efficacious approach for youth with Cannabis Use Disorder who are
      poor responders to treatment.

      Poor responders fall into two categories, those who failed to achieve a negative drug
      urinalysis during the last session of the initial MET/CBT-7 treatment they attended, and
      those who either dropped out or were administratively discharged at any time during the
      initial MET/CBT-7 treatment.
