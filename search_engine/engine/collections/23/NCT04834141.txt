      Kyphosis is roughly a slight forward curvature of the spine. A slight kyphosis or posterior
      curvature is normal throughout the human body and is present in every individual.
      Hyperkyphotic is a kyphotic angle greater than 40Â° commonly measured on a lateral X-ray
      measured by the Cobb method between C7 and T12. Postural stability or balance is the ability
      to keep the center of mass within the boundaries of the support base. Moving the center of
      mass beyond the boundaries of the support base may cause postural instability and loss of
      balance. There are studies showing that kyphotic posture affects the center of gravity and
      affects fall in the elderly, but there are limited studies on the effect of balance in young
      individuals.

      The Aim of This Study Is:

      To study the correlation between the balance and severity of thoracic kyphosis will be
      investigated
