      shot of IFN under the skin. On day 4, patients will be given ABVD through a vein over
      one-hour.

      The plan is for patients to receive 12 cycles of treatment. However, patients will leave the
      study if they have severe side effects or if the cancer grows or spreads. They will also
      leave if the cancer does not improve after 6 cycles. Patient who leave the study will be
      offered other treatments. A maximum of 35 patients will be treated with that dose.

      Before the first treatment, patient will have a physical exam, blood tests, and a heart scan.
      Within 1 month of starting treatment, patients will have a chest X-ray, CT scans of the
      abdomen and pelvis, and a gallium scan.

      During the study, patient will have blood tests every week and a physical exam every 2 weeks.
      The X-ray, CT scans, and gallium scan will be repeated after cycles 6 and 12.

      All the drugs in this study are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are
      available by prescription. ABVD is a standard treatment for Hodgkin's disease; IFN is an
      investigational treatment for Hodgkin's disease. About 35 patients will be enrolled in the
      study. All treatment will be given in the outpatient clinic at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
