      provides contraceptive protection for three years. In addition to the progestogen, Nexplanon
      contains barium sulfate and a Next Generation Implanon Applicator (NGIA). Nexplanon was
      developed to further facilitate correct insertion of the implant by using the NGIA, and to
      extend the diagnostic modalities for localization of the implant by making it radiopaque and
      visible via X-ray imaging and X-ray Computerized Tomography (CT).

      A large, descriptive, prospective, non-interventional, observational cohort study is planned
      to follow a cohort of new users of the contraceptive implant Nexplanon. Women will be
      recruited through health care professionals who have completed the Nexplanon Clinical
      Training Program. Baseline and follow-up information will be collected via a
      self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis will include characterizing the frequency of
      specific insertion-, localization- and removal-related events via point-estimates of the
      event rate as well as 95% confidence intervals. The impact of potential prognostic factors
      will be analyzed using multivariate regression models and/or stratified analyses.
