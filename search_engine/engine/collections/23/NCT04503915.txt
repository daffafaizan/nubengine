      increasing estrogen dose protocol on live birth rate of HRT-FET cycles.

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Women undergoing HRT-FET will be recruited
      and randomized to use a constant estrogen dose protocol and a step-wise increasing estrogen
      dose protocol.

      Participation in the study is totally voluntary. The subjects can withdraw from the study at
      any time and they will still receive standard medical care.

      Women being scheduled for HRT-FET will be assessed for eligibility. Eligible women will be
      recruited in the study and each woman will only be included in the study once.

      Informed written consent will be obtained prior to recruitment. The baseline characteristics
      will be collected. Transvaginal ultrasound will be done to measure the endometrial thickness
      on the day of progesterone supplementation. Embryo transfer will be performed 3 days or 5
      days after progesterone use, depending on replacement of cleaving stage embryos or
      blastocysts respectively.
