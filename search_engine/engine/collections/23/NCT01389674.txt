      echocardiography within the exploration. By this ultrasound we will measure the LV mass and
      the ejection fraction per apical 2-, 3- and 4-chamber view.

      In addition a 2D-strain-analysis will be done to measure the systolic and diastolic strain
      and also the circumferential and radial strain rate parameter (by depicting three parasternal
      short axis views in the basal, mid-ventricular and apical plane).

      These measurements will be compared with the studies-conditioned MRI-finding (as reference)
      to find the optimal strain-parameter and the optimal cut-off-data for an intraprocedural
      vitality diagnostics of the single layers (endocardial, myocardial, and epicardial) for this
      patient group.

      The data upraised through this are compared off-line to the MRI findings.
