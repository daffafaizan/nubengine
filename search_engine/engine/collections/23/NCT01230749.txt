    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      investigator nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), multicenter
      (study conducted at multiple sites), and placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with
      a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) and active
      comparator (an established effective treatment that is compared with a medication to test
      whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) controlled study (placebo or
      active comparator is compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication
      has a real effect in clinical study). The study consists of 4 phases: screening phase (45
      days before administration of study medication); pre-dosing run-in phase (a phase before a
      clinical study is commenced when no treatment is given. In this study, participant's glucose
      level will be observed during run-in-phase: days 15 to 1 before administration of study
      medication); treatment phase, and follow-up phase (7 to 10 days after the last dose of the
      study medication). Approximately 88 participants will be enrolled in this study. All
      participants will be randomly assigned to 4 treatment arms: JNJ-41443532 250 mg; JNJ-41443532
      1000 mg; pioglitazone arm; and placebo. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse
      events including ocular assessments, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital
      signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The maximum
      study duration for each participant will be approximately 12 weeks.
