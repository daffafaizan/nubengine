    
      A school-based behavioral intervention for Mexican youth with attention/behavior concerns
      (the Collaborative Life Skills Program for Latinos/Familias Unidades Empezando Retos y Tareas
      para el Ã‰xito [CLS-FUERTE]:) will be pilot-tested in a mixed-method investigation with four
      Mexican elementary schools.

      Participants will include 24-32 students (n = 6-8 per 4 schools) in participating schools.
      School personnel will help identify students with and at-risk for
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with at least one caretaker and teacher able
      to participate in the intervention. Students must be in 1st-6th grade at a participating
      school and must demonstrate clinically significant attention/behavioral concerns and related
      impairment as rated by caretakers and teachers. Caretakers and teachers must be able to
      attend program sessions held at the child's school over an approximately 6-week period.
      Through a school-clustered random assignment design, two schools will be selected to receive
      CLS-FUERTE during the fall of the 2016-2017 school year and two schools will be selected to
      receive school services as usual while waiting to receive CLS-FUERTE the spring of the
      2016-2017 school year. Caregivers and teachers of students will complete questionnaires about
      child behavior and family functioning and caregivers will participate in focus groups at 4
      time points regardless of treatment assignment: Pre (prior to random assignment), Post 1
      (following CLS-FUERTE in the fall cohort), Post 2 (following CLS-FUERTE for in spring
      cohort), and Follow-up (at the end of the school year).

      Feasibility and acceptability of CLS-FUERTE will be examined via participation enrollment,
      attendance, and engagement ratings and focus group feedback. Improvement in satisfaction with
      school services and youth outcomes will be examined and estimates of effect sizes will be
      used to support future scaled-up investigation.
