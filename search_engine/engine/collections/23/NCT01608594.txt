      response to therapeutic interventions, such as ipilimumab. Neoadjuvant ipilimumab therapy for
      high-risk melanoma patients with bulky regional stage IIIB-C lymphadenopathy may result in
      improved clinical outcome in this group of patients that are more likely to respond to
      immunotherapeutic interventions and without increased morbidity. Through the design of
      neoadjuvant trials in which it is possible to obtain biopsy samples, a greater understanding
      of the dynamic interaction between tumors and the immune system is possible. This should lead
      to the identification of new targets for the treatment of melanoma and aid in the development
      of new combinations that may have greater efficacy and acceptable toxicity, to build on the
      clinical, immunologic, and molecular effect of this therapy for patients with melanoma.
