      analysis. It will be used to assess changes in perfusion in response to a number of
      physiological stimuli. It will be compared to other standard diagnostics including
      ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index and transcutaneous oxygen measurement. Measurements
      will be undertaken in non-vascular patients as well as those with chronic limb threatening
      ischaemia.
