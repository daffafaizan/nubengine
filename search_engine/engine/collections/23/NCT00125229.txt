    
      This is a study comparing effects of two hypertonic solutions (mannitol, 6.4% hypertonic
      saline) on intracranial hypertension, cerebral blood flow, serum/urine osmolarity in patients
      with increased intracranial pressure caused by traumatic brain injury. The study is conducted
      during first 72 hours after the injury without any interference with standard medical
      treatment as performed at the institution. When the hypertonic solution is indicated by
      caregiver, the study team is informed and performs a set of physiologic bedside measurements
      including evaluation of cerebral blood flow and changes in plasma and urine osmolarity. The
      study is noninvasive and the study protocol does not hamper, in any way, standard care of
      treatment for these patients.
