      population. Although normal afferent feedback is crucial for adequate O2 delivery during
      exercise, excessive neural feedback has substantial negative consequences. HF patients are
      characterized by augmented neural feedback arising from overactive muscle afferents. It has
      been hypothesized that this abnormality compromises locomotor muscle O2 delivery in these
      patients. Therefore, the abnormally elevated muscle afferent feedback in HF might exacerbate,
      compared to healthy age- and activity matched individuals (CTRLs), the development of both
      peripheral (via limiting O2 delivery) and central (via restricting CMD) fatigue during
      exercise. Recent advances in non-invasive stimulation techniques offer a genuine opportunity
      to identify the sites and synaptic mechanisms that mediate central and peripheral fatigue
      including alterations in the responsiveness of the corticospinal tract (i.e. a determinant of
      central fatigue). Taken together, the proposed studies aim to determine the impact of HF on
      the precise development of central and peripheral fatigue during both whole body and single
      muscle exercise and evaluate the extent to which group III/IV muscle afferents contribute to
      this development.
