      increasing the fat and caloric content of human milk. specifically, we will test the
      following hypotheses:1) at constant caloric intake, 2 high fat (40% fat, 45% CHO) diets (
      margarine e nriched versus butter enriched) lead to higher fat and caloric content of human
      milk than the low fat diet (5% fat, 80% CHO); and 2) All 3 groups will have strikingly
      different milk fatty acid profiles (mirroring the dietary fatty acid profile).
