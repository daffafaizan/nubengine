      consent may participate in the study.

      Safety Cohort Prior to initiation of the randomized trial, 8 to 12 patients will be enrolled
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP2215 given with azacitidine therapy in the
      study population.

      Randomized Trial Approximately 250 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive
      ASP2215 plus azacitidine (Arm AC) or azacitidine only (Arm C). Patients will enter the
      screening period up to 14 days prior to the start of treatment. Patients will be administered
      treatment over 28-day cycles.

      Earlier protocol versions included a 1:1:1 randomization ratio to receive Arm A: ASP2215, Arm
      AC: ASP2215 + azacitidine or Arm C: azacitidine. Patients previously randomized to Arm A
      should continue following treatment and assessments as outlined in the protocol.
