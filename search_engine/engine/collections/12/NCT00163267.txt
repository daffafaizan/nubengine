      peripheral vascular disease. Currently there are no data about the amount of platelet
      activation during peripheral arterial intervention, the effect of clopidogrel on platelet
      adhesion and its clinical impact.

      Patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease receive placebo or clopidogrel before the
      intervention and for 6 months in follow-up. Platelet activation, the effect on macro-and
      microcirculation will be assessed as well as clinical endpoints.
