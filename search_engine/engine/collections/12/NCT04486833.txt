    
      GEN-104 is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating quaratusugene ozeplasmid
      (GPX-001) plus osimertinib versus monotherapy osimertinib in patients with advanced
      metastatic or recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

      Toxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using United States National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Serious Adverse
      Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety
      Monitoring Board.

      Phase 1 - Dose Escalation: The prospective maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with
      osimertinib, identified in the Dose Escalation phase will be confirmed in at least 6 patients
      to obtain additional safety and anti-tumor activity data. This confirmed GPX-001 dose will be
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) used in Phase 2.

      Phase 2: In the this Phase, GPX-001 in combination with osimertinib will be further evaluated
      using the RP2D identified in Phase 1. Patients will be randomized to receive either
      combination therapy or osimertinib alone in a 1 to 1 ratio and stratified based on prior
      local radiotherapy. Other subsets may be explored based on emergent data.
