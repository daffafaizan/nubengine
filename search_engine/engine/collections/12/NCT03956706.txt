      possible to reduce tumor bulk without causing deficits, followed by temozolomide chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy to the surgical area plus an additional 1-2 cm margin around this
      cavity. Despite advances in surgical techniques and radiation delivery, 80% of tumors recur
      at the margins of the surgery, within the regions that were treated with radiation.

      In 2014, different institutions found patients lived longer if part of the brain that looked
      normal received radiation therapy. This region was called the "subventricular zone" and was
      known to contain embryonic stem cells that formed the brain. Researchers believed this region
      contained cancer stem cells promoting tumor survival and growth. Some studies suggested this
      area might even represent another reservoir of malignant tumor cells.

      During participation in this clinical trial, targeted radiation to the subventricular zone is
      given in addition to standard of care radiation and chemotherapy. The subventricular zone is
      divided into four regions and one of four regions on the same side as the tumor is treated,
      not the whole subventricular zone. Only patients scheduled to receive six weeks of standard
      therapy are eligible for participation. The additional radiation therapy is delivered over
      the course of one day. The study is not randomized and all patients will receive the
      experimental treatment. Patients complete regular evaluations over the next two years to
      monitor toxicity, which is the main concern of this Phase I study.
