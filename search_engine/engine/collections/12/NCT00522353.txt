      chronic diseases as well as, large health care costs. Although obesity is a multifactorial
      disease, it is known that levels of satiety hormones including glucagon like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) are reduced in obesity. The ability of prebiotic fiber to
      promote weight loss through the production of satiety hormones has been tested previously
      using rodents. Here it was found that prebiotic supplementation resulted in a decreased
      energy intake, higher GLP-1 levels in the plasma and increased proglucagon mRNA levels in the
      gut. This study will address the important question of whether prebiotic fiber
      supplementation is effective in reducing body weight in overweight or obese human subjects.
