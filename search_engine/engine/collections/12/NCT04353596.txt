      countries. Experimental studies show that the SARS-CoV2 virus enters human cells via the
      angiotensin converting enzyme II receptor 2 (ACE2). ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin
      receptor blockers (ARB) can lead to an increase in the expression of ACE2. Therefore, there
      is concern that in patients treated with ACEI or ARB, the absorption of the virus is
      facilitated, thereby accelerating its spread in the body.

      ACEI-COVID tests the hypothesis that stopping chronic ACEI / ARB therapy in
      SARS-CoV2-infected patients improves outcomes.
