      I. To determine the effect of escalating doses of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) given
      pre-operatively on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess toxicity of escalating doses of metformin given pre-operatively in patients with
      resectable pancreatic carcinoma.

      II. To measure the effect of metformin on the expression of phosphorylated acetyl-CoA
      carboxylase alpha (ACC), phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine
      kinase) (mTOR), and pancreatic cancer stem cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo observation.

      GROUP II: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least
      7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride as in Group II.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 days.
