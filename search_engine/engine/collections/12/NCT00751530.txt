      and data abstracted. A comparison of the response to treatment by viral load measurement with
      raltegravir will be compared in patients whose regimens contained a protease inhibitor (PI)
      with those that did not contain a PI. Other endpoints will also be assessed including percent
      of patients with viral loads less than 400 copies/ml, less than 50 copies/ ml, CD4 cell
      changes, consequences of failure of raltegravir and use of predictive parameters such as GSS
      and PSS.
