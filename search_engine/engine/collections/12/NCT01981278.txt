    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), 2-way crossover (method used to
      switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study) study of a single
      dose of 250-mg tapentadol. All participants will receive in randomized order the TRF tablet
      and PR2 tablet, both as a single dose of 250 mg tapentadol. Approximately 64 participants
      will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 2 to
      21 days before the first study drug administration on Day 1 of Period 1), an open-label
      treatment phase consisting of 2 single-dose treatment periods. Treatment administrations will
      be separated by a washout period of 7 to 14 days. All participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following treatments, 1 in
      each period: Treatment A: tapentadol ER 250-mg TRF tablet, administered as a single oral dose
      under fasted condition and Treatment B: tapentadol ER 250-mg PR2 tablet, administered as a
      single oral dose under fasted condition. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of
      adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical
      laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of participation
      in the study for an individual participant will be up to 5.5 weeks.
