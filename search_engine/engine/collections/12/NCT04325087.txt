      manifestations including intrusions, avoidance behavior, and hyperarousal. Unlike most other
      psychological disorders, a PTSD diagnosis requires a clearly identifiable inciting event. As
      such, preventive interventions in recently traumatized individuals seem promising.

      In this randomized, placebo-controlled study the investigators explore the potential of
      individualized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to reduce trauma-induced intrusive
      thoughts by altering functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (dlPFC) and amygdala. Subjects will undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      session consisting of a resting state scan, an emotion recognition task and an anatomical
      scan at the beginning of the study (day 1). Resting state data will be used to determine
      individualized TMS targets for every subject, depending on functional connectivity between
      the dlPFC and amygdala. Subsequently, the analogue trauma model will be used to induce
      intrusions in healthy subjects. Subjects will be confronted with a video clip from the movie
      "Irreversible" and they will complete online questionnaires in the following three days to
      measure intrusive thoughts, trauma disclosure (i.e. duration of conversations about the
      aversive movie) and sleeping quality. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) will be
      administered directly after the video clip and on the following two days (day 2-4). Cognitive
      tasks will be applied before and after iTBS sessions to examine short-term effects of iTBS on
      a behavioral level. Finally, subjects will undergo a second fMRI session similar to the first
      one, to probe iTBS-induced changes in functional connectivity and emotional processing (day
      5).
