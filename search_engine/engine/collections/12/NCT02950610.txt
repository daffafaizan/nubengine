      relative concentration in health and disease. Metabolic disorders affecting the liver, such
      as NAFLD, produce disproportionate organic compounds produced as a by-product of metabolism
      and thus expired in exhaled breath, excreted in urine and detectable in blood. NAFLD
      prevalence is increasing and has reached epidemic proportions affecting 90% of obese adults
      and 22%-53% of obese children.Liver biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosing NAFLD, but it
      is unpleasant and can lead to complications. There is an unmet need to develop a non-invasive
      method of assessing liver disease. Comon Invent (Delft, Netherlands) together with the
      respiratory department at the Amsterdam Medical Centre (AMC), University of Amsterdam, have
      adapted the electronic nose known as SpiroNose as a prototype device for clinical use.
      Sensitive electronic sensors detect molecules in breath and generate signals. Complex
      algorithms and analytical technics allow pattern recognition of breath samples from different
      subjects. Well charaterised patients will be selected into clinical categories of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with and without cirrhosis and be compared with healthy
      individuals.

      Edinburgh will be the only site conducting this study. In addition to exhaled breath
      analysis, blood and urine will be collected to study the end products of
      metabolism.Furthermore, stool and urine collected from some subjects will be analysed to
      understand the role of gut bacteria in fermentation, metabolic products as a result cause VOC
      production.
