    
      This was a prospective, multi-center, observational registry study evaluating CARTO® XP CFAE
      Software (CFAE Software) in subjects with chronic AF requiring CFAE-guided RFCA. Use of the
      CARTO® 3 System (including CFAE Software) was also allowed. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      the acute success rate of CFAE-guided radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) using the CFAE
      Software. Acute success is defined as the subject achieving sinus rhythm at the end of the
      procedure without electrical or pharmaceutical cardioversion. Secondary endpoints consisted
      of measures of efficacy (example, performance of the CFAE Software) and of safety (example,
      number of procedure-related adverse events).
