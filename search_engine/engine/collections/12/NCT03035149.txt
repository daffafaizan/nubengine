      exercise measurements between obese patients and control subjects with normal weight; then,
      the investigators assessed the effects of medical weight loss in the obese group on these
      parameters. Baseline dyspnea was assessed using the baseline dyspnea index.The effect of
      weight loss on dyspnea was assessed using the transitional dyspnea index. The main
      physiologic measurement of interest was the inspiratory capacity (L, measured at rest and
      during exercise).
