    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding, phase I study of single agent CGM097,
      administered in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed despite standard
      therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. Patients' tumors must be characterized by
      p53wt status.

      The study consists of a dose escalation part, where cohorts of three to six newly enrolled
      patients will receive escalating doses of CGM097, and a dose expansion part, in which
      patients are given CGM097 the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose
      (RP2D). Novartis and the site investigators will jointly decide on each dose escalation step
      based on the recommendation from an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). If
      safety data should indicate a lower increment than suggested by the BLRM, the next dose level
      (DL) will be adjusted accordingly.
