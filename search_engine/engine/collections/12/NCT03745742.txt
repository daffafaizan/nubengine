      Patients with myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) without alteration of left ventricle
      systolic function, agreeing to participate at a cardiac rehabilitation program will be
      included in the study and randomized into two groups:

        -  Group A (= control): standard rehabilitation protocol according to the personal
           functional capacities (measured by a cardiopulmonary test on the beginning of the
           cardiac reeducation.)

        -  Group B (= strategy to the study): individualization of the rehabilitation program
           according to the daily HRV measure and the personal functional capacity (measured by a
           cardiopulmonary test on the program beginning).

      The duration of the rehabilitation program will be 4 weeks with 5 training sessions per week
      (Monday to Friday), or 20 training sessions. At the end of the program, patients will benefit
      from an assessment of functional abilities and their quality of life.
