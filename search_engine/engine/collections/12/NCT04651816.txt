      clinics) will identify pre-diabetic patients to take part in a Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP), modeled after the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) program.

      The DPP is a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program developed specifically to prevent type 2
      diabetes. It is designed for people who have prediabetes or are at risk for type 2 diabetes,
      but who do not already have diabetes. We will be using the DPP distance learning program
      which allows online delivery of classes. A trained lifestyle coach leads the program to help
      subjects change certain aspects of their lifestyle, like eating healthier, reducing stress,
      and getting more physically activity. The program also includes group support. The DPP is a
      year-long program focused on long-term changes and lasting results. Key components of the
      program include a CDC-approved curriculum with lessons, handouts, and other resources; a
      lifestyle coach, specifically trained to lead the program; and a support group of people with
      similar goals and challenges.

      To that end, this study has multiple arms that will test whether participation in the PSH DPP
      - and exposure to motivational messages that encourage physical activity or participation in
      lotteries, an increasingly common strategy for behavioral motivation, - significantly
      improves program retention and health-related outcomes, compared to those who only
      participate in the PSH DPP.
