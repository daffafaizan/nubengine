      of blindness in young adult males.Globally it has been estimated that 1.6 million people are
      blind as a result of ocular trauma with 2.3 million suffering bilateral low vision. Ocular
      trauma is the commonest cause of unilateral blindness in the world today with up to 19
      million with unilateral blindness or low vision. It is estimated that almost one million
      people in the United States live with trauma-related visual impairment. Ocular trauma has
      extensive socio-economic costs - patients with open globe injuries lose a mean of 70 days of
      work. In the United States work related eye injuries cost over $300 million per year
      (www.prevent blindness.org) this equates to an annual cost to the UK economy (for which no
      comparable data exists) of Â£37.5 million.

      In the UK it is estimated that 5000 patients per year sustain eye injuries serious enough to
      require hospital admission and of these 250 will be permanently blinded in the injured eye.
      Recent European studies document incidences of 2.4 and 3.2 per 100000 per year for open-globe
      injuries which suggests an annual incidence for the UK of between 1500 and 2000.

      Ocular injuries which result in visual loss invariably affect the posterior segment of the
      eye and prevention of visual loss involves posterior segment (vitreoretinal) surgery. It is
      clear from recent published data that although vitreoretinal surgical techniques have
      improved, outcomes remain unsatisfactory and that development of the intraocular scarring
      response proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the leading cause of this.
