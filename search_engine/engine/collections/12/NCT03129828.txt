    
      Cycle 1 (C1): At C1/day d2, there will be a CT- or ultrasound-guided re-biopsy of a lymphoma
      lesion that is accessible for biopsy without considerable risk for the patient.

      Cycle 2 (C2): After C2, a post-Interim CT will be performed (eventually FDG and FLT PET-CT
      imaging added to the protocol by amendment).

      Cycle 3 (C3): At C3/d0 (prior to therapy), there will also be another bone marrow aspirate
      for MRD follow-up. At C3/d2, there will be a re-biopsy of a lymphoma site in case of a
      residual lesion by CT that is accessible for biopsy without considerable risk for the
      patient. Biopsies can be obtained CT- or ultrasound-guided.

      End of treatment/post-therapy: The end-of-treatment visit is required for all subjects,
      irrespective of a completion of all 8 cycles of therapy or exit of the study protocol. It has
      to be scheduled approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the last cycle. A total of 7 Follow up
      visits is planned over 30 months of follow up.
