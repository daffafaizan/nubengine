        -  Estimate the diagnostic yield and positive predictive value of breast magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) for the detection of cancer in women who are at greater than 25% lifetime
           risk for developing breast cancer.

        -  Compare the diagnostic yield and positive predictive value of MRI with conventional
           breast cancer screening (mammography and physical examination) for the detection of
           breast cancer in women with a greater than 25% lifetime risk of developing breast
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive a physical exam within 90 days of initial MRI scan. Patients
      undergo a two view screening mammogram within 3 months prior to study entry. Patients undergo
      an MRI with gadolinium contrast at entry. All lesions identified as suspicious on physical
      examination, mammography, or MRI undergo a core needle or excisional biopsy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
