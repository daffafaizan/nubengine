    
      A prospective, open label, multi-center non-inferiority safety study with an all-comers
      enrollment of patients requiring surgical stapling of the stomach and/or intestine according
      to the labeled indications contained in the approved labeling. Up to 178 subjects consented
      for a 1-month clinical follow-up evaluation will be enrolled. Primary endpoint is to
      statistical non-inferiority of composite major adverse event rate (composite of infection
      (non-dermal), dehiscence, bleeding, and strictures) in study patients when compared to
      composite major adverse event rate (composite of infection (non-dermal), dehiscence,
      bleeding, and strictures) as derived from a comprehensive analysis of the medical literature.
      The comparison will be performed for cumulative events up to 30 days postoperatively.
