      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) and
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when used in combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine side effects and activity of MK-2206 and hydroxychloroquine when used in
      combination.

      II. To determine if hydroxychloroquine alters the pharmacokinetics of MK-2206 due to a
      drug-drug interaction.

      III. To validate biomarkers for autophagy detection.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK-2206.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Beginning on cycle 2,
      patients also receive hydroxychloroquine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
