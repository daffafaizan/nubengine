      multiple clinical study sites in the United States and Germany. Subjects will be
      competitively enrolled at multiple sites until at least 50 invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma
      cases identified by screening colonoscopy and verified by clinical and histopathological
      examination have been enrolled. The primary objective of the investigation is to evaluate and
      describe the clinical performance of the Septin 9 Biomarker for detecting the 50 individuals
      with invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma identified in this population representative of the
      US screening guideline eligible population. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate and
      describe performance characteristics of the biomarker in individuals with adenomatous polyps
      10 mm or larger, flat lesion (s) or non-invasive adenocarcinoma.

      Collaborating sites will identify and contact patients scheduled for screening colonoscopy.
      These patients may be screened by the PI or designee to determine the patients'
      appropriateness for, and interest in, study participation. Study site personnel will meet
      with patients meeting eligibility guidelines and offer them participation. Patients
      interested in participation and who provide written informed consent will be enrolled as
      Subjects in the study.
