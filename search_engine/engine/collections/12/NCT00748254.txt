      nonionizing, noninvasive, laser-based technology, for structural and functional imaging of
      human peripheral joints affected by inflammatory arthritis.

      Combining the advantages of both light and ultrasound scanning, PAT holds promise to present
      objective optical information in subsurface joint tissues with high sensitivity and high
      spatial resolution.

      This could be of considerable help in the early detection of inflammatory joint diseases. PAT
      may also prove useful in further understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders and
      assisting with therapeutic decisions, including assessment of new pharmacological therapies.
