      Test Product

      Once daily group: Asacol® 2.4g daily given as three 800mg tablets orally qAM

      Criteria for Evaluation:

      Primary Outcome Variable: Relapse rate over 1 year in the intention to treat population, with
      the study powered to detect non-inferiority of the once-daily regimen.

      Secondary Outcome Variables: assessment of superiority of the once-daily regimen, if
      non-inferiority is demonstrated; safety analysis; per protocol analysis of relapse rate; time
      course of relapse; medication compliance; changes in modified Baron sigmoidoscopy scores
      between trial entry and relapse/12 month; impact of various factors on relapse rate (time
      from last relapse at study entry, concomitant azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy;
      disease extent; disease duration; smoking status; age at diagnosis; previous dose of
      mesalazine; baseline calprotectin; baseline CRP level).
