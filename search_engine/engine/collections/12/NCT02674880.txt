    
      The objective of this study is to test the effect of HMW-HA on NIV effectiveness in patients
      admitted to a sub-intensive care unit for respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of
      COPD. The design is a parallel-arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical
      trial. Eighty patients, aged eighteen years or older, admitted for respiratory failure
      primarily due to COPD exacerbation and requiring non-invasive ventilation will be enrolled
      and randomized to the study treatment (active or placebo).

      All patients will be treated with NIV delivered using a Hamilton C1 ventilator and medical
      therapy according to current guidelines (inhaled long-acting b2 agonists, inhaled long-acting
      anticholinergic, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics). Patients randomized to
      the active intervention group will also receive HMW-HA (YabroÂ® - 5 ml of saline containing
      0.3% hyaluronic acid sodium salt) via nebulizer b.i.d., while patients randomized in the
      control group will receive a matching placebo. Patients will be treated until weaning or
      until NIV failure, defined as oro-tracheal intubation or death.
