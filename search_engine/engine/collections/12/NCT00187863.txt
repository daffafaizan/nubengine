      of chronic shoulder pain and disability. Previous studies have suggested that specific genes
      influence pain perception. Other studies have suggested that specific psychological factors
      influence pain perception. We plan to investigate both of these factors to see if they
      contribute to the development of chronic shoulder pain and disability.
