      accumulation in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). This two-year study will
      determine if daily oral intake of lipoic acid, a natural supplement, will prove superior to
      placebo in reducing injury to the brain and reducing disability progression in SPMS.
      Neuroprotection will be measured by the extent of brain volume loss seen on MRI, and
      disability will be measured by neurological status and quality of life.
