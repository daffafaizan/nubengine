      eligible to enroll in other tabelecleucel clinical studies, may be enrolled in this study.
      After the screening period, participants will receive intravenous infusions of tabelecleucel
      (1.6 to 2 Ã— 10^6cells/kg) on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of every 35-day cycle. Clinical
      assessment of disease response is recommended approximately 15 days after the last dose of
      tabelecleucel to assess the need for additional treatment. The end of expanded access
      protocol (EAP) visit should be performed at 30 days after the last dose of tabelecleucel.
