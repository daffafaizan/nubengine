      negative breast cancer patients in some phase II clinical trials. Meanwhile, Capecitabine is
      also a highly effective choice for metastatic breast cancer with considerable duration of
      response. Combination of cisplatin and capecitabine have been proved effective in metastatic
      breast cancer in several phase II trials. This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of this combination in triple negative breast cancer patients.
