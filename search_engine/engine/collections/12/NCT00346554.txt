      PROTOCOL: To study the prevalence of insomnia in geriatric COPD patients who are enrolled in
      a pulmonary rehabilitation program.

      I. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

      RATIONALE:

      The goal for geriatric patients with COPD and enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation programs
      is to improve the quality of life. COPD is known to be worse at night as are other
      respiratory problems such as CHF. Saturation is known to get worse nocturnally as well.
      Furthermore, these COPD rehabilitation patients tend to be older, and increasing age is
      associated with an increase in the incidence of sleep disorders. We suspect that there is an
      increase in the incidence of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep in COPD patients. A
      preliminary study was done by the chest medicine specialist in our group, but the results
      were not comparable to national statistics and were inconclusive. We plan to further evaluate
      the geriatric COPD patients in pulmonary rehabilitation with initial screening questionnaire
      and diagnostic screening questionnaires (MMSE, Beck's Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Depression
      Inventory, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale).

      GOALS:

        -  To determine the incidence and prevalence of insomnia (difficulty initiating sleep
           (DIS), and/or difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) in the geriatric population with COPD
           in a rehabilitation program.

        -  To determine how many of these patients suffer from anxiety and/or depression.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      The incidence of insomnia (DIS and/or DMS), along with anxiety/depression is more prevalent
      in geriatric patients with COPD.

      II. BACKGROUND MATERIAL According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), over a
      six-month period, 20 million Americans complained of insomnia.

      COPD patients tend to have decreased total sleep time (32% reported total sleep time less
      than 6 hours). According to previous studies conducted, the following was reported:

        -  15% reported to have insomnia;

        -  28% reported poor quality sleep due to anxiety and/or depression;

        -  12% reported > 3 awakenings due to unknown origin.

      RESULTS OF PILOT:

      In the pilot study, a preliminary general (initial) questionnaire was used and will continue
      to be used as a tool for general screening purposes. And diagnostic questionnaires will be
      used, which are the following:

        -  Beck's Anxiety Inventory

        -  Beck's Depression Inventory

        -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale

        -  MMSE

      III. DRUG INFORMATION

      No drugs are used in this study protocol.

      IV. INCLUSIONARY CRITERIA

      Geriatric patients with COPD enrolled in the rehabilitation program with FEV1<60%.

      V. EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA

      Geriatric patients without a clear diagnosis of COPD. Geriatric patients whose FEV1>60%.
      Geriatric patients who are unable to answer the questionnaire.

      VI. RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES

      Geriatric patients in the HUMC pulmonary rehabilitation program who consent to answer the
      questionnaire and with an FEV1<60% will be enrolled.

      VII. METHODOLOGY

      Screening: Charts will be reviewed to see which patients meet the criteria of the study.

      Informed Consent: If the patient is eligible for diagnostic screening, then an informed
      consent will be taken.

      Randomization: None

      Baseline evaluation: Geriatric patients will be asked the questions in the questionnaire.

      Follow-up: If insomnia is found, patient will be referred for further treatment.

      Withdrawal and Termination: The patient is unable to complete the questionnaire.

      VIII. DISCOMFORT AND RISKS

      No direct risks to the patient. Failure to follow-up in the clinic if indicated could be
      problematic.

      IX. BENEFITS

      Recognition and treatment of sleep problems in this group of patients will add to our
      understanding of problems in COPD.

      X. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING RESPONSE

      No response anticipated from the study protocol.

      XI. CONFIDENTIALITY

      All results will be kept confidential. Data will only be used by the investigators. Data can
      be reviewed by the IRB at any time. HIPPA forms will be used for the patient's permission.
