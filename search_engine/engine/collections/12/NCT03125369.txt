    
      Aim of study:

      To investigate and compare the safety profile, functional outcomes, efficacy in diabetic
      control and changes of hormonal profile of laparoscopic single loop duodenojejunal bypass
      plus sleeve gastrectomy (SLDJB-SG) versus the conventional standard roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      (RYGBP).

      Hypothesis:

      The efficacy of glycemic control and functional outcomes of SLDJB-SG is better than
      conventional RYGBP, and is a more suitable option for obese Chinese diabetic patients.
