      involving both healthy subjects and patients with brain lesions:

        -  Study Part I included healthy subjects: double-blind, randomized, placebo control;

        -  Study Part II included patients with brain lesions: open-label.

      In Part I, the following 6 dosing groups were investigated:

        -  Group 1: 0.025 mmol/kg

        -  Group 2: 0.05 mmol/kg

        -  Group 3: 0.075 mmol/kg

        -  Group 4: 0.1 mmol/kg

        -  Group 5: 0.2 mmol/kg

        -  Group 6: 0.3 mmol/kg

      Healthy subjects were included and were then administered with P03277 or placebo and were to
      undergo MRI examination according to the randomization scheme.

      In Part II, the following 4 doses groups were investigated:

        -  Group 7: 0.05 mmol/kg

        -  Group 8: 0.075 mmol/kg

        -  Group 9: 0.1 mmol/kg

        -  Group 10: 0.2 mmol/kg

      Patients with brain lesions were included and were then administered with P03277 and
      underwent MRI examination.
