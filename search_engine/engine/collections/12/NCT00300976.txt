    
      (Intervention study) The objective of the study is to confirm the superiority of the
      intensive therapy to the conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or
      exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus by a randomized controlled
      study in patients with type 2 DM. The primary outcome measure is occurrence of myocardial
      infarction, coronary bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke,
      carotid endarterectomy, percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty, carotid artery
      stenting, or death.

      (Follow-up study) The objective of the follow-up study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy
      of intensive versus conventional therapy in the effect on mortality and the prevention of the
      incidence or exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus through a
      post-intervention follow-up research conducted after the multi-center, open-label, randomized
      parallel-group study comparing the efficacy of intensive versus conventional therapy in type
      2 diabetic patients. The primary endpoint is identical to that in the intervention study. In
      addition, overall survivalall-cause mortality will be evaluated as a key secondary endpoint.
