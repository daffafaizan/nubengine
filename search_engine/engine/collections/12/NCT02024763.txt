      used for subject selection. In the first step, 8 schools in the Vila Mariana district - SÃ£o
      Paulo were selected and assigned randomly to physical activity intervention (3 schools) or
      control condition (5 schools). In the second step, all 48 classes from the 1st and 2nd grades
      were selected. In the third step, 352 children were randomly selected compose the
      observational group. In both groups, questionnaire data and SOFIT's observation were
      collected two times: "pre" (immediately before the intervention), and "post" (immediately
      after the intervention), with a six weeks interval between them. No educational intervention
      was taken place in the control schools while the project was running. Afterwards control
      schools received training.
