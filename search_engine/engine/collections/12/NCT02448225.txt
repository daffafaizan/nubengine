      I. To compare the imaging characteristics of 18F-FSPG PET/CT with standard-of-care, 18F-FDG
      PET/CT.

      II. To compare the imaging characteristics of 18F-FSPG PET/CT to standard-of-care 18F-FDG
      PET/CT in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer.

      III. To determine whether 18F-FSPG uptake in lung cancer can be predicted based on
      correlation with CD44 and amino acid transport system xc- (xC-) expression in surgical
      pathology specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scan per standard of care. Within 15 working days, patients
      also undergo 18F-FSPG PET scan over 60 minutes followed by an 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan over 30
      minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 years if needed for diagnosis.
