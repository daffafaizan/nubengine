      in the setting of war. Today however major amputations of the lower extremities
      (transfemoral- (TFA), knee disarticulations (KD) and transtibial amputations (TTA)) are, in
      developed countries, usually performed in elderly patients with untreatable vascular disease,
      diabetes or a combination of both. This fragile group of patients are characterized by a high
      degree of comorbidity, mortality and both surgical and postoperative complications; included
      herein problems with wound healing. The tissue is typically poorly vascularized and prone to
      wound break-down, infections, necrosis etc. 10-40% of patients undergoing TFA, KD or TTA have
      delayed wound healing and/or insufficient wound healing, resulting in problems with the
      aftercare, mobilization with a prosthesis and re-amputations. Recent retrospective studies
      show that Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) may have beneficial effects on incisional
      healing following lower limb amputations. However to our knowledge it has never been
      reproduced in a prospective randomized controlled setting.The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effect of NPWT with a PICO®️ device (Smith & Nephew) on the healing of the
      surgical wound following TFA, KD and TTA.
