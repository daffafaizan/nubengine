      Primary

        -  Assess the response rate to therapy within 72 hours of starting daptomycin in cancer
           patients with neutropenic fever.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the percentage of bacterial cures in patients with documented gram-positive
           bacterial infections.

        -  Assess time to afebrile state.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetic data of daptomycin in neutropenic patients.

        -  Document the incidence of breakthrough infections that require a change of therapy or
           additional agents to clear.

        -  Assess the tolerability of daptomycin in neutropenic patients.

        -  Assess and document adverse events and toxicity due to daptomycin.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients first receive standard treatment for gram-negative bacteria for 72 hours. If the
      patient is still febrile at 72 hours, daptomycin is administered.

      Patients receive daptomycin IV over 30 minutes once daily. Patients who are afebrile, not
      neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 500/mm続), and have no signs of infection after
      72 hours of therapy may discontinue daptomycin. Patients who are afebrile and neutropenic
      (ANC < 500/mm続) after 72 hours of therapy continue to receive daptomycin until absolute
      neutrophil count (ANC) > 500/mm続 for 2 consecutive days. Patients who are febrile with or
      without continued neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm続) after 72 hours of therapy continue to receive
      daptomycin for up to 10-14 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
