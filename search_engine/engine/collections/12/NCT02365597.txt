    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study (participants will know the identity of study drugs
      administered) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib in participants with
      urothelial cancer. The study comprises a 30-days Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase comprised
      of 28-day treatment cycles that will continue until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs, and a post-treatment Follow-up Phase that will extend from the
      End-of-Treatment Visit until the participant has died, withdraws consent, is lost to
      follow-up, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. The end of study is defined as the
      date when all participants have completed the study treatment (Regimens 1 to 3) or until the
      last participant enrolled under the drug-drug interaction (DDI) substudy completes the end of
      treatment visit,(whichever happens last). The purpose of DDI sub-study is to evaluate the
      interaction of repeated doses of erdafitinib with a sensitive cytochrome 450 (CYP) 3A
      substrate (midazolam) and with an organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) probe substrate
      (metformin). Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
