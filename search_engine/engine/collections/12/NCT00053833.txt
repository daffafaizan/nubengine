        -  Determine the objective confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response rates of
           patients with platinum- and taxane-refractory ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or
           fallopian tube cancer treated with irinotecan.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
