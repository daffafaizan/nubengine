      faith healers to deliver evidence-based mhGAP-IG adapted psychosocial interventions to reduce
      mental health treatment gap in Kenya. This will be achieved through establishing a dialogue
      and collaboration between the formal and the informal sector and training the informal sector
      on the use of mental health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guideline (mhGAP-IG) to
      identify and manage depression. It will take place in Makueni County among 100 randomly
      selected TH/FH. A descriptive (prospective cohort) study will be used to determine the impact
      of training TH/FH on the use of mhGAP-IG in the identification and management of depression.
      A mental health specialist will also determine the accuracy of diagnosis made by the informal
      sector using randomly selected patients (true positives and true negatives for depression) by
      an independent person. Moreover, patients identified to have depression will be followed up
      at 6 and 12 weeks to assess their health outcomes using BECKs Depression Inventory Scale,
      Suicidality Scale and WHO quality of life.
