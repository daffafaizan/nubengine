      condition is called pruritus. This occurs when natural moisture is drawn out of the skin. The
      skin needs moisture to protect itself. The best way to relieve dry skin normally, for those
      suffering of seasonal dry skin problems, is to use standard moisturizers. However, for those
      suffering of mobility problems due to age or paralysis (spinal cord injury, multiple
      sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, amputation, cerebral palsy, or other
      comparable disorders), xerosis becomes severe and chronic because of the multiple causes
      (endogenous metabolic problems and dysfunctions rather than exogenous ones). SQIN with
      CanSATs technology is designed to act upon multiple mechanisms for enhanced protecting,
      moisturizing, and repairing effects. Based upon preliminary evidence, SQIN with CanSATs
      technology can thus elicit significantly superior effects compared with standard,
      commercially available moisturizers.
