           be stage I or II) or benign gastric neoplasm by preoperative screening diagnostic
           procedure. They will receive laparoscopic gastrectomy as follows: (1) wedge resection,
           subtotal or total gastrectomy with or without lymph node dissection; (2) R0 resection;
           (3) laparoscopic gastrectomy; (4 gastroduodenal anastomosis or duodenal bypass,
           including Roux-en-Y or gastrojejunostomy.

        -  Pre-operative, 6 and 12 months post-operative body composition measurement will be
           performed on each patient. The whole body composition measurement will be assessed by
           Hologic 4500/A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry system. The software performs
           calculations of the differential attenuations of the two photon energies and present
           data of percentage of fat, fat mass (g), lean mass (g), bone mineral content (g), bone
           mineral density (g/cm2), and total mass (g).

        -  Laboratory analysis - There is a battery of labs that are ordered in both the
           pre-operative, 6 and 12 months post-operative time frame. These labs are ordered
           independent of the patient's participation in the study. These labs are ordered to
           evaluate and to assist management of the patient's medical comorbidities as well as to
           assess for adequate nutritional intake and balance.

        -  Queries on nutritional intake and exercise will be made at each post-operative
           appointment.
