      washout period of one to two weeks. During each study session, healthy male subjects will be
      administered a single oral dose of 80 mg gliclazide (one BF-Gliclazide Tablet 80 mg or one
      Diamicron 80 mg Tablet) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours. 20% glucose will
      be given orally to each subject at 2 h after drug administration to minimize the risk of
      hypoglycaemia. Venous blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (0 h) and up to 72 hours
      post-dose. The plasma concentrations of gliclazide will be determined by a validated assay.
      The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the plasma concentration-time data and
      calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and
      T1/2. ANOVA will be conducted on logarithmically transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf.
      The two one-sided tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence intervals for the mean
      difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax, and to assess the bioequivalence of the two
      products.
