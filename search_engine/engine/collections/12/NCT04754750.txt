      conducted between Jan 2015 to Jun 2017 including from a psychiatric center in southern
      Taiwan. The stable schizophrenic patients who previously received risperidone long-acting
      injection for more than one year and shifted to paliperidone palmitate after including in the
      study. Firstly, participants were received the one month long-acting injection (PP1M) three
      months. Then, the stable participants were shifted to the three month long-acting injection
      (PP3M). Concomitant medications were allowed to prescribe except other antipsychotics.
      Outcome measurements were 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), 45-itme quality of life
      for mental disorder (QOLMD), Short-version of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser
      (short-version UKU), and Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST). These measurements were
      performed every three-month except WCST which was performed every six-month. The effect of
      treatment was assessed using Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scales for the evaluation
      of psychosocial functioning at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks in first study, and at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12
      months in second study, respectively. In addition, all participants were assessed for body
      weight, waist circumference, and blood lipid profile. To evaluate the lipid profiles, fasting
      blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), High-density
      Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL). These blood samples were collected at
      every month until study completion.
