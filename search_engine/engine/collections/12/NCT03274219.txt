      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (bb21217).
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to
      bb21217 infusion. All subjects will then be followed for up to 60 months in Study CRB-402.

      All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after
      receiving bb21217 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria,
      will be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study.
