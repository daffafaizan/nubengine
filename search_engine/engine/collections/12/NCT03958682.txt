      original flight helmet .During the rescue, the doctors are asked to wear the special helmet,
      through the device's camera system and headset, investigators can obtain graphics and sound
      of the helicopter cabin .At the same time, it also receives the historical data of patients
      and real-time diagnosis as well as rescue guidance from the ground medical institutions.

      In short ,it can not only transmit the patient's information in the cabin to the ground
      medical institutions in real time, but also transmit the rescue plan of the ground medical
      experts to the rescue helicopter in real time to ensure the safety of patients in transit
      ,which will save the time for medical staff to hand over after landing and reduce errors.

      At present, most of the airborne information exchange systems in air medical rescue in China
      focus on the internal use of the army, which are incompatible with the medical information
      systems of most hospitals on the ground. Moreover, these systems can only achieve limited
      information transmission, and can not delivery rescue scene images in real time. Civil air
      medical rescue conditions are relatively backward, most of them rely on 2G/3G/4G mobile
      communication technology, which can lead to failure in case of bad weather or sudden major
      disasters, and bring great security risks to patients in air medical rescue.

      If the airborne visual real-time evaluation system can be successfully completed, it will be
      popularized and applied in Chinese airborne first aid alliance, and eventually a standardized
      airborne medical rescue information management system will be formed. Furthermore, a
      three-dimensional rescue system for civil airborne medical rescue will be built to reduce the
      potential safety hazards of patients in airborne medical rescue, and to enhance the rapid
      response ability and organization of medical institutions.
