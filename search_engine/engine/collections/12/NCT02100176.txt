      motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the evidence of a possible
      neuroprotective action of exercise in PD has been obscured by the facts that all studies were
      performed in patients in different disease stages and under a variety of pharmacological
      treatments. Our objective is to test whether a multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation
      treatment (MIRT) slowed down the progression of the disease in PD "de novo" patients, all
      treated with Rotigotine, in a randomized controlled study with a 18 months follow-up.

      40 Patients at the initial stages of PD (H&Y stages 1,5-2) treated only with Rotigotine will
      be enrolled and randomly assigne into two groups. Patients in group 1 (20 subjects) will be
      undergone 2 MIRT cycle (at T0 and T3). MIRT consist of a 4-week cycle of physiotherapy that
      entailed three daily sessions 5 days a week (Frazzitta G. et al., Neurorehabilitation [30]
      2012, 295-301). Patients in Group 2 (20 subjects) will continue with drug therapy alone.

      For the group 1, Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) II, UPDRS III, six-minute
      walking test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-up-and-go test (TUG), comfortable and
      fast gait speed, Self-assessment Parkinson's disease disability scale and L-dopa equivalents
      will be assessed at Baseline T0, T1 (discharge after the first MIRT cycle), T2 (control at 6
      months after discharge), T3 (hospitalization for second MIRT cycle), T4 (discharge after the
      second MIRT cycle) and T5 (end of the protocol, 18 months); For the group 2, UPDRS II, UPDRS
      III, six-minute walking test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-up-and-go test (TUG),
      confortable and fast gait speed, Self-assessment Parkinson's disease disability scale and
      L-dopa equivalents will be assessed at Baseline T0, T1 (check-up at 6 months), T2 (check-up
      at 12 months), T3 (check-up at 18 months).
