      living in our intestines, known as "gut flora," react to different foods a person may
      consume. The investigators want to know if there are differences in compounds measured in a
      participant's blood and urine after eating different foods. Specifically, the investigators
      are interested in seeing if there are differences in these compounds after eating
      ultra-processed foods, like hamburgers and french fries, versus eating whole foods, like
      fresh fruits and vegetables. The investigators also want to know if the bacteria in our
      intestines may change the levels of these compounds. To this end, some subjects will be asked
      to take antibiotics to suppress the gut flora for three days before eating the challenge
      meal. Suppression of gut flora is a known effect of the antibiotics used in this study.
      Participants will have two study visits.
