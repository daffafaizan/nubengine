      worldwide. BCCs are slow-growing, locally invasive tumors that rarely metastasize but can
      cause extensive morbidity through local tissue destruction. Recurrence is often the
      consequence of incomplete removal of the cancer tissue. Mohs' micrographic surgery is
      considered the most effective treatment modality for BCC with a recurrence rate of less than
      5 %, however, the technique requires specialized training and is labor-intensive and costly.
      Fluorescence imaging by topical application of a tumor-localizing agent such as methyl
      5-aminolevulinic acid (MAL), resulting in buildup of photosensitizing porphyrin IX (PpIX)
      that can be visualized by Woods' light fluorescence, might serve as a quick and simple
      "bed-side" technique for demarcation of BCC tumor borders prior to surgical excision
      Objective: To test the reliability of MAL-induced porphyrin fluorescence tumor demarcation by
      comparison with the tumor borders determined by Mohs' surgery Methods: Twenty eight patients
      with facial BCCs (17 nodular, 3 superficial, 1 morphea type, 3 ulcerated and 4 recurrent
      tumors) scheduled for Mohs' surgery were recruited for the study. The night before the
      surgical procedure, crusts were gently removed and an approximately 1 mm thick layer of a
      cream containing 16 % MAL (MetvixR) was applied to the tumor area as well as to the
      surrounding skin and covered by a transparent occlusive dressing. The following morning
      (10-17 hours after MetvixR application), the dressing was removed, and the lesion size was
      determined with a caliber by measuring the largest perpendicular diameters under natural
      (clinical size) and Woods' (fluorescence size) illumination. The patients then underwent the
      scheduled Mohs' surgical procedure, and the tumor size (Mohs' size) was determined when
      reaching the tumor free margins.
