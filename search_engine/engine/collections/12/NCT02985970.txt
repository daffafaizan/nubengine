      several steps of RSI are not based on evidence based data (EBM) and are considered
      controversial. In an electronic evaluation form that will be send to Czech society of
      anesthesiology, resuscitation and intensive care (ÄŒSARIM) members, the investigators bring 4
      clinical scenarios in which RSI should be used. In the questionnaire the participants have to
      choose RSI or no and they have to describe all the next steps on anesthesia induction process
      in each single clinical scenario.

        -  1st. scenario - adult patient with acute abdomen in the OR to be anesthetized

        -  2nd. scenario - 4 years old child with acute abdomen in the OR scheduled for an acute
           surgery

        -  3rd. scenario - pregnant women scheduled for an elective caesarean section in the OR

        -  4th. scenario - geriatric patient with hiatal hernia scheduled for an elective
           laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      In each scenario the several steps of the RSI sequence has to be answered:

      Is RSI indicated? Y N

      Peripheral vein line before induction? Y N

      Nasogastric tube before/after induction or without?

      Patients position: neutral, head-up, head-down?

      Preoxygenation - 3/5minutes, breaths, (CPAP)/Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)?

      Sellick manoeuver? Y N

      Drugs for induction (order with the number in the row) - propofol, etomidate, ketamine,
      thiopental, midazolam, suxamethonium, rocuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, vecuronium

      Manual hand-bag ventilation after induction: with limited pressure/contraindicated

      Airway: tracheal tube with the cuff/without cuff/laryngeal mask
