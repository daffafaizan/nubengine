      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus to use in combination with mFOLFOX6
      [oxaliplatin, leucovorin (leucovorin calcium), 5-FU (fluorouracil)].

      II. To better describe the toxicities associated with the combination of everolimus with
      mFOLFOX6.

      III. To assess response rate and progression-free survival in this patient population.

      IV. To assess overall survival in patients with metastatic gastric, esophageal and
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma treated with the combination of mFOLFOX6 +
      everolimus.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus. Patients receive fluorouracil
      intravenously (IV) continuously over 46 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive oral everolimus once daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.
