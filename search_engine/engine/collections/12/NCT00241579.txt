      of hyperalgesia more closely approximates the clinical situation. There are limited clinical
      studies on the effect of the cannabinoids on facilitated pain states. Noyes et al evaluated
      the analgesic effects of Delta-9-THC in 34 cancer patients with pain. They concluded that
      20mg of oral Delta-9-THC was similar to 120mg of codeine (Noyes et al, 1975). Jain et al
      concluded that 1.5-3mg of intramuscular Levonantradol resulted in significant pain relief as
      compared to placebo in 56 patients with acute postoperative pain (Jain et al, 1981).

      Comparison(s): Three different doses of smoked cannabis will be compared to placebo for the
      reduction of experimentally induced pain.
