      blood sample will be taken by fingerprick, and approximately 500 ÂµL of blood will be dripped
      into a collection tube. The participant will then consume a meal of either: two types of
      lentils, corn, macaroni, white rice, or white potato. All study days will be randomized. Each
      meal will be served in either 1/4 or 1/2 cup servings depending on the study block. Six more
      blood samples will be taken by fingerprick at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the
      beginning of the meal.
