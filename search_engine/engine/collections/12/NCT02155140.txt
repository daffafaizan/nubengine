    
      For patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery for cancer:

        1. Because of the nature of upper gastrointestinal surgery these patients have been shown
           to suffer undernutrition and weight loss after hospital discharge (up to 3 months) and
           to a greater extent than other groups of surgical patients. Quality of life and fatigue
           is a major issue after upper GI surgery.

        2. Nutritional supplementation via a jejunostomy after hospital discharge is only done
           routinely for all patients in 10%, and for selected patients in 20% of United Kingdom
           (UK) hospitals.

        3. Derriford hospital is very unusual in that 85% of patients are given home jejunal
           feeding.

        4. In Devon and Cornwall home enteral nutrition is delivered under contract by Fresenius
           Kabil (a global health care company).

        5. There are no studies of home nutritional supplementation in upper GI surgical patients.

        6. Studies of home nutritional supplementation in surgical patients having undergone
           colorectal surgery have not shown clinical or Quality of Life (QoL) benefit despite
           weight gain.

        7. The process of enteral nutrition may be associated with a reduction in quality of life.

        8. There is a need for a clinical trial to establish the benefit of home enteral
           nutritional supplementation. The results of any such trial may influence the highly
           variable nutritional present practice and may influence the surgeons desire to place a
           feeding jejunostomy (or not) at surgery which is associated with clinical complications.
