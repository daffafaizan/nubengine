      associated with significantly increased mortality. Impairments in olfaction and taste are
      under-recognized and under-addressed symptoms that affect this population. Olfaction and
      taste influence appetite and nutritional status and represent a unique target for study and
      intervention. Small cross-sectional studies have shown a higher prevalence of olfactory (up
      to 56%) and taste disturbances (up to 35%) among patients with CKD compared with the general
      population, but little is known about longitudinal change in olfaction and taste in this
      population. Additionally, there is a lack of understanding about why these sensory
      disturbances more commonly occur in people with CKD, although there is speculation that
      uremia may contribute.

      This information gained from this study will address these gaps in knowledge by studying
      longitudinal changes in olfaction and taste and their associations with concurrent and future
      nutritional and functional status. Additionally this study will attempt to identify
      potentially modifiable risk factors associated with olfactory and taste impairment.
