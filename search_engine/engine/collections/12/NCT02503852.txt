    
      The STYLE Trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-center device trial intended to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the Celution and Puregraft Systems in the processing and
      preparation of an autologous fat graft enriched with adipose-derived regenerative cells
      (ADRCs) in the treatment of early alopecia androgenetica. Patients may be included if they
      are undergoing an elective cosmetic liposuction. Following informed consent and screening
      evaluations, eligible subjects will undergo pre-operative testing. Subjects will then undergo
      a fat harvest using local anesthesia with or without conscious sedating. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive a fat graft cell enriched with ADRCs (available in two different
      doses),a fat graft without cell enrichment using a visually-matched blood saline solution
      (fat alone control), or a saline injection (no-fat control) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.

      While undergoing liposuction, lipoaspirate will be processed in the Puregraft System to
      remove the lipoaspirate of impurities and in the Celution System to isolate and concentrate
      ADRCs. After the liposuction is completed), patients will have, under a ring block local
      anesthesia (see further description below), a subcutaneous scalp injection of either
      Puregraft purified autologous fat or saline (no-fat control) followed by a separate second
      injection, of either ADRCs (available in two different doses),a visually-matched blood saline
      solution (fat alone control), or saline (no-fat control) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.

      The STYLE Clinical Trial will have a sample size of 70 patients at up to eight (8) centers.
