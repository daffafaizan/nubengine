      clinical course and for educational purposes. But the videos are not used as a therapeutic
      tool for patients. This research project focuses on the therapeutic potential of these videos
      and particularly on the awareness of patients of their disorder (insight). Patients
      hospitalized for decompensation of their schizophrenic pathology will be filmed during
      structured interviews. After clinical stabilization patients will be proposed to participate
      to this trial. A group of patients (G1) will watch the video recorded in the acute phase of
      their illness. A control group (G2) will have a usual care without video or specific therapy.
      48 hours after, the clinical impact et the evolution of insight of patients will be
      evaluated. Then follow-up visits will also be provided at one and four months with the same
      clinical evaluation, plus an evaluation of treatment adherence and functional remission. This
      study also includes qualitative interviews for group 1 after watching the video to explore
      the experience of patients in this situation of self-confrontation. The autobiographical
      memory will also be studied in this protocol. Tolerance of this experience will be assessed
      by a monitoring of emotions, specifically depressive affects and suicidal ideation. Adverse
      events will be reported and patients will always have the access to a psychiatrist if
      necessary.
