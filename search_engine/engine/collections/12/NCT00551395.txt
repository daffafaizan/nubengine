    
      SLT therapy is used as an IOP lowering agent in patients with glaucoma. It is unknown whether
      the timing of a 2-staged approach to the laser therapy will result in better IOP lowering
      effect.

      This study will evaluate the timing (early vs. late completion of SLT therapy) and determined
      the IOP lowering effect following the interventions.

      Arm 1: Early Completion SLT

      180 degrees of SLT on Day 1, 180 degrees of SLT on the other 180 degrees on Day 2

      Arm 2: Late Completion SLT

      180 degrees of SLT on Day 1, 180 degrees of SLT on the other 180 degrees at the 1 month
      follow up visit.

      Primary Outcome: IOP (mmHg).
