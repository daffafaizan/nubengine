      morbidly obese patients awaiting Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to 20 healthy volunteers. On
      the days before the first and after the last dose faeces and blood are sampled for the
      analyses of bile acids and the gut microbiota. On the day after the last dose a
      push-enteroscopy is performed in conscious sedation for biopsy taking in the jejunum. These
      procedures are repeated 6 month after surgery in the morbid obese patients. Inclusion
      criteria are male or female gender, 20-65 years of age and morbid obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2)
      eligible for bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria are liver diseases other that fatty liver
      disease, other significant morbidity, medications known to interact with OCA, pregnancy,
      uncertainty about safe and reliable contraception, and problems to understand or adhere to
      the protocol. The primary objectives of this pharmacodynamic trial are the study of the
      effect of OCA on the expression of FXR in the jejenum and small intestinal permeability, and
      on fecal bile acids and gut microbiota. The secondary objectives are the study of the effects
      of OCA on the genome-wide FXR DNA binding sites (cistromics) with the global gene expression
      profile (transcriptomics) in human jejunum.
