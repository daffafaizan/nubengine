      Strict NPO (NPO after midnight) or liberal NPO (clear liquids up to 2 hours prior to
      procedure). All patients, regardless of study arm, will be allowed to take medications with a
      sip of water. All other peri-operative care will be routine. On the day of the procedure, a
      patient satisfaction survey will be completed and the procedure will be performed as routine.
