      whether diabetes itself could increases the susceptibility of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and
      subsequently impacts the outcomes in these patients , or the SARS-CoV-2 subsequently affects
      the risk of type 1 diabetes and increase in the prevalence of severe DKA.

      Poorly controlled diabetes and chronic hyperglycemia creates a state of low grade chronic
      inflammation, which may explain the underlying mechanism of increased susceptibility to
      infection and infer the outcome in patients with diabetes .

      Poorly controlled diabetes has been linked to multiple derangements of immune system
      including inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in response to different stimuli, as well as
      impaired monocyte/macrophage function together with increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines and adhesion molecules that mediate tissue inflammation .

      Few data links the association between development of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with
      COVID-19, where the infection could trigger higher stressful conditions, with the release of
      stress hormones leading to increased blood glucose levels and abnormal glucose variability .

      The extent to which clinical and demographic data of patients with type 1 diabetes modifies
      the outcome and severity of the disease seems entirely unclear and is the question of several
      researches.

      â€¢ Study Tools:

      All patients admitted to Pediatrics Hospital, Ain Shams University in the period between May
      to August 2020 will be subjected to:

      1- Detailed history 2. Thorough clinical examination: To assess the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. A thorough clinical review to assess organ involvements and clinical and laboratory
      characteristics as well as the outcome measures in the studied cohort.

      3. Data collection: Demographic and data will be extracted from patients inpatient files and
      reports
