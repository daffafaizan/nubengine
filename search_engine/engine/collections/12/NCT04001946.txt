      and provide medication to children who can not eat or take medication on their own. G-buttons
      are commonly placed through surgery. While G-buttons give access for caregivers to provide
      adequate nutrition, they also can have complications associated with them; including, but not
      limited to leakage, skin irritation or infection, and dislodgement. These complications can
      be a big burden for caregivers and medical providers causing extra clinic, ED visits, and
      increased cost. The investigators have designed a securement device for the gastrostomy
      button and want to compare the device to the standard securement method, which is tape and
      gauze dressing. The investigators believe that they will show a significant reduction in the
      complications listed above. The investigators plan to randomized 200 patients to either the
      new securement device (treatment group) or the standard dressing (control group). The
      investigators plan to get feedback from caregivers at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The G-button
      securement device that is a Class II, 510(k) exempt medical device, subject to General
      Controls under Product Code PLI, regulated by 21 CFR 876.5980.
