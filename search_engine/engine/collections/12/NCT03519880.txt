      neurological diseases. Specifically, for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)--a fatal,
      non-curable, progressive disease of the motor neurons--NIV represents one of the most
      effective treatments with a survival benefit of greater than 1 year. Despite this survival
      advantage, and the corresponding improvement in Quality of Life (QoL), compliance with NIV
      can be poor. Factors contributing to poor compliance to NIV include bulbar onset disease and
      mask leaks. In addition to reduced adherence to therapy, elevated mask leaks can compromise
      the pressure adjustment algorithm in average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS)
      ventilation, a commonly used mode of bilevel (positive airway pressure) PAP therapy in ALS.
      In an effort to increase NIV compliance in subjects with neurological conditions, and
      specifically ALS, investigators hypothesize that a better fit achieved through 3D printed NIV
      mask interfaces may improve utilization by decreasing mask leaks, decreasing the required
      delivery pressures and improving compliance with therapy. Investigators therefore propose a
      feasibility study to investigate the use of 3D printing to manufacture customized NIV mask
      interfaces for subjects with ALS who encounter difficulty using NIV because of poorly fitting
      mask interfaces despite exhausting available commercial mask options.
