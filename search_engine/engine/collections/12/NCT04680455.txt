      care group (N = 30) or an intervention group (N = 30). Eligible participants will be age 19
      years or older, living with obesity (BF â‰¥ 28%), able to perform exercises, but not currently
      engaged in regular physical activities (150 min of moderate to vigorous aerobic activities +
      two sessions of RT per week). Participants will be asked to maintain their current dietary
      habits within the duration of the project.

      Sample size calculations was done based on the anticipated change in the proportion of obese
      men to achieve the PA guidelines (minimum of 150 minutes spent at MVPA in a week in addition
      to two sessions of RT). It is predicted that the proportion of men living with obesity who
      meet physical activity guidelines (both aerobic MVPA and RT) in the RT+ group will increase
      to 26.2% (similar to lean counterparts) at follow-up compared with 0% increased for the
      control group. The alpha level and power of analysis were set at 0.05 and 80% respectively,
      considering a drop-out rate of 30% in each group. A total of 23 people per group were
      required, so investigators will recruit 30 per group.
