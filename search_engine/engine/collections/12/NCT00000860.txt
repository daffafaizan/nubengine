      that this poor outcome is not simply a reflection of greater immune impairment in AIDS
      patients with MAC infection, but rather may be a direct or indirect consequence of infection
      with mycobacterium. Survival of AIDS patients with MAC is shorter than those without MAC.
      Studies show that treatment for MAC improves the survival of MAC infected patients to nearly
      the survival of AIDS patients without MAC. Treatment of MAC with clarithromycin containing
      regimens is associated with decreased symptoms and prolonged survival. There is evidence,
      however, that mycobacterial infection may enhance propagation of the human immunodeficiency
      virus through mechanisms that may involve enhanced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines.
      It is unclear to what extent cytokine abnormalities contribute to this symptom complex and to
      what extent treatment of MAC infection will reverse these cytokine abnormalities.

      All patients diagnosed with MAC and who will initiate at least a 2 drug clarithromycin
      containing MAC treatment regimen will be eligible for participation. Blood and urine will be
      obtained from each patient at the following timepoints: Pre-Entry (within 7 days prior to
      study entry), week 4, and week 8. Sites will process and ship specific samples to Case
      Western Reserve University (CWRU). Various assays and analyses will be performed by CWRU.
      NOTE: Patients will receive no treatment on this study, however, all patients must be
      receiving at least a 2 drug clarithromycin containing treatment regimen for MAC either as
      part of participation in other studies or as prescribed by the subject's health care
      provider.
