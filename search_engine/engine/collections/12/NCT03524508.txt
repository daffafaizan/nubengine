    
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase II study comparing the efficacy
      and safety between fluorouracil/folinic acid plus liposomal irinotecan and
      fluoruracil/folinic acid monotherapy in patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer which
      progressed on 1st line gemcitabine/cisplatin.

      Eligible patients will be included in this study and treated according to the protocol. Study
      treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's
      decision/consent withdrawal. Local investigators will determine disease progression,
      radiologic or clinical deterioration.
