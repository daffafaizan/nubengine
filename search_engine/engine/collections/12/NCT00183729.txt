      occurs in people of all ages, but is often overlooked in older adults. Depression frequently
      co-occurs with other serious illnesses, and may be mistaken by both patients and health care
      givers as a normal consequence of the illness. However, these misconceptions toward
      depression contribute to the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of depressive disorders in
      older people. In turn, depression may hinder a patient's recovery from an illness. This study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of memantine in improving rehabilitation outcomes and
      preventing major depressive disorder in older adults who have been admitted to a
      rehabilitation hospital for a hip fracture or a cardiopulmonary condition.

      This double-blind study will last for 12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either placebo or memantine, which is a drug that is often used to treat Alzheimer's
      disease. Both memantine and placebo will be administered to participants for 12 weeks. All
      participants will be followed for an additional 40 weeks. Outcome measurements will include
      participants' depressive symptoms, motivation, and learned helplessness. In addition,
      medication side effects, functional outcome, and incidence of major depressive disorder will
      be measured. All measurements will be taken at Week 12 and Month 12.
