      background radiation + boost radiation, and surgery. 3 patients will start with a background
      radiation therapy (RT) dose of 0 cGy, and boost RT of at least 2100 cGy. If the radiation is
      manageable (radiation related AEs grade < 4), the next set of 3 patients will be enrolled,
      and the background radiation dose will be increased by 600 cGy. This will continue until the
      background radiation dose reaches 1800 cGy. If 1 patient exhibits dose limiting toxicities
      (AEs grade 4 & 5), the dose level will repeat with the next 3 patients. If 2 or more patients
      exhibit DLTs, the previous dose level will be determined as the maximum tolerated dose level.
      Surgery will be scheduled to occur approximately 1-2 weeks after completing radiation
      therapy, and will subsequently be followed up as per study schedule.
