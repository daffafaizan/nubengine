      division between the medial and lateral compartments of the knee, present in 85.5% of knees1,
      felt by some to be of no clinical significance other than acting as a block to visualization
      an movement during arthroscopy.2 S.J. Kim 3,4, C.R. Boyd 5, and B. Demirag 2006 have
      documented successful relier of anterior knee pain after resection of the IPP. This study
      seeks to assess the relationship between knee motion, activation of the extensor apparatus,
      and the IPP, in essence, the kinematics of the contents of the anterior compartment of the
      knee. The hypothesis to be evaluated is:

      the infrapatellar plica is a structure of fundamental biomechanical significance, allowing
      the transmission of force from the extensor apparatus to the distal femur through the fat
      pad, and acting as a restraint and a modulator of fad pad mobility.

      Subjects will be identified by the PI at their office visit. The subject will be consented.
      The consent will be discussed and verified in a second office visit before surgery. The
      subject will undergo arthroscopy specifically directed toward identifying and treating known
      pathology. Once this is finished, if an IPP is present, it will be injected with radiographic
      contrast material. A series of maneuvers will be performed involving passive and active
      motion of the knee and active contraction of the quadriceps apparatus. Videotape recording
      and fluoroscopy will be undertaken. The plica will be removed. Another fluoroscopy will be
      performed. The patient will be followed according to the standard practice for arthroscopy
      and the defined pathology.
