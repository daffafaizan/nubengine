      hydroxide. The Zika virus vaccine is being tested to provide safety and immunogenicity data
      to enable the vaccine to be further developed clinically.

      The study will enroll approximately 240 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four groups-which will remain undisclosed to
      the study observer:

        -  Placebo

        -  PIZV: 2 microgram (mcg) Low Dose

        -  PIZV: 5 mcg Medium Dose

        -  PIZV: 10 mcg High Dose

      All participants will be administered either placebo or PIZV by intramuscular (IM) injection
      into the middle third of the deltoid muscle, preferably in the non-dominant arm on Days 1
      (Visit 1) and 29 (Visit 4).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico. The overall
      time to participate in this study is up to 25 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic on Days 1, 8, 29, 36, 57, 211, 393 and will be contacted by telephone on Day
      133 (Visit 7) and Day 575 (Visit 9) and also visit the clinic on Day 757 (Visit 11) depending
      on the study arm, for a final follow-up assessment.
