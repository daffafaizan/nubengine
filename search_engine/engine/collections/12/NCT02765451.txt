      trials. But this accessibility is far from the optimal care in non-university healthcare
      institutions (public and private hospital). These non-academic healthcare facilities support
      at national level about 60% of chemotherapy and 70% of radiotherapy, but only 17% of the
      inclusions in trials.

      A dissociation exist between a care package guaranteed on quality criteria (criteria to
      obtain the capacity to treat the cancers in healthcare institution) distributed all over the
      country, and the research, mainly concentrated in few referral centers (University hospital
      and French Comprehensive Cancer Centers).

      Clinical trials allow patients to have early access to new treatments, optimal and formalized
      information, and supported by physicians in connection with a strict protocol for patients
      included.

      Several studies have shown the existence of geographical and socio-economic determinants for
      access to reference centers and for the duration of survival of cancer patients. In France,
      it was found that for patients with gastrointestinal cancer, the remoteness of the place of
      residence compared to the nearest referral center and a higher level of deprivation decreased
      the probability of being supported in a reference center.

      The hypothesis of the ERNU study is that aid from the Canc√©ropole Nord-Ouest facilitates
      clinical research activity resulting in a significant development of inclusions in
      non-university centers of the french north-west inter-region with an influence on the social
      and geographical inequalities recruitment.
