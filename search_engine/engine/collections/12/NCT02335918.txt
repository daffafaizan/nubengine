      certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

      Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called PD-1 on immune
      cells and promotes anti-tumor effects.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 3 mg/kg of nivolumab. The first
      phase of the study will test the safety profile of the combination and determine which dose
      will be studied in Phase ll of the overall study.

      During Phase ll, depending on cancer type, groups of patients will be enrolled and receive
      varlilumab at a dose of either 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 3 mg/kg every 12 weeks, or 0.3 mg/kg
      every 4 weeks in combination with nivolumab at 240 mg.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
