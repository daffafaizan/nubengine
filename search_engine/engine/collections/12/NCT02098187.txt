    
      This was an open-label, rising single-dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the
      investigational agent, MP-3180, and to evaluate the use of the Optical Renal Function Monitor
      (ORFM), an investigational noninvasive fluorescence detection device. Single-dose
      pharmacokinetics at four dose levels were evaluated following the administration of a single,
      intravenous dose of MP-3180. Iohexol was also administered followed by saline. Prior to
      administration of MP-3180 and iohexol, ORFM sensor probes were affixed to four locations on
      the body of each participant. The noninvasive fluorescent signal from MP-3180 was measured
      using the ORFM investigational device continuously for approximately four hours post MP-3180
      administration. For the determination of the pharmacokinetic disposition of MP-3180 and
      iohexol, blood samples were collected from each participant provided the individual completed
      all blood collections in the study. The pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 and iohexol were assessed
      by statistical comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma
      concentration-time curves and urine recovery data.
