      has been coupled to improvements in overall cardiovascular outcomes, the control of
      hypertension has become an important modifiable risk factor in the overall care of the
      patient with Type 2 Diabetes, in addition to glycemic control. Recently, several large-scale
      clinical trials evaluating the glucose-lowering effects of the anti-hyperglycemic agent,
      liraglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist), have demonstrated a modest yet
      persistent anti-hypertensive effect in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

      Study Objectives: Accordingly, the goal of this small study is to understand whether the
      blood pressure lowering effect of liraglutide is coupled to the release of vasoactive
      mediators which may stimulate natriuresis and/or diuresis and lower systolic blood pressure.

      Study Design: Randomized, double-masked, cross-over study with treatment of liraglutide or
      placebo for 3 weeks, with an intervening washout period for 3 weeks, and cross-over to
      identical treatment with placebo or liraglutide for 3 weeks.

      Study Patients: 20 patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Systolic Hypertension

      Endpoints: Change in vasoactive hormones, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, urinary sodium
      excretion patterns.
