      visual analogue scale (VAS), pain-free and normal range of motion (ROM) with goniometer,
      joint position sense (JPS) with inclinometer, muscle strenght with hand-held dynamometer, and
      shoulder functionality with Constant Murley Score (CMS) and Shoulder Pain and Disability
      Index (SPADI) in a pretest-posttest design. HILT Group (n=15) will receive only HILT for 10
      sessions, 3 days a week on alternate days. HILT& Exercise Group (n=15) will receive exercise
      treatment in addition to HILT for the same duration of time.
