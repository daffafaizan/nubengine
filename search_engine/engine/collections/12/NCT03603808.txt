    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of participants with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18-positive anal high
      grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL) that achieve either complete or partial
      response (which is defined as histopathological regression from HSIL to low grade squamous
      intraepithelial neoplasia [LSIL] or normal) at 48 weeks after the first dose of VGX-3100
      (VGX-3100).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v5.0).

      II. To determine the proportion of participants with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18-positive anal HSIL
      that achieve complete response (which is defined as histopathological regression from HSIL to
      normal) at 48 weeks after the first dose of VGX-3100.

      III. To determine the proportion of participants who clear HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (defined as
      changing from presence to absence of HPV-16 or 18 by anal histological specimen) at 48 weeks
      after the first dose of VGX-3100.

      IV. To determine proportion of participants who clear HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (defined as
      changing from presence to absence of HPV-16 and/or 18 by anal swab) at 48 weeks after the
      first dose of VGX-3100.

      V. To compare the proportion of participants with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18-positive anal HSIL who
      achieve either complete or partial response (which is defined as histopathological regression
      from HSIL to LSIL or normal) versus those who do not at 72 weeks after the first dose of
      VGX-3100.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of non-HPV-16 or HPV-18-positive anal HSIL lesions that
      achieve either complete or partial response (which is defined as histopathological regression
      from HSIL to LSIL or normal) at 48 weeks after the first dose of VGX-3100.

      II. To determine the T cell response to VGX-3100 as measured by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot), flow cytometric assessments, and T cell
      infiltration into anal mucosal tissue.

      III. To determine the antibody response to VGX-3100 as measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against HPV-16 E7 and HPV-18 E7 target antigens.

      IV. To determine the association of the addition of a fourth dose of VGX-3100 with T-cell and
      antibody responses.

      V. To determine the association of VGX-3100 immune response with CD4+ lymphocyte count over
      time.

      VI. To determine the association of VGX-3100 immune response with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) over time.

      VII. To determine if CD4 + lymphocyte count affects the overall or complete response rate at
      48 weeks after the first dose of VGX-3100.

      VIII. To assess the effect of tissue PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) expression and T-cell
      infiltration on clinical benefit.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine VGX-3100 intramuscularly (IM) and then
      undergo electroporation over 10 seconds for 4 doses in week 0, 4, 12, and 24 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 72 weeks.
