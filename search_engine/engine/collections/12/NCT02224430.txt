      emergency room or the hospital using several new "high-tech" methods, including the use of a
      smartphone, health and wellness wristbands/watches and an optional arm patch sensor. These
      devices (some of which are commercially available to the public for purchase), will capture
      ongoing physiological information including sweat gland activity, movement, skin temperature,
      heart rate, breathing rate, and sleep. The smart phone, and an installed application, will
      administer bidaily and weekly symptom assessment, track the general location of the
      participant, and collect statistics about text messaging and cell phone use.

      In addition to the on-body devices participants will come into the clinical research office
      to complete clinical scales every other week. These scales will be used to determine symptom
      exacerbation or relapse. This signature will then be utilized as a marker to examine the data
      collected from the devices.

      The investigators hope to go beyond clinical evaluation and identify a signature of relapse
      that is reliably detected from on body devices in a natural setting. This would cut down on
      the time it takes to successfully treat psychotic illnesses and would reduce the amount of
      pain and and suffering experienced by patients during relapse.
