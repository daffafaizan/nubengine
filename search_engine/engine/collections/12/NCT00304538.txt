      replacement therapy with very low doses of glucagon may prevent hypoglycemia without
      compromising effective glycemic control by insulin. In this study very low doses of glucagon
      will administered to Type I diabetics who use insulin pumps. The glucagon will be
      administered subcutaneously overnight for 6, 9 or 12 hours to see if the number of mild or
      impending hypoglycemia events can be safely decreased. Three different doses of glucagon will
      be compared to a control infusion.
