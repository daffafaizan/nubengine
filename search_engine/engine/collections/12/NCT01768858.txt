      marketing authorization with regards to dose, population and indication. The assignment of a
      participant to an adalimumab-containing regimen was decided in advance and was to be current
      practice. The prescribing of adalimumab was clearly separated from the decision to include
      the participant in the study. Participants were observed for a maximum of 12 months, with a
      total of 5 study visits (Screening = Visit 1).
