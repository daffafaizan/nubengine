      Eligible subjects will undergo a bronchial allergen provocation (BAP) with mite allergen to
      assess the asthmatic response before and after treatment. Subjects will be randomized to two
      parallel treatment groups. Each subject will be treated weekly over 12 weeks either with test
      product or with the reference product (placebo).
