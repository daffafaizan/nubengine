    
      The primary objective of this observational study is to estimate the 90-day response rates to
      treatment for a first episode of C. difficile infections (CDI) in adult transplant
      recipients. This includes treatment success, recurrence, and complications in a prospectively
      followed cohort of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Patients who
      develop CDI within 2 years after transplantation will be enrolled and followed prospectively
      for 90 days after enrollment. Specimens of stool and serum collected within 48 hours of
      initiation of treatment will be stored locally for future epidemiologic studies to examine
      the immunologic and microbiologic risk factors for relapse and treatment failure, as well as
      complications of CDI in the transplant population. Response rates will be classified by organ
      type, hematopoietic stem cell transplant typ, treatment regimen, and immunosuppressive
      regimen.
