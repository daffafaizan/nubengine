      weekly) and Schedule 3 (S3, continuous), which may occur in parallel after observation of
      clinically significant related dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the S1 schedule. Dosing will
      be initiated on Day 1 with intermittent weekly dosing continuing for 21 days (1 Treatment
      Period). Expansion of Dose Escalation Cohorts may occur for S1 and S2 at the recommended
      phase 2 dose level(s) and a Biomarker Expansion Cohort may be opened in S1 and/or S2.
