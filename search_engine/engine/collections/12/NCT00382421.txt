      patients and completely asymptomatic in others, it is now widely accepted that silent
      ischemia, like symptomatic episodes, negatively affects prognosis. Silent ischemia may occur
      in totally asymptomatic patients without (type I) or with a history (type II) of an ischemic
      cardiac event and coexists with symptomatic episodes in many patients (type III). However,
      there is a lack of data on the prognostic importance of silent ischemia in totally
      asymptomatic subjects without history of coronary artery disease (CAD), i.e. silent ischemia
      type I, and, particularly, on a possible benefit of medical therapy in such patients. Reasons
      lie in the difficulty to identify such patients and their expected low event rates implying
      that large patient populations and/or long follow-up periods would be necessary to come to
      definite conclusions. Still, to address this problem, we perform SWISSI 1 which includes
      totally asymptomatic subjects older than 40 years of age without any history of CAD but one
      cardiovascular risk factor with documented silent ischemia. They are randomized to open
      antianginal drug therapy and risk factor control versus only risk factor management and
      followed up for â‰¥ 10 years.
