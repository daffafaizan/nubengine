      pharmacological treatment is a very high. Lifestyle modification is the first trial in stage
      1 hypertension before commencing pharmacological treatment and a co-treatment with drug in
      hypertensive patient. Slow paced breathing training and physical training has been shown to
      reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in HT. Moreover loaded breathing was
      reported to be able to decrease blood pressure in healthy. Loaded slow breathing training may
      enhance the antihypertensive effect of slow paced breathing.
