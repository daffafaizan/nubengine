    
      Objective: The overall objective of this extended follow-up study is to provide data
      regarding the incidence of late age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract surgery and
      lung cancer in the approximately 1,200 AREDS2 study participants enrolled in the Follow-on
      study. The specific objectives for the study are to:

        -  Study the rates of progression to late AMD, neovascular AMD, or geographic atrophy
           associated with AMD.

        -  To seek incidences of lung cancer, by treatment assignment.

        -  To assess cognitive understanding by phone prior to coming into the clinic.

        -  To seek incidences of cardiovascular events.

      Study Population: Up to 3,200 participants who were previously enrolled in the AREDS2 and
      AREDS2 Follow-on protocols are currently followed by telephone contact every six months for
      the past four years. It is expected that 1,200 of these 3,200 participants will be eligible
      to participate in the study. Up to 83 participants will be enrolled at the NEI.

      Design: This is an extension of the multicenter, randomized trial of lutein, zeaxanthin and
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the AMD AREDS2 trial. Data for this extension will be
      collected by staff at selected AREDS2 clinical sites via an in-clinic visit.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes of the study will be the rates of progression to late
      AMD, neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy associated with AMD. Also of interest are the
      long-term rates of progression to late AMD, incidents of lung cancer and cataract surgery.
      Participant reports of incident cardiovascular events will be collected as secondary
      outcomes.
