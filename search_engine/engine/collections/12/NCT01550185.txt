      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the tolerability of daily oral
      eltrombopag (eltrombopag olamine) (14 days +/- 2 days after initiation of cytarabine) in
      patients receiving high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone for the treatment of acute myeloid
      leukemia patients with hypoplastic bone marrow 14 days +/- 2 days from initiation of
      cytarabine.

      II. To examine platelet count recovery to >= 100 x 10^9/L when eltrombopag is administered
      following high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemic
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) from day 1 up to day 62.
      Treatment continues for up to 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
