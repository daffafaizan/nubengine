      D deficiency. Serum 25(OH)D was categorized according to clinically accepted ranges for
      vitamin D deﬁciency (<20 ng/mL), insufﬁciency (20-30 ng/mL), and replete (>30 ng/mL).

      This is a retrospective cohort study of about 2000 infertile couples who undergo their ﬁrst
      IVF/ICSI and IUI cycle at Reproductive Medicine Center of Peking University Third Hospital.
      Patients will be excluded if they refuse to be recruited. Serum samples are collected the day
      when patients first time to Reproductive Medicine Center and were stored at -20℃ until
      assayed. Life style of patients is collected by questionair. Vitamin D status is measured by
      assessing circulating levels of 25(OH)D in frozen, never previously thawed serum samples
      using radioimmunoassay.

      The investigators will comapere the ART outcomes in different groups according to serum
      25(OH)D status.

      In female, the primary outcome is clinical pregnancy rates deﬁned as the presence of an
      intrauterinesac with an embryonic pole demonstrating cardiacactivity at 7 weeks of gestation.
      Secondary outcomes are quality of embryo, positive hCG rates and live birth rates.

      In male, the primary outcome is semen quality, such as semen volume, sperm concentration,
      sperm motility, morphologically normal percent and progressive motile spermatozoa percent.
      Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates.
