      group) was used in 131 and 127 patients, respectively. The recurrence rates of
      gastrointestinal bleeding and refractory hydrothorax/ascites, the cumulative restenosis rates
      in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-years, the incidence rate of hepatic encephalopathy, the rate of
      secondary interventional therapy, the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year survival rates were compared
      between the experimental group and the control group.
