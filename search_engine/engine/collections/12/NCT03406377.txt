    
      This clinical trial is a phase 2, double-blind dose escalation regimen of once-weekly
      OPK-88003 in subjects with T2DM. The trial consists of four phases: a screening/baseline
      phase (up to 2 weeks prior to first dose), a 30-week treatment period consisting of a dose
      escalation phase (8 weeks) and a target dose phase (22 weeks), and a follow-up period (4
      weeks). Subjects will be randomly assigned to volume-matched OPK-88003 or placebo
      administered QW.
