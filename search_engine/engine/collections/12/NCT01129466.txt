      potentiator, sulforaphane (SFN) in the form of its natural precursor, sulforaphane
      glucosinolate (SGSâ„¢). SFN is an isothiocyanate which has generated interest recently as a
      chemopreventive agent in cancer research, and as an antioxidant in inflammation research.
      Recently published data show that 3 days intake of broccoli sprouts in homogenate form is
      followed by significant upregulation of several phase 2 enzymes in nasal cells. Our group's
      research at the UNC Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology (CEMALB)
      focuses on the effects of oxidant pollutants on inflammatory and host defense responses to
      viral infections. One of the aims of our grant is to measure the effects of pre-treatment
      with SFN supplements, on nasal responses to live attenuated influenza virus vaccines. In
      preparation for this larger study, we here propose a pilot study comparing the effects of the
      published BSH supplement, vs. supplementation with foods containing fresh broccoli sprouts,
      on relevant nasal endpoints and serum SFN levels.
