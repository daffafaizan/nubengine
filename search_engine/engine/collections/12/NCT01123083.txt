        -  Screening Visits: 2 to 3 appointments will be conducted to determine eligibility. At 2
           of these visits participants will drink a liquid meal and have blood tests done over the
           post-meal period. Participants will also be required to wear a continuous glucose
           monitor for a short period of time.

        -  Dosing Visits: 8 outpatient visits on consecutive days, each lasting about 2-4 hours.

        -  Follow-up Visits: weekly for the first month, then every 2 weeks for 3 months, followed
           by monthly visits through 1 year. There will be 3 visits in the second year.

        -  The total duration of the study is 2 years.

        -  Glucose test strips and glucose monitors will be provided to participants for the
           duration of the study. Frequent glycemic monitoring will occur through lab testing and
           blood glucose self-monitoring to help facilitate tight glycemic control in all subjects.
           Subjects will be asked to intermittently record their insulin doses using a telephone or
           web based system and continuous glucose monitoring will be performed every 6 months.
