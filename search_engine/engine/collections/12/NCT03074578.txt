      quantified data to have a better understanding the physiological and neurological perception
      of verbal violence, in order to understand the impact it might have on a subject. This
      project aims at assessing the influence of time, sleep, and people interaction on the
      perception of verbal violence. The "cognitive replay" will also be assessed through dreams.
      The investigators think that sleep plays a role in desensitization to negative emotions and
      to memory consolidation. However, the role of sleep in verbal violence remains unknown.
