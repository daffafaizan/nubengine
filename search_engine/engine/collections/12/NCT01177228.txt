      follow-up in Study C13004 (NCT00619489). Participants who did not proceed into Study C13004
      were followed by telephone contact at 6-month intervals for 2 years after the last
      administration of study treatment to collect reports of adverse events, including colectomy,
      severe infections [including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)], and
      dysplasia/cancer.
