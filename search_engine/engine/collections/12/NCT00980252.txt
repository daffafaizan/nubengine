      to their initial course of antipsychotic medications; however, studies indicate that
      nonadherence rates soar as high as 90% in the first year and do not improve over time. To
      date, there is no effective psychosocial intervention that improves adherence or reduces the
      adverse consequences of nonadherence after it occurs. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new
      intervention to improve medication adherence and improve clinical outcomes in patients
      recovering from first-episode schizophrenia.

      This study is to pilot an intervention specifically suited for patients with first-episode
      schizophrenia based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This is to focus
      on adherence from the perspective of the patient.

      Methods: This study compares the effectiveness of a standard psychoeducation program [Team
      Solutions (TS)] to a CBT approach known as the Health Dialogue Intervention (HDI). Consenting
      patients will receive a 4 week stabilization assessment period and then be randomized to a
      prospective, random-assignment study comparing the effectiveness of TS to HDI to improve
      medication adherence of patients recovering from first-episode schizophrenia.
