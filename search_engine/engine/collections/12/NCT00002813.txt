      duration of response, time to treatment failure, and survival in patients with advanced,
      persistent, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours beginning after completion of vinorelbine
      infusion on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 20 months.
