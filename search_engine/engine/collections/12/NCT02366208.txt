      randomized to two groups. The combination group (n= 57) received PEG-Tα1 (1.6 mg/ml, once a
      week, taken subcutaneously) and adefovir (10 mg, once daily, taken orally) for 24 weeks. The
      control group (n = 59) received placebo and adefovir. Both groups received adefovir
      continuously for additional 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the loss of HBeAg at 48 weeks.
      The secondary endpoints included 1) loss of hepatitis B virus ( HBV) DNA, 2) HBeAg
      seroconversion and 3) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization etc. at week 4, 12, 24, 36
      and 48. The number of CD4＋and CD8＋T cells was also determined during 48 weeks.
