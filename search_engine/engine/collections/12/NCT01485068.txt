    
      The DEBREST clinical trial is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, interventional
      study evaluating the investigational Danubio Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Balloon in patients
      with in-stent restenosis (ISR) lesion(s) with reference vessel diameter ≥2.5 mm and ≤3.5 mm.
      The trial will allow the treatment of up to two ISR (either Bare Metal Stent (BMS) or Drug
      Eluting Stent (DES) ISR) per patient in native coronary arteries with mandatory predilatation
      with a conventional balloon.

      The DEBREST clinical trial will enroll 60 patients. All patients will receive Quantitative
      Coronary Angiography (QCA) before and after Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) inflation and at 6
      months follow-up. All patients will have a clinical follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months.
