      nervous system (CNS), is the most common cause of progressive neurologic dysfunction in early
      to middle adulthood. People with MS are a markedly high risk for sleep disturbance. Estimates
      of the lifetime prevalence of sleep disturbance in MS reach 50%; sleep disturbance is also
      associated with excess MS-associated morbidity and diminished quality of life. Despite the
      high burden of impaired sleep and its contribution to adverse MS outcomes, effective
      approaches to treat and ameliorate disturbed sleep in people with MS remain poorly
      understood. There is unmet need to develop safe and effective rehabilitative alternatives to
      mitigate sleep disturbance in MS. Prior research supports the use of timed bright light
      therapy (LT) as one such approach for insomnia and sleepiness in those with sleep disorders
      or other neurologic diseases. Yet, the safety and potential effectiveness of timed LT have
      yet to be tested in MS. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct a detailed intervention
      study testing if timed bright LT in people with MS is 1) safe (primary outcome) and 2)
      potentially effective for reducing sleep disturbance (specifically, reducing insomnia,
      fatigue and improving sleep efficiency, quantity and quality as secondary outcomes). The
      study will also explore whether LT stimulates a novel subtype of retinal ganglion cells which
      are central to the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep.
