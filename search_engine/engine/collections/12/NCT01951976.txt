      intervention condition in which they participate in group Iyengar yoga classes for 90 minutes
      twice per week for 12 weeks (total of 24 classes). Study outcomes are assessed: 1) following
      recruitment but prior to the first yoga class; and 2) within two weeks post-intervention
      (follow-up). Additionally, a brief assessment of pain will be conducted four weeks and eight
      weeks after the start of yoga classes.
