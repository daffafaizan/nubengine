      an important issue in many countries; Health Information (HI) technology has been considered
      as a potentially effective answer to this issue. The French Health Ministry first funded the
      development of five TSN ("Territoire de Soins Num√©rique" / Digital health territories)
      programs, aiming at improving healthcare coordination and access to information for
      healthcare providers, patients or the population, and at improving healthcare professionals
      work organization; The French Health Ministry then launched a call for grant to fund one Eva
      TSN project consisting in evaluating the TSN programs implementation and impact and to
      develop a model for HI technology evaluation.
