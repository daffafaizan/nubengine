      Primary

        -  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of using previously reported morphometric criteria
           for chromatin distribution, shortest distance between nuclei, and/or the ratio of
           nucleoli area to nucleus area in a conventional Pap smear from patients with a cytologic
           diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of unspecified significance (AGUS) to predict the
           presence of significant glandular lesions (i.e., adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS] or
           invasive cancer) and/or squamous lesions (i.e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN2
           or CIN3]) of the cervix.

      Secondary

        -  To optimize the diagnostic accuracy of using chromatin distribution, shortest distance
           between nuclei, and/or the ratio of nucleoli area to nucleus area in a conventional Pap
           smear from patients with a cytologic diagnosis of AGUS to predict the presence of
           significant glandular lesions (i.e., AIS or invasive cancer) and/or squamous lesions
           (i.e., CIN2 or CIN3) of the cervix.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected slides from Pap smears of patients enrolled on clinical trial
      GOG-171 are assessed for nuclear chromatin distribution, the shortest distances between the
      central points of neighboring cell nuclei, and nucleoli area/nucleus area (N/N) ratio via
      morphometric analysis.
