    
      Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by intermittent cessation or decrease of airflow
      and effort of breathing during sleep. The diagnostic criteria for CSA varies according to the
      type of CSA (e.g. CSA due to cardiac failure, due to a medication, ...).

      CSA is defined as: (1) an apnea/hypopnea index â‰¥ 15 per hour of sleep and (2) the number of
      central apneas and/or hypopneas is > 50% of the total number of apneas and hypopneas.

      Presence of CSA is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality.
      Furthermore, in patients with heart failure, presence of CSA was found to be related to
      mortality. As yet, however, there is insufficient knowledge on the clinical features,
      pathophysiological background and consecutive algorithms for treatment. Currently, it is not
      fully clear whether CSA or the treatment of CSA is related to disease progress.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the current treatment choices for CSA in Belgium and
      compliance with and effects of these treatments.
