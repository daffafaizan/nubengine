    
      In patients who were planned to receive an operation with intrathecal anesthesia, NIRS (INVOS
      Cerebral Oximeter Model 5100B; Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA) with two adhesive patches was used
      to monitor rSO2. One patch was applied over the biceps brachii muscle,(the body part above
      the anaesthetic level), and the other patch was applied over the medial side of the
      gastrocnemius muscle of the non-surgical leg,(the body part below the anaesthetic level). In
      both extremities, rSO2 was monitored continuously and recorded every minute from before
      intrathecal bupivacaine injection until 15 min after injection. Isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%
      10-15 mg was injected intrathecally and the level of anaesthesia was examined 10 min later by
      loss of cold sensation to alcohol swab by an anaesthetist not involved in the study. the
      changes of rSO2 of upper and lower extrimities were recorded and analysed.
