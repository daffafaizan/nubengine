      dietary supplement CardioFlex Q10 for 90 days can reduce cardiovascular risk factors in
      healthy adults. The health markers that will be tested include the participant's waist
      circumference, body weight, body mass index (BMI), atherosclerosis risk factors (blood
      pressure, plethysmogram (PTG) wave form, heart rate variability, accelerated plethysmograph
      (APG) type (biological age of arteries)), and blood work including total plasma lipid profile
      (total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL),
      triglycerides (TGs)), kidney and liver function (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine),
      and inflammatory and endothelial function biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6
      (IL-6), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell
      adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) ).

      All health markers will be tested the day before starting the study and the day after the
      study is completed.
