      non-pharmacological interventions with strong potential to prevent or delay the onset of AD
      in high-risk populations (e.g., those with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) is critically
      important. Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are 2 promising interventions for
      preventing AD. Aerobic exercise increases aerobic fitness, which in turn improves brain
      structure and function, while cognitive training improves selective neural function
      intensively. Hence, combined Aerobic exercise and Cognitive Training (ACT) may very well have
      an additive or synergistic effect on cognition by complementary strengthening of different
      neural functions. Few studies have tested ACT's effects, and those studies have reported
      discrepant findings, largely due to varying ACT programs. The purpose of this single-blinded,
      2Ã—2 factorial Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the efficacy and
      additive/synergistic effects of a 6-month combined cycling and speed of processing (SOP)
      training intervention on cognition and relevant mechanisms (aerobic fitness, AD signature
      cortical thickness, and functional connectivity in the default mode network [DMN]) in older
      adults with amnestic MCI (aMCI).
