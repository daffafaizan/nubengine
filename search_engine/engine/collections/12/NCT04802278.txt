      transferred - both transplacentally and through breastfeeding, from mother to child, in the
      context of COVID-19.

      We first recruit all babies delivered to mothers convalescent from antenatal COVID-19, to 1)
      follow up their growth and development, and 2) study the protective effects of antibodies
      transferred from mother to child transplacentally during pregnancy, as well as postnatally
      through breastfeeding. We compare these to a cohort of healthy controls whose mothers did not
      have COVID-19 during pregnancy.

      Next, we compare the protective effects of antibodies transferred during breastfeeding from
      mother to child after lactating mothers are vaccinated against COVID-19, to that of natural
      infection. We also study the safety of breastfeeding after vaccination by looking for vaccine
      components in the breast milk.
