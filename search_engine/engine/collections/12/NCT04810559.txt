    
      Background and Rationale:

      At the end of 2018, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) noted 2,242 new HIV infections
      (incidence rate of 6 per 100,000 people) representing a slight increase from 2016 estimates.
      For the same period, PHAC estimated there were 62,050 Canadians living with HIV (prevalence
      rate 167 per 100,000) and about 18,700 Canadians were missed throughout the HIV care
      continuum, including 8,300 who are living with HIV but were undiagnosed. This represents
      about 13% of Canadians living with HIV but are unaware of their status and not in care.

      As testing is the entry point to HIV care, it is likely that those who are undiagnosed are
      not engaging in HIV testing services. PHAC's "Pan-Canadian Framework for Action " sets out an
      overarching and comprehensive approach to address sexually transmitted and blood-borne
      infections including HIV, and is composed of 26 opportunities for action, including enhancing
      testing. Testing opportunities which include elimination of barriers to access testing and
      normalization of testing through primary healthcare providers (HCPs), strategies that use
      community-based services and HIV self-testing could help Canada reach the undiagnosed.
      However, testing by HCPs within clinical settings remains the foundation to Canadian HIV care
      programs.

      Point-of-care (POC) tests for HIV may have substantial utility for increased identification
      of HIV-infected individuals through their relative ease of use and portability, as well as
      their ability to deliver rapid, actionable results while the HCP still has access to the
      patient. OraSure Technologies, Inc. has developed a POC test, the OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2
      Rapid Antibody Test, which requires no additional instrumentation and can be used by HCPs in
      multiple near patient settings. The OraQuick ADVANCE® Test is a single-use, visually read,
      qualitative, in vitro lateral flow immunoassay to detect antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 in
      oral fluid and fingerstick blood. The Test package includes a specific step-by-step
      instructions, the device, testing buffer solution and a device stand. It is available in the
      United States (FDA approved) but is not currently approved for use in Canada.

      Currently only blood-based POC tests for HIV are licensed for use in Canada. Having a
      licensed, oral-fluid test in addition to blood-based tests available for use in Canada
      provides another option to increase the uptake of HIV testing, and further increase the
      potential of reaching undiagnosed individuals living with HIV in Canada. Studies have shown
      that interest and acceptability of testing with oral fluid is high.

      The objective of this near patient study is to demonstrate the simplicity and accuracy of the
      OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test when used by untrained HCPs in a clinical
      setting. A secondary objective includes the ability of HCPs to correctly interpret a variety
      of contrived (mock) test device results.

      Hypothesis: The OraQuickADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test as performed by untrained HCPs
      will meet or exceed the accuracy, usability and label comprehension requirements from Health
      Canada for license as a Class IV in vitro diagnostic device for Canadian market entry.

      Study Design:

      This study was designed around the requirements set out in the Health Canada Guidance
      Document: "Guidance for Manufacturers of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Rapid Diagnostic
      Tests (RDT's) for Use at Point of Care or Self Testing, 2017". It is a blinded, controlled
      study to evaluate the ability of HCPs to perform and interpret the results of the OraQuick
      ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test.

      This protocol involves collection of oral fluid and fingerstick whole blood from
      approximately 600 patients to test with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test device. Testing will be
      conducted by HCPs (blinded to patient's history and HIV diagnosis) in clinical settings. All
      patient participants will also have a venous blood sample collected (prior to fingerstick and
      oral fluid collection) for testing of plasma at a central laboratory with a 4th generation
      HIV Ag/Ab EIA (licensed for use in Canada) and positives will be confirmed using a standard
      HIV testing algorithm in place at the respective central laboratories. Results from the
      OraQuick ADVANCE® Test will be compared to results from the blood based 4th generation EIA.
      The sensitivity and specificity of the test result will be calculated relative to the
      confirmatory test process, where applicable. HCP qualification and assessment of the ease of
      device use will be evaluated. HCPs will also read and interpret 20 contrived (mock) device
      results in order to assess their ability to correctly interpret 5 potential test results,
      i.e. strong positive, weak positive, negative, invalid with no control and no test line, and
      invalid with no control and a positive test line.

      Investigators will provide descriptive statistics for subject and HCP parameters. Test
      results will be compared to a Health Canada licensed 4th generation EIA test and
      investigators will calculate positive and negative percent agreement (with two-sided 95%
      confidence interval for both) for each matrix (fingerstick and oral fluid) separately. For
      mock device interpretation, agreement of the OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV-1/2 Rapid Antibody Test
      results with each sample type reactivity will be calculated overall and for each HCP
      operator. Safety will be assessed by the incidence of reported adverse events.

      Sample population:

      The study population requirements published by Health Canada for near patient studies of
      untrained HCP testers stipulates that the prospective study include: A minimum of 3 POC sites
      (different geographic locations), a minimum of 9 HCPs, 200 known HIV positive individuals and
      400 individuals whose HIV status is unknown including 200 individuals at high risk of HIV
      infection (e.g. intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, etc.). Self-reported
      practices or behaviour will be used to define those at high risk.

      will meet or exceed the accuracy, usability and label comprehension requirements from Health
      Canada for license as a Class IV in vitro diagnostic device for Canadian market entry.

      Study Intervention Details:

      HCPs will be recruited by site coordinators first. If HCPs are interested in participating
      they will complete the informed consent process and then complete an initial HCP
      questionnaire which will collect information such as demographics, occupation and POC device
      experience (about 15 minutes).

      After this, patients will be recruited to the study when they come in for voluntary HIV
      testing (e.g. POC testing) and routine HIV follow-up care at study sites. If patients consent
      to participating, all those enrolled will voluntarily complete a questionnaire (collecting
      demographics and HIV medical history information) and then provide their venous whole blood
      sample (for clinical laboratory testing) and fingerstick and oral fluid specimens, for the
      testing with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Test - Visit 1 (day 1; about 40 - 60 minutes) as per
      protocol and study procedures. An unblinded HCP will administer the patient questionnaire and
      collect the venous whole blood sample. All patients will have a clinical laboratory test done
      for performance comparison using their venous sample, but only those with unknown HIV status
      will be instructed to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit two (2) weeks later to
      obtain their laboratory test results (Visit 2; about 10 - 15 minutes). Patients may also have
      a point-of-care (POC) test conducted on site as part of the clinic's standard of care
      testing, outside of the protocol and after all study procedures for Visit 1 are completed.

      Two HCPs who are blinded to the patient history (including HIV diagnosis) will collect and
      test patient specimens, either the oral fluid or the fingerstick whole blood, using the
      OraQuick ADVANCE® Test by following the instructions provided in the Step-by-Step Instruction
      Guide and Package Insert for the Test. HCPs will then read, interpret (following the
      instruction guide) and document these test results for each patient. Sampling, testing and
      recording is estimated between 20 - 40 minutes per patient participant. At the end of testing
      at a site, HCPs will complete a second questionnaire which will include reading and
      interpreting 20 mock (contrived) device results, comprehension questions and collect
      information about ease of use and experience with the Test (about 1 hour).
