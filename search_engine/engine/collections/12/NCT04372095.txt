      the cyproterone acetate.

      The investigators observed several familial cases of CPA related meningiomas, suggesting a
      strong genetic factor that modulates the risk to develop meningiomas in patients exposed to
      CPA. The aim of this project is to generate a biobank permitting, in future studies, to
      identify the genetic locus/loci associated with an increased risk to develop meningiomas
      after CPA (Androcur®) treatment, using a GWAS approach.

      Enrollment of patients will take place in hospitals where the patients are treated and also
      via the social networking sites such as Facebook. There will be 4 groups of subjects. Five
      hundred patients will be enrolled in each group targeting 2000 patients in total, among which
      1000 patients (Groupe 1 and Groupe 2) will participate in the biobank.

      Six centers in 5 university hospitals of APHP (Pitié-Salpêtrière, Ambroise Paré, Cochin,
      Lariboisière, Saint-Antoine) will be involved in the study.

      La duration of enrollment will be 24 months. The participation duration for each subject will
      be 1 hour. Statistics analysis method: SAS 9.1.3.
