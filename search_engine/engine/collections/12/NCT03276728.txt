    
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single day ascending dose
      (SDAD) study (Part A), a multiple daily ascending dose (MDAD) study (Part B), in healthy
      subjects, and a MDAD study (Part C) in heart failure patients. In Parts A and B of the study,
      healthy volunteers will receive AMG 986 by continuous IV infusion or by oral administration
      in a fasted state. IV Infusions will be divided into an initial loading dose (LD) for the
      first hour followed immediately by a maintenance dose (MD).

      In Part C of the study, patients with heart failure and either reduced (HFrEF) or preserved
      (HFpEF) ejection fraction will receive MDAD of AMG 986 or matching placebo once daily by oral
      administration for 21 days.
