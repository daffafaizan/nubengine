      the USA despite availability of effective treatment. People who are aware of their HIV
      status, but who are out of care and not on medications, are therefore at risk of developing
      HIV related health problems. In addition, people with HIV who are out of care are at greater
      risk of transmitting HIV compared to people on HIV treatment with suppressed levels of virus
      in plasma. To date, there are no interventions that have been shown to successfully link this
      "out of care" population back into care and successfully maintain viral suppression.

      This study will test a strategy of providing immediate HIV therapy drugs, linkage to care,
      and a randomized intervention (60-minutes for health or diet and nutrition session). The goal
      of the study is to demonstrate that the 60-Minutes-for-Health intervention improves the rate
      of viral suppression at 24 weeks.

      The use of rapid antiretroviral therapy (rapid ART), defined as the initiation of ART within
      7 days of HIV diagnosis, has been associated with improved rates of linkage to care,
      retention in care and virological suppression after 1 year among persons newly diagnoses with
      HIV. In addition, the behavioral intervention, "60-Minutes-for-Health", was shown in a pilot
      study to improve retention in care among PWH-OOC. We aim to undertake a study to evaluate the
      feasibility of providing rapid-ART to people who are aware of their HIV status, but have been
      out of care at the time they re-engage in care. In addition, study participants will be
      randomized to either the "60-Minutes-for-Health" intervention or a 60 minute diet and
      nutrition control session.
