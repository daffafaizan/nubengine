      insensitive and non-specific measure for use in individual decision-making. Frailty has been
      emerging to take its rightful place as a better measure for over past decades. Despite
      general consensus that the concept of frailty is clinically useful, the lack of agreement on
      its definition and the challenge of its measurement by front-line health providers mean that
      frailty remains only 'their apparent' to chronological age as a criterion to select older
      persons at risk.
