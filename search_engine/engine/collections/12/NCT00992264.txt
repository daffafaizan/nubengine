      Optimization Strategy. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 16 different
      combinations of the 4 experimental factors. Each factor was explored on 2 contrasting levels.
      Each contrasting factor level was then compared to the other, resulting in 4 analytic arms.
      Within each arm, all participants (n = 1865) were analyzed to determine the relative effect
      of each contrasting factor level on the primary and secondary outcomes of interest.
