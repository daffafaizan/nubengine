      resorption because of periodontal disease, traumatic extraction or surgical removal
      associated with treatment of invasive lesions.

      Ossix Volumax is a novel volume maintaining collagen scaffold designed for bone augmentation
      in the atrophic ridge. It is 1-2 mm in thickness and undergoes mineralization progressing
      into ossification.

      Thirty subjects requiring lateral bone augmentation of the maxilla or the mandible will be
      recruited study: Of these, twenty will be recruited and treated at the School of Dental
      Medicine, Harvard University, Boston, USA and ten (10) at the School of Graduate Dentistry,
      Rambam health care campus, Haifa, Israel.

      Hypothesis:

      The use of Ossix Volumax as a stand-alone augmentation material will results similar increase
      in the ridge width and volume compared to FDBA and barrier membrane when coupled together.
