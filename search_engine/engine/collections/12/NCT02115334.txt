    
      A total of 36 children with DD, aged 2-6 years, were randomly assigned to the
      professional-based group (professional therapists delivering the PHPA, total n=13),
      parents-based group (parents executing the PHPA, n=12) and control group (health education
      only, n=11). Outcome measures included clinical assessments and subjective questionnaires.
      The clinical assessments were Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers
      (CDIIT). The subjective questionnaires were Chinese Child Developmental Inventory (CCDI),
      Assessment of preschool children's participation (APCP), TN0-AZL Preschool quality of life
      (TAPQOL) and parent stress index (PSI). Tests were administrated before and after the
      intervention.
