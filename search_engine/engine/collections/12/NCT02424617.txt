      11 clinical sites in the US.

      Up to approximately 66 patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed Stage IIIb or
      Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer will receive BGB324 as a single agent (Run-in Cohort(mono
      therapy)) or in combination with erlotinib (Arms A, B, C).

      Run-in Arm to establish the safety and tolerability of BGB324 administered as a single agent.
      BGB324 will be administered at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1,
      followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. After 6 patients have been dosed and safety established
      Arm A ( dose escalation arm) will be opened to confirm the BGB324 to be used in combination
      with erlotinib.

      In Arm A the dose of BGB324 will be escalated in a standard 3+3 fashion until an MTD of the
      combination ( BGB324+ erlotinib) is established. The dose of BGB324 to be investigated in arm
      B and C will be confirmed upon recommendation of a Safety Review Committee.

      Arm B and C will open in parallel and will investigate BGB324 in combination with erlotinib.
