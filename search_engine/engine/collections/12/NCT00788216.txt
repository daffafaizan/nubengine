      (VAS) and TTO (TTO) methods. The subject will be asked to read a pertinent health state
      description and listen while it is read aloud. She will first be asked to place the state on
      a continuum (VAS) from zero to 100, with 100 presenting perfect health and zero presenting
      death. The TTO interview will then be administered. The subject will be asked to assume a
      remaining life expectancy of 30 years, and to choose between 30 years in the health state
      described or 29 years in a state of perfect health. The utility of the health state, a number
      between zero and one, is calculated as the minimum number of years the patient would accept
      divided by 30. Each subject will be asked to review and valuate 20 health states over the
      course of 60-90 minutes.
