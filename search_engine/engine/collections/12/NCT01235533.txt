      information-processing speed, working memory, attention and episodic memory, even after
      depressive symptoms subside and some of them further progress to dementia in two to four
      years. Several epidemiological studies, fatty acid comparison studies, animal studies, and
      clinical trials found that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were significantly
      associated with the major depression, cognitive decline in general population and Alzheimer's
      disease. Until now, there is no study investigating the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressive
      symptoms and cognition in patients with late-life depression. Thus, the aims of this study
      were to investigate whether fish oil supplementation, compared to placebo (olive oil), could
      have better effects on depression course and cognitive function in older people with major
      depression.
