      treatment, rates of binge eating behavior range from 20-36%. Studies of non-treatment seeking
      adolescents have also identified high rates of binge eating, suggesting that this behavior is
      not exclusive to clinical samples. Moreover, as in adults, binge eating in youth is
      associated with numerous psychosocial problems, including depression, anxiety, low
      self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and weight concern.

      Stepped-care models provide a lower intensity treatment and modify subsequent treatment
      intensity based on early treatment response. A stepped-care model would build upon the
      clinical treatment resources already established at the study site.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct a small pilot of the stepped-care model. All
      participants will begin with the same initial treatment, an introductory behavioral weight
      loss group for parents and adolescents with abnormal weight gain and/or overweight/obesity.
      Early responders will continue in this treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who
      show a weaker early response will be assigned to a higher intensity individualized treatment.
      All participants will receive 16 weeks of treatment.Assessments will occur at three time
      points: prior to intervention (baseline), mid-treatment (4 weeks), and end of treatment (16
      weeks). The investigators will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effectiveness of the stepped care approach. These data will inform the development of a
      subsequent RCT.
