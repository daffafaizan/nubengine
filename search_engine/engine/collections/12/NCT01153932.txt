      study in ambulant subjects with DMD resulting from a mutation that can be corrected by exon
      skipping induced by GSK2402968. The study aims to randomise 54 subjects. There will be 2
      parallel cohorts. Each cohort will include subjects on GSK2402968 and matched placebo in a
      2:1 ratio.
