    
      The overall objective is to assess the safety of ublituximab as add-on therapy to steroids
      for treatment of acute optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis in NMO and NMOSD.

      Primary Objective To assess safety of acute B cell depletion in NMO subjects with acute
      relapse of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis who are treated with ublituximab +
      glucocorticoids beginning on dose administration and ending with recovery of B cells.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the B cell depletion pharmacokinetics of ublituximab in the NMO patients
           population with monthly B cell counts for up to 9 months.

        -  To determine the frequency of adverse events with ublituximab in this patient
           population.

      Trial Design Given the severity and the consequences of relapse in NMO, placebo treatment
      without steroid treatment is unethical and use of an active treatment is considered
      mandatory. The potential of currently utilized drugs and techniques to reduce the
      inflammation in NMO has been established primarily through expert consensus and small open
      label and retrospective studies.

      This is a Phase 1 open-label, standard-of-care, single treatment arm, unblinded, single
      center interventional trial in NMO/NMOSD patients in which experimental subjects will receive
      one (1) infusion of 450 mg of intravenous ublituximab at the onset of an NMO exacerbation in
      addition to standard of care treatment with daily intravenous glucocorticoid at 1000 mg for
      five days.
