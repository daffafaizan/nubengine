      Endoprosthesis Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life threatening disease. There is a
      consensus to propose surgical repair in patients with a reasonable operative risk when the
      AAA exceeds 5 cm in diameter.

      The aim of the study is to compare the mortality and the occurrence of severe general,
      vascular and local complications in two groups of patients treated by either by open surgery
      or by EVAR (EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair). The main outcome criteria and the secondary
      endpoint are respectively the survival without severe complications and minor morbidity.
