    
      This study aims to test the efficacy of the ActiPatch® device by means of a randomised double
      blind controlled trial in a convenience sample of chronic low back pain patients at Royal
      Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) pain clinic. Outcome measures are validated psychometric
      measures evaluating known determinants of pain related disability, functional capacity
      measures, and pain scores; and a bespoke questionnaire assessing fidelity with recommended
      usage, and willingness to reduce analgesic or other pain related medications with the future
      assistance of the ActiPatch®.
