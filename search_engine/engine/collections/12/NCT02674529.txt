      of treatment response in depression. Still, despite obvious scientific progress in this
      field, the ability to implement neuroimaging biomarkers of antidepressant treatment response
      in clinical trial settings is lacking. In order to objectively asses the neural bases of
      treatment response in depression, the investigators will use a "Real-time Neurofeedback fMRI
      task", specifically designed to record and modulate mood improvement by providing
      neurofeedback in the context of the administration of an antidepressant treatment. In a pilot
      study, positive neurofeedback during the administration of the drug was associated with
      significant acute mood improvement and increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
      responses in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a common neural target of
      antidepressant treatments. The central hypothesis is that antidepressant effects in
      depression are mediated by increased neural activity in the rACC (AIM1), which can be used in
      clinical trials of antidepressant treatment to predict antidepressant effects (AIM 2) and
      assess the effect of antidepressant treatment on antidepressant-induced rACC neural responses
      (AIM 3). The results obtained from this project are expected to have an important impact on
      our ability to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms implicated in antidepressant
      treatment responses in patients with depression, as well as on the ability to implement
      neuroimaging biomarkers of treatment response in the clinical trial settings.
