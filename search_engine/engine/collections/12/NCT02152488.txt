      multigate 2Mhz pulsed wave Transcranial Doppler (Multidop T1, Software Multiflow MF version
      8.27j, DWL Corp., Sipplingen, Germany). Using a trans-temporal approach to the proximal
      segment (M1) of the MCA, the Doppler probes were fixed bilaterally with an adjustable
      mounting (SPENCER helmet) to keep the angle and depth of insonation constant over time. With
      the upper cervical spine in a neutral sagittal orientation, the insonation depth was chosen
      between 45 and 55 mm and the point permitting best recording was fixed. A sample volume of 5
      mm, a sonographic frequency of 128 Hz FFT, and a fast sweep for temporal overlap were
      determined. Low power and low gain was set within the dynamic range of the system. All
      measurements were performed between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, by the same examiner (JL) in a
      quiet, warm, well-lit room. Each subject was asked to assume a relaxed, supine position.
      Patients eyes were closed to eliminate stimulation of the occipital cortex. Three minutes
      rest were provided to acclimatize and stabilize haemodynamically. Non-invasive blood pressure
      was measured at both arms before and after the procedure to ensure that any possible changes
      in blood flow were not related to blood pressure changes. The time-averaged mean blood flow
      velocities on both sides were measured with the cervical spine in neutral position, rotated
      maximally to the left, then to the right, hyperextended and then hyperextended and rotated to
      the left and to the right position. Measurements were performed after 1 min of stable blood
      flow. Neutral position was reestablished after each position and next maneuver started after
      blood velocities in neutral position had normalized to velocities in starting neutral
      position.
