      months of age. In 2007, 2211 families from Copenhagen were randomly selected through the
      National Civil Registry and invited to participate in the study by letter. The participants
      were invited to three examinations at 9 months ±2 weeks, 18 months ±4 weeks and 36 months ±3
      months. A total of 330 children are included in the study, where 312 have completed the 9
      months examination, 291 completed the 18 months examination and 263 completed the 3-year
      examination. All examinations took place at Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports,
      Frederiksberg Denmark. The examinations involved collecting a broad spectrum of data.
      Following data were collected: anthropometry (weight, height, age- and sex-specific Z-scores
      for body composition, triceps and subscapularis skinfolds), background interview (concerning
      e.g. infant feeding, household income, the parent's educational level, allergy and chronic
      diseases), blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure), faeces- and urine
      sample, blood samples (9 and 36 months), Bio impedance analysis (36 months), 7 day diet
      registration, general questionaire (concerning e.g. sleep, daycare, attendance and use of
      screen devices), psychomotor questionnaire (motoric development), 7 day physical activity
      monitoring and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (36 months).
