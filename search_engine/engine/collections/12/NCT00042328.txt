      be drawn to evaluate the pharmacology (how the body handles the drug). Blood samples (less
      than one teaspoon each) will be obtained before receiving the drug and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5,
      6, and 8 hours after receiving the drug. The total amount of blood drawn from patients for
      all blood work including routine blood tests as well as pharmacokinetics will not be greater
      than 5% of the total blood volume.

      We will also have all urine output collected for 8 hours starting at the time patients
      receive the dose of valacyclovir. A 5cc sample of urine will be collected and analyzed to
      determine how the body handles the drug at hours 2, 4, 6, and 8.
