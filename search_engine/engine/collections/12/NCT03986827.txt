      program for youth SAD compared to a generic G-CBT program for anxiety disorders.

      Reduction in anxiety symptoms is expected for both treatment conditions although we
      hypothesize better outcome for the enhanced treatment condition.

      Approximately 96 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years will be included with data points at pre-
      and post-treatment, and at 3-month and 1-year follow-ups.
