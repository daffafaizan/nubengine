    
      This is an open-label, single-blind study to evaluate the effect of informing subjects of
      their individualized risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma on proportion of subjects who
      achieve compliance with requested follow-up with a dermatology healthcare provider, defined
      as in-person follow-up within 365 days following diagnosis of initial basal cell carcinoma.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to "intervention" (knowledge of individualized risk) or
      "control" (lack of awareness of individualized risk). Investigators will be aware of the
      modelled risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma for all subjects, but only subjects
      randomized to the "intervention" arm will be informed of their modelled risk. All subjects
      will receive standard sun avoidance counseling and will be requested to follow-up no later
      than 365 days from initial basal cell carcinoma diagnosis.
