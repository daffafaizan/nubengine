      the workplace being unsustainable due to the requirement of deliberate and dedicated time
      away from work, this group-randomized trial will test the efficacy of sit-stand workstations
      on decreasing sitting time and increasing light-intensity physical activity (LPA) in a highly
      generalizable sample of office worksites using a multi-level intervention with high potential
      for dissemination.
