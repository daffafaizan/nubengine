    
      Eligible subjects will be identified by the Senior Cardiothoracic Physical Therapist (Dr.
      Craig D. Feinman, PT, DPT) on staff at North Shore University Hospital. Dr. Feinman will
      provide basic study information to potential subjects and refer those that are interested in
      the study to the research team who will then provide a copy of the consent form and more
      information about the study. Inclusion Criteria represents post-surgical adult patients who
      had a median or midline sternotomy incision during cardiac surgery at North-Shore University
      Hospital. Exclusion Criteria represents patients with dementia or those that are cognitively
      impaired will be excluded from the study.

      A T-test or Mann Whitney U test will be use to compare group differences on continuous
      variables, e.g. age. Beta regression or logistic regression model will be developed for the
      outcomes of adherence and readmission proportions/rates. To assess changes from pre to post
      training on behavioral intentions a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank for matched pairs
      will be used. A result will be considered statistically significant at the p<0.05 level of
      significance. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
