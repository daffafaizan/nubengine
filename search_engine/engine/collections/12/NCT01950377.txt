      signaling pathway on metric measures of impulsivity. Our hypothesis is that increased
      dopamine levels or conversion of dopamine to intracellular signals, brought about by specific
      variants of genes in this pathway, will increase impulsivity in our behavioral tasks. We will
      examine variability by recruiting up to 400 ethnically and racially diverse healthy adult
      male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55. We will carry out genotyping, behavioral testing
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging on this group. We will initially recruit a large
      pool of subjects for behavioral testing and genotyping. Behavioral tests will include various
      laboratory tasks related to impulsivity. We have recently developed a series of tasks that we
      have used in a group of Parkinson s patients with impulsive/compulsive behaviors (PD+ICBs).
      Several tasks have shown large group effects between Parkinson s patients with and without
      ICBs (PD +/- ICBs). We will focus on those tasks in the present study. Specific examples
      include information sampling tasks and measures of novelty preference. If genetic effects on
      behavior in the large sample are found, we will ask a subset of the original sample to return
      for fMRI testing. The subset will be selected to allow us to examine the neural circuits that
      operate differently as a function of genotype. In other words, they will be selected on the
      basis of their genotype. The outcome measure in this case will be differences in brain
      activity as a function of genotype, during performance of our behavioral task.
