      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer. Any number of prior
      therapies is allowed. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks at a fixed dose of 200
      mg IV. Dinaciclib will be administered D1 and D8 of a 21 day cycle by 2-hour intravenous
      infusion. The starting dose level of this study will be dinaciclib 12 mg/m2 in combination
      with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV. The dose of dinaciclib will be escalated following a toxicity
      probability interval (TPI) design which targets a DLT rate of ~ 25% . The primary objective
      is to define the maximum tolerated and recommended phase 2 dose (MTD and RP2D) of dinaciclib
      when given weekly in this combination and schedule. The primary endpoint is safety and
      tolerability. MTD will be defined in at least 6 patients. Secondary objectives include
      evaluation of the preliminary efficacy of this combination using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST.
      Exploratory studies characterizing and correlating PDL-1 and MYC overexpression with clinical
      response will be performed. Tumor biopsies are mandatory unless otherwise specified.
