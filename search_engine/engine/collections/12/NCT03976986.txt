      travelling on commercial aircrafts is predicted to rise up to 8.2 billion passengers in 2037.
      Therefore evidence-based flight recommendations will gain importance in the future,
      especially for patients suffering from chronic diseases. Hypoxic Challenge Testing (HCT) is
      the recommended method for inflight hypoxia risk assessment where nitrogen is introduced in a
      plethysmograph reducing FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) to 0.15. Oxygen supply is
      recommended if PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood) drops <50-55 mmHg (in
      adults) or Sat.O2 (oxygen saturation) â‰¤ 85% (in infants) where non-invasive pulse oximetry is
      the recommended method for hypoxia assessment. Onboard oxygen administration remains
      controversial. The effectiveness of pulsed-dosed systems remains unclear in small patients
      due to shallow breathing patterns. The aim of our study is to establish the effectiveness and
      safety of POCs in infants undergoing HCT.
