      antihypertensive drugs like ramipril. The study will assess the safety and blood pressure
      effects of several doses of the antihypertensive drug ramipril in children and adolescents
      age 6-16 years. Approximately 450 children will be given placebo, or 1 of the 3 doses of
      ramipril. The treatment assigned will be done by chance, like flipping a coin. Approximately
      120 study centers throughout the world will participate in the trial.

      Each child will complete a 1- to 4-week Screening Period where they will stop taking their
      current blood pressure lowering drug(s), a 4-week Treatment Period where they will receive
      placebo or one of the ramipril doses, and a Follow-up visit 1 week after completion of the
      Treatment Period. Children diagnosed with hypertension according to the fourth report on the
      diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure in children and adolescents (U.S.
      report), will be included in the study if their blood pressure meets certain values.

      Each child will complete a minimum of 6 and up to 9 clinic visits over the course of the
      study during which procedures and assessments of blood pressure and safety will be performed.
      In addition, a child's parents/guardians will be instructed to measure their child's blood
      pressure at home between clinic visits.

      A planned interim analysis was performed after approximately 240 subjects completed the
      trial. The study was stopped, as permitted by protocol, after the analysis.
