      The primary objective is to evaluate patients referred with a diagnosis of frontotemporal
      dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or related adult-onset neurodegenerative
      disorder to assess patient eligibility for ongoing protocols. The secondary objective is to
      develop and maintain a registry of characterized patients and presymptopmatic carriers of
      gene mutations that cause ALS or FTD. An exploratory objective is to obtain biospecimens from
      clinically characterized patients to carry out laboratory-based studies aimed at
      understanding the molecular pathways and genetic overlap between these neurodegenerative
      disorders.

      Study population

      Adults referred with clinical diagnoses of frontotemporal dementia, motor neuron disorder, or
      related adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Presymptomatic carriers of genes that cause
      familial FTD or ALS.

      Design

      Participants will all undergo clinical tests to confirm diagnoses and to stage disease
      severity, including a standard battery of tests to measure cognitive and motor function.
      Participants may opt-in for research procedures such as phlebotomy, skin biopsy, and

      lumbar puncture to obtain biospecimens for laboratory research, and magnetic resonance
      imaging or transcranial magnetic stimulation may be used to explore biomarkers of disease.

      Outcome measures

      Clinical information will be analyzed as part of our research to identify common features and
      differences among participants.
