      enclosure with a high concentration of Epsom salts to create a completely buoyant
      environment. This, along with a combination of temperature that is kept equal to skin
      temperature (94 degrees), allows the subject to eliminate the gravitational effects on the
      body, and along with lack of sound and low to no light (depending on comfort) allows the
      brain and body to completely relax for augmented physical and mental recovery. To control for
      potential changes in sleep quality, quantity, and/or stress and anxiety, a control condition
      utilizing a Metronap nap station to ascertain the effects of standard, horizontal napping
      with partial sensory deprivation (no light and silence) compared with floating.

      To assess whether or not flotation therapy positively influences sleep and perceptual
      recovery, participants will float for 60 minutes 2 times a week for 8 weeks, use the sleep
      pod for 60 minutes 2 times a week for 8 weeks, or take part in a cross-over study where the
      participant will alternate float and sleep pod every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. All participants
      may wear a fitness tracker and a sleep monitoring ring worn on the finger for the duration of
      the study. In addition, daily, per session, monthly, and pre/post-study questionnaires will
      be submitted via a smartphone application.
