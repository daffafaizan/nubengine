      of life. As such, there is an increased interest in the implementation of the
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program as an additional supportive treatment. MBSR is a
      structured group program that aims at reducing stress levels by enhancing awareness of the
      present moment in combination with a non-judgemental attitude.

      The study evaluates the effects of an 8-week MBSR program on quality of life, mood,
      depression, stress and coping skills in breast cancer patients.

      Breast cancer patients of the Breast Clinic of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel
      participate in the MBSR program. Before and after the training program patients filled out
      questionnaires evaluating quality of life, coping skills, emotional functioning, stress and
      aspects of mindfulness.
