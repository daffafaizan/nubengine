      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (20), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (20) and axial
      spondyloarthritis (SpA) (20) from the Rheumatology outpatient clinic at Aalborg University
      Hospital. The participants will be randomised in ratio 1:1 to:

        -  Group AT (App → Touch) (30 participants) the participant reports data through the DANBIO
           app on a smartphone first and after a "washout period" of one day via the touch screen
           solution at the rheumatology outpatient clinic.

        -  Group TA (Touch → App) (30 participants): the participant reports data through the touch
           screen solution at the rheumatology outpatient clinic and after a "washout period" of
           one day via the DANBIO app on a smartphone.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether electronic reporting of PROM through the DANBIO
      smartphone app is comparable to the traditional touch screen solution in the rheumatology
      outpatient clinic among patients with inflammatory arthritis in standard clinical care. The
      primary outcome is HAQ. Secondary outcomes are: VAS pain, VAS fatigue, VAS global Health,
      BASDAI, BASFI, PASS, Anchoring question, DAS28crp and ASDAS. DAS28crp are estimated using a
      fixed level for C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 6, swollen joint count of 0.5 and tender
      joint count of 1. ASDAS are estimated using a fixed level for CRP of 6. These data are based
      on DANBIO registrations of patients with RA, PsA or SpA from the rheumatology outpatient
      clinic at Aalborg University Hospital. DAS28crp and ASDAS are estimated from the PROM data to
      give the clinician an overview of PROM correlating to e.g. remission or high disease
      activity.
