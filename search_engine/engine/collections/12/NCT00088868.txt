      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of
           17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with an
           advanced malignant solid tumor or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects and toxicity profile of this drug in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effects of this drug on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) client proteins when
           assayed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) vs tumor tissue from patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate disturbances in key signaling pathways with administration of this drug in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the dose that alters key proteins in the majority of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Correlate serum proteomic patterns with target interactions or DMAG clinical effects in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-center, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) IV over 1-2
      hour on days 1 and 4 or days 2 and 5 weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-DMAG until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of up to 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
