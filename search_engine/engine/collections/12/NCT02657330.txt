    
      This first-in-human study of SBP-101 will be conducted in two phases: dose escalation and
      expansion. The dose escalation phase of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      PK profile of SBP-101 in subjects with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Up to 48 subjects may be enrolled in dose escalation. The
      expansion phase of the study will consist of 24 additional subjects who will receive the
      maximum tolerated dose of SBP-101 based on data from the dose escalation phase of the study.
