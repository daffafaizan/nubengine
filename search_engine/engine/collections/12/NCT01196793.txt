      Emergency departments (A&E) with feverish illness. Most of these patients could safely be
      managed in a primary care setting, particularly with guidelines in place on how to optimally
      assess these children. Some patients, however, will require admission, either because of a
      potentially serious underlying disease or because of other factors, for example parental
      concern or difficulties in communication because of language barriers. An increase in the
      number of children attending A&E departments with feverish illness as well as a rise in the
      volume of admissions has been noted over time. To enable an appropriate adaptation of acute
      medical services for children an in depth understanding of the assessment and admission
      processes is crucial.
