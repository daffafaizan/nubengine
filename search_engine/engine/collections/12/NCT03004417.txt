      sputum and blood biomarkers of inflammation in subjects with symptomatic COPD with moderate,
      severe airflow limitation and with chronic bronchitis. The efficacy of the treatment will
      also be measured using forced oscillometry technique and spirometry. Safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated.
