      I. To determine the feasibility of identifying changes in urine and gut microbiomes during
      androgen deprivation therapy and radiation therapy for prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore associations between baseline microbiomes and urinary or gastrointestinal
      radiation toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient
      Reported Outcomes (PRO).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of stool and urine samples within 2 weeks before hormone therapy
      or radiation therapy, after hormone therapy but before start of radiation therapy, and after
      completion of radiation therapy. Patients also complete a series of questionnaires prior to
      starting radiation therapy, mid-way through radiation therapy, and after completion of
      radiation therapy (within 1-3 weeks, at 3 months, and then every 6 months until 3 years from
      radiation completion). Patients' medical records are also reviewed.
