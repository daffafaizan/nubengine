      contractility by selectively and directly activating the enzymatic domain of cardiac myosin
      heavy chain, the force-generating motor protein of the cardiac sarcomere. This is a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study, consisting of a dose escalation
      phase to select 1 of 3 omecamtiv mecarbil oral formulations in 2 dose escalation cohorts,
      followed by an expansion phase to evaluate 20 weeks of administration of the selected
      omecamtiv mecarbil formulation at 2 target dose levels, compared with placebo.
