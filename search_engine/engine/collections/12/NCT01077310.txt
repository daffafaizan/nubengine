      intramuscular placebo among Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) infected prisoners meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for alcohol dependence or problem drinking, who are transitioning to the community
      and seeking treatment to prevent relapse to alcohol use. While the COMBINE trial has
      demonstrated the effectiveness of oral naltrexone in a group of active alcohol dependent
      persons in decreasing relapse to alcohol use over placebo, naltrexone has not been studied in
      people who have a history of current alcohol dependence prior to incarceration, are
      incarcerated and not actively using alcohol and are likely to return to alcohol use when
      released. In this study, we conduct a placebo-controlled trial to determine if naltrexone has
      an effect in this group, which could be important in making the case for having naltrexone
      available to alcohol dependent or problem drinking HIV+ prisoners prior to release. We will
      compare their HIV treatment (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count), alcohol treatment (time to relapse
      to heavy drinking, percent of days drinking, percent of days abstinent and alcohol craving)
      and HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes. The hypotheses include:

      i. XR-NTX will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes, including changes in HIV-1 RNA
      levels, and higher CD4 counts.

      ii. XR-NTX will result in improved alcohol treatment outcomes, including longer time to
      alcohol relapse, lower percent days drinking, and lower craving for alcohol.
