      constitutional symptoms, the reversibility of these adverse events generally occurring only
      during the infusion time; the absence of overlapping toxicities with chemotherapeutic agents;
      the safety and preliminary antitumor activity observed in previous trial with doxorubicin;
      and the objective response rate (RR) registered in a phase II trial in previously treated
      ovarian cancer patients seems justified to evaluate in a randomized phase II trial the
      efficacy of NGR-hTNF against a doxorubicin-based option in advanced ovarian cancer patients
      progressing or recurrent after a standard platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy.
