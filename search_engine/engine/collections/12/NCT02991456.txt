      75 mg/m2 of TMZ daily for a total of six weeks. Patients will be randomized to receive one of
      two antiemetic treatment sequences: sequence A that involves administration of ondansetron
      alone for 3 weeks followed by a single dose of rolapitant (day 22) plus daily ondansetron for
      3 weeks or sequence B that involves a single dose of rolapitant (day 1) plus daily
      ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks of daily ondansetron alone. The study has one
      primary endpoint: complete response (CR) rate. Participation in this study may result in
      reduced chemo-radiation induced nausea and vomiting, however, risks include the common side
      effects of rolapitant including decreased appetite, neutropenia, dizziness, dyspepsia,
      urinary tract infection, stomatitis, and anemia.
