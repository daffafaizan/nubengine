    
      Hydromorphone is an opioid analgesic that has been used for decades as an alternative to
      morphine in the treatment of moderate to severe malignant and nonmalignant pain. Only a small
      number of analgesics have been studied in children. The benefits to the subjects include
      contribution of knowledge that will provide for appropriate dosing regimen recommendations
      for future pediatric subjects.

      Treatment consisted of both parenteral and oral hydromorphone. For up to 48 hours immediately
      following surgery, subjects were administered hydromorphone by IV PCA pump. Dosing with the
      oral hydromorphone HCl began when the subject was ready to take clear oral liquid. Subjects
      were administered oral hydromorphone HCl every 6 hours for up to 9 doses. The investigator
      determined the timing of the first dose based on each subject's clinical condition.

      The duration of the treatment phase was up to 102 hours (up to 48 hours for the Parenteral
      Treatment Period and up to 54 hours for the Oral Treatment Period).

      Efficacy was based on the oral hydromorphone treatment. Adverse events were collected for
      both the oral and parenteral treatments.
