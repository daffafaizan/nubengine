      patients. To answer the questions about the importance of this hormone in this population, we
      designed a cohort study about the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (measured as
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D), classifying it in severe deficiency (<10 ng/ml), deficiency (< 20
      ng/ml), or insufficiency (< 30 ng/ml), the relationship with secondary hyperparathyroidism
      (PTH > 65 pg/ml), and related BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). These results will be
      adjusted by baseline factors, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) coinfection, risk practice for HIV infection, CD4+ count, antiretroviral therapy, and
      HIV RNA level.

      In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation according to clinical decision, it will be
      evaluated the changes in percentage of hypovitaminosis D and/or secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, and the effect on BMD. Bone biomarkers will be collected to determine
      the impact of changes secondary to vitamin D improvement in the bone evolution.
