        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oblimersen when administered with oxaliplatin,
           fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of oblimersen and oxaliplatin in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine relevant predictive biomarkers of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study of oblimersen followed by a
      non-randomized, phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-5 and 15-19; leucovorin
           calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 6, 7, 20, and 21; and
           oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 6 and 20.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Up to 35 additional patients are treated as in phase I, with oblimersen at the
           MTD.

      In both phases, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-53 patients (6-18 patients for phase I and 12-35 patients for
      phase II) will be accrued for this study.
