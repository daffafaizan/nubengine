      some researchers prefer minimally invasive methods, some researchers prefer surgical
      treatment. The most important concern in surgical treatment options is the prolongation of
      the disease recovery time and recurrence of the disease. Complications that may develop after
      treatment prolong the treatment period. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to
      compare the results of the widely used Limberg and Karydakis flap operations in recent years.
      The parameters that will be used in the comparison will be an infection, recurrence and wound
      decomposition.
