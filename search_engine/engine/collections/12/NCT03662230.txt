      wounded persons, it can appear in the first 7 days.

      It has been well described among American soldiers and it is known that it's serious,
      frequent and multifactorial.

      However, not a single study has described the frequency and the severity of the ARDS in
      French wounded soldiers.

      Thus the purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence and severity of the ARDS among
      the French wounded soldiers, admitted in continuing care and intensive care unit between 2001
      and 2017.

      The analysis of this data collection will let us improve the medical care of the ARDS in
      Outside Operation.
