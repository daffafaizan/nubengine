      myrosinase to ITC, which have chemopreventive properties. No information has been reported
      about the metabolic fate of ITC in the kailan-hybrid broccoli, which physicochemical
      characteristics could greatly influence that metabolic fate. Previous studies have shown that
      cooking process of vegetables may vary the human absorption of the correspondent nutritional
      and bioactive compounds.

      Research Methods & Procedures A cross-over-design study of 7 subjects after ingestion of
      200-g raw or microwaved kailan-hybrid broccoli was conducted. Total ITC equivalents in the
      vegetable, urine and blood samples were determined by HPLC as the cyclocondensation product
      of 1,2-benzenedithiol.
