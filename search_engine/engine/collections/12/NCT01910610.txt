      unresectable wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer. All the available treatments are
      being used in each strategy (oxaliplatine, irinotecan, fluoropyrimidines, bevacizumab,
      cetuximab or panitumumab) but in a different order:

      STRATEGY A: FOLFIRI-cetuximab, followed by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab
      vs.

      STRATEGY B: OPTIMOX-bevacizumab, followed by irinotecan-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab,
      followed by anti-EGFR mab with or without irinotecan.
