      administered glinides (10mg of mitiglinide or 90 mg of nateglinide) at lunchtime without
      changing their insulin regimen. Twelve weeks after administration of the glinides, they are
      discontinued. HbA1c levels at the start of glinide administration, 12 weeks after
      administration, and 12 weeks after discontinuation are measured.
