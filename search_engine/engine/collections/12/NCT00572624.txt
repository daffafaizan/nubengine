      determine whether weight loss could improve obesity-related myocardial metabolism and
      efficiency. Two different mechanisms of weight loss were studied: diet and exercise and
      gastric bypass surgery. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to quantitate myocardial
      oxygen consumption (MVO2) and myocardial fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Echocardiography with
      tissue Doppler imaging was used to quantify cardiac structure, systolic and diastolic
      function (left ventricular (LV) relaxation (E') and septal ratio (E/E')).
