      palliation of inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction. As the survival time for those
      patients has improved due mainly in part to development of chemotherapeutic intervention, it
      is becoming important to prevent recurrent cholangitis and liver failure by prolonging the
      SEMS patency, leading to continuation of chemotherapy and better prognosis. Therefore,
      one-time stent insertion before disease-progression-related death is an ultimate goal of
      developing an ideal biliary stent.

      SEMSs have been found to be superior to plastic stents in terms of the stent patency, because
      it prevent accumulation of biliary sludge owing to larger diameter. The ideal designs of
      biliary SEMSs for prolongation of the stent patency include 1) bare metal mesh for tissue
      embedding to prevent stent migration, 2) covering material to counteract neoplastic tumor
      ingrowth, and 3) anti-reflux structure to reduce enteric biliary reflux. However, none of
      bare, covered, and anti-reflux metal stent alone constantly demonstrated superiority over the
      others in the stent patency.

      To compensate for the limitations of each stent, a double stent system in which both covered
      and bare SEMSs are integrated into one stent system was introduced in the field of the
      interventional radiology, but further data accumulation is needed to assess the comparability
      with various conventional SEMS types in terms of stent patency, reintervention efficacy, and
      clinical outcomes following reintervention, because in this system two metal stents are
      implanted at once exclusively via percutaneous route and clogged inner covered stent cannot
      be removed at the time of the reintervention. Recently a new covered and uncovered SEMS in
      which the clogged inner stent can be endoscopically removed leaving the outer stent in place,
      was introduced. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this
      stent in patients with inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction.
