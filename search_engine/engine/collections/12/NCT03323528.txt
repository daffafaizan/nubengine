    
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients with
      non-streptococcal sore throat and signs of moderate-to-severe associated pain (pain intensity
      on the 11-point Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale NRS ≥7 and ≥50 mm on the subjective 0-100 mm
      visual analogue) are assigned to Dorithricin® or matching placebo lozenge treatment. Efficacy
      was assessed at the investigating center for 2 hrs after first dosing, and 3 days later
      (visit 2). The primary efficacy end-point is the percentage of total responders assessed at
      visit 2, i.e. complete resolution of throat pain and difficulty in swallowing at approx. 72
      hrs after first application of treatment, Safety and local tolerability are also assessed.
