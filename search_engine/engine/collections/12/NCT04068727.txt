      at an elevated risk for adverse drug events (ADEs) or potential ADEs from medication errors.
      An intervention that integrates clinical pharmacists, a pharmacy technician, and follows a
      checklist published by experts at the Anticoagulation Forum can prevent adverse outcomes. The
      Investigators propose research on the effectiveness, implementation, and dissemination for a
      care transition intervention that follows the checklist which includes evaluation for
      appropriateness of DOAC use, assistance with drug procurement, telephone access to an
      anticoagulation expert, and other best practice recommendations.
