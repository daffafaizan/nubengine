      insufficiency for a 13 week trial. All subjects will be 60 years of age or older.
      Participants will be randomized to one of four groups: vitamin D (50,000IU/wk) + aerobic
      training (7 days during the 13th week); vitamin D (50,000IU/wk) + normal daily activity
      during the 13th week; placebo + aerobic training (7 days during the 13th week); or placebo +
      normal daily activity during the 13th week.

      Following screening and informed consent process a physical activity questionnaire will be
      administered. A blood draw will then be conducted at baseline, midpoint and endpoint.
      Collected blood for the purposes of this study will assess vitamin D status (25(OH)D),
      parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, insulin, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. At
      baseline and endpoint muscle lipid will be assessed using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and
      muscle oxygen consumption will be determined using a novel hybrid diffuse optical instrument
      consisting of a near-infrared spectroscopy and a diffuse correlation spectroscopy. In
      addition, at each study time point 3 dietary recalls will be completed and physical activity
      will be measured using an accelerometer.
