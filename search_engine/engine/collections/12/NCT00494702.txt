    
      This is a prospective randomized trial enrolling premature infants of less than 28 weeks
      gestation. Patients are randomly assigned to become resuscitation with an initial oxygen
      inspiratory fraction (FiO2) of 30% or 90%. Main objective is to reach a target saturation of
      85% at 15 min of life.

      Immediately after birth pre-and-postductal pulse oximeters are set and oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) continuously monitored and registered as long as the patient requires oxygen
      supplementation. FiO2 is stepwise adjusted (increased or decreased 10%) every 90 sec
      according to heart rate, SpO2 and responsiveness.

      Blood samples are drawn from umbilical cord and at day 1, 2 and 7 from peripheral vein to
      determine oxidative stress markers (GSH, GSSG), angiogenic factors (VEGF, VEGF receptors,
      Angiopoietin), pro-inflammatory markers (IL8, TNF alfa) and pro-apoptotic markers (Fas
      Ligand; Cytochrome C).

      Urine is collected every day during the first week of life to determine oxidative stress
      markers (8-oxo-dG; O-tyrosine; F2 isoprostanes; Isofurans).

      Babies are followed in the NICU and clinical condition recorded. Serial examinations for ROP
      and Auditory evoked potentials will be performed. Neurodevelopmental outcome is evaluated at
      2 years of postnatal life. Main outcome: Achievement of a target saturation of 85% at 15 min
      of life. Secondary outcomes: acute complications during delivery; chronic complications (BPD,
      ROP, IPVH); mortality in the neonatal period.
