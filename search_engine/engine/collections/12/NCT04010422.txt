      individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including eye gaze abnormality, higher
      frequency of refractive errors (e.g., astigmatism, hypermetropia, and anisometropia),
      strabismus, abnormal blinking rate, disturbed eye movements that may be associated with or
      aggravated social communication deficits of ASD. However, little is known about the ocular
      surface conditions. This study will investigate the visual function in individuals with ASD,
      with a particular focus on the ocular surface condition. We plan to recruit 50 adults with
      ASD and 50 age-/sex-matched typically developing controls in this project, and perform visual
      function assessment.
