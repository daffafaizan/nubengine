      have a quiescent molecular immunologic profile with kSORT and uCRM. Patients who screen
      negative on all 2 tests will undergo stepwise withdrawal first of steroids then of MMF or
      mTor inhibitors. Prior to each withdrawal the 2 screening molecular tests will be performed
      and advancement to the next withdrawal phase will be performed if both are negative. Patients
      who are maintained on belatacept monotherapy with quiescent kSORT and uCRM and elevated kSPOT
      will be transitioned to q 8 weeks belatacept administration.

      Forty patients who are previously enrolled in belatacept based regimens with a minimum of 7
      years of follow up at 4 transplant centers and who are maintained on belatacept, an
      antiproliferative Â± steroids will be approached for enrollment.

      Drug withdrawal of steroids (in patients on steroids) and of antiproliferatives (MPAs or mTor
      inhibitors) will follow the design shown in the Study Schema. Patients who continue to be
      stable for 3 months on belatacept monotherapy will be converted from q 4 weeks to q 8 weeks
      belatacept administrations.
