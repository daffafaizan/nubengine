      fundamental for a good performance in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). In a realistic
      simulation scenario, the results tend to improve with the use of feedback manikins that
      evaluate the quality parameters in CPR and show in real time what the rescuer needs to
      improve in order to be successful in training and increase the probability of success in
      future real care. Objective: To verify the efficacy of the manikins with feedback in the
      training of physicians and nurses in the courses of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)
      authorized by the American Heart Association (AHA). Methods: Comparison of CPR performance of
      ACLS students. The intervention group will be submitted to the real-time feedback of the
      manikins, the control group will receive feedback from the instructor. Statistical analysis
      will consist of inter-group comparisons and will cover mean, standard deviation, and
      parametric tests such as Student's T test. The results will be related to the characteristics
      of the sample, including anthropometric profile, profession, training time, practice area,
      previous training with a focus on CPR and physical exercise practice.
