      in participants with onychomycosis. The present study consists of 2 periods: Screening period
      (up to Week minus 2) and Treatment period (up to Week 49). The ICZ will be administered in 3
      cycles (Week 1, Week 5 and Week 9) and each cycle will consist of taking 2 capsules of 100
      milligram (mg) each, orally, twice daily, continuously for 1 week. Total duration of
      treatment will be of 49 weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by percentage of
      participants showing 10 percent or higher response in SCIO Score. Participants' safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
