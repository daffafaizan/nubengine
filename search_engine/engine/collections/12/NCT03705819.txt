      Pain is the way our body tells us that we must take care of ourselves. Chronic pain is
      different. Chronic pain is pain that lasts for a long time. Chronic pain can last for weeks,
      months, and even years. In some cases chronic pain remains without any sign of body damage.
      Today, there is no way for a doctor to measure someone's chronic pain or accurately determine
      many details about chronic pain. The investigators at Columbia University are interested in
      new imaging test that could help doctors look at chronic pain and help patients with chronic
      pain. The new imaging test uses a new drug called [11C]-NOP46. [11C]-NOP46 is a radioactive
      drug and is experimental. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
      investigators believe that, when given to patients, this new drug can go to the exact places
      of chronic pain within the body. Once the drug goes to the places of chronic pain, a special
      camera, called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) camera, can be used to take pictures of
      the drug. In this study, the investigators will give [11C]-NOP46 to up to 35 subjects.
