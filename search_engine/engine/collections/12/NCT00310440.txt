      symptomatic degenerative cervical disk disease in patients who fail conservative treatment.
      i-FACTOR bone graft is a unique anorganic bone mineral (ABM) and small peptide, P-15â„¢. P-15
      is a synthetic fifteen amino acid polypeptide that mimics the cell-binding domain of Type I
      human collagen and is responsible for osteogenic cell attachment via alpha2-beta1 integrins.

      This is randomized, controlled, multi-center, prospective FDA IDE study conducted to assess
      the safety and effectiveness of i-FACTOR bone graft (Cerapedics, Inc. Westminster, CO) in
      patients treated with single level ACDF. Patients received i-FACTOR bone graft or local
      autologous bone inside a structural allograft.
