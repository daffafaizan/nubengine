      I. To assess the feasibility of administering a cognitive assessment battery in a medical
      oncology clinic.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the variability of the various cognitive tests and to assess changes in
      cognitive performance based on the results of cognitive assessments obtained prior to
      chemotherapy and at 6 to 8 weeks and 12 to 16 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy.

      II. To explore the association of cognitive performance with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance status as evaluated by the patient's oncology team.

      III. To assess the association between cognitive performance and the occurrence of a serious
      adverse event during chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete cognitive assessments, comprising Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised
      (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test Parts A & B (TMT-A, TMT-B), Digit Symbol Coding Test (DSC),
      Category Fluency Test (Animals), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Digit Span Test
      (DST). Patients also complete the Beck Depression Inventory. Assessments are administered on
      day 1 of chemotherapy and at 6-8 weeks and 12-16 weeks after day 1 of chemotherapy.
