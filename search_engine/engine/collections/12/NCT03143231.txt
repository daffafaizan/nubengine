      comparing between 2 groups of patients with bronchiolitis, first group will receive 3%
      hypertonic saline and second group will receive 0.9% saline.

      Data collection includes:

      Name, Age, Mode of delivery, Birth weight, Current weight, Number of sibling, Immunization
      record, Duration of breast feeding, past medical history including number of wheezy chest,
      pneumonia, Parents level of education, Presence of Asthma / Allergic rhinitis in family, Pets
      /Smoke at home)

      Using the validated Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) investigators will
      assign patients a score before and at the end of treatment.

      To prepare 3% sodium chloride, the investigators will dilute 60 ml 20% sodium chloride
      injection with 500 ml normal saline (NSS) 0.9%.

      Length of stay will be measured in both groups, to establish the efficacy of hypertonic
      saline in reducing length of stay.
