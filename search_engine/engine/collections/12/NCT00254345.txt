      are commonly used for fabricating provisional restorations (PRs) during prosthetic treatment
      1. Biofilm accumulated on these PRs may cause caries and inflammation of the surrounding
      tissue, tempering the outcome of the final restoration 2. Plaque adherence to temporary
      restorations was significantly increased compared with the untreated reference teeth 3.
      Biologic and physical properties of the various materials used as PRs were studied
      extensively 4-8 whereas their interaction with bacterial biofilm in vivo and ex vivo is less
      characterized.

      One improvement in provisional restorative materials is the use of liquid polish. It is
      claimed that these materials gives a high luster finish to provisional bis-acryl restorations
      and processed acrylic appliances, reduces or eliminates costly and time consuming polishing
      steps and can be used on all types of direct and indirect restorations and appliances.

      The effect of liquid polish coating or resin bonding coating on biofilm formation on PRs was
      not reported. In this study we intend to measure, in vivo early biofilm formation on PMMA PRs
      with and without resin coatings.
