      surgery. Comparing to the articulation of articular cartilage, the artificial joint undergo a
      boundary lubrication in which a thin layer of synovial fluid molecules is formed between the
      artificial joint materials. Therefore a larger wear rate is observed in the artificial joint
      system. Researchers have devoted themselves to modifying the artificial joint materials in
      order to reduce the wear phenomena. We first propose that modification the lubrication by
      adding effective lubricating molecules may help to reduce the wear of artificial joint.
      However, there still lacks fundamentally understanding of the artificial joint lubrication
      mechanism under synovial fluid. Hence, we plan to investigate the boundary lubrication
      mechanism of synovial molecules, such as albumin, globulin, hyaluronic acid, and lipid in the
      first year. We would like to obtain the adsorption behaviors of the single molecules as well
      as multiple molecules on the surfaces of artificial joint materials by experiments. Molecular
      dynamics simulation will also be performed to gain the knowledge of adsorption energy and
      possible conformation change of the molecules. In the second year, the tribological heat and
      mechanical effects on the synovial molecules will be studied. The analysis platform will be
      established to perform the composition and properties measurement of the synovial molecules.
      In the third year, we will further discuss the effect of the synovial molecules
      transformation on the surrounding cells and tissues. Their influences on the tribological and
      biochemical behaviors will be investigated.
