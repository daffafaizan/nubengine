      combination therapy of camrelizumabï¼Œapatinib and hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients
      with renal cell carcinoma(RCC). All enrolled patients will receive the following treatments:
      camrelizumab 200mg every 2 weeks for 1 years combined with apatinib 250mg everyday until
      disease progression (as determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision
      to stop treatment. One week following completion of the second immunotherapy,
      hypofractionated radiotherapy with marginal dose of 50Gy/2Gy/25f and tumor center dose of
      local hyperfraction increase 24-32Gy/8-12Gy/3-4f will be performed 3-5 times. The routine
      radiotherapy will be started at the same time as the third immunotherapy and 25 times routine
      radiotherapy will be completed before the fifth or sixth immunotherapy.

      During treatment participants will be assessed for curative effects and the occurrence of
      adverse events. Following treatment, participants will be assessed at a clinic visit every 3
      months to collect survival information and follow-up treatment information. The planned
      sample size is 30 study participants.
