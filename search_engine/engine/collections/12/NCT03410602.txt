    
      A total of 30 patients who were about to undergo fixed orthodontic therapy were selected and
      divided into two groups.

      Group A comprised of 15 patients who were treated with routine full-mouth supragingival
      scaling and subgingival scaling only around all banded first molars.

      Group B comprised of 15 patients who were treated with full-mouth supragingival scaling and
      subgingival scaling only around all banded first molars followed by irrigation with 0.2%
      chlorhexidine gluconate solution (Trade name: HEXIDINE), an antiseptic - antiplaque agent.
      Treatment for both the groups was performed at 3rd month, 6th month and 9th month.

      Parameters such as radiographic evidence of alveolar crestal bone level, gingival index,
      probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level around the banded first molars and
      full-mouth plaque index were recorded as a change from baseline to 12th month. The
      differences between the values were assessed and sent for statistical analysis.
