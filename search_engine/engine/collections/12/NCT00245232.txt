      which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. PTSD is marked by clear biological
      changes as well as psychological symptoms. Many people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma
      in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts. This study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy versus its individual
      components in treating women with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression brought on by
      sexual assault.

      Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive one of three
      treatments: cognitive processing therapy (CPT); cognitive therapy (CT); or written exposure
      (WE). Participants assigned to receive either CPT or CT will attend therapy sessions twice
      weekly for 6 weeks. CPT will focus on helping each individual to process accurate memories of
      the traumatic event and to work through any memories that cannot be completely ignored, nor
      completely integrated back into their thinking. Also included in CPT will be a WE component,
      in which participants will be encouraged to recall the traumatic event and experience any
      emotions connected to it. CT will be similar to CPT, but will not include the WE component.
      Participants assigned to receive only WE will attend one 2-hour session each week. Symptoms
      of PTSD and depression will be measured at baseline, post-treatment, and at a 6-month
      follow-up visit.
