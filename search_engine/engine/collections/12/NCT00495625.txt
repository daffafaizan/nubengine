    
      An open label multi-site phase II clinical trial of sunitinib malate given orally once daily
      on days 1-28 of each 42-day cycle. Sunitinib malate will be dispensed as capsules at the
      beginning of each treatment cycle. The dose may be escalated at the investigator's
      discretion. Treatment will be continued until there is either disease progression or
      cumulative or acute toxicity which in the opinion of the treating physician compromises the
      ability of the patient to receive treatment or patient desire to stop treatment.

      A follow up visit will be required before the beginning of every cycle every 6 weeks to
      assess toxicity and for physical examination. Complete blood count (CBC) and differential,
      comprehensive metabolic panel (including liver function tests) and alpha-feto protein (when
      indicated) will be obtained at every scheduled follow up visit.
