      ischial containment socket in above-knee amputees, or transtibial socket in below-knee
      amputees. It is the goal for the pro-active dynamic socket to alleviate high pressure on the
      residual limb and improve socket fit and comfort. The pro-active dynamic socket contains
      bladders that can inflate and deflate throughout the gait cycle to appropriate levels of
      pressure to improve socket fit. These improvements will be confirmed by pressure measurements
      on the distal end of the residual limb, the ischium, and the bladders located around the
      socket walls.
