      even faster in ICU patients due to inflammation, pharmacological agents (corticosteroids,
      muscle relaxants, neuromuscular blockers, antibiotics), and the presence of neuromuscular
      syndromes, associated with critical illness. A recent recommendation document advices to
      start early with active and passive exercise in critically ill patients. However, no evidence
      is available concerning the feasibility of an early muscle training intervention in the acute
      ICU phase when patients are still under sedation. A rather new method to train bed-bound
      patients is the use of a bedside cycle ergometer. This randomized controlled trial was
      designed to investigate whether a daily training session using a bedside cycle ergometer,
      started early in stable critically ill patients with an expected prolonged ICU stay, could
      induce a beneficial effect on exercise performance, quadriceps force and functional autonomy
      at ICU and hospital discharge compared to a standard physiotherapy program.
