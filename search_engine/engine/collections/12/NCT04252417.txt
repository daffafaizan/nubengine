    
      The study is a multicentric, open label, phase I, two arms study to compare pharmacokinetics
      of MD1003 after a single oral dose of MD1003 100 mg in eight (8) healthy male/female subjects
      and eight (8) male/female patients of moderate Child Pugh category. Healthy subjects and
      patients will receive a single oral dose of MD1003 100 mg. The healthy subjects will match
      with impaired hepatic function patients on ethnic group, sex, age (+/- 10 years) and BMI (+/-
      20%).

      Participants will be admitted into the Clinical Research Units (CRU) on Day-3. On the morning
      of Day 1, subjects will receive a single 100 mg oral dose of MD1003 following an overnight
      fast (i.e., at least 10 hours). Participants will be confined to the CRU until discharge on
      Day 8, with PK blood sample draws for measurement of MD1003 and its main metabolites being
      taken throughout the confinement (Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36,
      48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168h post dose). A Follow up post study visit will occur on Day 14 (Â± 2
      days).

      Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination (PE) findings will be monitored at
      Screening and at specified times during the study. All AEs will be recorded throughout the
      study (i.e., from signing of the Informed Consent Form until Study Completion).

      The Study Completion is defined as the last subject's end-of-study assessment.
