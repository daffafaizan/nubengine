      Prior to thyroidectomy, patients will be randomized to two groups: 1) use of conventional
      surgical procedures to achieve hemostasis,i.e., ligatures and bipolar electrocauterization
      alone, and 2) use of oxidized cellulose patch (Surgicel©) in addition to classical methods
      (ligature; bipolar electrocautery). All anticoagulants will be discontinued 10 days prior to
      the operation, if this will not be possible the patient will be excluded. The investigators
      will perform the specified procedure in accordance with accepted clinical practice standards.
      At the end of the thyroidectomy, a meticulous hemostasis will be achieved. Before wound
      closure, the sealed affiliation envelopes will be opened and 1-2×2 cm oxidized cellulose
      patch will be placed over the thyroid bed depending on patient randomization. Next, a suction
      drain will be placed. The drains will be removed when the secretion volume/day will be less
      than 20 cc.

      All operations will be performed under general anesthesia by three head and neck surgeons who
      had experience in thyroid surgery. Outcome measures will include duration of operation,
      hemodynamic variables on emergence (blood pressure and heart rate), volume of secretion in
      the drain, time to removal of wound drain, length of postoperative hospital stay, and
      incidence of postoperative complications, i.e. hemorrhage, transient hypoparathyroidism,
      wound infection, seroma, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Evaluation of the postoperative
      course and recording of data will be done by one surgeons blinded to the intervention (MA).
      Follow-up for this study will be ended one month after the surgery.
