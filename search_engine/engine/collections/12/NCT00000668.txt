      10 to 15 percent of people with AIDS. A previous study has shown that treatment with
      ganciclovir resulted in a significant delay in time to first retinitis progression compared
      to untreated controls. More studies are warranted to evaluate effects at different doses.

      In group A, 36 HIV seropositive patients with CMV viruria receive a single dose of
      intravenous ganciclovir followed by one of three oral dose regimens for 28 days. Twelve
      individuals are treated at each dose level. In group B, 12 patients with AIDS and CMV
      retinitis receive oral ganciclovir therapy. These 12 patients must have received an induction
      course of intravenous ganciclovir for 4 weeks prior to study entry and must have stable CMV
      retinitis. Measurements for both groups include pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerance
      (history, physical examination, hematology, and serum chemistry), and CMV blood and urine
      cultures. In addition, there are weekly ophthalmologic evaluations for individuals in the
      group B study.
