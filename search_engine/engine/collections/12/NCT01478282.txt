      anticoagulants in patients that require a rapid restoration of their impaired hemostatic
      mechanisms. The present study seeks to improve the security and efficacy of the clinical
      practice with the new generation of oral anticoagulants.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the action of new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran y rivaroxaban) on hemostasis
           with specific interest on possible interference with platelet interactions and
           coagulation mechanisms under flow conditions;

        2. To evaluate comparatively the effects of coagulation factor concentrates of established
           efficacy (prothrombin complexes and rFVIIa) to reverse the alterations of hemostasis
           parameters induced by the new anticoagulants.

      METHODOLOGY:

      Studies will be performed ex vivo using blood samples from healthy individuals subjected to
      treatments with the new anticoagulants at doses of proven efficacy and safety (150mg/12 h for
      dabigatran and 20 mg/day for rivaroxaban). Blood samples from the participants will be spiked
      "in vitro" with know concentrations of the coagulation factors. Modifications in:

        -  morphometric parameters (platelet deposition and fibrin formation) in perfusion studies
           under flow conditions; and

        -  analytical tests evaluating changes in coagulation mechanisms (thrombin generation,
           ecarine and prothrombin times) will be determined.
