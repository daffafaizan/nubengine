    
      The goal of this study is to pilot data for a systematic molecular characterization of
      pathophysiologic perturbations incurred by snake envenomation and compare this to other
      inflammatory physiologic states such as trauma and sepsis. The investigators will
      characterize transcriptomic and immune biomarker response to varying clinical severities of
      snakebite envenomation and compare to that of sepsis and traumatic injury.

      This sub-study will analyze samples of participants enrolled under a previously IRB-approved
      protocol, "Surgical Critical Care Initiative Tissue and Data Acquisition Protocol (SC2i
      TDAP)". All participants eligible for protocol SC2i TDAP (NCT 02182180) are eligible to be
      included in the current proposal, and conversely, the investigators will not enroll any
      participants in the current protocol who is not enrolled in SC2i TDAP. Participants enrolled
      under that protocol who have suffered snakebite envenomation will undergo additional
      procedure of follow up phone call 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after discharge from the emergency
      department or hospital to fill out the PSFS via phone. All labs and other procedures will
      otherwise be as described in SC2i TDAP.
