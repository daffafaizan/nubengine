    
      CK0801 (Cord blood-derived T-regulatory cells) consists of ex vivo expanded T-regulatory
      cells with a flow cytometry phenotype of â‰¥ 60% CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells and < 10%
      CD4-CD8+ T-cytotoxic/suppressor cells. The cellular starting material of CK0801 is a single
      unit of umbilical cord blood (CBU) from a normal, healthy unrelated donor. Because Treg cells
      are present only at low frequency in circulating blood or umbilical cord blood, production of
      clinically relevant Treg cell doses requires ex vivo enrichment and expansion of Treg cells
      with a CD4+CD25+ phenotype. In their natural state, T-regulatory (Treg) cells play an
      important role in maintaining immune homeostasis and limiting autoimmune responses by
      modulating both innate and adaptive immunity. Based on literature reports of animal studies
      showing induction of immune tolerance by Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, graft-versus-host
      disease, and solid organ transplant rejection, the administration of Treg cells in human
      clinical trials has become an attractive strategy to induce immune tolerance in patients in a
      variety of clinical settings.
