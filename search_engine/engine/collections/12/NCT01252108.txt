    
      A total of 30 Urea Breath Test (UBT)-Positive volunteers will be enrolled. Each subject will
      receive SQ109 150 mg bid with PPI or 300 mg qd by mouth daily for 14 consecutive days.

      Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Subject must be 18 to 45 years of age (inclusive).

        2. Subject must have 2 positive Urea Breath Tests (UBT) obtaining during screening, and no
           other clinically significant disease (i.e., hematology, clinical chemistry and
           urinalysis tests must be within study-defined ranges. Clinical tests must be performed
           within 14 days of receiving first dose of study drug.

        3. Body Mass Index (BMI) must be between 18 and 33 kg/m2 inclusive.

        4. Subject must be able to give voluntary written informed consent before any study related
           procedure is performed.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of SQ109 administered daily for 14 consecutive
           days in male and female Urea Breath Test (UBT)-positive subjects.

        2. To assess antimicrobial activity against H. pylori of SQ109 administered daily for 14
           days in UBT-positive subjects.

      Design: Each subject will undergo screening evaluations within 14 days of study entry (Day 1)
      and baseline evaluations Day -14 and Day -2 to Day 1 (up to 14 days prior to the first dose).
      On Day 1 (first day of dosing), the subject will be administered study drug and undergo the
      Day 1 procedures. Throughout the 14 days of treatment phase of the study each subject will be
      assessed daily for adverse events (AEs). Laboratory safety evaluations will be performed on
      Day 7, 8, 9, or 10, and on Day 14, and Day 21. On Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 each
      subject will have a UBT. On Follow-up Days 21 and 28 each subject will return to the study
      unit to have safety assessments.

      Outcome Measures:

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by a review of physical examinations, neurological
      examinations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead ECGs, routine clinical laboratory tests
      (including chemistry and hematology data), and AE assessments.

      Efficacy Outcome Measures consist of serial UBT assessments for evidence of H. pylori in the
      gastrointestinal tract collected at baseline, during the 14 days of SQ109 administration, and
      during the 14 day follow-up period.
