      displays any clinical symptoms . The most common symptom is local pain, usually non
      responding for non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Radiation therapy usually does not result
      calcification or the tumor regression, but significantly reduces the pain intensity or
      eliminates it. Currently, the most common RT schedule is conventional radiotherapy using
      fraction dose (fd) of 2 Gy delivered to the total dose (TD) varying from36 Gy to 40 Gy. The
      results in pain reduction achieved after larger total doses are better that led us to use
      radioablative techniques. This procedure is associated with a probability of better analgesic
      effect and the good local effect (calcification and / or regression of laesion) with high
      safety of radiation delivery using tracking based cybernetic microradiosurgery (CyberKnife).

      The comparison of two modalities of radiation therapy (conventional [fd 2 Gy, TD 36 Gy] and
      hypofractionated [fd 5 Gy, TD 25 Gy]) used for treatment of painful vertebral hemangioma
      patients will be performed in the phase III randomized study.

      80 patients will be enrolled in this study. All patients will be planned (RT) on the base of
      CT/MRI fusion.

      Patients will be controlled 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after treatment completion and, next every
      each 6 months. Pain relief, analgesics uptake, local effect (MRI and Technetium -
      99m-labelled RBC(red blood cell) scintigraphy) and eventual toxicity will be checked during
      follow-up (FU).
