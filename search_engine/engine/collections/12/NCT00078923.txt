        -  Compare blood/prostate biomarkers of oxidative stress and prostate cancer risk in
           patients with stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with 3 different dose
           levels of soy isoflavones before radical prostatectomy.

        -  Compare prostatic tissue biomarkers of proliferation and apoptosis in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Determine the potential response, in terms of tumor and prostatic intraepithelial
           neoplasia grade and volume, extraprostatic extension, and serum prostate-specific
           antigen level, in patients treated with soy isoflavones and in those treated with
           placebo.

        -  Determine the safety of soy isoflavone supplementation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
      Patients are stratified according to tumor stage (T1c vs T2). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control group): Patients receive oral placebo once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral soy isoflavones and oral placebo once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive a higher dose of oral soy isoflavones and oral placebo once
           daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive a higher dose (higher than arm III) of oral soy isoflavones
           once daily.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 2-6 weeks (depending on the time from study entry to
      planned surgery) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. All patients then undergo radical
      prostatectomy.

      Patients are followed at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (25 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 12.5 months.
