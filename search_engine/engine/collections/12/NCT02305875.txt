      additionally examination with a special focus on the anatomy and course of the mcn nerve. A
      line was drawn from the most cranial part of the humeral head perpendicular towards the
      brachial plexus. The distance from this line to the point where the mcn nerve entered the
      coracobrachial muscle was measured. This entering point was defined as the point where the
      mcn nerve left the axillary sheat. The visulaity of the mcn was scored as 0 = not visible, 1
      = partly visible and 2 = clear visible.

      The evaluation was a consensus assessment where all authors evaluated the T2-weighted, fat
      suppressed MRI images at the same time. If the mcn nerve could not be identified, the
      patients were excluded.
