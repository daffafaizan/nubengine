      appropriate candidates for irrigation of their jaw joints secondary to pain or limited
      opening. At the completion of the joint irrigation subjects will be injected by one of three
      different products to determine if the additional injection results in a further decrease in
      jaw joint pain and improved opening. Subjects will be followed for 3 months. Those who do not
      show improvement may be candidates for additional treatment.
