      Mexico, household contacts of pulmonary TB patients who recently converted their tuberculin
      test and TST+ve contacts from randomly selected control households with no history of TB
      within the last 2 years (remote contacts) will be enrolled. We assume that these individuals
      are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Additional confidence that all subjects
      enrolled are latently infected will come from ELISPOT analysis of the response to ESAT-6 and
      CFP-10. We propose to administer INH to 100 TST+ve recent and 100 TST+ve remote contacts for
      6 months. To control for spontaneous fluctuations of biomarker levels, we propose to defer
      therapy by 3 months to half the subjects in each group. Thus, four groups will be defined:

      A. Recently converted contacts receiving isoniazid (5mg per kg up to 300 mg daily for 6
      months) immediately after recruitment.

      B. Recently converted contacts receiving isoniazid (5mg per kg up to 300 mg daily for 6
      months) three months after recruitment.

      C. Remote contacts receiving isoniazid (5mg per kg up to 300 mg daily for 6 months)
      immediately after recruitment.

      D. Remote contacts receiving isoniazid (5mg per kg up to 300 mg daily for 6 months) three
      months after recruitment.

      All contacts will undergo clinical evaluation at enrolment and review. The development of
      active TB will trigger withdrawal and full treatment. Fortnightly clinical review of group B
      during the deferred phase will be undertaken. ELISPOT analysis will be performed on all
      subjects at 0, 1, 4, 13, 26 and 40 weeks in groups A and C, and at 0, 13, 14, 17, 26, 40 and
      54 weeks in groups B and D. A subset of 10 patients per group will be sampled for expression
      analysis at 0, 4, 26 and 40 weeks (groups A and C) and at 0, 13, 17 and 40 weeks in groups B
      and D (160 hybridizations in total).
