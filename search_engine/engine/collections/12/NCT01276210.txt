      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib, when
      administered in combination with SRS to patients with 1-4 metastatic brain tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the six-month intra-cranial progression-free survival (PFS) of sorafenib when
      administered in combination with SRS to patients with 1-4 metastatic brain tumors. PFS is
      defined as the time to intra-cranial tumor progression or death.

      II. To assess the six-month overall survival (OS) of sorafenib when administered in
      combination with SRS to patients with 1-4 metastatic brain tumors.

      III. To compare results to patients who are treated with SRS alone (concurrent controls).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate.

      Patients receive oral (PO) sorafenib tosylate once daily and undergo SRS 5-7 days later.
      Treatment with sorafenib continues for 2 weeks after SRS in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8, 26, and 52 weeks.
