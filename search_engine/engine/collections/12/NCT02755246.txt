      pathological conditions like subjective, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), all of which are a growing public-health concern with devastating effects.
      Polyamines supplementation and corresponding up-regulation of autophagy (i.e., cellular
      protein degradation pathways) may be a key target of intervention against age-related memory
      decline. The study will investigate whether a polyamine-enriched dietary supplementation
      (through capsule intake) could provide positive effects on the cognitive function of elderly
      individuals (60-80 years old) with subjective cognitive decline.
