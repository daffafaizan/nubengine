      formal care but access anti-malarials at the informal community level. ACTs were previously
      unaffordable to this group but this should change with the introduction of the AMFm. To avoid
      missing alternative causes of illness, reduce costs and delay the spread of resistance to
      ACTs, they need to be targeted at those who really need them. Studies in formal healthcare
      settings in Ghana have shown that where microscopy is not available, the impact of Rapid
      Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) can be substantial. RDTs are relatively simple to use, requiring
      fairly minimal training to master the mechanics of test preparation and interpretation
      Whether to deploy RDTs as part of AMFm is unclear at this time.Even in the absence of AMFm
      the question about how best to target antimalarials in the community is an important one, and
      will get more so as malaria incidence in many countries decreases, making presumptive
      treatment of all febrile illness as malaria increasingly ineffective. Locally chemical
      sellers are the closest equivalent as they provide the majority of treatments, especially for
      the poorest.

      It is difficult to predict whether RDTs would make chemical sellers more commonly accessed
      (because patients prefer a diagnosis) , or less accessed (patients do not like having choice
      restricted/do not want a blood test etc). Studies in other settings suggest interventions to
      improve diagnosis by shop-keepers can be effective and cost-effective .
