      several factors. Currently, there are several types of treatments for cervicalgia, applied
      according to the therapist's choice and patient's conditions and preferences, however, there
      are no reports of an effective self-performing treatment aiming to stabilizing the cervical,
      giving musculoskeletal balance, and focus on reducing pain.

      It is important the promotion of a self-performing treatment, resulting in a high cost
      benefit because patient does not have to move to perform the treatment outside his or her
      home, does not need financial resources and demands little time to perform it. In addition to
      decreasing the frequency and intensity of hospitalizations and government costs incurred in
      this musculoskeletal disorder. Therefore, the study aims to construct, validate and adapt a
      self-performing exercise protocol in reducing cervical pain.

      Methods: The first phase was the development of the first version of the protocol, through
      literature search; in the second phase, the content was validated, through evaluation by a
      committee of nine physiotherapists judges using the Delphi technique; and the last phase of
      the protocol, the cultural adequacy, is being performed through evaluation by fifteen
      participants of the target population to assemble the final version of the protocol.
