      prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This study will enroll HIV-infected mothers who
      are at increased risk of passing HIV on to their children. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety and PK of VRC01, VRC01LS, and VRC07-523LS in HIV-exposed infants.

      This study will enroll mother-infant pairs into five groups. Infants enrolled in Dose Group 1
      and Dose Group 2 will receive a single VRC01 injection less than 72 hours after birth.
      Infants in Dose Group 3 will receive a VRC01 injection less than 5 days after birth. They
      will then receive additional VRC01 injections monthly for at least 6 months and no more than
      18 months while breastfeeding.

      Dose Groups 4 and 5 will each enroll infants into two cohorts: Cohort 1 (non-breastfeeding)
      or Cohort 2 (breastfeeding). Infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort 1 will receive a single VRC01LS
      injection less than 72 hours after birth. Infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort 2 will receive an
      initial VRC01LS injection no longer than 5 days after birth, and a second VRC01LS injection
      at Week 12 if they are still breastfeeding. Infants in Dose Group 5, Cohort 1 will receive a
      single VRC07-523LS injection less than 72 hours after birth. Infants in Dose Group 5, Cohort
      2 will receive an initial VRC07-523LS injection no longer than 5 days after birth, and a
      second VRC07-523LS injection at Week 12 if they are still breastfeeding.

      The mothers will not receive any VRC01, VRC01LS, or VRC07-523LS injections. At study entry,
      all mothers will undergo a medical history review and a blood collection. Infants in Dose
      Groups 1 and 2 will attend several study visits through Week 48. Infants in Dose Group 3, 4,
      and 5 will attend several study visits through Week 96. Visits will include a medical history
      review, physical examination, blood collection, and oral fluid collection.
