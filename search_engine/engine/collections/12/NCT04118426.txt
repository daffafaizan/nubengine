      cognitive function and radio-sensitivity of the brain is unknown. RT with protons instead of
      photons spares the healthy brain tissue more and is believed to reduce the risk of cognitive
      dysfunction. There is modest knowledge on which parts of the brain the investigators need to
      spare, to prevent cognitive dysfunction.

      The study is a cross sectional study assessing cognitive function in patients with brain
      tumours previously treated with RT compared to a similar non irradiated group. 104 patients
      with specified brain tumours from Aarhus University Hospital treated in the period 2006-2016
      will be included. The patients will do patient reported outcome (PRO) and undergo
      neuropsychological assessment with standardized tests: They will do this prior to RT
      treatment and Â½, 1, 3 and 5 years afterwards. The PRO's included measures on quality of life,
      fatigue, sleep, depression, anxiety, and socio demografica. The standardized tests are: Trail
      making Test (TMT); Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT); Controlled Oral Word Association Test
      (COWAT) - Animals and S; Coding and Digit Span from WAIS-IV; Paced Auditory Serial Addition
      Test (PASAT). The correlation between cognitive scores and RT dose-volume parameters to
      specific areas in the brain will be tested.
