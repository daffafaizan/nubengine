      I. Conduct a prospective clinical imaging study to quantify the amount of inter- and
      intra-physician contouring variability on four dimensional (4D) CT, active breathing control
      (ABC) CT, free breathing CT, and free breathing and ABC cone beam (CB)CT.

      II. Quantify the magnitude and distribution of target and organ at risk volume variations
      between the different imaging modalities.

      III. Determine dosimetric changes related to contouring variations for tumor and normal
      tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo conventional free breathing CT, 4D CT, ABC CT, ABC CBCT, and free breathing
      CBCT before undergoing radiation therapy.
