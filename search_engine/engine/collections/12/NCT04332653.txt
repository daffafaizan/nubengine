      pembrolizumab. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1b) followed by a dose
      expansion phase (Phase 2a).

      The Phase 1b is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, including determination of
      the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NT-I7.

      The main purpose of Phase 2a of this study is to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of
