      hydrosalpinx as confirmed by HSG. Tubal ligation may be a safe and effective method in the
      treatment of hydrosalpinx. But in this study, investigators will use fiber platinum coils to
      occlude the tubes. After the treatment, IVF-ET will be applied,and then the patients'
      pregnancy rate will be assessed in the following-up.
