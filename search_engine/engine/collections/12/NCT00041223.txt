        -  Determine the efficacy of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract for the treatment of
           radiation-induced fibrosis after high-dose radiotherapy in women with a history of early
           breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to time since prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract three times daily
           for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo three times daily for 6 months. Patients are
           followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 for arm I and 24 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
