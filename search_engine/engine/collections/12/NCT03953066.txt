      melatonin levels in colostral milk in spontaneous vaginal delivery,emergency cesarean and
      elective cesarean section patients and changes in blood IL-6 level before and after the
      delivery in same patient groups.

      the investigators randomized 30 cases for each group for comparisons.Time range seems short
      in this study but participating hospital setting is a busy maternity hospital thus it will be
      performed easily.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the beneficial effect of spontaneous vaginal
      delivery on the secretion of melatonin which is solely secreted by the mother and the newborn
      is dependent on maternal milk oriented melatonin until 12 th week after delivery
