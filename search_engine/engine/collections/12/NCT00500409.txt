      daily 1000 mg elemental calcium and 500 IU of vitamin D for 45 days. 82 eligible women with
      osteoporosis were randomly received daily either calcium and vitamin D alone (control group)
      or Osteoform 20 Âµg subcutaneously with calcium and vitamin D (drug group) for 12 months. End
      points such as percentage of increase in bone mineral density and, changes in bone biomarkers
      (serum osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, and urinary DPD) were evaluated at
      baseline, and 6 and 12 months after supplementation. Besides, safety parameters and adverse
      events were monitored through out the study period.
