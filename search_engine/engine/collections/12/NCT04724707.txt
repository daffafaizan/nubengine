    
      This open multi-center observational study (registry) is designed to enroll consecutive
      eligible patients hospitalized with and recovered from COVID-19 (ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2)
      with the involvement of the cardiovascular system or with baseline severe cardiovascular
      diseases. Data collection is ongoing for the duration of the pandemic. This study aims to
      assess the mid-term and long-term prognosis in this patient population. Analysis of this
      information may help to better predict the prognosis for patients and socio-economic burden
      of the coincidence of COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases and to better inform about the
      optimal surveillance programs in recovered patients.

      The de-identified participant data will be abstracted from the medical chart prospectively on
      the day of discharge or retrospectively (on the day of the first outpatient visit) and
      entered into an electronic database. The information will be stored in a database, and used
      at a later time for research studies.

      Patients will be followed up for at least 12 months. Data on standard clinical assessment,
      echocardiography, laboratory results, assessment of the current therapy, specific
      cardiovascular assessment (depending on the cardiovascular disease), and outcomes will be
      collected, as well as additional blood samples for biomarkers substudy and central core
      laboratory imaging assessment (when applicable) at 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigators will
      contact patients by telephone to obtain information about outcomes in case of inability to
      visit in person.
