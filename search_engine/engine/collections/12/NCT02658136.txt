      transplantation remains the gold standard of therapies. However, due to a severe lack of
      donor organs, mechanical circulatory support is an alternative option for some eligible
      patients. Mechanical circulatory support in the form of a CF-LVAD is a pump supporting the
      left ventricle by pumping blood from the apex to the ascending aortae. Implantation with a
      CF-LVAD increases survival and improves quality of life, but peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2)
      remains severely reduced post-implant. Complex central and peripheral hallmarks of heart
      failure attribute to the continued work intolerance. Furthermore a fixed CF-LVAD pump speed
      prevents adequate circulatory support during strenuous exercise. The effects of late right
      ventricular (RV) failure on exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL) is, however, unknown
      and the purpose of this study is to examine RV function and the association to exercise
      capacity in CF-LVAD patients.
