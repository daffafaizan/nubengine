      Ten (10) or more independent qualified practitioners trained to operate the device in
      accordance with the Directions For Use (DFU), and after completing the Device Usability
      aspect of the study, will be asked to perform simulated procedures with and without the
      device as indicated in the DFU on one-hundred (100) or more subjects using the following
      subject population and sampling table. A minimum of one hundred (100) or more data collection
      observations will be recorded, tabulated and reported.

      Assumptions: The population and sampling sizes chosen for each subject category will meet the
      goal to attain sufficient diversity to satisfy representation that supports the efficacy of
      the device across the population samples. Any failures or results from the acceptance
      criteria may require an increase in the sampling size to ensure coverage representation of
      all subject demographics.
