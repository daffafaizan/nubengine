      i) gluconeogenesis rates ii) sources of gluconeogenesis and pyruvate cycling, and iii)
      protein kinetics in critically ill children and adolescents, and its differences by age
      group, as well as in comparison to healthy adolescents. The study size will include 45
      critically ill septic, pediatric patients (22 children at 5-12 years of age and 23
      adolescents' at 13-19 years of age), male and females admitted to the pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) at Children's Medical Center, Dallas. The minimal subject's weight will be
      17kg. Additionally, 30 healthy adolescents matched by age, gender, BMI and Tanner stage will
      be studied at the Clinical Translational Research Center at Zale Lipshy Hospital, to serve as
      healthy adolescent controls. The number of subjects includes an expected drop out rate of
      about 20%, in order to obtain 18 patients with complete data in each group. Patients will
      receive nutritional support as per standard care. This study will yield important knowledge
      and may lead in the future to changes in the current practice on the management of critically
      ill pediatric patients in the PICU.
