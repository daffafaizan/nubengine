      Double blind, randomized, cross-over study with two different diets: one diet will be high in
      palmitic acid (C16:0) and the other diet will be high in stearic acid (C18:0). Subjects will
      receive both diets for 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4-6 weeks in between. Contrast in
      the intakes of palmitic acid and stearic acid is 6% of energy. A postprandial test will be
      carried out at the end of each dietary period.

      Study population:

      Accounting for a dropout rate of 20%, 40 healthy men and postmenopausal women, aged between
      45 and 70 year, having a BMI (body mass index) between ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2 will be
      recruited.
