      The "Dentary" intervention implies a trimestrial follow-up of patients and counseling for
      appropriate care (if needed), in order to restore a minimum masticatory function, associated
      with particular focus on the realization of daily oral wash.

      The "Nutrition" intervention consists in 1) comparing the meals and oral supplements
      administered with the dietary prescriptions and 2) Incite patients to eat.
