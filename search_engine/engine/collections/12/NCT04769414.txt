      disease of limited survival and a very poor response to treatment. The median overall
      survival at five years is expected to be between 4-6% only. Adenocarcinoma is the most common
      type of pancreatic cancer. It is the tenth most common adult solid malignancy. Most of the
      new therapeutic modalities has proven to be non-beneficial in this disease including targeted
      and immunotherapy.

      For many years, the first line of treatment for pancreatic cancer was gemcitabine either
      alone or in combinations. Recently, FOLFIRINOX has become the standard of care due to its
      overall survival benefit. However, it is a small benefit on the expense of great toxicity.

      Patients with metastatic cancer pancreas are recruited to receive the test regimen. Baseline
      evaluation will be done either by CT scan or PET/CT. re-evaluation will be repeated after 3
      months of treatment and at end of 6 months
