      (http://www.lumosity.com/) - an online cognitive training program, to address the cognitive
      impairment in outpatient HCT survivors. The program offers over 60 tasks in game-like format
      that cover the main cognitive domains: processing speed, working memory, and executive
      function. Training will involve a daily session of 5 training tasks for 12 weeks. Each time
      the patient is logged in for a session, a customized report will be generated by the Lumosity
      program to capture performance information.

      Ideally, targeting the intervention and offering it specifically to those at highest risk
      (integrating clinical and genetic markers) would ensure efficacy. However, evidence is
      lacking on whether patients are receptive to communication of individual genetic information
      and whether provision of such results would lead to enhanced intervention response. To
      realize the high expectations of personalized medicine, patients' preferences and attitudes
      need to be thoroughly investigated especially as more information on genetic risk becomes
      available. The investigators will examine patients' genetic knowledge to determine whether
      factual knowledge of genetics is essential for understanding genetic risk and for informing
      treatment decision making in this patient population.
