      7-12 sites in the United States, Canada and Europe in pediatric patients with suboptimal LV
      EBD on non-contrast 2D transthoracic echocardiography. It was estimated that 92 patients were
      to be enrolled to provide 73 evaluable patients.

      Three cardiologists unaffiliated with enrolling centers (blinded readers), blinded to the
      patient's identity and clinical profile were to independently evaluate the echocardiograms.
      The efficacy analysis was primarily based on the blinded reader evaluations.

      Imaging modalities that are used throughout the study in pediatric subjects represented those
      utilized in routine clinical practice in adults.

      One of the sites participating in this study was to be asked to consent a subset of patients
      for additional blood sampling for analysis of SF6 concentration in blood from a total of 6
      patients (3 males and 3 females) in the age group 9 up to 12 years of age and 6 patients (3
      males and 3 females) in the age of >12 up to and including 17 years.

      The current study was designed to assess the efficacy of Lumason-enhanced echocardiography in
      pediatric patients.
