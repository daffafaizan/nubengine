      transmitted and has aroused enormous global attention. Infected patients may develop severe
      and even fatal respiratory symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
      acute respiratory failure, ending up in intensive care. Patients with COVID-19 diagnoses are
      treated under isolation in hospitals and with high-stress level. The stress and psychological
      impact on patients were also correlated significantly with several adverse psychological
      effects, such as fatigue, fear of social contact, poor sleep, loneliness, and depressed mood.
      The psychological impact of COVID-19 may also evolve and last for a prolonged period after
      discharge from the hospital. However, there is currently little information on the mental
      health implications of exposure amongst COVID-19 survivors and their family members. Research
      exploring the psychological impact amongst survivors of exposure to COVID-19 is desperately
      needed to understand the effects, mental health toll, and support required in survivors of
      COVID-19. This study aims to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on
      COVID-19 survivors and their family members.
