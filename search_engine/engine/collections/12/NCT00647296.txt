    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of KNS-760704 compared to placebo. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

      In Part 1, approximately 80 eligible patients will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups
      for 12 weeks of treatment: placebo; low-dose; mid-dose; or high-dose KNS-760704. Participants
      meeting eligibility requirements will be enrolled at approximately 20 centers in the U.S. In
      addition to the visit to determine eligibility and the first visit to take study drug,
      participants will be required to make 5 additional research clinic visits in Part 1.

      Participants who complete all 12 weeks of Part 1 will be eligible for randomization to Part
      2. The duration of Part 2 of the study is 76 weeks. Subjects will receive 1 of 2 active
      treatment groups for 72 weeks (low-dose or high-dose KNS-760704) and placebo for the
      remaining 4-week period in Part 2. Participants will not be told when the 4 weeks of placebo
      treatment will be given. During Part 2, participants will be required to make 12 research
      clinic visits, including the baseline visit.
