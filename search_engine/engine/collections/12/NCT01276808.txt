      clinical use for interventional cardiology in 2003.

      Magnetic navigation gives 3 dimensional (3D) directional control over the guide-wire tip
      during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.

      Magnetic navigation has been shown to be feasible and effective (1-3), case reports suggest
      that it enables the performance of procedures that could not be successfully finished
      conventionally (4-6), and that the use of the system may lead to reductions in contrast use
      and procedure time (7-11) that can be expected to result in better patient outcomes, and an
      economical advantage (less consumables per procedure, more procedures per session). There are
      only a few centers that perform magnetic navigation for percutaneous coronary intervention
      The OLVG has performed the most procedures of any of these centers and has included all the
      patients in a registry.

      The registry at the OLVG suggests that different subgroups derive different benefit.

      Distal lesions (10) defined as lesions more distal than the first 2 coronary segments from
      the aorta (thus RCA segment, mid LAD or distal Cx).

      Technical success did not differ significantly between magnetic and conventional PCI (88.5 vs
      96.2%; p=0.14). Significantly shorter procedural and fluoroscopy time were observed for
      magnetic compared to conventional PCI (29.9±17.1 vs 42.9±21.1 min, p<0.001; 8.2±7.7 vs
      16.7±22.4 min, p=0.01 respectively). More contrast was used in de conventional PCI group (54
      ml/patient; P=0.02). These advantages resulted in a mean saving of 1652 euro per patient
      (P<0.0001).

      Primary PCI (11) The technical success rate was high in both the MPCI and CPCI groups (95.4%
      vs 98%; P = NS). There was significantly less contrast usage in the MPCI compared to the CPCI
      group (167±80/patient vs 220±87/patient; P<0.001). Procedural times were not significantly
      different for MPCI compared to CPCI (30.8±16.5 min vs 33.6±15.8 min, p=0.2) while fluoroscopy
      times were significantly better (8.1±5.0 min vs 14.6±26.5 min, p<0.05).

      Simple lesions (8) as defined by the elective treatment of a single discrete stenosis that
      would require a maximum of two stents and excluding multiple lesions in the target vessel,
      multi-vessel PCI, bifurcation lesions, acute and chronic total occlusions, or a previous
      failed conventional attempt for the same target lesion.

      Procedural and fluoroscopy times were not significantly different for MPCI compared to CPCI
      (21.0±14.5 min vs 24.7±14.0 min; 4.9±4.8 min vs 7.3±10.3 min, p=NS). There was a significant
      reduction in median contrast use (60 ml/patient [41-100] vs 100 ml/patient [64-130];
      P=0.006).

      Summary Benefit appears to increase depending on the complexity of the vessel/lesion with
      distal lesions showing a significant benefit in terms of contrast use, procedure time and
      fluoroscopy time.

      Simple lesions show that procedures are not negatively influenced in terms of time, or
      irradiation and there may be benefit in terms of contrast use.

      Acute procedures where time is at a premium (primary PCI for a heart attack) are not slowed
      by the use of the system.

      Furthermore, the investigators have published a clinical prediction rule for selection of
      patients that will most benefit from this technology. (12)

      The use of this system may have a number of benefits

        1. Reduction in the procedure time, irradiation and contrast use in the patient

        2. Better procedures with wire passage that maintains the tip coaxial in the vessel to
           avoid inadvertent sidebranch cannulation or more accurate bend/sidebranch entry to
           produce less complications

      The hypothesis that MPCI is better than CPCI should be investigated by a randomized
      controlled trial (Magnetic navigation wire placement vs conventional wire placement).

      The investigators plan to randomize patients into magnetic and conventional groups.

      Endpoints:

        1. Primary endpoint Contrast use

        2. Secondary:

           Short-term procedural Procedure Fluoroscopy Procedure time Procedure success Short term
           contrast nephropathy

        3. Long-term MACCE at 1 month and 12 months.
