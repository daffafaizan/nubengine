      block are routine in modern anaesthesia, whereas monitoring of analgesia still requires
      further studies. Recently, the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) was added as a surrogate variable
      showing the nociception-antinociception balance into abovementioned parameters constituting a
      novel approach in monitoring patients intraoperatively, known as adequacy of anaesthesia
      (AoA) or tailor-made anaesthesia.

      Different options of preemptive analgesia are used to decrease the postoperative pain
      perception as well as diminish the rate of PONV by deceasing intraoperative consumption of
      intravenous narcotic analgesics
