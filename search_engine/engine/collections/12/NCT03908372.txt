      associated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were main problems for patients with clinical
      stage II and III nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, inductive chemotherapy can decrease the
      likelihood of emergence of distant metastasis and reduce treatment related toxicities as
      previous studies showed.

      The role of inductive chemotherapy in screening low-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma for less
      treatment intensity is under-evaluated in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
      we hope to find the optimized treatment strategies by reducing the intensity of treatment
      according to the treatment response of inductive chemotherapy.
