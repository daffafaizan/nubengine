      (CHD) known as Ebstein's anomaly. These studies complement ongoing research studies using
      mouse models to recover mutations causing structural heart defects associated with human CHD.
      By elucidating the underlying genetic causes for Ebstien's anomaly, it may be possible to
      improve risk assessments as well as facilitate the development of new strategies for
      prevention and disease management. These studies are important for early diagnosis and the
      management of complications associated with surviving adults with Ebstein's anomaly, some of
      whom have undergone surgical correction and others that are unoperated.
