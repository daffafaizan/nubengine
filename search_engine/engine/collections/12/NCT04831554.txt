      subpleural bleb in otherwise normal lungs. The indications for surgical treatment include
      persistent air leak after intercostal tube drainage, recurrent PSP, and contralateral PSP.
      The video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach probably represents the treatment of
      choice for PSP.

      The presence of a residual pleural space after surgery may be a factor associated with
      increased risk of recurrence. One possible hypothesis to explain the association between
      residual pleural space and recurrence of pneumothorax may be the failed pleurodesis due to
      lack of pleura-pleura apposition. Multiple chest tubes are effective in clinical practice,
      but there was no convictive evidence that the number of chest tube do effect to the
      recurrence of pneumothorax, which placed after thoracoscopic wedge resection together with
      mechanical pleurodesis. This study evaluates the efficacy of single chest tube versus
      multiple tubes drainage in spontaneous pneumothorax after VATS bullcetomy and
      pleurodesis.After routine procedure the participants will randomized to either placed
      multiple chest tubes or single chest tube.

      The recurrence of the two group and other postoperative clinical parameters will be observed.
