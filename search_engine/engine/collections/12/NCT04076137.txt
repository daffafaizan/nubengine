      residents, with solid tumors accounting for 77 percent.Immunotherapy is considered one of the
      most promising ways to fight cancer.This study is a single-center, open, single-arm
      controlled clinical trial (after intravenous infusion of targeted T cells, compare the
      changes of self-lesion). The essence of this study is to collect immune cells to the
      surrounding of tumor cells, so that immune cells can kill tumor cells at close range.The
      researchers plan to enroll 10 patients with solid tumors and follow them up to the end of the
      study after completing 9 courses of treatment.The results of this study were statistically
      analyzed using RECIST1.1 records.
