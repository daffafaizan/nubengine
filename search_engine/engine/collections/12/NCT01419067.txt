    
      The primary objectives of this study :

      To estimate the progression-free and overall survival distributions for children and young
      adults with craniopharyngioma treated with limited surgery and proton therapy using a 5mm
      clinical target volume margin while monitoring for excessive central nervous system necrosis.

      The Secondary Objectives of this study:

        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of cystic intervention and the event-free survival
           distribution for children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated with limited
           surgery and proton therapy using a 5mm clinical target volume margin; and compare the
           distributions of progression-free, event-free and overall survival with the
           distributions for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital cohort of 93 patients on
           which the design of this trial is based.

        -  To estimate the distributions of progression-free survival and overall survival for
           children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated only with primary surgical
           resection and to compare these distributions with the distributions observed for
           patients treated with limited surgery and proton therapy.
