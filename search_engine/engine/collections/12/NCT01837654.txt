      detrusor pressures of each contraction will be documented and compared. At the beginning of
      the 2nd or 3rd wave, patients will be asked to perform continuous plantar-flexion by pushing
      their tiptoes against the floor. Following each wave, patients will be asked to grade the
      severity of the urgency by a visual analogue scale
