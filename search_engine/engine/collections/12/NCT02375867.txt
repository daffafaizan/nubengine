      mortality rate may reach 80-90% in the absence of liver transplantation. FHF is the clinical
      manifestation of liver cell death of a critical degree with insufficient hepatocellular
      regeneration and characterized by coagulopathy with or without hepatic encephalopathy.

      Liver injury is considered to be mainly immune mediated with augmentation of cytolytic
      pathways of infected hepatocytes. For that, it was suggested that corticosteroids modulate
      the activity of the disease by suppressing the immune system.
