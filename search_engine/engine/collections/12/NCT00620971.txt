      whether the administration of more than 2 active drugs provides greater efficacy than a
      two-drug combination. Docetaxel/gemcitabine combination is a well tolerated regimen, which
      has comparable efficacy to docetaxel/cisplatin or vinorelbine/cisplatin. In a recent phase II
      study in first line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC, the sequential administration
      of vinorelbine/cisplatin followed by docetaxel/gemcitabine produced a response rate of 45.8%
      and a 1-year survival rate of 51%. The addition of bevacizumab to a platinum-based regimen
      provided a survival benefit in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
