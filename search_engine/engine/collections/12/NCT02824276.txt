      prescribed oral opioid therapy.

      Investigators will conduct a moderate-term, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, and
      use quantitative sensory testing (QST) to evaluate whether changes in pain sensitivity and
      pain modulation occur as a result of long-term opioid use. Investigators hypothesize that
      increases in pain sensitivity (i.e., OIH) and maladaptive changes in endogenous pain
      modulation (i.e., enhanced temporal summation of pain) will occur as a result of long-term
      opioid use, but that these changes will be observed predominantly among patients with high
      levels of negative affect and pain-related catastrophizing.
