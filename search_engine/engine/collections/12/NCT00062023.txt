        -  Determine the percentage change in colorectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in patients with
           a history of colorectal cancer or at high risk for colorectal cancer when treated with
           sulindac vs aspirin vs ursodiol.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of these drugs, in terms of ability to cause
           regression of existing colorectal ACF and prevent new ACF development, in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a partially blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to colorectal neoplasia (adenoma vs carcinoma). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral aspirin once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral ursodiol three times daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral sulindac placebo twice daily. In all arms, treatment
           continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo a colonoscopy at baseline and at the end of treatment.

      Patients are followed at 2 months after the end of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 172 patients (43 per treatment arm) with a history of
      colorectal cancer or adenomas will be accrued for this study. A total of 20 additional
      patients with no elevated risk of colorectal neoplasia will be accrued, but not randomized,
      for this study.
