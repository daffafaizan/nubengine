      tissue concentrations, oral bioavailability and adequate tolerability and safety profiles,
      they are ideal candidates as antibacterial prophylaxis in cancer patients. Randomized trials
      investigating the effect of an antibiotic prophylaxis on patients with intermediate
      neutropenia have recently been conducted with levofloxacin. The influence of moxifloxacin on
      the incidence of bacteremia in patients undergoing autologous hematopoetic stem cell
      transplantation has not been investigated. Moxifloxacin may be another promising alternative,
      covering a broader spectrum of gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria than first- or secondary
      generation fluoroquinolones and for instance it is an agent administered only once daily,
      thus optimizing compliance, a crucial issue in prophylaxis.
