      gingiva with the following parameters: width of keratinized tissue (WKT) and gingival
      thickness (GT). The phenotype determination is extremely important during many dental
      procedures, such as in dental surgery, orthodontics, prosthetics or implantology because it
      allows to dental treatment planning and reduce the risk of complications. Previous methods of
      determining the gingival phenotype were based on the shape of the crowns of the upper
      incisors and transparency of the free gingiva. These methods are non-invasive, but
      innacurate. The gingival phenotype may be determined more precisely by using biometry of WKT
      and GT. There are several possible methods to measure the thickness of the gingiva, such as
      bone sounding, cone beam comuted tomography (CBCT) measurement or parallel profile
      radiographs, CBCT/CAD (CBCT and computer-aided design) and ultrasound method. The ultrasonic
      gingival tissue measurement (UGTM) method is non-invasive, removes the need for anesthesia,
      which may increases the volume of tissues, but requires the experience of the researcher.
      However, it is considered as effective and reproducible method of the measurement soft tissue
      thickness. CBCT/CAD/PDIP (CBCT/CAD and prosthetic-driven implant planning) method also can be
      used to establishing the gingival phenotype.

      Measurements of WKT are most often carried out using a periodontal probe calibrated every
      1mm. In each case, a necessary condition for the proper examination of the patient and
      determination of GP is healthy periodontium.
