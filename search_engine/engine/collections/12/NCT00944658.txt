      disease in the spine. The only proven treatment is the use of drugs inhibiting tumour
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF). However, there are limitations with this treatment in that it
      needs to be administered via an injection and is also very expensive. Therefore it is
      necessary to develop new therapeutic agents for this condition.

      Apremilast (the study drug) is an oral tablet which has been shown to inhibit TNF production
      in a mouse model of inflammation. It has also been used in clinical trials for asthma and
      psoriasis in humans with good affect and tolerability.

      These studies were funded by Celgene Corporation and they will be funding this study.

      The patients will be recruited from hospitals by Consultant referral. The patients will have
      had AS for at least 2 years and their symptoms will have been uncontrolled on conventional
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. Patients will be randomised to
      either receive apremilast or a placebo and treated over a period of 12 weeks. They will then
      be followed up for 28 days after the treatment period.
