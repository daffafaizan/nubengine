      cases were randomly divided into two groups.

        1. The cases in group of laminoplasty, the lamina and spinous process was replanted to
           maintain the anatomical intactness of spinal canal.

        2. On the other hand, the cases in internal fixation group, the pedicle screws were
           implanted, and tickets were used to complete the internal fixation.

      During 3 years follow up, the vertebral deformity and the range of motion were investigated
      and evaluated. And in the meantime, the patient's age will also be analyzed to detect it's
      influence for the prognosis.
