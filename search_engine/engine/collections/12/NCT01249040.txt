      evaluate shoulder range of motion (ROM) in flexion, external rotation,abduction and internal
      rotation by goniometer(9).Restriction in ROM is noted.Cases with possible diagnosis of frozen
      shoulder is arranged to receive shoulder arthrography(10,11,12)which is performed by the
      administration of contrast media(2ml) into joint space,followed by injection of air.Injection
      is discontinued when resistance is felt.The joint space capacity is defined as the total
      volume of contrast media and air that could be injected without resistance.All procedures are
      conducted by the same well experienced radiologist to keep measurement reproducible.The
      arthrographic findings should met at least two of the following criteria for final diagnosis
      of frozen shoulder:(1)joint space capacity less than 10ml;(2)irregularity of capsular margin;
      (3)diminished or absent axillary recess.Once frozen shoulder is confirmed,the patient is
      randomly arranged to receive a specific treatment program.

      (B) Treatment program:

      The treatment program and grouping arranged as follow:

      Group 1:Physical modalities + therapeutic exercise Group 2:Physical modalities + therapeutic
      exercise+ intra-articular injection of steroid Gouup 3:Therapeutic exercise

      (C) Sample size estimation: We assume α=0.05,power=1-α=0.95,from previous
      literature(10),change of ROM in flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation
      before and after treatment was estimated as 40,40,40,20 degrees respectively,,standard
      deviation was 10,15,10,10 degrees respectively.Therefore,standard effective size was
      4,2.6,4,2 respectively.From applied linear statistical models(13)fourth edition,1996,if
      α=0.05 sample size estimated as 5,7,5,10 Respectively.Therefore,sample size in each group is
      estimated as 10.
