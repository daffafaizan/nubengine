      groups of impoverished mothers, with rates in recent community studies approaching 50%. Even
      though primary care offers an ideal venue to identify and manage depression among women who
      commonly fail to receive needed mental health services, rigorously tested primary care-based
      treatment strategies that address the needs of homeless mothers with depression are lacking.
      This study reports results on a pilot test and feasibility findings of a new intervention,
      the Integrated Care Model for Homeless Mothers (ICMHM), adapted from the collaborative care
      model for depression (CCM) to address unique aspects of care for homeless mothers who
      screened positive for depression during a shelter-based primary care visit.
