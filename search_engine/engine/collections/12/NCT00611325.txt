      combination with Avastin for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (gbm). 56 total
      patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant gliomas have been enrolled on study. Avastin
      was administered intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Bortezomib was
      administered on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, & 32 of a 42-day cycle. The dose of bortezomib
      was 1.7 mg/m2 for non-EIAED patients & 2.5 mg/m2 for EIAED patients. Treatment continued
      until either evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with
      study follow-up / withdrawal of consent. Brain MRIs were obtained after every cycle.

      Bortezomib administration is associated with mild toxicity in most patients, such as fatigue,
      diarrhea & nausea, constipation & peripheral neuropathy. Less common, bortezomib
      administration leads to more significant hematologic toxicities & peripheral neuropathies.
      Most significant toxicities associated with Avastin in recently completed phase II clinical
      trial at Duke were thrombotic complications & grade 2 proteinuria. "Unacceptable" toxicities
      rates of 15 percent or less were considered desirable, while rates of 40 percent or greater
      were considered undesirable. The statistical hypothesis that needed testing differentiated
      between 15% & 40% rate of unacceptable toxicity.
