    
      A single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be carried out to assess the effects of 12
      weeks of Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) +Hand Therapy
      Video Games (HTVG) compared to CCFES. Dexterity, upper limb impairment, and activity
      limitation will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 3, 6, 9, 12 (end of treatment), 24, and 36 wks.
      Cortical activation (measured with fMRI) will be assessed at 0 and 12 wks. The treatment dose
      will be the same for both groups: 10 sessions per week (7.5 hrs) of self-administered
      treatment at home plus 2 sessions per week (3 hrs) of group-specific occupational therapy in
      the lab.
