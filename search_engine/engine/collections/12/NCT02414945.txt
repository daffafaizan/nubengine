      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The target number of cells for infusion is between 1 x
      1010 and 1.6 x 1011. The cells are given intravenously over a 20-30 minute infusion.

      Prior to infusion of TILs, patients will receive a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide
      (60 mg/kg/day x 2 days intravenously) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day x 5 days intravenously).

      After the cell infusion, patients will receive low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy (125,000
      IU/kg/day subcutaneously for 2 weeks with a 2 day break between each week. The goal for the
      total number of doses is 9-10).

      Because confusion is a possible side effect of IL-2 administration, a Durable Power of
      Attorney will be signed by the patient to identify a surrogate to make decisions if a patient
      becomes unable to make decisions.
