    
      Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue matrix caused by
      abnormal collagen microﬁbril assembly, .Several clinical subtypes of Osteogenesis imperfecta
      have been described based on the clinical, biochemical, and molecular nature of the disorder
      . New research is emphasizing the structural interaction within the microﬁbril and
      identifying regions within the collagen, which play greater or lesser roles in the structural
      properties of the triple helix, .In taking this information into account, clinical phenotypes
      resulting from certain mutations can be predicted because of this pathogenetic correlation.

      The clinical manifestations vary considerably, ranging from a severe perinatal lethal form to
      a mild disorder which only becomes evident in adulthood, manifesting as premature
      osteoporosis, .Most commonly, however, Osteogenesis imperfecta presents in childhood with
      multiple fractures and related complications, .The precise incidence of Osteogenesis
      imperfecta is unknown and reports vary from approximately 1/100,000 to 1/25,000 dependent on
      the criterion used to deﬁne Osteogenesis imperfecta.

      Severe forms and milder disease occur with approximately similar incidence. Severe and mild
      forms share the cardinal feature of bone fragility, which is characterized by bone fractures
      often after little or no trauma, .Several ﬁndings in Osteogenesis imperfecta are common to
      other disorders of connective tissues; hyper-mobile joints and a blue sclera are among these
      features frequently described, The incorporation of abnormal type 1 collagen in teeth results
      in brittle opalescent teeth, the hallmark of Dentinogenesis Imperfecta, often seen in
      Osteogenesis imperfecta, .Progressive conductive hearing loss in early adulthood is the
      result of damage to the ossicles in the middle ear; over time, hearing loss typically
      progresses and combined conductive and sensorineural hearing loss may be seen in adults,
      similar to that of otosclerosis. Short stature and bone deformity are common features of the
      disorder The mainstay of treatment is orthopedic management along with physiotherapy,
      Bisphosphonates are being evaluated for efﬁcacy and clinical trials have shown improvement at
      least in bone mineral density
