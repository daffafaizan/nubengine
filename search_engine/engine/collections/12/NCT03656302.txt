      depressive episodes, is commonly found in the general population with a lifetime prevalence
      of 1-2% in the world. The morbidities and mortality associated with bipolar disorder are huge
      and the repercussion on their family members is considerate. Nonetheless, there is no
      existing well-established prevention strategy that may prevent this distressing mental
      disorder. A major reason is that there was limited understanding of the prodromal phase of
      BD. On the other hand, the genetic background determines about 60-85% of risk variance of BD.
      In other words, the offspring carries significant risk and propensity to develop future BD.
      Limited existing studies suggested that offspring of patients with BD have a higher rate of
      sleep and circadian disturbances and mental disorders than those offspring of parents without
      BD. Nonetheless, it is still unclear whether sleep and circadian disturbances are prodromal
      markers or risk factors for the development of bipolar disorder in this high-risk population.

      In light of our research and other studies' preliminary findings on the relationship between
      circadian rhythms dysregulation and BD and robust heritability in BD, we hypothesize that

        1. Circadian rhythm dysregulations are prodromal features and endophenotypes of BD. The
           offspring of BD parents will have more circadian rhythm dysregulations than those
           offspring of healthy controls;

        2. The biologic indices of circadian rhythm dysregulations will be correlated with
           subsyndromal psychopathology.
