    
      Purpose The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the International Consultation on
      Incontinence Modular Questionnaire (ICIQ-SF) Short Form are widely used in clinical practice.
      The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of KHQ and ICIQ-SF in polish
      women.

      Methods One hundred fifty-five women with urinary incontinence (UI) aged between 19-82 years
      underwent urodynamic investigation and completed both KHQ and ICIQ-SF. To evaluate the factor
      structure and construct the validity of the KHQ and ICIQ, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      using VARIMAX rotation was conducted for all questionnaire items. PCA results were also
      confirmed by Spearman's correlations between KHQ and ICIQ items. Moreover, the internal
      consistency of the KHQ and ICIQ was estimated by way of Cronbach's alpha coefficient (Î±).
      Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA version 13.1 software (StatSoft, Poland),
      as well as open source R software (version 3.4.4).
