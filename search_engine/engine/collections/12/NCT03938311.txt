      parallel group, clinical trial. This trial will be conducted in 57 general hospitals in
      mainland China affiliated with the China Stroke Databank Center and will enroll 6033 eligible
      patients with acute ischemic stroke. Participants will be randomly allocated to either (1)
      the very early mobilization group in whichmobilization is initiated within 24 hours from
      stroke onset, (2) the early mobilization group in which mobilization begins between 24 and 72
      hours poststroke, or (3) the late mobilization group in which mobilization is started after
      72 hours poststroke. The mobilization protocol is otherwise standardized and identical for
      each comparison group. Mobilization is titrated by baseline mobility level and progress of
      patients throughout the intervention period. The primary outcome is death or disability
      assessed with the modified Rankin scale at 3 months poststroke. Secondary outcomes include
      impairment score of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, dependence in activities
      of daily living as measured using the modified Barthel Index, cognitive ability assessed with
      the Mini-Mental State Examination, incidence of adverse events, hospital length of stay, and
      total medical costs.
