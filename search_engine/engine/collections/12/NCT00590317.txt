    
      Nausea and vomiting can be common symptoms in the emergency department (ED). Antiemetics,
      agents to treat nausea and vomiting, include phenothiazine derivatives, prokinetic agents,
      and 5-HT3 antagonists. There have been limited studies on the use of these agents in the ED,
      and no direct comparisons to 5-HT3 antagonists have been published to date.

      Inclusion Criteria:

      Patients presenting to the ED with at least one of the following

        -  nausea

        -  vomiting documented in the ED
