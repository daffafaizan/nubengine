    
      The key purpose of the main part of the study is to assess the MTD, safety and efficacy of
      BEY1107 as monotherapy and combination therapy for locally advanced and/or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. The main purpose of the safety lead-in (dose-finding) part of the study is
      to determine the safety and tolerability of BEY1107, to determine the MTD.

      Patient will receive BEY1107 for 4 weeks in monotherapy for each cohort (administered in a
      3-weeks-on / 1-week-off) during Phase I-1 trial.

      At next stage, patient will receive BEY1107 with gemcitabine for 4weeks in phase I-2 trial.

      Final stage, patient will receive BEY1107 with gemcitabine for 24weeks in phase II trial.

      Blood samples will be collected for safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis. Archival
      of fresh biopsy tissue will also be collected for biomarker analysis.
