      I. To evaluate the effect of sunitinib (sunitinib malate) compared to placebo on
      progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who
      have had either stable or responding disease over the course of their initial 4 cycles of
      platinum-based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of sunitinib compared to placebo in the maintenance setting.

      II. To evaluate the additional response rate as a result of sunitinib in this setting.

      III. To assess the impact of sunitinib on overall survival compared to the placebo arm.

      IV. To assess the impact of sunitinib on delaying the time to deterioration in quality of
      life and symptom progression compared to placebo using the European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and Lung Cancer
      Module (LC13).

      V. To assess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) haplotypes in advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer and sunitinib maintenance.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then periodically for 3 years.
