      have a Serratus anterior plane block (SPB), with a first ropivacaine 0,375% bolus (0,4ml/kg),
      followed by an infusion of ropivacaine 0,2% at a 10ml/hr rate, through a multi-holed catheter
      located under the serratus anterior muscle, for a duration of 24 hours. The other group will
      have a standard intravenous analgesia with a PCA morphine-dehydrobenzperidol pump. Anesthesia
      protocol will be standardized. Except the infusion of ropivacaine for the SPB, per operative
      anesthesia and post operative analgesia will be the same for every usual patients.

      The investigators will evaluate post operative pain based on the visual analog scale, 24
      hours morphine consumption, sensitivity of concerned territory. The investigators will also
      evaluate post operative chronic pain by assessing pain two months post operatively,
      completing two questionnaires of neuropathic pain: DN4 and QDSA short form.

      Finally, ropivacaine blood concentrations will be dosed by multiple blood samples taken over
      24 hours after realizing the SPB, in order to make a population pharmacokinetic analysis, and
      evaluate the degree of ropivacaine resorption at this level.
