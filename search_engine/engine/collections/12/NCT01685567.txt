      adverse neurological effects. Most major clinical studies of CAS have used distal filters for
      cerebral protection and have compared the neurologic complication rates with those of carotid
      endarterectomy (CEA). Many currently available embolic protection devices, however, have
      limited efficacy in capturing microembolic debris that is liberated during stenting,
      pre-dilatation and post-dilatation. Distal protection systems are furthermore limited by the
      need to cross the lesion prior to deployment. Some studies have shown a relatively high
      incidence of cerebral infarction even when distal protection devices are employed.

      Cerebral protection with carotid flow reversal is a method that was developed as an
      alternative to the use of distal protection devices. While novel in its approach, this method
      too has its limitations. Another technique developed employs carotid flow reversal prior to
      traversing the stenosis and can be accomplished by directly accessing the carotid anatomy
      without the use of the transfemoral approach. Major benefits to this method include a simpler
      route to the target lesion and the ability to perform the procedure on patients with severe
      carotid tortuosity and difficult aortic arch anatomy.
