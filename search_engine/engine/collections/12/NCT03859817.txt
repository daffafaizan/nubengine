    
      At the beginning and during the course of the study the glycemic and ketone index obtained by
      the homologous blood glucose monitoring will be evaluated. During the study, prognostic
      biomarkers (sP2X7R, KIM-1, sTNFR1, 11-dehydro-tromoxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin-F-1a
      (PGF1Î±)), which are presumed to play an important role in inflammatory renal diseases, will
      also be measured in diabetic subject, in addition to the traditional marker that is the
      urinary albumin.

      Step 1. Visit Baseline: blood sampling and collection of a urinary sample, evaluation
      proteinuria, GFR and blood and urinary ketones Step 2. Visit at 6 months: blood collection
      and collection of a urinary sample, evaluation proteinuria, GFR and blood and urinary ketones
      Step 3. Visit at 12 months: blood collection and collection of a urinary sample, evaluation
      proteinuria, GFR and blood and urinary ketones. The study involves the enrollment of T1D and
      T2D subjects in diabetic nephropathy. The study involves the enrollment of T1D and T2D
      subjects in diabetic nephropathy A timetable will be prepared for the surgeries during the
      which the diabetic subject will be informed about the study protocol in question and will
      provide eventual informed consent to entry into the study, blood sampling and urinary sample
      collection. However, the analysis will be above all exploratory and will allow to foresee
      possible studies future properly sized.
