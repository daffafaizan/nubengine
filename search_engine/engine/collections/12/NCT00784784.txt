      influenza infection and illness when used either as prophylaxis after exposure to a household
      contact with influenza or when taken for several weeks at the height of influenza activity in
      the general community. However, the longest duration of prophylaxis with neuraminidase
      inhibitors in two clinical trials, to date, has been six weeks.

      Antiviral medication will likely have an important role in the response to the next influenza
      pandemic. Additionally, there may be indications for use during seasons when the major
