      diagnosed pre-diabetes comparing the effects of real-time continuous glucose monitoring
      (RT-CGM) combined with diet and lifestyle education to those who have diet and lifestyle
      education alone. During a "wash-in" phase both groups will wear a masked CGM for 1 week at
      baseline and again after 12 weeks. Those randomized to the RT-CGM will wear it for 4 cycles
      of 2 week on/1 week off over the next 12 weeks. Both groups will follow-up with their primary
      care providers as clinically indicated over the next year with quarterly measurements of
      blood pressure, weight, and BMI. At the end of this period, they will wear a masked CGM for 1
      week.
