      Because of a lack of evidence, natural health products field remains uncertain. Decision aids
      (or decision support interventions) have been elaborated in the past for several health
      decisions and previous studies showed that they seem to be effective on reducing decisional
      conflict. Following a needs assessment with 40 women and 15 key informants, we developed a
      decision aid tool specific to the context of natural health products for menopause. In this
      study, we will assess its impact on decisional conflict, knowledge, persistence for an
      option, intention to use for a future decision in the same area, and intention to disclose
      use of natural health products to health professionals.

      tool that we developed based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework.
