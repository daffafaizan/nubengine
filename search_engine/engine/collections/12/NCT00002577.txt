      3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in patients with locally advanced, inoperable,
      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3D-CRT in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the morbidity associated with high dose 3D-CRT for carcinoma of the
      lung.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are stratified by the percentage of total
      lung volume (TLV) receiving greater than 20 Gy of radiation (less than 25% vs 25% to less
      than 37% vs at least 37%). As of 7/1/1999, the third stratum closed to accrual. Patients
      receive 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) 5 days a week for either 6-7 weeks, 7-8
      weeks, or 9-10 weeks (depending on the cohort). Within each TLV stratum, cohorts of 15-36
      patients receive escalating doses of 3D-CRT until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which less than 15% of patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-36 patients per cohort will be accrued for this study within
      1 year. As of 7/1/1999, the third stratum closed to accrual.
