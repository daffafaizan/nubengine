      receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and
      returned to the patient by Ommaya Reservoir at specific cell doses. Three CD147-CART doses
      patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Serum cytokine level and CAR-T cell number will be
      measured in whole treatment session.
