      one of the most frequent death causes of patients with liver cirrhosis. When a patient has
      bleeding episode, it's very likely that he/she will develop another one in the future.
      Endoscopic treatments such as ligation, sclerotherapy or cyanocrylates are proved to decrease
      the risk of re-bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two
      different endoscopic treatments in patients who have both gastric and esophageal varices with
      liver cirrhosis: In addition to cyanoacrylates, ligation versus ligation plus sclerotherapy.
