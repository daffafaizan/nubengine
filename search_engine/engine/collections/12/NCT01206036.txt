    
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate feasibility of dose levels DL1, DL2 and DL3
      (which are combinations of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel) and defining a recommended dose (RD)
      for the Phase II part using these dose levels in a dose escalating scheme.

      Secondary objectives are the collection of safety data on the dose levels used in this part.
