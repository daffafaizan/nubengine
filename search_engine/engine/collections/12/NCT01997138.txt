      operative inflammation will be evaluated. On inclusion, pain intensity will be measured on a
      five-point verbal rating scale (0= no pain, 1=mild pain, 2=moderate pain, 3=severe pain, and
      4=intolerable pain), and on a visual analogue scale (0-100mm). VAS scale will be repeated at
      20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 and 200 minutes after inclusion / intervention. The
      patients will also rate pain intensity during a 5 meters walk at 200 minutes (evoked pain).
      The patient will rate pain at rest and evoked pain 24, 48 and 72 h after intervention.
