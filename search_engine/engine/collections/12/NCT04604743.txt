      confidence intervention, targeting positive change related to HPV vaccine uptake behavior and
      reducing sentiments of hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine, that can be seamlessly
      integrated into the existing environment of pediatric and family practice clinics in rural
      Alabama. To do so, the investigators will first assess stakeholders' knowledge, sentiments,
      and beliefs related to vaccination in general, a COVID-19 vaccination, and the HPV
      vaccination. The investigators will also assess stakeholders' perceptions of barriers to
      vaccination that exist in rural Alabama. This will occur in Aim 1. Then, in Aim 2, the
      investigators will use these data to inform the development of a non-invasive, modular
      synchronous counseling intervention targeting 15-17 year old adolescents (rationale for this
      age range presented later in this proposal). After the intervention has been finalized, in
      our final aim, Aim 3, we will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation cluster
      randomized control trial to assess intervention acceptability and feasibility (N=4 clinics;
      N=120 adolescents), while also assessing for a "clinical signal" of effectiveness. To support
      dissemination and scale up, also during Aim 3, we will document implementation contexts to
      provide real-world insight. To do this, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews
      with the same groups of stakeholders that we interviewed in Aim 1.
