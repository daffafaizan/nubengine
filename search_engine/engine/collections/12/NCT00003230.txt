      in patients with acute leukemia refractory to or recurrent after standard chemotherapy, in
      patients with blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, or in elderly patients (65-75)
      with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. II. Determine the rate of complete and partial
      remissions to paclitaxel treatment in these patients. III. Assess the toxic effects of
      paclitaxel given as a 96-hour infusion in these patients. IV. Determine the duration of
      remission after paclitaxel treatment in these patient populations.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel as a
      96-hour continuous infusion. Patients may receive a second course of treatment after 4 weeks
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity irrespective of the treatment results after 1 course.
      Cohorts of 3 patients are treated at escalating doses of paclitaxel in the absence of dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT). If 1 out of 3 patients develops DLT, then 3 additional patients are
      treated at the same dose level. If DLT occurs in more than 1 out of 3-6 patients, dose
      escalation stops and this is considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD has
      been defined, the next patients are entered at the dose level preceding the MTD for the phase
      II portion of the study. Patient are followed at 2 weeks after completion of study and then
      every 3-6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be a total of 33 patients accrued (22 patients in the first
      stage and 11 in the second stage) in this study.
