      very valuable for therapy regulation. So-called chaperones out of the family of heat shock
      proteins (HSP) are promising candidates which are involved in the development of ANR as well.
      This could be a starting point for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

      ANR occurs in up to 50 percent of all critical ill patients and has a high rate of morbidity
      and mortality despite advances in symptomatic therapy. Following severe sepsis, septic shock
      or other shocks, combined with multiple organ failure, the ANR is an autonomous prognosis
      worsening factor.

      Should the results of our study show a correlation between the production of HSP and the
      outcome of children with ANR, further studies would be required, to examine the
      pathophysiological relevance of HSP in ANR. We would then be able to determine a high risk
      population for ANR. A modulation of ANR therapy might be a result of further studies.
