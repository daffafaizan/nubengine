      kg/m2 (120-150% desirable body weight) are recruited and screened via telephone, medical
      history, and physical exam. Exclusion criteria are: diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia (>400
      mg/dl), history of cancer or myocardial infarction, clinical depression, renal, liver or
      hematologic disease, and medications that affect glucose or lipid metabolism (thiazides,
      estrogen replacement, beta-blockers). Changes in total and visceral body fat are measured by
      dual x-ray absorptiometry and computerized tomography, resting energy expenditure and fat
      oxidation rate by indirect calorimetry, and lipoprotein lipids by enzymatic assay. Glucose
      tolerance is assessed during a three-hour oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of
      glucose- and insulin levels every 30 minutes. LPL activity is measured in 3050mg pieces of
      subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue.
