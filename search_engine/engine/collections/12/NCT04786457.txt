      vaccinated with Tetravalent Dengue Virus (TDEN) Purified Inactivated Vaccine (PIV) with alum
      and boosted with TDEN live attenuated vaccine (LAV) formulation against a weakened form of an
      experimental dengue virus challenge. The Investigators will also include people that have not
      received the study vaccine. The Investigators are collecting information about how the
      vaccine protects against a dengue virus challenge as well as adding to knowledge about the
      safety of the challenge. The information will help Investigators develop vaccines to protect
      people from dengue. Participation is voluntary. The duration of participation will last for
      180 days (six months). After participants are exposed to the weakened dengue virus, the
      Investigators will follow them closely to measure their symptoms. Like the flu, participants
      might expect to have a headache, rash, body aches, fever and chills or they may experience no
      symptoms whatsoever. If a participant does develops symptoms, the Investigators will monitor
      him/her closely in a local hotel or a wing of our hospital to ensure safety and to treat
      symptoms if they occur. Participants will be compensated for their time.
