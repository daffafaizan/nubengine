      to conventional ventilators, the Trilogy device achieves comparable level of gas exchange
      (measured as partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in arterial, venous or capillary
      blood)and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, (SpO2) levels during various modes of
      ventilation.

      B. Secondary Hypothesis and end-points In patients with respiratory insufficiency, when
      compared to conventional ventilators, the Trilogy device achieves comparable breathing
      pattern (tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation), hemodynamics (heart rate), and
      subjective measures of breathing comfort (measured by modified Borg dyspnea scale).
