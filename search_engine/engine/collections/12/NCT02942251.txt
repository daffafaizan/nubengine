      study is using big data analysis based on clinical features and immunochemistry to
      investigate and establish an relapse predict model for patients with first episode MDD.

      This study includes two steps. Step 1: Big data analysis based on the clinical features and
      immunochemical figures of 30000 patients with first episode MDD will be conducted to
      construct a relapse predict model.

      Step 2: 300 patients with first episode MDD will be recruited in this step. Physicians prefer
      to give corresponding treatment recommendation based on the predictive factors to verify this
      relapse model.
