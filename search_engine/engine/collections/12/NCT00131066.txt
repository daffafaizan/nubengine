      patients who have completed participation in a previous study and who received treatment with
      MEDI-507. Patients must have had an ALC > 30% lower than baseline (defined as baseline prior
      to any MEDI-507 exposure); or an absolute CD4 count of < 250 cells/uL. This study will also
      evaluate the development and durability of anti-MEDI-507 antibodies.
