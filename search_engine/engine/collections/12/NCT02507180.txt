      is a common clinical problem faced by clinicians daily. The only validated method to exclude
      DVT in pregnancy requires leg vein CUS imaging. This imaging modality is costly and has
      limited availability (only available in radiology departments and, usually, only during
      weekday daytime hours) often necessitating referral to the emergency room for initiation of
      heparin injections until leg vein CUS can be obtained. A simple and seemingly powerful
      clinical decision rule (LEFt) and a simple blood test (D-dimer) may be promising to exclude
      DVT in pregnancy without the need for diagnostic imaging. Validating the safety of a simple,
      non-invasive, widely available approach to suspected DVT in pregnancy would be an important
      advance in maternal health.

      A prospective cohort diagnostic management study in pregnant women with suspected DVT, with
      three-month follow-up for symptomatic VTE will take place in multiple centres throughout
      Canada and Europe.

      After obtaining informed consent, all patient will have the LEFt clinical decision rule
      applied by the attending physician and will have D-Dimer testing (D-Dimer results of test
      performed within 24 hours will be accepted and do not need to be repeated).

      Patients with an "unlikely" LEFt score of 0 or 1 point and a negative D-dimer will not
      undergo diagnostic imaging.

      Patients with either a "likely" LEFt score of 2 or 3 points or a positive D-dimer will
      undergo either a single complete leg vein compression ultrasound (CCUS) (Day 1) or a serial
      proximal leg vein (CUS) (Day 1 and Day 7).

      All patients will be followed for 3 months for symptomatic VTE.
