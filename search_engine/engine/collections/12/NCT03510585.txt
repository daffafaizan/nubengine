      with the written informed consent. Subjects were randomly assigned to 15-days of one of the
      following interventions: RRC and RRC+S. Non pharmacological respiratory approaches may be
      useful in the management of the respiratory symptoms and dysfunctions air pollution-related.
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether saline instillation and/or retrograde
      rhinopharyngeal retrograde clearance are effective in the treatment of upper airways
      dysfunction through nasal mucociliary clearance, mucus properties, pH, cellularity and
      cytokines in nasal lavage and pH in exhaled breath condensate, as well as the airways
      symptoms (cough, wheeze, runny nose, hoarseness, among others) in motorcyclists due to urban
      air pollution.
