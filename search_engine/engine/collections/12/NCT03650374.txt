      contralateral (non-operative) lower extremity in addition to standard of care postoperative
      rehabilitation. The experimental strength training will be performed with moderate resistance
      and will require moderate effort. Exercises will include unilateral leg presses, lunges, step
      ups, and step downs. These exercises are performed as standard of care but are not typically
      introduced into the physical therapy regimen until 10-12 weeks postoperatively. In the
      experimental group, these exercises will be introduced starting with the first postoperative
      physical therapy session, but only for the contralateral (non-operative) leg.
