      high fat meal will reduce the inflammatory response in people with the metabolic syndrome. If
      this extract is shown to mitigate the inflammatory response induced by a high fat meal, it
      could potentially aid in postponing of the diagnosis of diabetes or other chronic diseases
      associated with high levels of inflammation.
