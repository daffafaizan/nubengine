      treated ("study eye"). They will be evaluated every six months to determine if their
      condition is stable or worse. Following the injection of study medication, patients will not
      be required to come in to see the study physician. The investigator or study staff will call
      the patients on the day following injection to make sure there were no adverse effects to the
      injection. Patients will then come in for a Week 4 and Month 3 follow-up visit. At the Month
      3 follow-up visit, if patients are not showing stability or improvement, they may be offered
      either thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy. They will remain in the study and remain
      eligible for a repeat injection of Anecortave Acetate at the Month 6 visit.

      Patients will then been seen at Month 6 for a Re-treatment Evaluation Visit. If their
      condition is stable, they will be offered re-injection with the same study medication they
      received earlier. If Patients are not showing stability or improvement at the Month 6 visit,
      they may be offered thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy in conjunction with the Anecortave
      Acetate injection.

      If the patient is re-injected at the 6 month visit, the schedule of follow-up visits will
      repeat as before for the next 18 months. If the patient opts out of the re-injection, they
      will be exited from the study.
