      system works. By studying immune function in many people, we will be able to determine the
      range of normal variation.

      The second purpose is to enroll people who are willing to serve as comparisons in future
      research studies into the Genotype and Phenotype Research Registry (GAP Registry).

      Volunteers are asked to provide information on age, ethnicity and medical history. Volunteers
      are asked to provide a blood sample of up to 100cc and allow us to contact you about
      additional studies.
