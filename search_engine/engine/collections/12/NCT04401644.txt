      samples. The method involves the absorption of light by single virus particles giving a
      specific pattern. The investigators will develop the device to create a microdroplet of
      carrier fluid that is run through the trial device. The investigators will develop novel
      binding receptors for preferential capture of Coronavirus.

      The investigators will review the results of the novel test against the standard diagnostic
      test and identify virus particles in test negative subjects.

      The investigators will isolate the viral rna in test negative subjects and perform sequencing
      to find novel mutations that are not detected by the current test.
