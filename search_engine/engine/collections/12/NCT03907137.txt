      patient reported outcomes (PRO) in severe eosinophilic asthma patients who are treated with
      benralizumab according to the label granted in Switzerland. The PRO measures consist of the
      weekly Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) as well as Patient Global Impression of Change
      and Severity (PGI-C and PGI-S) collected at each visit (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 56 weeks). In
      addition the patient fills out twice daily the patient electronic asthma diary (eDiary)
      capturing daily symptoms and symptom free days together with a PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow)
      measurement. Persistance with eDiary and PEF will be assessed after 56 weeks. The percentage
      of patients successfully reducing their OCS dose will be evaluated after 16 weeks of
      treatment with benralizumab and if OCS reduction is persistent until week 56. Furthermore,
      the proportion of patients with an ACQ-5 score improvement of â‰¥ 0.5 after 8 weeks of
      treatment with benralizumab will be determined. In addition, the study will assess changes in
      FEV1 and FVC after 8, 16 and 56 weeks of treatment with benralizumab and describe
      retrospectively asthma disease history, past treatment status and current medication at
      baseline.
