      people. In view of the current lack of objective biological markers in the diagnosis and
      treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the lack of effective early diagnosis methods and
      curative effect prediction methods, the investigators carried out joint research by
      integrating research teams from molecular genetics, neurobiochemistry, psychiatry, medical
      imaging, information science and other fields. The overall objective of the project is to
      establish a bio-marker system for individualized diagnosis and treatment of early
      schizophrenia. Specific research contents include: screening and verifying multidimensional
      objective biological markers such as genetics, neurobiochemistry, neuroimaging,
      electrophysiology, which is related to early diagnosis and efficacy prediction of
      schizophrenia through big data analysis of healthy controls and patients with first episode
      schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorder. Pattern recognition method is used to build
      the individualized early diagnosis model, biological sub-type clustering model, biological
      sub-type individualized diagnosis model and early curative effect prediction model of
      schizophrenia. Based on the individualized diagnosis and treatment prediction model of
      schizophrenia, the individualized diagnosis and treatment toolkit was developed, and the
      individualized diagnosis and treatment prediction cloud platform was established to provide
      assist for clinicians.
