    
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) has primarily been utilized as a counseling strategy by
      therapists to counter addiction and improve lifestyle behaviors.

      This application proposes to train physicians to utilize MI to promote re-engagement in HIV
      care and to sustain retention and adherence. The study will increase the reach of the
      original pilot study and increase its generalizability, expanding the patient population to a
      wide variety of public and private clinic and hospital patients, including transgender women,
      drug users, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual men and women.
