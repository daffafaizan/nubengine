      limiting toxicity, stimulants (caffeine, methylphenidate, ephedrine, amphetamine) have been
      the primary class of agents used to counteract sedation. Modafinil is a novel stimulant that
      is FDA approved for the treatment of narcolepsy and has a very different side effect profile
      than traditional stimulants. The potential role of this agent in the treatment of opioid
      induced sedation remains undefined. This study, which utilizes a prospective, randomized,
      blinded, cross-over design, will collect daily information on sedation (Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale), pain, opioid consumption, and adverse effects in 90 patients suffering from opioid
      induced sedation within the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.
