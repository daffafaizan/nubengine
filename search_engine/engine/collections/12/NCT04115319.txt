    
      This is a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, flexible-dose study
      designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SEP-363856 (50 to 100 mg/day)
      compared with quetiapine XR (400 to 800 mg/day) in clinically stable adult subjects with
      schizophrenia. This study is projected to randomize a least 300 subjects to two treatment
      groups (SEP-363856 50 to 100 mg/day or quetiapine XR 400 to 800 mg/day) in a 2:1 ratio. Study
      drug will be taken once a day and may be taken without food or with a light meal.
