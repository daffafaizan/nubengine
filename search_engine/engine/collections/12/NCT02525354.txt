    
      Sixty young adult obese and non obese women, with, and without asthma, were studied using a
      cross-sectional design. Body composition was measured by plethysmography. A fasted blood
      sample was taken to measure: specific and total immunoglobulin (IgE) antibodies,biochemical
      markers of atopy; glucose and insulin to measure insulin sensitivity; estrogen(17β-estradiol)
      and sex hormone-binding globulin to measure estrogen status of the women; hormone-products of
      fat tissue ( leptin, adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukins
      (IL-6,IL-18), that have been associated with both obesity and immune processes involved in
      asthma and allergy. Dietary intake of omega 6: linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid(AA); and
      omega 3 fatty acids: α linolenic (ALA), eicosapentanoic (EPA) and docosahexanoic (DHA) and
      other nutrients were assessed by food frequency questionnaire.
