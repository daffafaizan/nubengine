    
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study. Patients will undergo
      screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to study drug
      administration. About 36 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups. Patients will be admitted to the clinical facility the day before dosing (Day 0) and
      will be receiving an IM injection of study drug and completing the assigned study activity
      including PK sample collection on Day 1. Patients will be discharged on Day 2 after PK
      collection. All patients will return to the clinical site at designated study days for PK
      sample collections and assigned clinical procedures. End of study evaluation will be
      completed on Day 120.

      Pharmacokinetics of the study medication will be assessed as primary outcome. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
