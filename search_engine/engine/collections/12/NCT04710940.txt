      approach to intervention development and initiate a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST)
      to learn how to maximize patient engagement and support of self-management training. In this
      pilot, study team will complete the first phase (Preparation), and initiate feasibility
      piloting of the second phase (Optimization). Completion of optimization and MOST's final
      phase (Evaluation), will occur in a subsequent project.

      In the preparation phase, Principal investigator will first analyze EHR and claims data in
      the UMCCTS data lake to identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with gaps in
      diabetes care to develop patient persona archetypes (Aim 1). Next, Principal investigator
      will selectively recruit patients of identified persona types as consultants, elicit
      stakeholder feedback during community engagement studios and conduct usability testing to
      iteratively design the intervention (Aim 2). Study team will then conduct a feasibility pilot
      (Aim 3) to assess user experience of the intervention implementation and collect exploratory
      outcome data to be used to inform a subsequent, complete optimization trial.
