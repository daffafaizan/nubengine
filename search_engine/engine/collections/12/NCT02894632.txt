      magnetic resonance (MR) images. Various methods have been proposed to compensate the
      motion-induced artefacts, including breathholding, respiratory gating and model-driven motion
      correction.

      Breath-holding is the simplest among the three. However this conventional clinical method
      induces various problem, including inefficient use of scanners, inconsistent organ position
      between each breath-hold, imaging an altered physiological status and patient inconvenience
      especially for those who suffer from respiration difficulties. Free-breathing MR acquisition
      has therefore become of great clinical interest recently.

      The investigators intend to examine the efficacy of the MARMOT sensors for:

        -  modelling and predicting the respiratory motions in abdominal scans,

        -  correcting for the respiratory motion in a cardiac cine scan, via a reconstruction-based
           method.
