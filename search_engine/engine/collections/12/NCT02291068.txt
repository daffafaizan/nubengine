      Medical Center, serving the broader Tel-Aviv municipal area. Referrals to the department will
      be screened for eligibility to participate in the study according to the study's inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria would be adjustment disorder as the referral
      cause, age ranging from 20 to 65 years old and Hebrew speaking. Patients with major
      depression, a psychotic disorder, alcohol or drug dependence will be excluded. All
      participants will sign a written informed consent. The diagnosis of adjustment disorder will
      be conÔ¨Årmed by an open clinical interview followed by a Structured Clinical Interview for
      DSM-IV SCID-IV (Shalev et al. 1994; First et al. 1995).

      Before starting the psychotherapy treatment, the patients will fill a psychological
      flexibility questionnaire (PFQ) and well-being questionnaire (MHI), in order to evaluate
      their psychological flexibility and well-being baseline. At the end of the psychotherapy
      treatment, they will fill the questionnaires again. Also, their therapists will evaluate the
      patients' levels of adjustment disorder or depression before and after the therapy.
