      reference measurement. The effectiveness of the System will be evaluated by comparison of CGM
      values to a laboratory reference, Yellow Spring Instrument (YSI), using arterialized venous
      sample measurements. Performance will be evaluated in terms of point and rate accuracy of the
      System in reference to YSI.

      The safety profile of the System will be characterized by the incidence of device-related
      Adverse Events (AEs) experienced by study subjects.
