      disease-free survival and overall survival more so than current staging conventions. This
      study will use a scoring system called 'immunoscore' to characterize the immune enviroment.
      Researchers hypothesize that the immunoscore will correlate with outcomes of colorectal
      patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
