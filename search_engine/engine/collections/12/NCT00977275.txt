           by the placement of small flexible tubes throughout the region surrounding the site of
           operation. These tubes will remain in place for 7-9 days following the surgery.

        -  The first 2-3 days, the tubes will not contain radioactivity. This time is used to do
           all the calculations necessary for treatment and to check the findings in the breast
           tissue that was removed. After 2-3 days, the tubes will be filled with a radioactive
           wire which will remain in place for the next 5 days. During this period of time,
           participants will be required to remain within the hospital. At the end of these 5 days,
           the radioactive wires and tubes will be removed.
