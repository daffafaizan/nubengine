    
      Preterm infants who remain intubated or on nasal mechanical ventilation (IMV) at 14 days
      postnatal age, meet blood gas criteria, have transcutaneous carbondioxide (TcCO2) monitoring
      with TcCO2 values that trend and correlate appropriately with PaCO2, and are not judged too
      unstable by Attending neonatologist will qualify.

      The investigators will use the data from the 96 hours of intensive multiparametric
      physiologic monitoring at 2 weeks postnatal age.

      The first 24 hours of data collection will be the baseline data. Over the next 72 hours, the
      investigators will evaluate 3 interventions in a cross-over manner with the initial
      intervention randomly assigned: Intervention 1 (24-48h of data), Intervention 2 (48-72h of
      data) and Intervention 3 (72-96h of data).
