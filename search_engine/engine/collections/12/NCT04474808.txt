    
      Since the participants are recruited during a routine visit to the outpatient clinic or the
      study center of the West German Diabetes and Health Center (WDGZ), no visits to the study
      center are necessary as part of the study.

      recruitment

        -  Check the inclusion and exclusion criteria

        -  Clarification with written confirmation

        -  Demographic data (including contact details)

        -  Completing the foot care questionnaire (week 0)

        -  Delivery of the two creams for the next six weeks

        -  Handover questionnaires for week 2, 4 and 6 including prepaid envelopes

      Study phase (6 weeks) Participants cream their feet with the study creams twice a day
      (morning and evening) over a period of six weeks. Since there is no contact with medical
      study staff during this time, undesirable study effects on the behavior of the participants
      remain minimal.

      The use of other creams or care products (except for cleaning) on the feet is not permitted
      during the study phase.

      Questionnaires Foot care questionnaires are completed after two, four, and six weeks and sent
      to the study center.
