    
      Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), also called "Familial Transthyretin-Mediated
      Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP)" is a hereditary condition caused by mutations in the TTR gene.
      It is estimated that around 10,000 people in the world are affected.

      In ATTR-PN, amyloid builds up in the nerves that detect temperature, pain, and touch.
      Patients with ATTR-PN can experience a loss of sensation, tingling, numbness, or pain in the
      hands and feet (also called peripheral neuropathy).

      In this study Eidos is researching the investigational drug AG10 800mg (2 tablets)
      administered orally twice a day. Through the study, Eidos wants to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of AG10 in patients with ATTR-PN versus placebo.

      This is an 18 month, placebo-controlled study. This means that, during the 18 month study,
      investigators conducting the research and study participants will not know whether the study
      participant is receiving AG10 or placebo.

      The primary outcome of the study is the difference between AG10 and placebo groups in the
      Modified Neurologic Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) at 18 months of treatment versus baseline.

      At the end of 18 months, participants may be eligible to receive investigational AG10, and
      there is no placebo. This is called an "open label extension." This part of the study may
      help us better understand the safety related to taking AG10 over a longer period of time.
