      infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to
      refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric
      oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory
      hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and
      clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other
      strains of coronavirus.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in
      patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2.

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients
      will be blinded to the treatment.

      Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
      and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not
      (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more
      than 24 hours.
