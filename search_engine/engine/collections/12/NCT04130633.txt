      Unit (BPRU). Participants will complete 9 acute drug administration periods in which they
      will administer THC alone, pinene alone, THC and pinene together, or placebo. Subjective drug
      effects, cognitive performance, and vital signs will be assessed following drug
      administration. Each participant will receive all 9 dose conditions in a randomized order
      using a placebo controlled within-subject crossover design. The study will help the
      investigators understand the individual and interactive effects of THC and pinene, two common
      constituents found in cannabis.
