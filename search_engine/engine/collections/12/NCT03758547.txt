      removal techniques on passive respiratory mechanics, in patients undergoing invasive
      mechanical ventilation.

      Consecutive patients will undergo 3 sequential assessments at time0 (baseline), at time1
      after the application of of 10 cycles alternating 30 cmH20 during expiration and -30 cmH20
      during exhalation and finally after a 20 sec application of a "percussion technique".

      Protocol:

      The patients will be ventilated without PEEP and sedated with a benzodiazepine infusion to
      produce complete relaxation and adaptation to the ventilator, as assessed by the complete
      absence of spontaneous efforts, so that there was no change in inspiratory flow rate, tidal
      volume, or respiratory rate during the three measurement periods.

      Airway pressure (Paw) and flow (V) will be measured continuously throughout the respiratory
      cycle with the transducer and expiratory tidal volume will obtained by electrical integration
      of the flow signal.

      Arterial blood gas specimens will be withdrawn from the radial artery and analyzed with a
      blood gas analyzer The patients will be studied in the semi recumbent position. After
      baseline measurements of respiratory mechanics will recorded under control conditions.

      Direct measurement of PEEPi will be obtained using the following method:

      After several breaths under controlled mechanical ventilation, and with the patient relaxed,
      the airway opening is occluded at the end of a tidal expiration, using the end-expiratory
      hold button incorporated in the ventilator.

      The occlusion will be then released for the mechanical lung inflation, and after a few
      breaths the airway opening will be again occluded at the end of the inflation, using the
      end-inspiratory hold button of the ventilator.

      The static compliance of the total respiratory system (Cst rs) will be corrected for the
      compliance of the ventilator tubing and the gas compression (0.8 ml/cm H20 2).

      The end-inspiratory occlusion technique also allows determination of the inspiratory
      resistive properties of the respiratory system, named R,rs min and R,rsmax, that means the
      minimal respiratory resistances (those due mainly to the airways) and maximal respiratory
      resistances (those mainly due to stress relaxation and Pendelluft)
