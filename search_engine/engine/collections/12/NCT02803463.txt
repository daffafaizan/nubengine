      operations. in literature, few reports suggested that peritoneal closure may prolong the
      operation time, may increase the costs and has a probable aggravating effect on postoperative
      pain. In addition, there have been some reports that suggest non closure of peritoneum may
      not increase the postoperative complications. The need of further studies to clarify the
      effect of peritoneal closure versus non closure on postoperative pain and life quality
      especially has been specified in some literature. The aim of this study is to compare the
      effect of peritoneal closure versus non closure over postoperative pain, early complications
      and life quality.
