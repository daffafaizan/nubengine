      efficacy of melatonin in decreasing the incidence of delirium in elderly hospitalized adults
      compared to a placebo capsule. The study will be conducted on 4 general Internal Medicine
      inpatient floors at Yale-New Haven Hospital, St. Raphael's campus.

      Within 24 hours of admission to the floor, study subjects will be approached by a member of
      the research team, and asked for informed consent. Patients that consent to participate will
      be randomized to either the treatment or the placebo arm. Each subject will be administered a
      capsule containing either placebo or 5 mg melatonin each evening at 9 p.m. The capsules will
      be prepared and administered by the Yale-New haven Hospital Investigational Drug Service. The
      capsules will be administered nightly until discharge or a maximum of 2 weeks, if the
      hospitalization is prolonged.

      Subjects will be assessed twice daily by the floor nurses for evidence of delirium using the
      Short CAM (Confusion Assessment Method), which is a validated clinical tool for identifying
      delirium, and the current standard of practice tool for the diagnosis of delirium.
