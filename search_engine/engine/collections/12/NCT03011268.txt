    
      The BIOSTOP study is a prospective, open randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study to
      compare clinical outcome of discontinuing (interventional group) compared to continuing
      (control group) biologic treatment with anti-TNF in ulcerative colitis patients in clinical
      remission.

      Adult male and female patients with an established diagnosis of ulcerative colitis treated
      for minimum one year with anti-TNF maintenance therapy and being in clinical remission during
      the last 3 months are potential study patients. Eligible patients who have given their
      informed written consent will be randomized 1:1 to either discontinue anti-TNF treatment or
      to continue anti-TNF treatment for another two years.

      Patients in the control group who are still in clinical and endoscopic remission after two
      years on continued anti-TNF treatment, will then be switched to discontinue anti-TNF
      treatment.

      End of study/follow-up is after 4 years. In order to identify the primary endpoint
      (occurrence of disease relapse), each study center will have a phone number for patients to
      call in case of symptoms suspect of increased disease activity. If a patient is experiencing
      a potential disease flare (6-point Mayo score > 1) and/or 2 consecutive calprotectin tests
      are positive (> 200 mg/kg), an unscheduled visit including recto sigmoidoscopy will be
      performed without delay to document disease status.
