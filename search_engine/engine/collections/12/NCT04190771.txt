           program NAT-FM as coadjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU) vs. TAU alone.

        -  NAT-FM combines Classical Structural Assessment (CSA) and Ecological Momentary
           Assessment (EMA) to obtain more reliable information about the dynamics of the variables
           to be evaluated, to record the affective and cognitive impact of each activity, and to
           explore its potential delivery in real-world clinical practice.

        -  The main hypothesis is that improvement on functional impairment of patients with
           fibromyalgia can be achieved by the direct intervention on mechanisms such as
           self-efficacy and pain catastrophizing.
