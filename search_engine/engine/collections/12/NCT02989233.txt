      methods on the oral hygiene levels of school children using clinical and theoretical
      findings.

      Methods: In the present study, 144 children (72 males and 72 females), whose ages ranged
      between 8-13, were divided into 12 equal experimental groups according to their ages and
      gender. They were all considered to have poor hygiene. Only one out of the three different
      education methods (brochure, model or video) was applied to each group. The percentage change
      in PI, GI, BOP and theoretical test points from the baseline to the 6th months were
      evaluated. The data was statistically analysed by using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and One-way ANOVA
      tests.
