      as the women with the following diagnoses, which puts them at increased risk for Cesarean
      hysterectomy: placenta previa, placenta accreta, vaginal trial of labor after a previous
      Cesarean delivery.

      Written, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. A blood sample will be obtained
      shortly after admission to the hospital. In women who go on to have a hysterectomy, blood
      samples will be obtained at predefined time periods (at time of decision to perform
      hysterectomy, with every clinically indicated blood draw for coagulation tests, 2 hours after
      delivery. The next patient at risk of Cesarean hysterectomy, but who does not go on to have a
      hysterectomy, will serve as a cohort control. Blood samples will be drawn at 2 hours after
      delivery for coagulation testing. Baseline samples from all other study subjects will be
      discarded and no further blood work will be obtained. The primary outcome will be the the
      level of fibrinogen at 2 hours following delivery as a marker of consumptive coagulopathy.

      Every patient at risk for hemorrhage has at least one peripheral intravenous cannula inserted
      upon admission to the Labor & Delivery Unit. A 2nd IV cannula is almost always placed,
      usually when the decision is made to proceed with a Cesarean delivery. All study subjects
      will have a 2nd IV cannula placed for drawing blood for study coagulation tests, and any
      other clinically indicated blood tests. The cannula will be connected to a stopcock with a
      "heparin lock" (cannula and stopcock are flushed with saline between aspirations) and left in
      place for 48 hours after delivery.
