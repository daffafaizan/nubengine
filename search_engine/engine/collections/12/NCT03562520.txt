      improving AF among adolescents with BD, a group for whom improvements in AF offer multiple
      parallel benefits. This project will serve as a preliminary feasibility study, a necessary
      step in the path toward a well-powered, randomized controlled trial (RCT). If exercise is to
      achieve the same status as other evidence-based treatments for adolescents with BD, it will
      be necessary to evaluate exercise with the same level of rigor as other interventions. A
      crucial first step toward the ultimate goal of an adequately powered RCT is to demonstrate
      that adolescents with BD will enroll in, and actively participate in, an intervention study
      that accurately reflects what would be required of participants in such a study.

      Objective 1: Evaluate the feasibility of developing a 24-week BCC intervention, customized
      and personalized for adolescents with BD, focusing on increasing AF.

      Objective 2: Evaluate the feasibility of implementing the 24-week BCC intervention.

      Objective 3: Evaluate the feasibility of measuring the effects of the intervention.

      Exploratory: Examine the impact on AF of a 24-week BCC intervention, customized and
      personalized for adolescents with BD. Related hypothesis-generating analyses will examine the
      impact of specific variables (e.g., mood, medications, exercise-induced feelings, specific
      BCC modules, changes in motivation and self-efficacy) on AF changes.
