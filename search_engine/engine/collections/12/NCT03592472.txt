      randomized 2:1 to receive either a combination of pazopanib plus abexinostat or pazopanib
      plus placebo. At the time of disease progression, patient treatment assignment will be
      unblinded, and those patients randomized to the pazopanib plus placebo treatment arm will
      have the option of crossing over to receive treatment with a combination of pazopanib plus
      abexinostat. After providing written informed consent, patients will be screened for study
      eligibility within 28 days before their first dose of study drug. After screening
      assessments, patients who are eligible for inclusion in the study will be randomized and
      receive their first dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), within 7 days of
      randomization. A treatment cycle is 28 days in length. Patients may continue to receive study
      drug until any of the following events: the development of IRC-verified radiographic
      progression as assessed by RECIST version 1.1, clinical disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, another discontinuation criterion is met, withdrawal of consent, or closure of the
      study by the sponsor. No maximum duration of therapy has been set.
