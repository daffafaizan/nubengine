      the circulatory system. The lymphedema seen in patients treated for head and neck cancer can
      be seen externally on the neck and face, as well as internally in the lining of the throat.
      In this study, the investigators plan to treat the external lymphedema with a device called
      the Flexitouch Plus, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      lymphedema treatment, and to measure the degree of internal lymphedema using a pressure
      sensor to detect throat muscle pressure before and after the treatment with the Flexitouch
      Plus device.
