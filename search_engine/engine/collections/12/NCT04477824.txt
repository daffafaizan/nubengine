      most common emergency surgical procedure performed worldwide (2). During the last decades,
      there has been a paradigm shift in both diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis - surgical
      treatment has changed from open to laparoscopic appendectomy (3). Acute appendicitis has
      traditionally been a clinical diagnosis, but the use of preoperative diagnostic imaging has,
      in some countries, increased dramatically (4). The use of computed tomography (CT) before
      appendectomy is in the United States up to 90%, in England 13% and in Holland almost all
      patients undergo ultrasound and/or CT before appendectomy (1).

      The use of antibiotics can be successful in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis
      verified on CT, and the use of CT has significantly lowered the negative appendectomy rate
      compared to clinical evaluation only (1). But the use of CT is inevitably inducing radiation
      and increasing lifetime risk of cancer - especially in younger patients who most frequently
      present with acute appendicitis (1,5). It is estimated that CT of the abdominal region can
      avoid 12 negative appendectomies but at the cost of one cancer death due to radiation (5). In
      Denmark surgery is still the only treatment for appendicitis, but how is appendicitis
      diagnosed? Is acute appendicitis still a clinical diagnosis?
