    
      Lefamulin is a potent, semi-synthetic antibacterial belonging to a novel class known as the
      pleuromutilins. Both the intravenous (IV) and oral dosage forms of lefamulin are under
      investigation in this study. Lefamulin's in vitro antibacterial profile includes the most
      important bacterial pathogens causing respiratory tract infection (RTI). The antibacterial
      spectrum comprises S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, the atypical respiratory
      pathogens L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae, S. aureus including MRSA and
      CA-MRSA, ß-haemolytic streptococci including S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, and Enterococcus
      faecium including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Moreover, as demonstrated in
      cross-resistance studies, lefamulin remains active against clinical isolates resistant to the
      following antimicrobial(s) (classes): macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramin B,
      oxazolidinones, tetracyclines, ß lactams, quinolones, trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole,
      mupirocin, and vancomycin.
