    
      This was an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate a titration regimen for patiromer in
      approximately 63 HF participants with CKD receiving one or more of the following:
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or
      beta blockers (BBs). This study was considered to be exploratory.

      Upon successful completion of screening evaluations (-10 to -5 days prior to enrollment), all
      eligible participants were assigned at Baseline (Day 0 visit) to an initial dose of patiromer
      (20 g/day) and spironolactone (25 mg/day).

      Study visits for enrolled participants were scheduled for Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49
      and 56. A follow-up visit occurred on Day 63.

      At selected study visits, patiromer or spironolactone doses may have been titrated. The study
      dosing algorithm was designed to maintain an individual's serum potassium value in the range
      of 4.0 - 5.1 mEq/L (based on local lab data).

      Any participant with a local laboratory serum potassium value < 3.5 or > 5.5 mEq/L on two
      consecutive scheduled study visits, despite titration of patiromer or spironolactone, were
      withdrawn from the study, permanently discontinued patiromer and spironolactone, and returned
      for a follow-up visit within 7 days.
