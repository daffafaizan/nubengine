        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml convP on hospital stay

        -  Evaluate the change of the 8-point WHO COVID19 disease severity scale on day 15 and 30

        -  Evaluate the change of the 8-point WHO COVID19 disease severity scale on day 15 in the
           subgroup of patients with a baseline neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT50) <80

        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml convP on mortality in patients admitted to the ICU

        -  Evaluate the difference in effect of convP on mortality in patients with a duration of
           symptoms < or > the median duration of symptoms in the study population

        -  Evaluate the impact of CTL and NK cell immunity on the likelihood of being protected
           from immune serum transfer
