      has tested positive for COVID-19 will be invited to enroll in the study. On Day 1 they will
      be consented and randomized to one of two arms of the study: Arm 1 will consist of a 5 day
      treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA; 1300 mg p.o. TID x 5 days) and Arm 2 will consist of a 5
      day treatment with an identical appearing placebo. All subjects will be tested using
      nasopharyngeal RNA swabs for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on Days 1 and 7. The
      primary endpoint will be conversion from a negative test for COVID-19 on Day 1, to a positive
      test on Day 7. Secondary data related to symptoms and co-morbidities will also be gathered.

      Subjects who are positive for COVID-19 on Day 1 will not be included in the primary endpoint
      analysis for this study, but will receive the same 5 days of treatment and their data used
      for secondary analyses including safety.

      All subjects in Arm 1 will also be treated with apixaban (5 mg p.o. BID x 5 days) to mitigate
      potential risks associated with hypercoagulability which have been noted in COVID-19 patients
      and which could be made worse with TXA treatment. The subjects in Arm 2 who received placebo
      in place of TXA will receive a second placebo tablet in place of apixaban.

      Patients will be consented via the existent mechanisms associated with outpatient recruitment
      for all COVID-related studies at UAB. Consent would be performed remotely. All nasopharyngeal
      swabs will be obtained through the existent mechanisms for COVID-19 testing at UAB. Follow-up
      would consist of daily phone/internet contact for 7 days unless subjects acquire symptoms
      consistent with COVID-19, in which case they will be followed until resolution of their
      symptoms or for a maximum of 30 days.
