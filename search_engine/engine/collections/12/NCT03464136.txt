    
      This study compares the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab versus adalimumab. It will consist
      of screening (within 1- 5 weeks prior to Week 0), treatment phase (Weeks 0 to 52), and
      follow-up phase (up to Week 76). The primary hypothesis is that ustekinumab is superior to
      adalimumab as measured by clinical remission after one year of treatment. Study assessments
      will include Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), video ileocolonoscopy; CD-related
      healthcare utilization; patient-reported outcomes (PROs); laboratory evaluations; biomarkers;
      review of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs); and evaluation of serum
      concentrations of study agent as well as development of antibodies to study agent. All
      participants will randomly be assigned to receive either ustekinumab or adalimumab. No
      participants will be treated with placebo only.
