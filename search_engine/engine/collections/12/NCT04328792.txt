      metastasis of lung cancer is the most common malignant disease. Benign lesions, including
      inflammation, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, also need to be differentiated for targeted
      treatment.

      EBUS multimodal image including grey scale, blood flow doppler and elastography, can be used
      as non-invasive diagnosis and supplement the pathological result, which has important
      clinical application value. This study includes two parts: retrospectively construction of
      EBUS artificial intelligence prediction model and multi-center prospectively validation of
      the prediction model. A total of 1300 LNs will be enrolled in the study.

      During the retention of videos, target LNs and peripheral vessels are examined using
      ultrasound hosts (EU-ME2, Olympus or Hi-vision Avius, Hitachi) equipped with elastography and
      doppler functions and ultrasound bronchoscopy (BF-UC260FW, Olympus or EB1970UK, Pentax).
      Multimodal image data of target LNs are collected.

      Investigators will construct artificial intelligence prediction model based on deep learning
      using images from 1000 LNs firstly, and verify the model in other 300 LNs. This model will be
      compared with traditional qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods to verify the
      diagnostic efficacy.
