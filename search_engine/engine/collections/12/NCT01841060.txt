      not operable because of their condition or respiratory problems associated with it.

      The treatment is then suggested that local radiotherapy is conventionally carried out in
      split mode for 6 weeks at a dose of 60-65 Gy irradiation mode This exposes the patient to
      complications, including post-radiation pneumonitis.

      This can be problematic in patients with respiratory failure for which surgical treatment has
      been challenged. Radiofrequency pulmonary developed as a therapeutic alternative, it has the
      advantage of being performed in a session with less toxicity in the lung parenchyma
