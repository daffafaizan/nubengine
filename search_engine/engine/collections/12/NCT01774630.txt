    
      Patients with CML included in STIM trials, stopped their treatment by imatinib because the
      signal was not detectable. In case of reappearance of this transcript Bcr-Abl, the patient
      relapses. The trial Nilo Post STIM is suggested to the patient to assess if Nilotinib can
      rescue STIM patients in molecular relapse after IM discontinuation and to provide an
      estimation about duration of CMR after nilotinib discontinuation in 2nd line therapy among
      patients experiencing 2 years of stable CMR with nilotinib.

      The treatment/strategy for this study:

        -  Screening

             -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria

             -  CML history

             -  Confirm molecular relapse after discontinuation of imatinib (quantitative RT-PCR on
                two consecutive assessments from peripheral blood samples)

        -  Treatment

           â€¢ Nilotinib 300mg BID for 2 years

             -  Premature treatment discontinuation while on study: primary or secondary resistance
                progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, AE (to be defined later).

             -  In case of unsatisfactory response: transcript stability or increase on two
                consecutive PCR: nilotinib blood monitoring, and nilotinib dose escalation up to
                400mg BID will be proposed

             -  Discontinuation at 2 years for patients who resumed confirmed CMR

        -  Follow-up while on treatment with nilotinib:

             -  Physical exam, basic laboratory parameters, monthly during the first 3 months then
                every 3 months.

             -  Centralized quantitative RT-PCR for Bcr-Abl monthly for 6 months then every 3
                months for 24 months

             -  Follow AE management guidelines for nilotinib reduction/interruptions

        -  Follow-up after nilotinib discontinuation

             -  Patients in confirmed molecular relapse

                  -  Physical exam, event collection, basic laboratory parameters (including
                     glycemic and lipid profile) every 2 months during the first year then every 3
                     months

                  -  Hematology and centralized quantitative RT-PCR monthly the first year then
                     every 3 months for 12 months

             -  Patients without confirmed molecular relapse will take another treatment (dasatinib
                for example) and will stop their follow-up in the trial
