    
      Primary objective To evaluate dose regimen for pain control in terms of rate of treatment
      failure, defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events, at 3 months

        1. Worsening in the worst pain score by at least 3 by brief pain inventory survey

        2. â‰¥ 50% increase in dose of opioid/narcotic medication

        3. Development of pathologic fracture or cord/nerve compression indicative of surgical
           intervention

        4. Unequivocal radiographic disease progression

      Secondary objectives

        1. Compare pain response/control at the treated site(s) between the two treatment regimens
           by brief pain inventory survey

        2. Assess health-related quality of life for palliative cancer care patients (EORTC
           QLQ-C15-PAL & EORTC-BM22 Mandarin Taiwan)

        3. Evaluate the analgescis use after irradiation

        4. Evaluate acute and late adverse events associated with irradiation according to CTCAE
           criteria

        5. To evaluate the local control of the treated index site(s)

        6. To evaluate the patterns of failure

        7. To evlaute overall survival

        8. To evaluate the rate of re-irradiation, salvage surgery, interventional procedure, and
           MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound at the treated site(s)
