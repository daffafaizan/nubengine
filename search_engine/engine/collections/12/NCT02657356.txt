    
      This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will study the safety, tolerability,
      and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in qualified patients with WHO Group I CTD-PAH.

      Qualified patients will be randomized 1:1 to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo to be
      administered once daily for 24 weeks. Patients randomized to placebo will remain on placebo
      throughout the study. Patients randomized to bardoxolone methyl will start at 5 mg and will
      dose-escalate to 10 mg at Week 4 unless contraindicated clinically. Dose de-escalation is
      permitted during the study if indicated clinically.

      All patients in the study will follow the same visit and assessment schedule. Following
      randomization, patients will be scheduled to be assessed in person during treatment at Weeks
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 and by telephone contact on Days 3, 10, 21, 31, 38, 84, and 140.
      Patients will also be scheduled to be assessed at an in person follow up visit at Week 28,
      four weeks after the end of treatment.
