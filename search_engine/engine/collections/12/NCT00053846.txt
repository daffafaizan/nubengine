        -  Assess the degree to which buspirone can decrease the sensation of dyspnea in patients
           with malignant disease.

        -  Estimate the incidence of dyspnea in patients seen in community oncology practice
           settings.

        -  Investigate interrelationships of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and patient report of
           dyspnea.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center (CCOP site). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning on day 7 of chemotherapy, patients receive oral buspirone once a day
           for 3 days and then twice daily for up to 28 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Dyspnea is assessed at baseline.
           Dyspnea, mood, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life are assessed within 5-7
           days before chemotherapy and immediately following therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 376 patients (188 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
