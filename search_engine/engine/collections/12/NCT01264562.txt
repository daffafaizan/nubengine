    
      Primary hypothesis:

      *The adverse effects of cancer and cancer therapy on cognitive function in breast cancer
      patients are entirely or partly mediated by stress and the ensuing dysfunction of the
      HPA-axis.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determining the effect of cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, disease-related stress, acute
           stress response, posttraumatic stress disorder, posttraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety,
           and depression on the HPA-axis in breast cancer patients

        -  Determining the effect of cognitive dysfunction assessed with neuropsychological tests,
           cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, disease-related stress, acute stress response,
           posttraumatic stress disorder, posttraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression on
           subjective cognitive function in breast cancer patients

        -  Prevalence of acute stress response, posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic
           stress symptoms, and extent of cancer-specific stress in breast cancer patients treated
           with or without chemotherapy
