      nor the participant know the treatment) placebo-controlled and multicenter (when more than 1
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to determine if
      participants with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC will benefit from the addition of apalutamide to
      AAP compared with AAP alone. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase; Treatment
      phase, and Follow-up phase. At the final analysis, the study will be unblinded. After the
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) review and the sponsor's subsequent decision
      participants will be offered to receive treatment either in the Open-Label Extension Phase or
      the Long-Term Extension Phase of study. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
