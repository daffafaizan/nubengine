        -  targeting accuracy for static targets is excellent, with an error of about 1mm,

        -  it can adjust for intra-fractional organ motion, reducing the volume of the target PTV
           and therefore the dose to surrounding organs,

        -  by using over one-hundred non-conplanar beams, the dose gradient between the prostate
           and surrounding tissues may be superior to that achieved with conventional linear
           accelerators,

        -  the radiobiology of prostate cancer may favor large dose per fractions.
