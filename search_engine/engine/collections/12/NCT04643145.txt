      smaller than 20 mm, as an alternative to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and in
      combination with percutanous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for stones larger than 20 mm. At the end
      of the operation, a ureteral drainage is put in place for the treatment of residual fragments
      and the inflammation following the ureteroscopy. It helps prevent obstructive symptoms and
      the development of strictures.

      Drainage is done either by a ureteral catheter or by a double J stent. In the literature,
      while drainage after ureteroscopy is recommended, the criteria for choosing between these two
      options are not clearly defined.

      The objective of this study will be to assess whether the type of postoperative drainage
      after URS for kidney stones can influence the perioperative outcomes and health-related
      quality of life.
