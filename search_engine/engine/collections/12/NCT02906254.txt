      patients, in particular during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Guidelines recommend
      immediate initiation of antibiotic therapy, whose optimal duration is unclear. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate early discontinuation of antibiotic treatment for
      Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) in afebrile or febrile neutropenic patients. The secondary
      objective is to describe the epidemiology of febrile neutropenia (FN) in investigator centre.

      Every episode of FN was prospectively identified. In the first phase of the study, empirical
      antibiotic therapy of FUO patients was stopped after 48 hours of apyrexia, in accordance with
      ECIL-4 (European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia) recommendations. In the second phase
      of the study, antibiotics were stopped on day 5 for all FUO patients, regardless of their
      temperature or their leukocyte count.
