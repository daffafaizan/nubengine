      activation after preconditioning by sevoflurane in subanesthetic concentrations.

      Forearm perfusion, endothelial function and leukocyte/thrombocyte activation after
      tourniquet-induced ischemia/reperfusion injury of the forearm are measured using healthy
      volunteers in a cross-over design.
