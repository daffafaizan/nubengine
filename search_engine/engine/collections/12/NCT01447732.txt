      phase, subjects will receive CEP-37250/KHK2804, administered iv, once every week. A treatment
      cycle will consists of total of four doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will enroll
      subjects with either colon cancer or pancreatic cancer to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 at a dose
      to be determined following completion of Part 1.

      All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of
      unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator
      decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of
      CEP-37250/KHK2804 therapy, the subject may continue to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 after
      discussion with the Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best
      response of at least stable disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities
      or dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).
