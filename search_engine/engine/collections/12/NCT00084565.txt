      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory
           prostate cancer treated with paclitaxel, topotecan, and estramustine.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency and number of circulating tumor cells in patients before and
           after treatment with this regimen and at disease progression.

        -  Determine the microtubule morphology, Î²-tubulin isotype pattern, apoptotic markers, and
           metaphase chromosome alignment in circulating tumor cells in patients before and after
           treatment with this regimen and at disease progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15; topotecan IV over
      30 minutes on days 2, 9, and 16; and oral estramustine twice daily on days 1 and 2 of course
      1 and on days 0-2, 7-9, and 14-16 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-38 patients will be accrued for this study.
