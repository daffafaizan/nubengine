      however, few studies have examined the theoretical constructs that drive goal-setting theory.
      To address the limitations and gaps in the literature, we designed an 8-week health behavior
      intervention for a racially and ethnically diverse sample of older adults. The primary aim of
      this study was to determine whether older adults randomized to a goal-setting intervention
      for physical activity or fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake would make significant improvements
      in physical activity or F&V intake. The secondary aim of this study was to determine whether
      participating in goal-setting interventions was associated with changes in theoretical
      constructs related to goal-setting. We hypothesized that older adults assigned to the
      physical activity condition would significantly increase metabolic minutes (MET-minutes) of
      physical activity from baseline to follow-up and that participants assigned to the F&V intake
      condition would significantly increase mean servings of F&V. In addition, we hypothesized
      that mean scores of goal specificity, difficulty, effort, commitment, persistence, barrier
      self-efficacy, and task self-efficacy would significantly increase from baseline to follow-up
      for both groups.
