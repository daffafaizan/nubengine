      and 35 subjects treated as control from January to April 2019. Research subjects were female
      who underwent brachytherapy for the first time with spinal anesthesia. The effectiveness in
      reducing pain was assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and patient movement during
      the surgery.
