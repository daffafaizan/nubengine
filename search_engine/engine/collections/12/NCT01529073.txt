    
      Main Objective To evaluate the SVR rate of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b plus RBV and NTZ in
      patients coinfected with HIV and HCV genotype 4, both never exposed to therapy against HCV or
      who failed a previous treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV, and to compare with the SVR rate
      obtained in patients with Peg-IFN plus RBV in a historical cohort.

      Secondary objectives: In naive, as well as in experienced patients:

        1. To evaluate the virological activity at weeks 4 and 12 after starting the combination of
           Peg-IFN plus RBV plus NTZ in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients.

        2. To analyze the safety of Peg-IFN plus RBV plus NTZ in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients.

      Design Single arm pilot clinical trial to evaluate safety and efficacy (phase II).

      Disease or disorder under study Coinfection with HIV and HCV genotype 4.

      Drugs under study Nitazoxanide 500 mg every 12 hours for 4 weeks followed by nitazoxanide 500
      mg every 12 hours plus pegylated interferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/kg/week and weight-adjusted
      ribavirin for 48 weeks.

      Study Population and total number of subjects Patients infected with HIV-1 with chronic HCV
      genotype 4 who meet the selection criteria.

      Number of patients included in the study: 45.
