      pancreatic head, distal bile duct or duodenum. Postoperative pancreatic fistula is the main
      contributor of severe postoperative morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Characteristics
      of the pancreatic gland like soft pancreatic consistency and small pancreatic main duct
      predispose for the postoperative fistula development. In high risk patients, the risk of
      suffering from associated postoperative morbidity is 50 percent which is considered
      unacceptable high. The aim of the current trial is to investigate whether a new anastomosing
      technique for the pancreaticojejunostomy can reduce the incidence of associated postoperative
      morbidity in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.
