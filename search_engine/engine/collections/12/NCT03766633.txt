    
      Liver volumetry has been widely used in liver surgery and living donor liver transplantation
      to estimate the future liver remnant or the required liver volume for the recipient,
      respectively.

      Liver volumetry is typically performed using CT imaging with specially designed software.
      Such manual measurements are time consuming and there is an ongoing debate whether the they
      reflect the actual liver volume when performed by radiologists or surgeons as well as
      according to the different software currently available in the market.
