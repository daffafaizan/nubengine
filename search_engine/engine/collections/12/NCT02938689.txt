      groups by randomization. Each of the group learns one of the exercises based on the lumbar
      extension or flexion for four weeks. The main outcome variables are measured and compared
      respectively in baseline, immediately after the education, 3, 6, 12, 24 months after the
      enrollment. Finally lumbar extension exercise is verified whether it is more effective than
      the lumbar flexion exercise on the pain relief and the prevention of pain recurrence in
      chronic low back pain patients.
