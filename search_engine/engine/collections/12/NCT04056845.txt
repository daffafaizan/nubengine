      and geriatric population, which poses a huge burden to our in-patient and out-patient
      orthopaedic services. Conservative treatment like physiotherapy and analgesic provide
      temporary symptomatic relief. Surgical treatment like high tibial osteotomy and knee
      arthroplasty are not without major potential surgical risks and implant-related
      complications.

      Orthotic treatment can theoretically alter the loading to the knee joint and help to reduce
      the symptoms and disease progression. Small scale biomechanical studies have demonstrated
      such effects with the use of valgus knee brace (2-4). Though prospective clinical outcome
      studies on Chinese patients in our locality are lacking.

      Valgus knee brace is a non-pharmaceutical, non-invasive option for knee pain. Using a
      three-point leverage the unloader brace is to shift the stress away from the arthritic area
      to the normal portion of the knee, maintains good alignment and stability and thus provides
      significant pain relief during daily activities. It has been commonly used as a first line
      management option in other countries.

      Our aim is to perform a prospective randomized study to look at the difference in outcome
      measures in osteoarthritic patients with the use of valgus knee brace, on top of the usual
      regime of conservative treatment.
