      epidemic, Our study will include young and middle-aged obese patients. The lockdown period is
      21 days. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups with a total follow-up time of
      6 months. One group is the telemedicine intervention group, and the other group is the
      routine follow-up control group. The intervention group used the hospital telemedicine
      management system to upload blood glucose values (fasting and 2h after three meals), food
      intake of three meals, and exercise volume (Data collection frequency: first three months, 4
      times/week; 4-6 Month, 2 times/week).Doctors will collect data from hospital telemedicine
      management system to guide patients on diets, exercise, and medication adjustments. The
      control group will be followed up by telephone/outpatient clinic every 1 week. (only
      telephone follow-up will be conducted during the lockdown period) Then doctors will collect
      their blood glucose values.(fasting and 2h after three meals) Based on the data collected,
      The doctors will provide lifestyle guidance to the patients on the telephone or face to face.
      The clinical data of the two groups of patients will be collected at baseline, 22 days, 3
      months, and 6 months respectively. (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose(FBG), blood glucose 2 hours
      after breakfast, blood pressure, Body Mass Index(BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, total
      cholesterol(TC), triglyceride(TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), Blood Urea Nitrogen(BUN), serum creatinine(Scr), e-GFR,
      Self-rating Depression Scale, frequency of hypoglycemiaï¼Œand Cost effectiveness) The clinical
      data will be statistically analyzed.
