      common cancers, annual deaths from PDA are rising. During the year 2017, it was estimated
      that 53,670 people would be diagnosed with PDA and approximately 43,090 people would die in
      the U.S. Despite recent advances, cytotoxic chemotherapy for PDA has been disappointing with
      response rates of 20-30% for the most active regimens and little activity for targeted
      therapies. Even among the small subset of patients who are suitable for surgical resection at
      the time of diagnosis, complete resection is followed by recurrence in >90% of patients
      without further systemic therapy, with a median time to recurrence of 6.9 months. Thus all
      PDA patients require systemic chemotherapy and more effective regimens are urgently needed.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug, bethanechol, could potentially be
      used in combination with surgery to decrease the chance of cancer coming back after it is
      removed. Bethanechol is a medication that is approved by the FDA and regulates the
      parasympathetic nervous system. It is used to treat dry mouth and for patients who have
      difficulty urinating. It has been used to manage the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. The
      investigators planned this study in pancreatic cancer because animal models have shown that
      treatment with bethanechol can inhibit cancer growth and spread. People with pancreatic
      cancer localized to a small area usually undergo surgery to remove the tumor. The study is
      designed to investigate that the medication is easy to tolerate and that it shows signs of
      slowing cancer cell growth.
