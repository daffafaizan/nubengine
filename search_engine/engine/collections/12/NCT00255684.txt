    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency, extent, and rate of donor (myeloid and lymphoid) engraftment in
           patients with serious hematologic malignancies treated with nonmyeloablative
           conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low-dose total-body
           irradiation followed by unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation and
           post-transplant immunosuppression comprising cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

        -  Correlate clinical and umbilical cord blood-related factors with engraftment in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine transplant-related complications, in terms of toxicity, myelosuppression,
           infections, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine treatment-related mortality of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a uncontrolled, pilot study.

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes
           daily on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -6 and undergo
           low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

        -  Unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT): After completion of
           TBI, patients undergo 1 or 2 unrelated allogeneic UCBTs on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression: Patients receive oral or IV cyclosporine daily
           beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 180 and oral or IV mycophenolate mofetil
           twice daily on days 0-30.

      Patients are followed periodically for 1 year after transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
