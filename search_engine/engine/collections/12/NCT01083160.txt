    
      This is a prospective, single-arm, post marketing observational study in adult patients with
      active RA who are discontinuing treatment due to lack of efficacy, intolerance or to an
      incomplete response with either infliximab or etanercept.

      The aim of this post-marketing observational study is to obtain data on clinical outcomes,
      compliance and tolerability to determine the effectiveness of switching from infliximab or
      etanercept to Adalimumab. In this cohort, the different treatment strategies are to be
      studied in the context of the routine clinical practice in the different participating
      places.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      To assess the effectiveness of the treatment with adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) that have failed or presented an incomplete response to current treatment with
      either infliximab or etanercept.

      Secondary objective:

      To evaluate the compliance and clinical tolerability with adalimumab

      Investigational Plan and Selection of Study Population:

      All patients belonging to any of the centres participating in the study that meet all the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be considered eligible.
