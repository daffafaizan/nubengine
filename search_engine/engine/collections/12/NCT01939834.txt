    
      The primary goal of this study is to test an Advisory/Automated Adaptive (AAA) Control
      system, which includes three interacting control modules:

        -  Module 1 - Automated Safety Supervision (SSM) responsible for prevention of
           hypoglycemia, which can be adapted (individualized) with prior data for each subject;

        -  Module 2 - Advisory Module (AM) responsible for pre-meal boluses and postprandial
           corrections, which can be adapted (individualized) with prior data for each subject;

        -  Module 3 -- Automated Basal Rate Module (BRM) responsible for augmentation of basal rate
           to compensate for changes in insulin sensitivity, particularly overnight (e.g. dawn
           phenomenon), which can be adapted with prior data for each subject.

      Daytime control (40hour studies) includes all 3 modules (n=36). Overnight only closed loop
      control (5 consecutive overnights) includes Module 1 and 3 (n=5-7).
