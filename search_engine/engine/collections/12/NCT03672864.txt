    
      A prospective, randomized controlled trial at 3 healthcare centres: Edmonton, Calgary and
      Ottawa. The period of participation for each child is 12 months. The Immediate Group will
      have 3 months of intervention and 9 months follow-up. The Delay Group will be followed for 6
      months (control period), then given the opportunity to receive the same intervention and
      followed for 3 months after the intervention.

      The intervention will be delivered by clinicians in the rehabilitation centres in partnership
      with the child's parents. Therapists will provide training 2 days a week and will coach the
      parents to provide the training at home for 2 days a week.

      The intervention will consist of child-initiated, intensive leg activities for one hour a
      day, four days a week for 12 weeks.
