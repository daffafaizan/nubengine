    
      The SEAS Follow-up Study is a 21 month extension to the base protocol (2004_050, MK0653A-043;
      NCT00092677). The main objective of the extension is to observe the incidence rates of
      cancer, total mortality, and mortality due to cancer over a 21 month follow-up period (from
      04-March 2008 to 31-December 2009) in patients from the SEAS clinical trial. The sources of
      study data will include data collected from national cancer and death registries as well as
      data from the original clinical trial. No patient visits will occur. National cancer and
      death registries exist in 5 of the 7 countries that participated in the base SEAS trial. At
      the time of Follow-up study initiation, accessing the registry data in Ireland was not
      feasible due to local regulations and Cancer and Death registries did not exist in Germany.
      As a result, data will be collected only for all SEAS patients known to be alive at the end
      of the base study originating from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and the United Kingdom.
