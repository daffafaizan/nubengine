      arthroplasty. Allogeneic RBC (red blood cell) transfusion and anaemia are related with higher
      postoperative mortality and morbidity. It is important to have a strategy of patient blood
      management.

      Hb(hemoglobin) level of 10 g/dl will be used as a cut-off value for our study. In
      postoperative period in total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, consented patients with
      postoperative anemia will be administered Ferinject® or placebo (normal saline) based on the
      results of randomization.

      Study Group: Ferinject® administration as IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection with
      a minimum administration time of 15minutes (for 1000mg(milligram) single administration) for
      body weight ≥50 Kg (kilogram) or 6 minutes (for 500mg(milligram) single administration) for
      body weight < 50Kg( kilogram) .

      Control Group: Placebo in the form of normal saline administration as same time period as
      equivalent Ferinject® administration. IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection with a
      minimum administration time of 15 minutes (200mL(milliliter) as infusion or 20mL(milliliter)
      as bolus injection) for body weight ≥50 Kg ( kilogram) or 6 minutes (100mL normal as infusion
      or 10mL(milliliter) as bolus injection) for body weight <50 Kg (kilogram).
