      LMWH (low molecular weight heparin, tinzaparin) plus DOAC (Direct Oral Anticoagulants,
      rivaroxaban) vs. DOAC alone to determine the sample size and assess feasibility for a larger
      study assessing the effectiveness of an initial 3-week lead-in course of LMWH (tinzaparin)
      compared to DOAC alone (rivaroxaban) in patients with proximal DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) at
      high risk of developing PTS (Post-Thrombotic Syndrome). PTS is a frequent, costly and
      burdensome complication of DVT, especially for patients with iliac or femoral vein DVT who
      have a high risk of developing PTS and severe PTS. Anticoagulant therapy appears to influence
      this risk, with a higher frequency of PTS in patients with DVT who receive suboptimal
      treatment with a VKA (Vitamin K Antagonist). DOAC are expected to avoid this and other
      limitations of VKA therapy and have become the standard of care for patients with DVT.
      Extended treatment of DVT with LMWH, by providing more effective anticoagulation and by
      reducing inflammation, appears to restore venous patency and reduce venous reflux compared to
      VKA and probably to DOAC. Extended treatment of DVT with LMWH, therefore, has the potential
      to reduce PTS.
