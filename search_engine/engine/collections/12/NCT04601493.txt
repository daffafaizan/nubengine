      pain treatment, the investigators will implement a pragmatic clinic-randomized trial across
      the primary care clinics of Fairview Medical Group and University of Minnesota Physicians.

      The study has two parallel components. The decision support tools to be tested will differ
      somewhat depending on whether a given patient is opioid-naïve, or whether a given patient is
      a current opioid-user. Four sets of analyses will be conducted separately: one for the
      opioid-naïve group using EHR data, one for the current opioid-user group using EHR data, one
      at the PCP-level using web survey data, and one at the PCP-level using MN Prescription Drug
      Monitoring Program (PDMP) data.
