      years from primary care, secondary care and the NIHR (National Institute for Health Research)
      Bioresource. Participants will receive a home visit from a researcher to complete a detailed
      health profile. Participants will then be invited to attend a clinical visit at Newcastle's
      Campus for Ageing and Vitality for imaging and muscle biopsy. A subsequent clinical visit
      will involve a fasting blood test, follow-up of the biopsy site and gather participants'
      views about taking part in the study.

      The aims of the study:

        1. To determine if it is acceptable and feasible to recruit adults across a range of ages
           to undergo detailed studies of skeletal muscle including biopsy

        2. To understand how lifestyle is related to the characteristics of muscle

        3. To use advances in technology (an omics approach) to identify mechanisms of sarcopenia
           and biomarkers for early diagnosis

        4. To use findings from 2 and 3 to develop new approaches to treatment and also to invite
           participants to relevant trials

        5. To secure funding for maintaining and expanding the cohort
