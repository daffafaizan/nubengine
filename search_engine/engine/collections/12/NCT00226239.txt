    
      This research study involves the use of a combination of two chemotherapies, cisplatin and
      docetaxel, which have been known to shrink head and neck cancers and are a commonly used
      treatment for this type of cancer. This combination will then be followed by radiation and
      more chemotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether this combination of chemotherapy and radiation,
      with the addition of Cetuximab, can improve control of disease and collect information on
      what side effects this combination therapy may have. In addition, biologic factors (markers)
      will be studied that may help to predict and treat head and neck cancer patients in the
      future.
