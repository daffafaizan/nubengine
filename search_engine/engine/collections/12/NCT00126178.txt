      surgically removable kidney cancer will be randomly selected post-operatively to receive
      adjuvant treatment with HSPPC-96 or no adjuvant treatment. All patients will undergo complete
      surgical removal of their tumors.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether patients who receive adjuvant
      autologous HSPPC-96 (treatment group) after surgical resection of locally advanced renal cell
      carcinoma have improved recurrence-free survival as compared to patients who are not
      receiving adjuvant treatment (observation group). Eligible patients will have a 50% chance of
      receiving adjuvant treatment with HSPPC-96. Patients in the treatment arm of the trial will
      receive the vaccine once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week until vaccine
      depletion or disease recurrence. Both groups of patients will be followed regularly for
      assessment of their disease status.

      HSPPC-96 is an investigational, immunotherapeutic agent made from an individual patient's own
      tumor, which is collected at the time of surgery. A portion of the tumor tissue is sent to
      Antigenics' manufacturing facility where it will undergo processing to create a vaccine.
