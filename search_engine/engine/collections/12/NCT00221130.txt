      forms of this. Their primary etiology is bacterial plaque, which can induce destruction of
      the periodontal apparatus. Gingivitis is inflammation of the gingival that does not result in
      clinical attachment loss. Periodontitis is inflammation of the gingival and is characterized
      by loss of connective tissue attachment and alveolar bone.

      Therapeutic approaches for periodontitis are divided into two categories: 1) anti-infective
      treatment; 2) regenerative therapy.

      Several surgical techniques have been developed to regenerate periodontal tissues including
      guided tissue regeneration, bone grafting, the use of enamel matrix derivative. However,
      these techniques are not reached for complete regeneration of the periodontium.

      This study will test the safety and efficacy of alveolous bone reproduction by the
      transplantation of mixture named periodontium injectable gel for the adult periodontitis
      patients. Injectable gel is the mixture of ex-vivo cultured mesenchymal stem stem cells,
      ex-vivo cultured osteoblast-like cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells and
      scaffold (include, platelet rich plasma, human thrombin and calcium chloride).
