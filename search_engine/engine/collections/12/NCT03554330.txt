      refractory pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the incidence of spontaneous closure is
      higher, which limits the clinical utilization of this procedure. Radiofrequency catheter
      ablation (RFA) has the potential to cause irreversible damage around the rim of fenestration
      created with BAS, which might prevent the re-adhesion of the septal remnants. In addition,
      RFA on fossae ovalis might reduce the elastic recoil of local tissue and contribute to create
      larger inter-atrial fenestration with same BAS procedure. In this study, the patients between
      18 and 60 years of age who have severe pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with right
      heart failure refractory to medical therapy or severe syncopal symptoms may be eligible for
      this study (idiopathic severe pulmonary arterial hypertension or severe pulmonary arterial
      hypertension associated with repaired congenital heart disease). These patients will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to control group, single-RFA group and double-RFA group:

        1. In control group: only BAS is carried out.

        2. In single-RFA group: after BAS procedure identical to control group, RFA is performed
           immediately around the rim of created inter-atrial fenestration.

        3. In double-RFA group: the first step is RFA on fossae ovalis; and then the other two
           steps are identical to the single-RFA group (BAS and RFA around the rim of
           fenestration).

      The immediate size of created fenestration will be determined with intra-cardiac
      echocardiography, and the patency and size of fenestration will be followed up for 12 months.
      During the period of follow up, the other evaluations will include the exercise tolerance,
      cardiac index, systemic arterial oxygen saturation and so on.
