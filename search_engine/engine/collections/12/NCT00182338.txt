      of developing premature cardiovascular disease; the reasons for this are complex. Two recent
      randomized controlled trials in peritoneal dialysis patients have demonstrated that targeting
      patients to higher dialysis clearance values is not associated with a reduction in mortality.
      It is known that patients on peritoneal dialysis are more likely to be volume expanded,
      develop left ventricular hypertrophy, and have inadequate blood pressure relative to patients
      on hemodialysis. As a result there has been increased attention on the role of fluid
      management in reducing the risk of developing congestive heart failure and other adverse
      cardiovascular events in peritoneal dialysis patients.

      Extracellular fluid volume and total body water can be accurately assessed with
      multi-frequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Estimation of volume expansion by measuring the
      natriuretic peptide N-BNP produced by cardiac tissue in response to ventricular wall stretch
      can also be used.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether volume status, as measured by BIA and N-BNP
      levels, correlates with clinical volume assessment, cardiovascular outcomes, peritoneal
      membrane transport properties and markers of inflammation such as serum albumin and
      C-reactive protein.
