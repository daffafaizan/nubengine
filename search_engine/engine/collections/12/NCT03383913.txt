      chronic pain, stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia, loneliness, helplessness, physical
      limitations and pain medication dependence. HRV-B is an interactive procedure in which
      participants relax and breathe regularly while watching a computer screen. The computer
      screen provides feedback that helps people increase their heart rate variability, which is
      the difference from beat to beat. HRV-B is a complementary, non-pharmacologic therapy that is
      now being used to see if it can help sickle cell patients reduce their symptoms of pain,
      stress, insomnia, fatigue, or depression.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either an Intervention Group or a Comparison Group.
      Each group will have about 15-20 participants. The Intervention group will receive a baseline
      assessment including symptom questionnaires, up to six weekly HRV-B training sessions lasting
      about 45 minutes each, and a follow-up assessment including symptom questionnaires. There are
      6-8 total visits for the intervention group and 2 for the control group. The Comparison Group
      will have a baseline assessment including symptom questionnaires, then six weeks with no
      training sessions, then a follow up assessment including symptom questionnaires. After the
      follow up assessment, the Comparison Group members will have the option of receiving the same
      treatment as the Intervention Group.
