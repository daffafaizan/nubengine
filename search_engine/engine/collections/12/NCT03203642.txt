      dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) will be assessed.

      The primary purpose of this study is focused on evaluating the change from baseline in
      height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      at Months 12, 18, and 24 in patients with ADPKD treated with tesevatinib or placebo.

      If eligible for the study participation, subjects will be randomly assigned to either
      investigational treatment group or placebo group. Treatment group will receive 50mg
      tesevatinib once daily for 24 months and control group will receive the placebo once daily
      for 24 months.
