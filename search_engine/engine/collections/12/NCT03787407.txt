      study. Pre-assessment includes questionnaires related to stress, emotional labor, resilience,
      sleep, etc., and includes stress-related physiological measures using HRV, 2 lead EEG. After
      the pre-evaluation, the neurofeedback-assisted mindfulness and mindfulness training group
      will have education sessions with a psychologist for 30 minutes at a time, once a week, for a
      total of 4 sessions (one month for a period). The education includes the instruction of the
      application including mindfulness training, with or without neurofeedback, and the review for
      the accomplishment of the training. Participants should follow the instruction and the
      training schedule which is arranged in advance. On the other hand, for a self-care control,
      the education sessions are not provided and self-learning materials are provided once a week.
      The purpose of the study is to find the effectiveness of mindfulness training on reduction of
      stress and severity of emotional labor. Especially, mindfulness training group with
      neurofeedback might be expected to show the highest improvement in various clinical scales
