      enrolled. After the achievement of endoscopic hemostasis, the patients are randomized to
      40-mg intravenous (i.v.) OME bolus injection every 12 h or 8-mg/h continuous i.v. infusion
      for 72 h after an 80-mg i.v. OME bolus administration. The intragastric pH is recorded for 72
      h. The CYP2C19 variant alleles (*2, *3, *17) are analyzed and the serum concentrations of OME
      and 5-hydroxyomeprazole (5-OH OME) are determined. The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori
      infection was based on the results of the rapid urease test performed on stomach mucosa
      biopsies (antrum and angle) and on the results of the stool antigen test.
