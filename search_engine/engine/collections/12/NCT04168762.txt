      currently not known how long these effects last. This is an important consideration if
      ultrasound is to be translated and advanced to clinical or therapeutic uses as this study
      will help to determine suitable ultrasound durations for efficacious use. The investigators
      will test the duration of ultrasound neuromodulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation
      which will elicit a recordable and quantifiable metric of motor cortical excitability in the
      form of a motor evoked potential.

      Participants will complete 3 study visits. During the first study visit, participants will
      complete Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography scans for TUMS localization in
      visits 2 and 3. Each participant will undergo motor cortex thresholding prior to their study
      TUMS stimulation procedure. Depending on randomization, subjects may receive one or two TUMS
      stimulation procedures at each session.
