    
      The proposed investigation is a randomized prospective evaluation of a Survivorship
      Intervention in improving the quality of care, treatment satisfaction and understanding of
      care in Latina and Caucasian breast cancer survivors treated in an urban academic medical
      center. Patients will be recruited within 6 weeks of completing their last definitive breast
      cancer therapy (radiation or chemotherapy). Patients will complete self administered baseline
      and follow-up questionnaires. Following baseline evaluation patients will be randomized to
      receiving either written information for follow-up care of cancer survivors published by the
      National Cancer Institute (Facing Forward), or the Survivorship Intervention. Patients will
      not be aware that they are participating in a randomized intervention. After verbally
      agreeing to participate they will be randomized to group A or B and will receive the
      corresponding consent. Patients will be re-assessed 3 and 6 months after enrollment.
