      Kaiser Permanente Northern California (NCKP) sites. Using existing data on healthcare
      utilization, rates of medically attended events (MAEs) of interest will be evaluated in all
      eligible Q/LAIV recipients who are vaccinated in the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern
      California Health Care Plan during the 2013-2014 influenza season. Enrollment must include a
      minimum of 10,000 children 2 through 8 years of age; based on previous utilization of FluMist
      at NCKP, enrollment is expected to include approximately 80,000 children and adults 2 to 49
      years of age.
