      inhibiting tumor angiogenesis developed by a group of Chinese scientists and clinician. It is
      expressed in E. coli which Consists of 184 amino acids. It appears to be better than NP
      chemotherapy alone in terms of efficacy in phase I/II trials for advanced NSCLC. In this
      study, a randomized, double-blind, Placebo plus NP as control, multi-center phase III trial
      was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sulijia plus NP in the treatment of
      advanced NSCLC patients. PFS (progress free survival) is the primary end-point with OS
      (overall survival), ORR (objective response), DCR (disease control rate) and safety as the
      secondary end-point. A total of 560 patients have been recruited.
