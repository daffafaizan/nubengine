    
      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the shortest dose-fractionation schedule (Dose Schedule) with acceptable grade
      ¡Ã 3 GU/GI toxicity rate for salvage HypoFx RT to maintain a constant, high BED for prostate
      cancer response while reducing the BED for late GU and GI toxicity

      To assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the recommended Dose Schedule of salvage
      HypoFx RT by demonstrating no significant change in 1-year disease specific QoL, as compared
      to baseline

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate and characterize the acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI)
      adverse effects associated with postoperative, hypofractionated radiation therapy.

      To evaluate biochemical failure rate, defined separately as nadir plus 2 ng/mL and as three
      consecutive rises in PSA, at 2 years after hypofractionated, post-prostatectomy radiation
      therapy.

      To evaluate health utilities at 1 year after HypoFx salvage RT, as measured by the EQ-5D
      instrument.

      To evaluate changes in sexual domain of EPIC quality of life instrument at 1 year after
      HypoFx salvage RT.

      To evaluate the treatment burden for patients undergoing salvage HypoFx RT, in order to
      examine whether HypoFx RT results in less burdensome treatment for patients, as measured by
      patient-reported direct and indirect (i.e., transportation) health care costs and lost
      productivity due to treatment, as evaluated by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
      Questionnaire¢-General Health (WPAI-GH).
