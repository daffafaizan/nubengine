      between the Endobronchial Coil and Control Groups. Subjects will be block randomized in a
      Treatment to Control ratio of 2:1. The randomization will be stratified by site and
      homogeneous versus heterogeneous emphysema, to support a balance of patients with differing
      heterogeneity in both the Treatment and Control Groups
