      negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Melasma is more common in patients with
      skin of color and has also been linked to chronic ultraviolet (UV) and heat exposure, family
      history and hormonal factors. There are several studies in the literature using various
      therapies for melasma, including sun protection, topical therapies, lasers and chemical
      peels. However, many of these studies vary greatly in their efficacies and side effect
      profiles, due to varying and undelineated pre and post-op procedure regimens. Side effects of
      post-inflammatory hyper and hypopigmentation and rebound are reported in these studies. The
      investigators would like to conduct a tri-split face study that compares a 22%
      trichloroacetic acid (TCA) deep medium peel with an ablative fractionated CO2 laser and more
      pigment selective Q-switched (Qs) Nd:YAG laser. To minimize possible post-procedure side
      effects and melasma rebound, the investigators will perform above treatments in conjunction
      with an optimal skincare regimen, starting 6 weeks before and continuing after the
      treatments. The investigators will perform the 22% TCA chemical peel, CO2 laser and Qs-Nd:YAG
      at 6 weeks after the start of the skincare regimen, and repeat treatments with Qs-Nd:YAG at
      weeks 8, 10, and 12. The investigators will assess participants using standardized photos in
      conjunction with UV imaging (Visia CR) at weeks 0, 6, 16, 20 and 24 (6 months), by measuring
      the modified melasma area and severity index (mMASI) scores and visual analog scale (VAS)
      scores as graded by participants as well as by blinded physicians based on photos and UV
      imaging.
