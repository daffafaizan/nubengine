      angioplasty. Recently it was reported that pretreatment with atorvastatin reduce the
      myocardial damage compared to placebo. Thus, we will evaluate the difference of pretreatment
      of pitavastatin compared to standard therapy on the reduction of myocardial damage in patient
      who is scheduled elective PCI for stable angina pectoris.
