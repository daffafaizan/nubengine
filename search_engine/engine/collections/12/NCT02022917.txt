      paclitaxel, and bevacizumab without unacceptable significant AE in patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer after neoadjuvant carboplatin/cisplatin, and paclitaxel and interval
      cytoreductive surgery, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. This study will
      also investigate progression free and to assess the quality of life.

      A Simon minimax two-stage design is employed to determine permit early stopping when a
      moderately long sequence of initial adverse events occurs. Under this two-stage design, 13
      subjects are enrolled at the first stage. If there are > 3 subjects discontinue treatment due
      to significant AE in the stage-1, then stop the trial. Otherwise, the second stage is
      implemented by including the other 14 subjects. The treatment safety will be evaluated and
      ensured by the occurrence rate of significant AE (or non AE). In stage-1, postoperative
      adjuvant cycles 2-6 will be observed for defined significant AE.

      Patients' or physicians' decision of discontinuation not because of the above-defined
      significant AEs or due to cancer progression should not be counted as an end-point event.
