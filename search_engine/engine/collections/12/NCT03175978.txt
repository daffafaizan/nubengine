      with advanced, previously treated MDS, CMML and O-AML. 765IGF-MTX at a dose of 0.20 to 2.5
      Âµequivalents per kg is administered as an IV infusion over 1.5 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 of a
      28 day cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression, as assessed after 2 cycles,
      unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Assessment of response will be confirmed by bone
      marrow studies performed at the end of cycles 2, 4, and 6 (each +/- 3 days).

      Pharmacokinetics will be performed before and for up to 24 hours after drug administration on
      days 1 (for 24 hrs) and 15 (for 24 hrs) of cycle 1. Pharmacodynamic samples will be assessed
      pre-dosing on day 1 of cycle 1, pre-dosing on days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, and pre-dosing on day
      15 of cycles 4 and 6.
