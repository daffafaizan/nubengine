      cancers worldwide. Both the absolute and relative frequency of lung cancer has risen
      dramatically. Unfortunately, lung cancer remains by far the leading cause of cancer-related
      deaths, accounting for 18% of the total number of deaths. Non Small Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      accounts for 85% of all cases of lung cancer and is further classified in several subtypes
      based on various molecular and histological features.

      The initial dose of 80 mg AZD9291 administered once daily orally in the fasted state can be
      reduced to 40 mg AZD9291 once daily under circumstances

      Single arm, open-label, phase II, multicenter study. NSCLC patients with activating EGFR
      mutations, who are under front line treatment with first generation EGFR TKIs according to
      the physicians' choice and present disease progression, will be treated with single agent
      AZD9291. The patients will be followed every 3 months for the detection of mutations (T790M),
      (C797S), (L858R), del 19 EGFR mutations as well as the mutations [(KRAS)/(NRAS), (BRAF),
      (PI3K)] in the serum/plasma, the determination of the serum levels of Hepatocyte Growth
      Factor (HGF), the presence of T790M (+) and C797S(+) CTCs as well as the molecular (c-MET)
      and (HER2 amplification) and phenotypic characterization of CTCs using the filtration
      platform (ISET). The elimination or the emergence of each of these circulating tumor
      biomarkers will be correlated with patients' clinical outcome [objective response to
      treatment (ORR), (PFS) and (OS)].

      There is no specific control group in this study. Biomarkers profile at baseline will be used
      as internal control for each patient to monitor changes throughout treatment.
