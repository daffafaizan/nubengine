      NCT02337101) from which the subjects are recruited and will separately examine the possible
      microstructural changes in the brain during recovery after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)
      in subjects with ongoing symptoms more than 2 month after mTBI in both groups from the RCT.

      Several biomarkers and brain areas has been investigated as possible sites of injury after
      mTBI. The nature of the diffuse chronic post-concussion symptoms (PCS) makes corpus callosum
      (CC), thalamus (THA) and hippocampus (HIP) interesting because of their central position and
      connection to widespread motor, sensory and cognitive processes and other brain areas. In
      most prior studies conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has failed to detect
      pathology especially in the chronic phase after mTBI. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and
      Diffusional Tensor Imaging (DTI) are more sensitive to microstructural changes and might
      serve as biomarkers in the brain after mTBI.

      We hypothesized that a change in symptoms (as measured by cognitive performance and self
      reported symptoms) will correlate with a change in microstructural changes (as measured with
      DKI) in thalamus, corpus callosum and hippocampus from baseline 2-6 month after mTBI to
      follow up 6 month after.

      Separate correlations will also be made for both treatment and control group within the
      cohort.
