      was significantly decreased in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (NAT), hard
      for pathologists to detect, and is difficult to meet the guideline that minimun of 12 lymph
      nodes should be retrived after surgery in colorectal cancer. Carbon nanoparticle (CNP) is a
      specific lymph node tracer, which only dyeing the lymph node, and can keep the lymph node in
      dyeing state in at least half year. The inverstigator attempted to compare the amount of
      lymph node yield after surgery in locally advanced rectal caner between injection CNP before
      NAT and no injection CNP before NAT. In this study, the participants with clinical TNM stage
      T3+ or N+ will be recruited. The participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to a control and
      intervention arm. The participants in the control arm will not receive injection of any kind
      lymph node tracers. The participants in the intervention arm will receive injection of CNP
      before NAT. And the specimen would be evaluated by the pathologist.
