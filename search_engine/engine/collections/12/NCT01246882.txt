      previously described and tested for short-term reliability. Three sets of triaxial
      accelerometers (Gulf Coast Data Concepts, Waveland, MS) were mailed to each site's
      coordinator. Therapists placed one sensor on each ankle before participants got out of bed
      each morning and removed them once they were in bed at the end of the day; sensor use during
      weekends was optional. A soft snap band secured each sensor proximal to the medial malleolus,
      flush against the bony tibia. Every night, sensors were plugged into a local computer to
      recharge while accelerometer data were uploaded to the central server at UCLA for secure
      storage and processing. Sensor Calibration and Data Processing In recognition of the
      variations in gait speed and stand and swing symmetry that occur in patients who need
      inpatient rehabilitation after stroke, we chose to generate individual templates of each
      participant's gait from a pair of standardized walks. On study entry participants performed
      two stopwatch- timed 10-meter walks at self-selected casual and safest fast walking speeds. A
      hybrid classifier employing dynamic time warping and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms generated
      statistical models of each participant's gait based on the two walks. Repeat walks were
      performed and the templates updated weekly for the remainder of each participant's
      rehabilitation stay to account for expected changes in gait parameters.
