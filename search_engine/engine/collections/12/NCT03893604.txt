      Healthy recreational and high level athletes will be recruited through social media and

      Each subject came twice to the Liege University Hospitals' isokinetic lab. Each session began
      with strapping the subjet into the isokinetic machine, making sure that all the settings were
      adapted to the subject. Then, each subject received either anodal tDCS, of sham tDCS. Neither
      the evaluator or the subject knew which they were receiving. Immediately following tDCS,
      there was a warmup consisting of stationary bike, and an isokinetic warmup. Then, subjects'
      endurance was using a maximal isokinetic tests, at 30 maximal concentric and eccentric
      contractions at a speed of 180Â°/s.
