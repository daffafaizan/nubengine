      recognized to be secondary to immune mechanisms. Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a
      life-threatening blood disease which can be effectively treated with immunosuppressive drug
      regimens. However, a significant minority of patients with SAA fail to respond to a single
      course of horse antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, and other patients experience
      relapse, especially on discontinuation of therapy. Pancytopenia secondary to refractory or
      relapsed aplastic anemia has a poor prognosis, with death usually resulting from infectious
      complications. Alemtuzumab (Campath ) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed
      against the CD52 protein; CD52 is expressed on all lymphocytes and monocytes. Alemtuzumab
      (Campath ) produces profound and persistent lymphopenia. The antibody has been used to treat
      a wide range of autoimmune diseases, lymphoid malignancies, and in solid organ and
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In our limited experience with alemtuzumab for the
      treatment of SAA refractory to horse antithymocyte globulin, meaningful hematologic responses
      have been observed and toxicity has been modest.

      We therefore propose a non-randomized pilot phase II study of this humanized monoclonal
      antibody in SAA relapsed or refractory to ATG. Commercially available alemtuzumab (Campath )
      will be administered at 10 mg per day subcutaneously for 10 days total.

      The primary end point of the study is the response rate at 6 months, defined as no longer
      satisfying blood count criteria for SAA.

      Relapse, robustness of the hematopoietic recovery at 3 and 6 months, 3 months responses,
      survival, and clonal evolution to myelodysplasia and acute leukemia will be secondary end
      points.
