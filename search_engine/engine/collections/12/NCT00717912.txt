      All foods that contain carbohydrates, such as starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn), desserts,
      fruits, bread, pasta, and rice, can be tested for how they affect blood sugar levels after
      being eaten. Glycemic index is assessed by having one or more people eat a specific amount of
      a single food (usually 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate) and then measuring the change in
      blood sugar levels compared with the levels achieved after they have eaten a control food
      containing the same amount of digestible carbohydrate, such as white bread or glucose. The
      average change in blood sugar levels over a set period of time relative to the levels after
      consumption of the control food, usually white bread or glucose, is the food's glycemic
      index.

      Insulinemic index is measure with the same methodology.
