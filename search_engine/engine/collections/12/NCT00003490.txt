      cyclophosphamide and vincristine after cycling myeloma cells with sargramostim (GM-CSF). II.
      Evaluate whether Labelling Index (LI) changes influenced by GM-CSF would predict a group of
      patients that will respond to this particular course specific design. III. Determine the
      toxicity of GM-CSF in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive subcutaneous injections of sargramostim (GM-CSF) once a day for 5
      days. Two to 3 days later, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30-45 minutes on day 1,
      vincristine IV bolus on day 8, and oral prednisone 4 times a day on days 1-4. Patients also
      receive subcutaneous injections of GM-CSF starting on day 2 and continuing for 10 days or
      until neutrophil count is at least 1000/mm3. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum
      of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve at least stable response receive GM-CSF 3 times a week for up to 2 years. Patients
      are followed every 3-6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued.
