      cardiovascular mortality.

      The investigators have previously shown vasodilatation and a transient fall in blood pressure
      following irradiation of human volunteers with 2 standard erythemal doses of UVA radiation.
      This was independent of vitamin D and temperature rise and correlated with a nitric oxide
      synthase independent mobilisation of NO stores from the skin to the systemic circulation.

      In this randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over double blind study, they will measure whether
      twice daily UVA administration can produce a sustained fall in BP and other cardiovascular
      risk factors in a cohort of pre-hypertensive patients.
