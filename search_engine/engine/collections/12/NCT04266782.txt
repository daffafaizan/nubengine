    
      Background: Several studies suggest an impact of physical exercise on walking parameters in
      ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD) patients.

      Objective: the present study will evaluate the impact of three months physical exercise
      training program followed by a group-long walking on motor impairment in PD.

      Methods:

      PD patients will be randomized in two arms: one group will be assessed to a training exercise
      program of three months followed by long-walking in group under the support of
      physician/physiotherapist and caregivers. A complete motor, cognitive and general assessment
      will be performed at baseline. The patients will be evaluated under supervised an
      unsupervised conditions at baseline, before the long-walking, during the walking and after 2
      months after the walk.
