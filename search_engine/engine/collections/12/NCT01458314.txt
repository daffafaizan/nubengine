      Group 1 (NIV during training + nocturnal NIV): This group of patients will use the usual NIV
      during night and will perform a rehabilitative program of at least 20 sessions of training at
      cycloergometer under NIV.

      NO INTERVENTION

      Group 2 (training in Spontaneous Breathing [SB] + nocturnal NIV): This group of patients will
      use the usual NIV during night and will be trained in a rehabilitative daily program without
      NIV. This group will be considered the "control" group.

      Sessions: 30 minutes/session, 2 times/day, 4-5 times a week for a total of 20-25 session in 3
      weeks.

      Intensity: each patient will start at 50% of each individual's maximum work capacity
      (cycloergometer) increasing up to the maximum tolerated, according to Maltais's protocol.

      NIV SETTING:

      Training: Facial mask with usual setting (Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure [IPAP] 10-15;
      Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure [EPAP] 4-6 cmH20) with a possible adjustment in agreement
      with the comfort.

      The adjustment of ventilation during training will be only within the first 3 sessions
      according to the following protocol:

      COPD patients: increase up to 3 cmH2Os of EPAP and decrease up to 3 cmH2Os of IPAP.

      Restricted patients: increase up to 3 cmH2Os of IPAP.

      Nocturnal ventilation: mask and usual setting

      The primary outcome of the study is evaluation of effort tolerance measured by 6 minutes
      Walking Test (6-min Walking Test). The hypothesis is to verify a percentage of variation
      between the two groups equal to 10% after the rehabilitative program. To get a study power of
      80% and an alpha error <5% 25 patients for group had to be enrolled.
