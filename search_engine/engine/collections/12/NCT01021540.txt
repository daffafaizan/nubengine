      Europe. It has been proven effective in treating idiopathic membranous nephropathy and other
      various diagnoses involving the kidneys. However, Synacthen is not available in the United
      States. The only preparation available is the H.P. Acthar Gel (repository corticotrophin)
      which has been widely used in the treatment of infantile spasms and has been available longer
      than Synacthen. Therefore, we are conducting this study to determine if H.P. Acthar Gel
      (repository corticotrophin) is as effective in reducing protein in the urine as seen in
      synthetic ACTH in Europe.
