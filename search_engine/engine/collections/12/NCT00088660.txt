    
      PANVAC-VF is an investigational cancer vaccine. The vaccine is based on the theory that the
      body can be taught to fight cancer by directing the immune system to attack specific targets
      found on cancer cells. These targets are called Tumor Associated Antigens, or TAA's. This
      trial will help determine if this vaccine can help fight cancer.

      All patients will be required to sign an informed consent prior to the performance of any
      study-related procedures. Patients will be screened for eligibility within 14 days prior to
      their anticipated treatment start date (Day 0). Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be centrally randomized into the study and will receive a unique patient
      identification number and a treatment assignment. The ratio of active treatment to control is
      1:1 (PANVAC-VF: best supportive care or palliative chemotherapy).
