        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete and partial) in patients with previously
           untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with oral fludarabine.

        -  Determine the molecular complete response rate in patients who achieve a clinical or
           immunophenotypic complete response when treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the progression-free and treatment-free survival of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the baseline incidence of defined genetic abnormalities in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the prognostic and predictive significance of defined genetic abnormalities in
           patients with respect to response to treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine the prognostic and predictive significance of immunophenotypic profile of
           patients with respect to response to treatment with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral fludarabine on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6-8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete
      remission after 6 courses do not receive further study therapy.

      Patients are followed at 2 months and then every 4 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
