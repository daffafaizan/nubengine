    
      -  Patients had Tcpo2 recording at the suspected limb and chest level at rest in the lying
           position.

        -  Provocative tests (leg elevation, leg lowering, oxygen inhalation) were performed to
           improve the sensitivity of tests.

        -  TcpO2 results were recorded on a 1 Hz bais for of line analysis after anonymization.

        -  We recorded age , gender, weight, height, ongoing treatments , History of cardiac or
           respiratory disease.

      Visual and mathematical analysis of the TcpO2 recording at the chest and limb level searching
      for various indices of TcpO2 variability at rest, or differences in responses between the
      chest and limb tcpO2 responses to provocative tests..
