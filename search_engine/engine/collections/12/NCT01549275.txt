      collection of specimens because it is considered safe, efficacious, accurate and cost
      effective. Our previous study from small number of patients showed that specimens obtained
      from FNA had potential to be applied for primary culture of cancer cells. This study was to
      modified our method for primary culture of both hepatocellular carcinoma cells and
      cancer-associated fibroblasts in patients with tumor measuring larger than or equal to 3cm.
      All patients received one session of aspiration for the diagnosis of hepatic tumor. The
      aspirated specimens were applied for both cytologic and pathologic examinations at first.
      After then, 10 mL 0.9% NaCl was aspirated by the same needle connected with the same syringe
      and injected into 15 mL sterilized centrifugation tube. If the tube contained visible
      specimens, these specimens were sent for primary culture.
