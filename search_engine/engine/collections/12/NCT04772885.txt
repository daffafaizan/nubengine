    
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose trial of KT-474 that will characterize the safety, PK and PD of orally
      administered KT-474 after a single dose (Part A) and after repeated dosing first in healthy
      adult volunteers (Part B) and then in patients with AD or HS (Part C). Initially, a dose
      range of KT-474 in single ascending dose (SAD) escalation cohorts will be explored in healthy
      subjects. Up to two single dose cohorts of healthy subjects is also planned to understand
      food effects (FE) on the PK of KT-474. Enrollment of healthy subjects into 2-week multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) escalation cohorts will be initiated once sufficient safety and PK data
      from multiple SAD cohorts are available to inform the safe starting dose for the 2-week MAD
      portion of the study. After the MAD portion in healthy subjects is completed, the safety, PK,
      and PD of a dose of KT-474 that was found to be safe in healthy subjects when administered
      for 2 weeks will then be evaluated in AD or HS subjects for two weeks of dosing.
