      early childhood. The surgical repair of cleft palate is very painful, and generally requires
      high doses of opioids for adequate pain control, placing children at risk for post-operative
      respiratory depression and airway obstruction. An alternative approach to post-operative
      analgesia for cleft palate repair is the placement of nerve blocks in the pterygopalatine
      fossa bilaterally, blocking the maxillary nerve and covering the entire mid-face. This
      randomized, double-blinded study will investigate the utility of maxillary nerve blockade in
      controlling post-operative pain, decreasing opioid requirements, improving post-operative
      oral food and drink intake, and decreasing hospital length-of-stay after cleft palate repair.
