    
      The EVOLVE China clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System for the treatment of
      subjects with atherosclerotic lesion(s) in native coronary arteries in China. The SYNERGY™
      Stent System (Boston Scientific Corporation [BSC Corporation], Natick, Massachusetts, United
      States) is based on the well characterized Element™ stent platform and utilizes a
      bioabsorbable poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer to deliver everolimus.

      While SYNERGY is a new generation DES, the safety and effectiveness of the Element stent
      platform in combination with everolimus in the form of the PROMUS Element stent has been
      established in the PLATINUM Clinical Trial Program.The PROMUS Element Plus stent (control
      device) uses the same stent platform as PROMUS Element stent with a modified balloon
      component on the Stent Delivery System to improve overall system deliverability. In addition,
      the previous version of the SYNERGY stent, the SYNERGY First Human Use stent (SYNERGY FHU
      stent) has been investigated in the EVOLVE FHU trial which has completed its primary endpoint
      and demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy profile of SYNERGY FHU to PROMUS Element up
      to 1-year follow-up (28). SYNERGY has been approved by CE Mark.
