      United States. It has a narrow therapeutic window, however, that represents an inherent
      limitation, such that insufficient and excessive levels of anticoagulation are associated
      with elevated risks of thrombosis and bleeding particularly frequent early in the initial
      dose-finding phase of therapy. Typically, anticoagulation is achieved through empiric dosing
      and titration with consideration of certain variables and frequent assessment of the
      international normalized ratio (INR). Despite these precautions, conventional dosing
      strategies are associated with therapeutic levels of anticoagulation only about half the time
      on treatment. Recently, genetic variants, specifically variations in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1
      genes, have been identified that affect warfarin dose requirements, prompting the expectation
      that gene-based dosing strategies may maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the
      risks associated with dosing errors. While the association between variation in these genes
      and differences in warfarin dose requirements has been identified, the specific contribution
      of allelic variation to the response to warfarin administration has not been thoroughly
      identified. The investigators therefore seek to assess the impact of allelic variation on
      warfarin dose-response relationships in a group of healthy subjects. The investigators
      hypothesize that genetic variation in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 enzymes will result in
      differences in the warfarin dose-response relationships when accounting for non-genetic
      factors that can affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin and its effect on coagulation.
