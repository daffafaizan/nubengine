      ECT in randomized trials of efficacy. However, there are currently no real-world
      effectiveness trials guided by the clinical decision making of the ECT psychiatrist as deemed
      best for the patient. The aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness of MST versus ECT in patients with MDD, and (2) Compare the cognitive adverse
      effects of MST and ECT, (3) Explore changes in SPECT that is associated with MST treatment
      and treatment response.

      Patients will be clinically assigned to either ECT (n=30) or HD-MST (n=30) twice a week.
      Efficacy will be primarily assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 (HAMD-21);
      primary cognitive side effects were assessed by Time to Reorientation (TRO) and secondarily
      cognitive battery. Brain SPECT will be done for patients before and after MST.
