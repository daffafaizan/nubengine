      hyperintensities seen on MRI in these patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) alone is not
      sufficient to provide insight into the hemodynamic status of the brain. CVR allows us to gain
      insight into the capacity of the cerebrovasculature to respond to increased CBF. Vasculopathy
      is common in SCD and the caliber of the vessels can be assessed with 4D Flow MRI in response
      to actue and chronic changes in the velocity and wall shear stress on the intracranial
      arteries in the Circle of Willis.

      This study will be performed as a single center, patient-control, cross-sectional,
      observational study in patients with steady-state SCD and controls. The investigators expect
      that patients with impaired CVR will have a greater number and/or volume of SCIs.
