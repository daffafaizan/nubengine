      to gain benefit from local radiotherapy to the prostate. The internationally accepted
      fractionation schedule is 3 Gy (Gray) x 19-20 over a course of 4 weeks.

      There is continous evidence for even more hypo-fractionated radiotherapy with higher
      fractionation doses. We will test if the schedule of 6.1Gy x 6 compares to standard of 3 Gy x
      19 with regard to patient reported side-effects.
