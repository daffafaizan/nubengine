        -  Determine the relationship between estimated absorbed dose of iodine I 131 and tumor
           response or normal organ toxicity for different dosimetric measures, using data derived
           from clinical radionuclide therapy studies in patients with thyroid cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dosimetric iodine I 131 (^131I) on day 2 and then undergo
      nuclear medicine imaging at 0.5-4 hours, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosimetric ^131I.
      Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT scans are performed at 0.5-4 hours and
      24 or 48 hours over the head and neck region, including the salivary glands. Subsequent
      SPECT/CT scans are performed over the candidate tumor sites. Patients undergo ^131I therapy
      on day 11.

      Saliva is collected on days 1 and 2, weeks 2 and 4, and months 3 and 6 to measure saliva flow
      rate. Blood is collected at baseline and periodically during study to measure FLT3 ligand
      levels.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study.
