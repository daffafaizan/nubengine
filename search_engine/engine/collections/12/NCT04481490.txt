    
      Participants enrolled in either home-based or center-based cardiac rehabilitation will be
      instructed to wear an accelerometer device for 7-days at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and
      12-weeks, to objectively measure their physical activity level during the cardiac
      rehabilitation program. A questionnaire will also be completed by the participant at baseline
      and 12-weeks to subjectively measure their physical activity level, based on self-report
      activities over the previous 7-days.

      Enrollment in home-based versus center-based cardiac rehabilitation will be based on the
      availability of cardiac rehabilitation facilities and/or patient preference. There is no
      random allocation or assignment to groups by the study team.
