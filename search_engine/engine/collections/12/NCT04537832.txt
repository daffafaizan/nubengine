      neurodevelopmental, motor and behavioral characteristics of SCN1A-positive Dravet Syndrome in
      children aged 6 to 60 months (at baseline) with SCN1A mutations. The study will examine these
      characteristics over 2 years using standardized assessments and will also explore the impact
      of the disease on parents/caregivers and health care resource utilization (HCRU).
