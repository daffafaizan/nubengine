      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with previously treated persistent, recurrent,
           or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with gemcitabine and
           docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses of therapy
      beyond documentation of CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-41 patients will be accrued within 42-49 months.
