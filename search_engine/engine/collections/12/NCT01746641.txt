      safe alternative for the management of discomfort of patients undergoing endoscopic
      gastrointestinal procedures. However, what medication from those available for TCI would be
      the most appropriate is not known.

      Sixty-nine patients requiring a gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure were randomly assigned
      to receive a TCI effect site (e) of remifentanil (n=30) or propofol (n=39). The primary
      outcome was patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included gastroenterologist
      satisfaction, the proportion of adverse events between the two groups were compared
      (occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, mild respiratory depression, major respiratory
      depression, bradycardia, hypotension, pain, nausea or vomiting, and lack of amnesia), and the
      level of consciousness.
