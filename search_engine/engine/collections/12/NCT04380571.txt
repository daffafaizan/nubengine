      range of non-invasive therapeutic approaches like Kegel exercise, Biofeedback, and posterior
      tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). However, up till now, there are no established guidelines
      for treatment.1 The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the early effect of
      Biofeedback therapy versus bilateral transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation
      (TPTNS) as non-invasive methods in the treatment of (FNRFI) in children.

      Methodology: The current prospective randomized controlled study included 93 children with
      FNRFI who were randomly divided and allocated into three groups. Group A treated by
      conventional methods through dietetic regulation and Kegal exercises. Group B treated by
      biofeedback therapy while group C received bilateral (TPTNS). Initial manometric findings
      including resting pressure, squeeze pressure, 1st sensation, 1st urge, and intense urge were
      recorded and repeated after 3 and 6 months together with incontinence score recorded in using
      St' Mark's (Varizey) with the primary endpoint of improvement of the incontinence score more
      than 50%.
