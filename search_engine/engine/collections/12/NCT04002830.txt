      the progressive neurologic involvement, somatic disease manifestations, especially
      splenomegaly and resulting cytopenia, contribute to significant mortality and morbidity . The
      effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on patients with Type 1 GD have been clearly
      documented and have a beneficial effect on visceral and hematologic disease parameters . It
      is known that recombinant enzyme does not pass the blood-brain barrier and has no effect on
      neurologic involvement . Probably due to the rarity of Type 3 GD, information on the somatic
      effects of ERT is largely limited to case reports or single-center series. There are also few
      reviews of cohorts but the clinical subtype, age, genotype, ERT dosage, accompanying
      therapies, and treatment response vary widely among patients in these cohorts. This
      prospective study aims to objectively evaluate the hematologic and visceral effects of ERT
      with taliglucerase alfa on a rather clinically and genetically homogenous group of
      treatment-na√Øve patients with Type 3 GD . For the purposes of this study, subjects receiving
      no Gaucher-specific medications for at least 12 months will be considered "untreated". The
      results of this study are expected to provide a more objective view of the degree of response
      of this patient type, and potentially create new areas of research.
