      underserved population in oncology. AYA engagement in ongoing disease management is
      compromised by lack of awareness of their continued health vulnerabilities and need for
      continued care, their desire to be "normal" and remove themselves from the cancer experience,
      and lack of AYA-appropriate support and services. Thus, AYA with cancer, especially those
      completing active treatment, are extremely vulnerable and in need of support to maintain
      remission and assure optimal health into adulthood. To address the immediate need for
      innovative interventions targeting AYA completing cancer treatment, the proposed study will
      test the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a tailored text messaging intervention
      for AYA transitioning off active treatment called THRIVE (Texting Health Resources to Inform,
      motiVate, and Engage).

      A pilot randomized controlled trial testing the acceptability and feasibility (primary) and
      initial efficacy (secondary) of a health promoting mobile health texting intervention with
      AYA transitioning off active cancer treatment to follow-up care.

      The intervention compares a texting intervention to a receipt of an AYA survivorship
      handbook. Acceptability and feasibility are primary outcomes. Efficacy outcomes include
      measures of knowledge, healthcare utilization, adherence, engagement in care, and
      psychosocial well-being measures.
