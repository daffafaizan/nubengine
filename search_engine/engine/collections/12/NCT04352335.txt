      molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In this retrospective study, we will observe
      the change in NLR and explore its possible association with survival among advanced lung
      cancer patients receiving Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with and without such
      immuno-modulator, Astragalus Polysaccharide Injection. It can be used to understand the
      relationship between NLR values and the survival rate of lung cancer patients after ICIs
      treatment. Physicians can refer to this result to give patients the suitable treatment
      recommendations.
