    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      1. To compare the rate of disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year post hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) in patients undergoing HSCT treated on this successor Thomas Jefferson
      University (TJU) 2 Step reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) haploidentical regimen and
      compare it with that of the initial 2 Step RIC regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the 100 day regimen-related mortality (RRM) in patients undergoing HSCT on
           this treatment protocol.

        2. To determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients
           undergoing treatment on this regimen.

        3. To evaluate engraftment rates and lymphoid reconstitution in patients treated on this
           trial.

        4. To assess overall survival at 1 and 3 years past HSCT in patients treated on this trial.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV)
      over 60 minutes on days -15 to -12, thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -15 to -13, donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6, and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.
      Patients also undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) on day -10.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day
      0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV on days -1 to 42 followed by taper and
      mycophenolate mofetil IV twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
