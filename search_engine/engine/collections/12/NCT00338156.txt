      symptoms of heart failure and/or evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. The trial was
      terminated in 2002 and the results of the main trial have been published. In this trial, a
      collagen and neurohumoral substudy was performed to assess the importance of collagen
      turnover in this population. A total of 235 patients were included from 18 centres. Blood was
      taken at randomisation, 1 month, 1 year and 2 years.

      The present study will recruit surviving patients among the 119 individuals that were
      randomised to the neurohumoral substudy at the Stavanger University Hospital. The study will
      assess the relationship between collagen turnover, neurohormonal activation, scarring and
      left ventricle remodelling in these patients about 3 years following the index myocardial
      infarction.

      The data collected at the 3-year follow-up visit will be compared to data from the initial
      study.
