      prevalence and incidence (e.g., up to 30% each year in Canada, regardless the cognitive
      status of fallers), 2) They negatively impact an individual's health condition (e.g., hip
      fracture) and quality of life (e.g., social withdraw), and 3) They impose a high financial
      burden on the Canadian health care system (e.g., $2 billion per year). Major neurocognitive
      disorders are strongly associated with falls and their adverse outcomes. There is a greater
      risk for falls and fall-related injuries in cognitively impaired individuals, more than
      doubled compared to cognitively healthy individuals (CHI). The nature of the interactions
      between neurocognitive disorders and the other risk factors for falls and fall-related
      injuries are still a matter of debate. For instance, the presence of specific patterns (i.e.,
      types and combinations) of risk factors for falls and fall-related injuries associated with
      neurocognitive disorders at their onset (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and mild
      dementia) compared to CHI is questioned. Recently, the investigators howed that the
      identification of risk factors for falls is influenced by the method of data analysis used.
      The investigators demonstrated that emerging modeling techniques such as artificial neural
      networks (ANNs) improve the performance criteria of fall prediction compared to classical
      linear models. Other methods such as Factor Mixture Models (FMMs) may also be helpful in
      identification of patterns of risk factors for falls and fall-related injuries associated
      with neurocognitive disorders. Using baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on
      Aging (CLSA), the investigator will examine the patterns (i.e., types and combinations) of
      risk factors for falls and fall-related injuries associated with neurocognitive disorders at
      their onset by 1) Examining the epidemiology of falls and fall-related injuries, and 2)
      Modeling and comparing the associations of risk for falls and fall-related injuries between
      cognitively healthy and impaired (i.e., MCI and mild dementia) older adults participating in
      the CLSA.
