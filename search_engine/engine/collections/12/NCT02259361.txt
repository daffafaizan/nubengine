      potassium channels on demyelinated neurons, allows normal electrical conduction.

      Dalfampridine has recently been found to be associated with improvements in visual function,
      strength, ambulation, fatigue, and endurance in individuals with MS.

      Although this medication has a widespread effect, its influence on upper extremity function
      has never been investigated in a double blind randomized case control study.

      Following the fact that during the disease course, approximately 3 out of 4 multiple
      sclerosis patients encounter upper limb dysfunction the primary objective of this study will
      be to investigate the efficacy of sustained-release oral dalfampridine on upper extremity
      function in patients with MS.
