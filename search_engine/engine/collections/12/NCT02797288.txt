      fecal transplantation. Follow-up biopsies will be obtained from the sigmoid colon during
      convalescence 60 days after fecal transplant for subjects who agree to return for optional 60
      day follow-up. Biopsies taken for research purposes at each colonoscopy will be analyzed for:
      cytokines and chemokines, gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry and high dimensional
      flow-cytometry.
