        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with megestrol vs placebo.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral megestrol twice daily for 1 year.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo twice daily for 1 year. Quality of life is
           assessed at baseline and then monthly for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 300 patients (200 for arm I and 100 for arm II) will be
      accrued for this study.
