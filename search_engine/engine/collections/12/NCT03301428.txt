    
      This trial aims at comparing the effectiveness of different didactic tools (an educational
      website vs a booklet) developed for patients with chronic pain to correct misbeliefs and
      improve disability in patients with chronic low back pain.

      Participants of the 2 experimental groups will be invited to use the tool they receive during
      a one-month period.
