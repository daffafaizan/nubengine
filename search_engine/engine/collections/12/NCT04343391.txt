      countries. So-called "emotional disorders" and their mostly pharmacological treatment are, in
      no small part, responsible for this situation. However, research indicates that psychological
      treatment should be the first step when caring for these types of problems. The investigators
      expect that the results show that brief psychological therapies are more effective than
      pharmacological interventions. Moreover, it is expected that brief individual psychotherpay
      approach delivered in secondary care is more effective than brief group psychotherapy
      delivered in primary care.
