      topically applied SD-101-6.0 in participants with simplex, recessive dystrophic, and
      junctional non-Herlitz EB. SD-101-6.0 was applied topically once a day to the entire body.
      The planned duration of treatment with SD-101-6.0 for Study SD-006 was up to 48 months, with
      a safety follow-up period of 30 days; however, the study was terminated early by the sponsor.
      The maximum study duration completed by at least 1 participant, treatment and safety
      follow-up, was 37 months.

      Participants who successfully completed Study SD-005 had the option to rollover into Study
      SD-006. The screening/baseline visit (Visit 1) occurred at Visit 5 (approximately 90 days
      from baseline) of Study SD-005. The Body Surface Area (BSA) assessments of lesional skin and
      wound burden performed at Visit 5 (approximately 90 days from baseline) for Study SD-005 were
      utilized as the baseline assessments for Study SD-006. Participants returned for follow-up
      visits at Month 1 then every 3 months.

      At each visit, assessments included BSA of lesional skin and wound burden. For target wounds
      that are not closed by the end of Study SD-005, the ARANZ picture and calculation of target
      wound area at the final visit for Study SD-005 was used as the baseline area size of the
      target wound for Study SD-006. These unhealed target wounds from Study SD-005 were assessed
      via ARANZ SilhouetteStarâ„¢ at each subsequent scheduled visit until the target wound was
      documented as closed. Closed wounds were assessed for scarring.
