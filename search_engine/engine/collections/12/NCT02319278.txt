      superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIOs) that are taken up by macrophages.
      Concentration of USPIOs within macrophages changes the tissue relaxation properties and this
      can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging using R2* maps. In a recent early
      proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that macrophages could be detected with USPIOs in the
      penumbra and infarct zone of the myocardium in patients with a recent myocardial infarction.
      The investigators therefore wish to establish whether USPIOs can be used to identify cellular
      inflammation within the myocardium in three distinct clinical conditions that currently lack
      a non-invasive diagnostic imaging test: cardiac allograft rejection, viral myocarditis and
      cardiac sarcoidosis. If successful, this would not only provide a useful diagnostic test but
      would also be a method of monitoring disease progression or response to therapy.
