      a diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer are randomized to receive either 20 mg of melatonin
      nightly or an identically matched placebo. All patients will be followed for two years with
      primary outcomes assessed at a two year time point and secondary outcomes evaluated
      throughout the course of the trial.
