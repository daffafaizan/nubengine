      A 12-week single-blind randomised control design pilot study. 100 participants aged 18-69
      years or above with proven stabilized acute coronary heart disease, physical inactive and
      having own smartphone with adequate internet technology literacy to operate the smartphone
      app and able to read and understand Chinese were recruited from the outpatient Cardiac Clinic
      in 3 hospitals.

      The intervention group will be asked to practise ZTE either using the smartphone app or a
      zerotime exercise booklet with a focus on exercise adherence to at least 20-30 minutes per
      day, and on most and preferably all days of the week. The control group (CON) were asked to
      do deep breathing exercise at least 20 minutes daily. The exercise adherence of 25
      participants in each EXP and CON groups are measured by activity trackers.

      A mobile electronic whatsapp message was used as an anti- inertia reminder (AIR) to promote
      ZTE adherence. We used pictures with simple exercises to remind the participants in
      intervention group (EXP) to do ZTE regularly. Whatsapp reminders on deep breathing exercises
      are sent to CON. The frequency, format, whatsapp feedback and response to enquiry are the
      same as for EXP.
