      difficulties with sleep and our current research confirms this, indicating that chronic
      community dwelling stroke survivors experience poorer self-reported and objective sleep
      quality than age matched healthy controls.

      "Sleepio" is an online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) programme. The
      efficacy of this intervention has been demonstrated in people with chronic insomnia but has
      not yet been tested in people with stroke. The study therefore aims to determine whether
      digital CBT-I is effective for improving sleep quality in chronic stroke survivors.
      Participants will be randomised to receive either digital (online) CBT-I or a leaflet with
      sleep hygiene information. The primary outcome is the change in self-reported sleep quality,
      assessed using the Sleep Condition Indicator. Secondary outcomes include changes in sleep
      fragmentation and wake after sleep onset assessed with actigraphy, self-reported sleep onset
      latency from the sleep diaries, anxiety and depression using the PHQ9 and GAD7, quality of
      life using the SIS-8 and EQ-5D-5L as well as changes in healthcare costs during the 8 week
      follow up.
