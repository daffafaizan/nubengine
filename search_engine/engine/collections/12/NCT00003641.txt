      Primary Objective:

        -  Compare the effect of high-dose interferon alfa-2b treatment on the relapse-free
           survival of patients with stage II or III resected malignant melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Compare the effect of this treatment regimen on overall survival of these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of treatment on quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by pathologic lymph node status
      (known vs unknown),lymph node staging procedures(sentinel lymph node procedure vs. elective
      lymph node dissection vs. no lymphadenectomy), Breslow depth (<= 1.0 mm vs. 1.01-2.0 mm vs.
      2.01-4.0 mm vs > 4.0 mm), ulceration of the primary lesion (yes vs. no vs. unknown), and
      disease stage (lymph node positive [N1, N2a] vs. lymph node negative [N0]). Patients are
      randomized into one of two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio.

        -  Arm I (observation): Patients undergo observation for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II (Interferon Alfa-2b): Patients receive high-dose interferon alfa-2b intravenously
           (IV) over 20 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days. Treatment repeats weekly for 4 weeks
           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, at day 22, every 3 months for 2 years, and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter until 15 years after randomization.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,420 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.
