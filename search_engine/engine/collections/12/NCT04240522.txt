    
      Primary Objetive:

      In the planned project, the main objective is to identify endogenous (e.g. immunological and
      molecular factors) and exogenous factors (e.g. environmental, socioeconomic and microbial
      factors) that influence the course and remission of AD. More specifically to identify factors
      that are significantly different between patients that have or do not have remission from AD.

      Secondary Objective:

      (i) To identify endogenous and exogenous factors such as immunological, molecular and
      microbial factors to separate subgroups of patients (endotypes) with distinct local and
      systemic inflammatory responses.

      (ii) To identify potential biomarkers predicting the individual clinical course of AD and
      other atopic diseases including asthma, food allergy and allergic rhinitis.
