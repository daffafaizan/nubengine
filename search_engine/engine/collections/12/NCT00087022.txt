      Primary

        -  Evaluate the disease-free and overall survival of patients with primary clear cell renal
           cell carcinoma at high risk for recurrence treated with chimeric monoclonal antibody
           cG250 (WX-G250) vs placebo in an adjuvant setting.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Perform pharmacokinetic analysis of WX-G250.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to risk criteria and participating centers (US vs Non-US). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal chimeric antibody cG250 (WX-G250) IV over 15 minutes
           once weekly for 24 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo IV over 15 minutes once weekly for 24 weeks. In both
           arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic analysis.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 12 and 24 during treatment, and then at 6
      months after completion of study treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months during years 1 and 2, every 6 months during years 3 and
      4, and then annually during year 5 and thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 864 patients out of the expected 856 (428 per treatment arm)
      were accrued for this trial.
