      I. Evaluate the tolerability of disulfiram and arsenic trioxide administration as a
      therapeutic combination. (Phase IB)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. Determine the response rate (complete and partial responses) and time to progression of
      previously treated patients with metastatic malignant melanoma when treated with disulfiram
      plus Arsenic Trioxide. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.

      Patients receive disulfiram orally (PO) twice daily and arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV)
      over 1-2 hours on Monday through Friday, alternating two weeks on treatment followed by two
      weeks off treatment. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
