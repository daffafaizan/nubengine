    
      This study is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, triple-cohort study. For the
      Fenestrated-CMD cohort a total of 250 patients will be enrolled. For the type I-III
      thoracoabdominal cohort, a total of 200 patients will be enrolled. For the Arch cohort, 10
      patients will be enrolled. CMDs will be used primarily. Off-the-shelf devices will be used in
      urgent cases and when the waiting period for design and manufacturing of a CMD may not be
      considered acceptable. Staged endovascular repair will be used for type I, II and III TAAAs
      and for concurrent arch and TAAAs, unless the condition of the patient requires a single
      stage endovascular repair. A separate subgroup analysis of patients undergoing procedures
      with off-the-shelf devices will be performed.
