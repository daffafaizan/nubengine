    
      Phase 1 - Preparation: Each participating site begins to organize itself for the project.
      Baseline data will be collected and will be used to benchmark where each site is relative to
      blood pressure control/management of persons with diabetes prior to the implementation of the
      training programs.

      Phase 2 - Implementation: Sites begin to address the gaps they have identified that affect
      blood pressure outcomes of patients with diabetes. IDC provides two on-site training programs
      for providers and support staff.

      Phase 3 - Follow-up: IDC provides on-going support to each site via individual and
      collaborative conference calls and resources on the project Web site. Patient and visit data
      (audit form) will be collected six and 12 months after training. This data will be compared
      to the site's pre-training data.
