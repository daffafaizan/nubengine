      treating vitiligo and other conditions with depigmented skin. MKTP involves the
      transplantation of melanocytes and keratinocytes from normal skin onto the depigmented skin
      in order to repigment the skin.

      Both dermabrasion and carbon dioxide lasers have been used effectively in MKTP to denude the
      epithelium. This study will compare the efficacy of these two techniques.

      The study will also compare the efficacy of two different dressings used in MKTP, vaseline
      impregnated gauze and collagen dressings.
