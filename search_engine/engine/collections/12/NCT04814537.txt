      estimate the dose of bupivacaine required to achieve initial effective comfort in 90% of
      patients (ED90) via the epidural (DPE or EPL) technique in women undergoing labor induction
      or augmentation; we hypothesize that we will be able to determine the ED90 of bupivacaine for
      each technique with adequate precision to inform the optimal doses.
