      calls patient-centredness as an independent outcome indicator to evaluate quality of
      healthcare. Nevertheless, within fertility care there is great variation in the delivery of
      patient-centred care and room for improvement.

      The effects of a multifaceted approach on patient centredness and quality of life will be
      determined by a baseline and after measurement. Three questionnaires will be used to measure
      patient centredness (Patient Centredness Questionnaire-Infertility), Quality of Life
      (FertiQoL) and risk factors of emotional maladjustment(SCREENIVF). The multifaceted approach
      consists of: 1)audit and feedback, 2) educational outreach visits, and 3) patient-mediated
      interventions.

      During one year the multifaceted approach is performed followed by an after measurement with
      the same questionnaires. The effects and costs of the multifaceted approach will be
      determined. Process evaluation will be performed to investigate feasibility and to study
      wether and to what extend patients and professionals used and appreciated the elements of the
      multifaceted approach.
