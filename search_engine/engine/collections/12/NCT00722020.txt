      years of age hospitalized with a diagnosis of asthma or reactive airway disease and admitted
      to the pediatric intensive care unit. Upon receiving informed consent, patients were treated
      with HFCWO therapy via the VEST. The primary endpoint was time to readiness for discharge,
      lack of need for continued supportive care (e.g., intravenous fluid or oxygen), and
      bronchodilator treatments spaced at least four hours apart.
