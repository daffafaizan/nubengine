      impaired in neuropathies,especially length-dependent ones. Sweating dysfunction has been
      shown in several neurological peripheral disorders and it has been suggested that sweating
      function should be included among the diagnostic tests for the early detection of autonomic
      neuropathies. Several methods have been developed, but the lack of easy and quick tests to
      diagnose sweating dysfunction has restricted widespread use in clinical practice. Measurement
      of electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) using Sudoscan® is a new method for quick,
      non-invasive and quantitative assessment of sweating. This technique has demonstrated its
      usefulness in detecting autonomic and small fiber neuropathy, especially in diabetic
      patients.The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the laboratory battery of
      CV tests and of sweating dysfunction by Sudoscan®, alone or in combination, to differentiate
      MSA-P from PD. Among the CV tests, the present study particularly looked at those tests
      already recommended as screening bedside tests in diabetic patients (HR variations with deep
      breathing and BP variations during stand test) ; these tests are rapid and easy to perform.
      HR variations with deep breathing depend on parasympathetic tone and BP variations depend on
      vasomotor sympathetic response.
