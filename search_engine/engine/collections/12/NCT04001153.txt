    
      This is a prospective observational cohort study involving children undergoing treatment at
      Dundee Dental Hospital & School. The study involves taking additional measurements of
      children who have already had treatment planned that includes a HTPMC (having a crown placed
      over a decayed tooth).

      There will be no interventions or invasive procedures as part of this study. As an additional
      procedure, specific to this study (not included in the standard care), participants will have
      dental impressions taken to compare pre and post HTPMC placement (right after the treatment
      and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks follow-up) state of their mouths. Dental impressions are a
      routine procedure that children regularly undergo for orthodontic treatment or to make mouth
      guards for sports.

      Children having a HTPMC fitted would not have a dental impression taken before and after the
      HTPMC placement or at subsequent appointments as part of standard care.

      Since the aim is to track the changes that happen in children's mouth, the investigators are
      going to use these extra procedures of taking dental impressions to analyse digitally (by
      making a 3D scan of the stone study models). This will allow us to see how long it takes for
      the children's vertical dimension to come back to its pre-treatment state and what the
      changes are that happen in their mouth after the placement of a HTPMC.
