      essential role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and has anti-inflammatory,
      anti-oxidative, and anti-thrombotic actions in the body. However, studies have shown that
      higher HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are not always cardioprotective, and that the
      functionality of the HDL molecule is critical for cardioprotection.

      The HDL molecule is associated with many proteins (the HDL proteome) such as apolipoprotein
      A-one (apoA-I) and paraoxonase (PON) which are critical for its function. These proteins can
      be the target of oxidative damage which negatively impacts HDL functionality. Loss of HDL
      function leads to impaired RCT and the build of cholesterol within the vasculature with an
      increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque development. Gain of HDL dysfunction leads to HDL
      acting as a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant molecule, further increasing cardiovascular
      risk.

      Several dietary ingredients have been shown to support various aspects of HDL function and
      the HDL proteome. Examples include pomegranate juice and extract, lycopene, and quercetin.

      Nutritional supplements are routinely purchased by consumers with suboptimal HDL to support
      their health, lifestyle and overall quality of life. Many such products receive minimal
      evaluation prior to marketing. As part of the investigator's commitment to safe and
      beneficial formulating of nutritional supplements, an evaluation of both the safety,
      tolerance and acceptability as well as the potential for positive impact on quality of life,
      this study aims to collect information on relevant outcomes related to quality of life and
      recovery, with a view to understanding potential for benefit and areas for larger research
      focus.
