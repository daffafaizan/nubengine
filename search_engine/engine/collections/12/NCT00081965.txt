    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether acupuncture, compared to placebo, reduces the incidence of hot flashes
           in women with breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the long-term effects of acupuncture on hot flashes.

      OUTLINE: This a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to concurrent treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators,
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, or aromatase inhibitors (yes vs no), concurrent use
      of hot flash medication or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (yes vs no),
      baseline hot flash frequency (> 7 per day), and menopausal status at diagnosis (premenopausal
      vs postmenopausal). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (treatment): Patients receive 8 acupuncture treatments over 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive 8 placebo acupuncture treatments over 4 weeks.
           Beginning at week 7, patients are offered 8 true acupuncture treatments over 4 weeks.

      Patients in both arms complete a "hot flash" diary for 1 week before treatment and then
      periodically during and after treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
