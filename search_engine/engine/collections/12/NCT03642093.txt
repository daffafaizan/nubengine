      lean muscle mass, which can be best categorized as frailty. Frailty affects global health,
      the ability to carry out normal functions, and even the ability to tolerate targeted curative
      treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The Investigators evaluate frailty,
      and design a study to evaluate the outcomes of the administration of multimodal preoperative
      prehabilitation programs on those frailty markers. Previous data provides support for
      interventions that include:

        1. Improved protein rich nutrition with specific immunonutrition recommendations,

        2. Treatment of maldigestion or pancreatic insufficiency in pancreatic, gastric, or
           esophageal cancer patients,

        3. Brief, evidence-based activity interventions such as walking and inspiratory muscle
           training (IMT), and

        4. Disease specific education

      These interventions should improve frailty by maintaining or regaining weight, improved grip
      strength, and improved prealbumin. These markers indicate improvements in nutritional status,
      increased strength and ability to ambulate, and improved functional status in the
      preoperative period. Other outcomes that will be reported include fat-soluble vitamin levels,
      global health, and inflammation.

      The preoperative period is the best time to facilitate patient engagement through self-care
      and proactive activity. Interventions must be easy to accomplish and structured so patients
      have accountability and both patients and clinicians have methods and tools for measuring
      progress. Most patients and family members are motivated at this time and understand the need
      to improve frailty and potentially improve global health.
