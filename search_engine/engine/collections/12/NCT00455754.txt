      therapy consisting of omeprazole 20 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg
      bid for seven days leads to a complete long-lasting resolution of lymphocytic gastritis in 96
      % of patients. However, after 3 months we also found a healing rate of 50 % in patients who
      received omeprazole 20 mg bid and placebo antibiotics for seven days suggesting spontaneous
      remission or a potential PPI effect. Thus, we speculate that PPI therapy may have led to
      elimination of H. pylori and subsequently healing of lymphocytic gastritis in those patients
      with potentially minimal H. pylori colonization at baseline. For this reason we investigate
      whether a PPI treatment alone is able to heal patients with lymphocytic gastritis.
