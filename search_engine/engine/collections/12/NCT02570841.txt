      the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Application of capsaicin 8% provokes distinct
      pain by activating the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor. Cooling the
      skin results in a reliable prevention of the application pain. However, the necessary cooling
      temperature and if cooling itself produces application pain, is unknown.

      Materials and Methods: 10 female and 10 male healthy volunteers will be enrolled in a
      randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study. The left or right forearm of
      each subject is going to be treated with a capsaicin 8% patch (QUTENZA, Astellas Pharma,
      Tokyo, Japan) of 9 cm² or a placebo patch (Demo patch, Astellas Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) of the
      same size for 60 min. Then the other forearm (which has not been tested before) will be
      treated with the remaining patch. During capsaicin and placebo exposure HPT in °C and CPT in
      °C are going to be obtained by the thermode of a thermal sensory analyser, TSA-II (Medoc
      Ltd., Ramat Yishai, Israel). Temperature increase/decrease of the thermode will be stopped,
      as soon as the subject presses a switch because of a beginning pain sensation. Immediately
      after exposure a pin prick test will be performed 5 times in a row by pressing a Mini-Spike
      (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) slowly against the skin of the application areal
      to determine the pressure necessary to provoke a sharp pain (Mechanical pain threshold in g).
      2 weeks later HPT, CPT, and MPT will be determined again in the areas of capsaicin and
      placebo exhibition.
