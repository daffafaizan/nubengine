      patients with burns. Prevention of microbial contamination and infection is vital for burn
      wound care as bacterial presence can result in excessive inflammatory reactions, delayed
      re-epithelialisation, impaired matrix remodelling and bacteraemia. A novel method to decrease
      the likelihood of infection and to help cure wounds is cold atmospheric plasma (CAP). CAP has
      been shown in vitro to kill a wide range of pathogenic bacteria.

      This safety study aims to demonstrate the safety, efficacy and efficiency of CAP for burn
      wound treatment. Intact skin of volunteers will be CAP treated. Local skin reaction (blister
      formation, pain, itching), erythema, local skin temperature, trans epidermal water loss
      (TEWL) and reduction of the bacterial load wil be monitored.
