      anemia (SCA). Exercise echocardiography (EE) can detect latent PH. We sought to investigate
      the occurrence of exercise-induced PH in patients with SCA and normal pulmonary pressure (PP)
      at rest, and its relationship with clinical and echocardiographic variables.Forty-four
      patients (22 men, mean age 25 y.o.) with SCA and normal PP at rest (tricuspid regurgitant jet
      flow velocity [TRV] <2.5 m/s) were studied and divided into two groups: exhibiting normal PP
      after treadmill EE (TRV≤2.7m/s) (G1), and exhibiting exercise-induced PH (TRV>2.7m/s) (G2).
      TRV cutoff points at rest and during exercise were based on data from healthy control
      subjects, matched for age, sex, and body surface area. Data obtained from EE were correlated
      with clinical, echocardiographic and ergometric variables.Exercise-induced PH occurred in 57%
      of the sample (G2), with mean TRV level of 3.4±0.4 m/s (range 2.8 - 4.5m/s), significantly
      higher than those of G1 (2.5±0.3 m/s, p<0.001). Exercise-induced PH was related to higher
      levels of creatinine (p<0.05), increased left atrial volume (p<0.05) and right ventricular
      diastolic area (p<0.05), larger E/Em waves ratio derived from spectral and tissue Doppler
      (p<0.05), and higher TRV at rest (p<0.005).We concluded that patients with SCA and normal PP
      at rest may exhibit exercise-induced PH, which was related to renal function, increased
      cardiac chambers, abnormal indices of diastolic function and baseline TRV levels. The
      clinical meaning of these findings requires clarification in future studies.
