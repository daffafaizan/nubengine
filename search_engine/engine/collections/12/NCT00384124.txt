      Inclusion criteria: Military beneficiaries with histologically proven Bowens disease, located
      on the head and neck, defined as any area superior to the clavicle and anterior to the
      posterior triangle of the neck

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Previous treatment of biopsied lesion Recurrent lesions from previous biopsy-proven
           Bowen's disease

        -  Patients younger than 18 years of age

        -  Pregnancy

        -  Immunosuppression, including HIV, transplant patients on immune suppressive medications,
           cancer patients on chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, leukemia)

        -  Mucous membrane involvement

        -  Lesions larger than 2 cm

             -  Methods: Pts randomized to treatment group (6 weeks of Mon-Friday Imiquimod to
                Bowens site) or vehicle group (same treatment regimen). All patients undergo
                surgical excision (Mohs or simple excision) of site where disease is either visible
                or was present and tissue examined for histologic evidence of residual Bowens
                disease
