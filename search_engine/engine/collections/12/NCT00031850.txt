        -  Compare the feasibility of raloxifene and goserelin versus no medical intervention in
           women at high genetic risk for developing breast cancer.

        -  Compare the incidence of adverse effects in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on bone density, biochemical markers of bone
           turnover, and lipid profiles in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once every month and oral raloxifene
           daily for 6-12 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients are screened for breast cancer every 6 months. In both arms, patients
           undergo annual mammograms.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
