      I. To assess the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a digital cognitive-behavioral
      stress management (CBSM) device, Attune, in stage I-III breast or stage I-III non-small cell
      lung cancer currently undergoing treatment or recently completed treatment (< 3 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy of the intervention with regard to
      improvements in patients' reported symptoms of distress.

      II. To evaluate patient safety and risks associated with screening procedures (severe anxiety
      or depression) as well as during receipt of the digital intervention.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients use the Attune app and undergo 10 sessions of CBSM over 30-45 minutes each
      consisting of cancer-specific educational videos, guided relaxation training, interactive
      exercises, and discussion modules. Following completion of the 6th session, patients undergo
      an assessment of intervention reception, update their medications, and schedule a phone call
      to assess for adverse events. At the end of the 10th session, patients undergo an online or
      phone de-briefing interview to discuss their experience with the intervention.
