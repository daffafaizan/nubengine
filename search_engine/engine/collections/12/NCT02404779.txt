      neuromuscular blocking agents before osmotherapy, barbituric coma, hypothermia and
      craniectomy.

      English speaking societies don't sustain this approach. Since then, the use of NMBA remains
      controversial in case of intracranial hypertension and no study is available.

      We propose to study severely brain injured patients presenting with intracranial hypertension
      and treat them with cisatracurium besilate or placebo.

      Our hypothesis is that neuromuscular blockade might act on several parameters:

        -  Hemodynamics

        -  respiratory parameters, mechanical ventilation and blood gaz analysis

        -  cerebral velocities

        -  diminished O2 peripheral consumption

        -  cerebrospinal diffusion and concentration of cisatracurium and a metabolite laudanosine
           We wish to assess changes in ICP according to the above parameters in a controlled
           randomized non blinded fashion against placebo (NaCl 0,9%).
