      Istanbul University Medical Faculty, Allergy Department. All treatments were performed in the
      same hospital.

      Sample Size: Sample size was calculated with power analysis. Pass 11 Home programme was used.
      α=0,05, β=0,6, 1- β=0,94 was determined. İf Sample size was defined 20 experimental and 20
      control group the power obtained %95. Using two-sided two sample t-test with alpha 0,05
      standard deviations were 5,0 and 4,0.

      Procedure: Forty chronic respiratory disease patient were assessed between the age of 10-18
      years old. The patients were found to be suitable for inclusion criteria of the
      study.Randomisation was performed by using randomisation function of Microsoft Office Excel
      programme by another researcher (ARO). Random number generator of Microsoft Office Excel
      Software gave a random number between 0 and 1 to the each treatment columns which were
      created by ARO. Sorting the random number row from the largest to the smallest number was
      performed by the sort and filter menu.After the randomisation,assessments at baseline and the
      patients were divided two groups. The experimental group was treated one by one with one
      physical therapist three times a week during a session for 30-45 minutes.
