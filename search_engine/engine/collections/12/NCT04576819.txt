      Jacksonville and UF Gainesville) and will confirm findings in a small prospective cohort of
      50 patients. The following will be tested in patient samples:

      Aim 1: Test and compare HDL and LDL function (oxidation/transport) in sepsis patients by
      clinical outcomes of rapid recovery, early death, CCI, and sepsis recidivism.

      Aim 2: Determine the changes in lipid homeostasis and patterns of inflammation that occur in
      sepsis patients by outcome.

      Aim 3: Characterize cholesterol & lipoprotein-specific metabolic gene expression in whole
      blood leukocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from sepsis patients.
