      autologous (the patient's own)umbilical cord blood cells in term gestation newborn infants
      with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. For this study, infants who have signs of moderate to
      severe encephalopathy at birth whose mothers have previously consented to providing cord
      blood cells for the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank or other public or private bank that uses
      accepted standards for collection and handling of cells, or provided verbal consent for cord
      blood collection for the possibility of their baby's participation in this trial, can receive
      their own cord blood cells if an adequate number of cells that meet Carolinas Cord Blood Bank
      Quality standards are available in the first 14 postnatal days. Study activities also include
      serial blood draws concurrent with clinically indicated blood draws with a total volume of no
      more than 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) from all study related tests. Babies will be followed
      for neurodevelopmental outcome at 4 - 6 and 9 - 12 months at Duke's Special Infant Care
      Clinic. MRI's will be obtained per clinical routine and results will be analyzed and
      described in study reports.
