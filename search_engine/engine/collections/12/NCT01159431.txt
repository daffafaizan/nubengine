      Neurostimulation is a promising alternative for patients who have failed medical therapy, and
      who are not resective surgical candidates.

      Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) is a novel form of neurostimulation, and has a strong
      antiepileptic effect in an animal model of seizures. Preliminary data in humans indicates TNS
      is well tolerated and may be effective in people with intractable epilepsy.

      TNS is an alternative mode of neurostimulation, because the Trigeminal Nerve can be
      stimulated in minimally-invasive fashion.

      This is a randomized double blind study of Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation, which compares high
      stimulation to an active control. Subjects with poorly controlled partial onset seizures who
      meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, enter a 6-week baseline period, and then are
      randomized in double-blind fashion to high or low intensity stimulation for 18 weeks. 50
      subjects are to be enrolled at two sites.

      Study outcomes are the following:

        1. Percent change in seizure frequency during the treatment period compared with the
           baseline (pre-treatment) period.

        2. Time to the 4th seizure

      The primary comparisons will be between and within groups.
