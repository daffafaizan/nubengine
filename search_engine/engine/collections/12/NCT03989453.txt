    
      This is a randomized clinical trial of single-blind with 2 arms (Control group and
      experimental group), in which a pre-treatment-postest design has been used.

      The study will define two groups:

      A control group (CG) that will not be submitted to treatment, which will be evaluated in the
      pre and post phase of the study. Participants assigned to this group will receive general
      advice on the positive effects of regular physical activity and will be given a guide to
      recommendations for promoting physical activity.

      An experimental group (GE) that after an initial evaluation will undergo a physical training
      program based on Chi Kung exercises.

      Once the intervention is finished, it will be submitted to a final evaluation to see if there
      is a difference or not with the results obtained at the beginning.
