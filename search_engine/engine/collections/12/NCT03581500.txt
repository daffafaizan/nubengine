      I. To assess reproducibility of quantitative spectroscopic and imaging parameters in
      hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), including key
      performance indicator (kpl), which assesses the rate of conversion of 13-C pyruvate to 13-C
      lactate in the tissue of interest, using a test-retest study design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To provide initial assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of hyperpolarized
      13-C-pyruvate MRSI performed pre-therapy for detecting high risk localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 10-20 seconds
      and undergo MRSI over 2-3 minutes at 6 and 8 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 day and then for up to 3 years.
