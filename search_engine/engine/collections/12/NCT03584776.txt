      pain and anxiety management in the post-operative period following major orthopedic surgery.
      While there is substantial evidence supporting the use of VR during dressing changes for burn
      victims, there is little known about VR use in post-surgical settings. In the proposed study,
      patients will be randomized to either receive VR in addition to standard of care or to
      receive only standard of care during their post-operative care following spinal fusion
      surgery for idiopathic scoliosis or neuromuscular scoliosis.
