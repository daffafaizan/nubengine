    
      This is a non-interventional study to determine the rate of control of disease activity in
      moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) participants, with two parts:
      cross-sectional evaluation (Day 1) with retrospective data collection and a prospective
      12-month evaluation for patients with active IBD at cross-sectional evaluation (Day 1).

      The study enrolled 407 patients. This multicenter trial was conducted in Brazil.
      Retrospective data of previous IBD treatments (drug, dose, treatment duration, drug changes),
      and use of other health resources related with the management of IBD for previous three years
      will be collected. Prospective data was collected for a period of 12 months in participants
      with active disease. UC participants, with no or light disease activity at Day 1 did not
      continue to 12-month follow up. CD participants, with no or light disease activity at Day 1
      but with colonoscopy or calprotectin levels (i.e, calprotectin >200 ug/g) in the previous
      year suggestive of inadequate control of activity progressed to 12-month follow up.
