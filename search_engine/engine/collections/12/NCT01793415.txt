      is a devastating and complex disorder. People with CFS experience overwhelming fatigue and a
      host of other symptoms that are not improved by bed rest and that can get worse after
      physical activity and mental exertion. They often function at a substantially lower level of
      activity than they were capable of before they became ill. Besides severe fatigue, other
      symptoms include muscle- and joint pain, impaired memory or mental concentration, insomnia,
      and post-exertion malaise lasting more than 24 hours. Often, CFS can persist for many years.
      Researchers have not yet identified what causes CFS, and there are no specific tests to
      diagnose CFS. The prevalence has been suggested to be around 1-2 %.

      All humans are exposed to small amounts of mercury every day from the environment. It is
      well-known that exposure to mercury in small quantities for a long time can affect the
      psychic function, and cause severe fatigue, insomnia, lack of concentration and memory
      problems, which is called micromercurialism. It is also known that the sensitivity to the
      toxic effects by mercury differs greatly between people. Thus, it is quite possible that the
      small amount of mercury that humans are exposed to daily are sufficient to lead to
      micromercurialism symptoms in sensitive individuals. Therefore, the question arises if a
      reduction of the mercury content in the body of CFS patients can improve their symptoms and
      problems in daily life.

      This study will examine if the mercury binding substance IodoCarb(r) can improve the health
      of patients with CFS.

      This is a double blind placebo controlled parallel group study.

      Patient population: 40 patients diagnosed with CFS will participate.
