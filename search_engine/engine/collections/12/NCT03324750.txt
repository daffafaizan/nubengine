    
      Prospective Qualitative Study Carried out among patients followed in rheumatology and in
      general medical practice.

      For each voluntary patient, a semi-directed interview was carried out in a consultation room
      after obtaining his agreement.

      The same investigator used a single guide and conducted all the interviews based on
      open-ended questions.

      At the end of the interviews, the entire recorded audio data was converted in written form
      before being analysed thematically.

      Data were analysed using a Fisher's exact test for categorical variables (presented as
      frequencies and percentages), and using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous
      variables (presented as the median and interquartile range, IQR).
