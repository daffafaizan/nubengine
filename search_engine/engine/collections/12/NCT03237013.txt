      cancer. Predictors of indoor and outdoor tanning including negative body image and negative
      affect. Thus, to subsequently prevent skin cancer, interventions should focus on appearance
      concerns and negative affect. To date, limited brief efficacious skin cancer preventions
      exist. One potential program (APRIL AGE) a facial morphing software program, has recently
      been evaluated as a potential prevention program of skin cancer. However, limited data exists
      on the long term benefits of this program. Additionally, brief mindfulness programs have been
      found to be efficacious in preventing other health risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, negative
      affect, eating behaviors). To the investigators' knowledge, these brief mindfulness
      interventions have yet to be applied in skin cancer prevention. Thus, the investigators
      sought to compare the relative efficacy of the facial morphing intervention and the
      mindfulness intervention vs. control condition (treatment as usual). It was hypothesized that
      both facial morphing and mindfulness would lead to reductions in tanning behavior compared to
      the TAU condition. The investigators also tested contrasts between the facial morphing and
      mindfulness conditions, however, no directional hypotheses could be generated, due to the
      dearth of prior data on these interventions in skin cancer prevention.
