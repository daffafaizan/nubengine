      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Efforts to treat these syndromes have not been effective,
      most likely because these obstetric complications are the clinical expression of adaptive
      mechanisms of host defense developed in response to pathologic insults. Since the ultimate
      pathologic basis of disease is unclear, therapy for these syndromes has been largely directed
      at symptoms, which appear late in the development of the disease. The main purpose of this
      study is to perform an early and comprehensive exploration of maternal and fetal factors that
      predict the subsequent development of these obstetric complications, so that early medical
      interventions may be tested in patients at high and low risk for adverse perinatal outcome.
