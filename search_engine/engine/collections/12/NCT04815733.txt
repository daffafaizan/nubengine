      anesthesia during long-term laparoscopic and robot-assisted abdominal operations at different
      levels of neuromuscular block.

      Intervention: We plan to include 100 patients who will undergo elective long (more 2 hours)
      laparoscopic or abdominal robotic surgery. All patients will be randomly assigned in two
      groups in ratio 1:1. 1 group- deep neuromuscular block and mandatory ventilation; 2 group-
      partial neuromuscular block and pressure support ventilation.

      Expected Results. PSV may reduce the systemic inflammatory response compared to the mandatory
      ventilation during laparoscopic and abdominal robotic surgery.
