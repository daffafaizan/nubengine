      Chinese Medicine (TCM) but is still lack of scientific evidence.The inference methods of
      causal relationship between treatment and clinial effect under real-word study may help.

      Objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy of Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome
      differentiation method in treating resistant hypertension and explore causal inference in the
      real-world study.

      Research design and methods: It is a multi-center,prospective,two-arm,cohort study including
      200 patients with resistant hypertension (doctors' diagnosis based on the American Heart
      Association criteria 2008).Essential hypertension subjects,aged 18-70 years,blood pressure
      >140/90mmHg even used to be on 3 or more medications for a month and diagnosed as Phlegm and
      Stasis Syndrome will be included.Thiazide diuretics and/or two more antihypertensive agents
      for 8 weeks, Chinese herbs (for synchronic treating phlegm and blood stasis) and
      nonpharmacological recommendations were initiated in the observational group and the control
      group received the same interventions without Chinese herbs.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes will be Systolic (SBP) and Diastolic (DBP) blood
      pressure reductions and changes in symptoms and signs.Cardiac event and death incident will
      be the secondary outcomes.Possible side effects and adverse reactions arising from the
      treatment like diarrhea will be recorded.

      Discussion: This is a rigorous methodology pilot study and 200 patients are enough to
      calculate sample size in later formal trial.
