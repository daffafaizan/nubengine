      demanding. Subjects will have to undergo an assessment via a movement protocol as well as
      clinical outcome tests. In both cases the type of assessment does not differ from the normal
      assessment at a rehabilitation centre. The training is assisted using a robotic device called
      the Haptic Master (HM). The participant's arm is attached to the HM via a gimbal. The HM has
      a number of safety features to avoid overload on the participant's arm. Any potential risk
      for overload is minimised by a) careful build-up of the training regime; b) regular
      check-ups; and c) checking the participant's status prior to the next training session.
