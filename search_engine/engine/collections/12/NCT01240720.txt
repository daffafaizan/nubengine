      tumour blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a
      rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a
      pathological feature of most aggressive types of cancer. The study aims at determining the
      therapeutic potential of the F16 antibody in SIP format,labelled with the radionuclide 131I,
      for the treatment of patients with different cancer types.
