      to Regimen A1 (RT + durvalumab). If this is not tolerated then an alternative Regimen A2,
      containing a lower total radiation dose will accrue 6 patients. If either A1 or A2 is
      tolerated then patients will be accrued to Regimen B1 (durvalumab, tremelimumab x 2 doses,
      and RT dose determined from Regimen A) following a 3+3 design for safety. If Regimen B1 is
      not tolerated an alternative Regimen B2 (durvalumab, tremelimumab x 1 dose, and RT dose
      determined from regimen A) will accrue following a 3+3 design for safety.

      After the safety lead-in for each group is completed, an expansion cohort will accrue
      patients. In this expansion cohort, patients will be randomized 1:1 to be treated with either
      regimen A or regimen B dose selected from the safety lead-in stratified by patient population
      (localized patients and metastatic patients).
