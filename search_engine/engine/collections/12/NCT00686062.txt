      prenatal care at one of the obstetrics clinics and practices affiliated with the University
      of California at San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), Kaiser San
      Francisco, or California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC). After completing a baseline
      questionnaire, participants will be randomized to view either a control or intervention
      group. Patients assigned to the control group will view the computerized version of the
      age-appropriate educational pamphlet concerning prenatal testing developed by the State of
      California. Patients assigned to the intervention group will use the computerized decision
      support tool/educational module which provides important background information about
      chromosomal abnormalities, and patient-tailored information about the advantages and
      limitations of diagnostic testing.
