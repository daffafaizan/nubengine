      more smaller minimal stent area (MSA) and stent underexpansion following deployment of DES
      are strong predictors of stent thrombosis and (TVR) target vessel revascularization. The
      investigators hypothesize than adjunctive postdilatation with noncompliant balloon can
      improve DES deployment.

      After successful drug eluting stent implantation, patients will be randomized into two
      groups: Group A with no further dilatation, and Group B with additional post-dilatation with
      a noncompliant balloon. The investigators will performed IVUS analysis in groups A and B just
      before randomization and after post-dilatation in group B. Post dilatation will be performed
      with noncompliant balloon and with a nominal diameter 0.25mm larger than stent balloon.

      The primary endpoint is optimum stent deployment. For defining the optimal stent deployment
      the investigators use the IVUS criteria adopted in the MUSIC study: Complete apposition
      without underexpansion and with symmetric stent expansion.

      Patients are eligible after successful drug-eluting stent implantation in a native coronary
      artery. Patients with myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome will be excluded from
      the study.
