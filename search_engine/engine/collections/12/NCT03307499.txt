    
      This study is a prospective, single center, postmarket study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of NeoPatch used as a tissue cover for chronically injured tendons requiring
      surgical revision. NeoPatch is a tissue covering derived from terminally sterilized,
      dehydrated human placental membrane tissue comprised of both amnion and chorion. Candidates
      for this study are patients presenting with chronic tendon pain that are being evaluated for
      primary tendon revision surgery following failure of standard of care or immediate need for
      surgery, as determined by the investigator. Consented patients will receive NeoPatch as an
      adjunct to their foot or ankle tendon revision; NeoPatch will be wrapped around the tendon
      immediately prior to closure. The study will be divided into two phases: Screening and
      Follow-up. The study will include prospective patient evaluations at scheduled clinic visits
      and ultrasound appointments for a maximum of 12 visits over 12 months. Patient history,
      medications, self-reported pain, tendon status, and adverse events will be collected on all
      patients consented and enrolled into the study.
