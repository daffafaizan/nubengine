    
      This Phase 3/4, randomized, observer-blind, multi-center, stratified study evaluated the
      efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a cell-derived quadrivalent subunit influenza virus
      vaccine (Seqirus QIVc) compared to a non-influenza comparator vaccine in healthy male and
      female participants between 2 to <18 years of age. A total of 4514 children/teens were
      randomized, receiving either QIVc or the non-influenza comparator vaccine. The comparator was
      (meningococcal [Groups A, C, W-135, and Y] oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM197 conjugate
      vaccine [Men ACWY]). Randomized enrollment was stratified in a 1:1 ratio via an Interactive
      Response Technology (IRT) system which assigned the participants into two age cohorts: 2 to
      <9 years of age and 9 to <18 years of age. Subjects between 2 to <9 years of age were further
      stratified by previous influenza vaccine status ("previously vaccinated" or "not previously
      vaccinated").
