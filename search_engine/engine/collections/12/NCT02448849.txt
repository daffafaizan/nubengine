      the society. Current treatment of this disorder is autologous bone graft. This treatment has
      potential minor and major complications and is considered as a risky treatment. So researches
      are focused on new treatment approaches for this disease.

      Cell therapy is one of these new approaches especially based on mesenchymal stromal cells.

      The investigators will evaluate safety and efficacy of percutaneous implantation of
      autologous BM-MSC (bone marrow -derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in combination with PL
      (platelet lysate product) in 30 tibia nonunion patients. The other 30 patients will receive
      placebo. These patients will be followed up and data will be analyzed with spss(v16).
