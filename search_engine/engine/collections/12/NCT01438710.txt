      drug-induced hand tremors in stable kidney transplant subjects converted from Prograf
      (tacro-limus, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Deerfield, IL) or generic tacrolimus twice daily
      (b.i.d.) to LCP-Tacro tablets (tacrolimus, Veloxis Pharmaceuticals A/S, Horsholm, Denmark)
      once daily (q.d.). The trial is designed to determine if the test drug LCP-Tacro, is
      associated with fewer and/or less severe drug-induced hand tremor than observed with Prograf
      or generic tacrolimus treatment; each therapy is to be concomitantly administered with
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), including generic versions of each,
      and/or prednisone or equivalent as long as doses remain stable during the study. All
      prophylaxis and other medication will be allowed per standard of care (SOC) in each of the
      participating sites; no medication that interacts with the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      tacrolimus is allowed unless subjects who are recipients of a renal transplant at least 1
      month and not more than 5 years prior to enrollment. Following screening, study visits will
      be conducted over a 2-week treatment period with consists of 1 week of Prograf or generic
      tacrolimus SOC, and 1 week of LCP-Tacro. Subjects who qualify for extended use of LCP-Tacro
      can continue LCP-Tacro treatment for additional 2 years. This decision will be made at the
      discretion of the physician and subject.
