      and music, configured in a wearable binaural head set are employed by seasoned smokers of
      cigarettes, with the end result of reducing the desire to smoke. This device use does not
      require any complementary or adjunctive drug use. A review of unregulated products that are
      marketed for smoking cessation, have as common mechanism of action, the administration and
      withdrawal of nicotine in a controlled dosing format. The proposed study device does not
      consider the use of the culprit drug, the best pathway to achieve rapid and long-lasting
      cessation results. The theoretical principle at work is the competition for absorption by
      nicotinic cholinergic receptors located in the brain by nicotine or by the LLLT and music
      therapy. If this competition for absorption by two competing elements (cigarettes and the
      proposed device) can result in the device "winning the race", then the neurotransmitters will
      respond to the LLLT and music stimulus instead of the serum nicotine and yield a reduced
      desire to consume nicotine. As with any new technology, it is essential to learn the variance
      between true efficacy and the placebo level of efficacy. This study seeks to define that
      variance.
