    
      Unexplained infertility was diagnosed according to standard World Health Organization (WHO)
      criteria. All women in the study had hormonal assessment to evaluate their ovulatory cycles,
      thyroid function, circulating prolactin and androgen levels. The ovarian reserve was checked
      by measurement of serum FSH and an antral follicle count on the third day of the menstrual
      cycle. Screening for infertility also included transvaginal ultrasound and
      hysterosalpingography, to exclude possible uterine malformations or pathologies, and to
      assess the patency of the fallopian tubes. Male factor infertility was excluded in all
      couples, according to standard WHO semen analysis.

      Following admission, all patients underwent complete clinical examination and detailed
      medical history was obtained.

      A venous sample was collected to test serum for HP IgG seropositivity by enzyme linked
      immunoassay for HELICOBACTOR PYLORI IgG (ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY TEST KIT).
