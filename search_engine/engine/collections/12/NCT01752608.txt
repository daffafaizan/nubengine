    
      This is a prospective, randomized, comparator-controlled, two-arm, parallel group study to
      examine the safety and efficacy of eCBT Mood, a handheld, computerized, electronic cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) application, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The
      study will involve 100 patients with mild to moderate MDD randomly assigned to daily use of
      either a CBT application focused on depression ('eCBT Mood'; MindApps, llc) or a
      comparator-controlled group using a mood monitoring application ('Mood Tracker'; GP
      International). This study design and duration of the study is consistent with other studies
      employing comparator-controlled designs in the study of CBT interventions, including
      computerized CBT interventions, among patients with MDD (e.g., Andrews et al., 2010;
      McKendree-Smith et al., 2003).

      After being screened to ensure that the patients meet the required diagnostic, depression
      severity, and other inclusion criteria, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to use
      either eCBT Mood, a computer application running on the Apple® iPhone™ or iPod Touch®
      handheld computer platforms. The application includes: (1) a psychoeducation module on the
      relationships among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, (2) a 6-item daily depression
      assessment with the option to e-mail the summary score and suicidal ideation assessment
      response to a 3rd party, (3) a negative automatic thought identification module, (4) a
      feelings and thoughts log, (5) a module enabling the user to challenge their negative
      automatic thoughts, (6) an assessment and challenge module regarding core beliefs which
      underlie many automatic thoughts, (7) optional compliance reminders to use the application or
      take medicines, and (8) links to behavioral science-based online content regarding MDD from
      PsychCentral (see www.psychcentral.com). In contrast, the comparator control condition will
      use Mood Tracker, which is also a a computer application running on the Apple iPhone or iPod
      Touch handheld computer platforms. This application enables users to rate their mood using
      expressive faces on a daily basis, log about their daily feelings, and also has an option
      enabling an e-mail to be sent to a 3rd party regarding their daily mood ratings.

      Throughout the 8-week study period, patients will complete both in-person and telephone-based
      assessments of their depression severity, mood, frequency of negative automatic thoughts, and
      safety assessments.
