      needs due to prematurity. These infants experience increased healthcare utilization, long
      durations of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and are at high risk of
      developing prematurity-related complications. As a result, their care is complex, and
      families need structured training to effectively understand, monitor, and manage their
      infant's care. PREEMIE PROGRESS is an innovative, video-based intervention that applies
      evidence-based family management theories to better equip parents to meet the chronic,
      complex healthcare needs of their preterm infant. This research aims to 1) refine a novel
      family management program, called PREEMIE PROGRESS, through iterative usability and
      acceptability testing and 2) test feasibility and acceptability of the refined intervention
      and study procedures in a pilot randomized controlled trial. This project will use
      implementation science tools and approaches to refine the intervention and study procedures
      to ensure that PREEMIE PROGRESS addresses key program elements that will be important for
      future adoption and implementation in NICU settings. We anticipate that the intervention will
      decrease parent anxiety and depression, increase infant weight gain and receipt of mother's
      milk, and reduce neonatal healthcare utilization. The long-term goal of this project is to
      develop, test, and translate into NICU practice an efficacious family management intervention
      for parents of preterm infants. Dr. Weber will significantly advance nursing science through
      this project by obtaining preliminary feasibility and acceptability data for a scalable and
      sustainable intervention to facilitate family management and improve parent-infant health
      outcomes.
