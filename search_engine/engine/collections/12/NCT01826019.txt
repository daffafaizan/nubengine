      HT Phase: Up to 30 urban and rural communities in Canada, Colombia and Malaysia will be
      randomized to participate in an intensive CV risk detection and control programme by NPHW or
      to care as usual for 12 months. NOTE: Canada will serve as a pilot study, which will be used
      to evaluate feasibility, time, cost and program improvements.

      CVD Phase: If funded, this phase will be a continuation and expansion of HT Phase to include
      up to 190 urban and rural communities in countries within Asia, South America, Sub-Saharan
      Africa, and Canada that will be allocated to participate in an intensive CV risk detection
      and control programme supported by NPHWs or to care as usual for up to 6 years. NOTE: CVD
      Phase - currently not initiated.

      Communities will be randomized 1:1 with a central randomization system to either a)
      intervention or b) control, after screening in the community is complete.
