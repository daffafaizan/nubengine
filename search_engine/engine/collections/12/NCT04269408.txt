      subarachnoid haemorrhage patients involving two treatment groups. Both treatment groups will
      receive standard of care and patients randomised to the investigational group will receive in
      addition NicaPlant速 .

      NicaPlant速 is a nicardipine modified-release formulation. It is presented in the form of a
      rod-shaped implant with a 4 mg nicardipine load. Following aneurysm clip ligation, 10
      NicaPlant速 implants will be placed into the basal cisterns in direct contact with the exposed
      cerebral blood vessel walls.
