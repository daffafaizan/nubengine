      periodontitis will be recruited and initially treated for inflammation. Using a randomized
      split-mouth design,the teeth in experimental (laser) group will receive LLLT while the teeth
      in the control (placebo) group will receive no laser treatment. The effects of LLLT in
      orthodontic-periodontal treatment on periodontal inflammation control, jawbone remodeling,
      reduction of tooth sensitivity, pain relief and quality of life will be investigated.
