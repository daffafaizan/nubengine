      risk management, clinical data of comparable devices) are available for assessing the safety
      and performance of the Gemini SL knee prosthesis system. Unfortunately, no data are available
      for the Gemini SL Fixed Bearing knee prosthesis. As one part of the post market surveillance
      (PMS) system of the sponsor, the clinical outcome of the Gemini SL Fixed Bearing knee
      prosthesis in the midterm follow-up shall be evaluated. Therefore patients who received a
      Gemini Sl Fixed bearing knee prosthesis 3 years ago are invited to participate in follow-up
      examinations.
