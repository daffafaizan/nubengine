    
      This is an open label, non-randomised, single arm phase IIIB study. Patients will be enrolled
      in this study if their current antipsychotic medication does not provide optimal control of
      psychopathology symptoms, as judged by the investigator. Therefore, the patients will not be
      switched from their current effective and well tolerated antipsychotic regimen to the study
      drug for the sole reason of being enrolled into the study. After enrolment, patients will be
      switched to Quetiapine XR and followed in an intent-to-treat design over 6 months. Even if a
      patient should stop for any reason Quetiapine XR or require adding or adjusting an
      antidepressant for anxiety resistant symptoms, he/she will be assessed for the entire study.
      Data will be analysed separately.

      Quetiapine XR will be titrated according to the following pattern: Seroquel XR 300 mg on day
      1 and Seroquel XR 600 mg on day 2. On day 3, the dosage could be either maintained at 600
      mg/day or continued up to 800 mg/day or if the 600 mg dose is not tolerated, the dose could
      then be reduced to 400 mg/day. Following this, subjects will be flexibly dosed, according to
      clinical judgment of the investigator, between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day with minimum dose
      adjustments of 200 mg/day. This adjustment can be performed at anytime during the study but
      should not take place within a week from last cognitive assessment, planned at month 6. An
      overlap of at least 4 days but not more than 2 weeks with the previous antipsychotic will be
      allowed with decreasing doses on a two-week period.
