      compression fracture (VCF) incidence at 6 months between single-fraction and two-fraction
      sSRS.

      Other objectives are to to evaluate the 12-month impact of single- and two-fraction sSRS on
      local control (LC), pain control (PC), quality of life (QOL), and toxicity (specifically,
      pain flare, radiation esophagitis/laryngitis/pharyngitis, and radiation myelitis)

      This study is planned as a two-arm randomized phase II trial to establish non-inferiority of
      single fraction sSRS compared to two-fraction sSRS. Approximately 130 participants will be
      enrolled in this trial; 65 participants in each arm:

        -  Group 1: If you are assigned to this group, you will undergo spine radiosurgery in a
           single (1) session.

        -  Group 2: If you are assigned to this group, you will undergo spine radiosurgery in two
           (2) sessions.
