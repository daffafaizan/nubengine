      incidence was reported to be 2 to 6% [1]. In patients suffering from low output syndrome
      cardiac output is severely reduced due to myocardial failure. Among other reasons for
      myocardial failure, ischemia, insufficient myocardial protection during aortic
      cross-clamping, and severely reduced ventricular function prior surgery are the most common
      risk factors for low output syndrome. Low output syndrome is treated with positive inotropic
      drugs and mechanical assist devices [2]. Morbidity and mortality of low output syndrome is
      high and the costs for treating the disease are immense.

      If cardiac output cannot be increased cardiac failure persist and vital organs are
      hypoperfused. Critical and prolonged hypoperfusion results in single and multi organ failure.
      Until today a definite threshold for a critically reduced cardiac output or cardiac index
      requiring immediate therapy is not completely known. Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed by
      clinical signs and it is not diagnosed by cardiac output or cardiac index. The critical value
      for a severely reduces cardiac index was reported to be in a range of 1.75 to 2.5L/min/mÂ²
      [3-5].

      The primary objective of this prospective observational study in 600 patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery is to try to define a threshold for a critically reduced cardiac output or
      cardiac index requiring immediate therapy.

      If cardiac output and cardiac index are not reduced below a critical threshold, morbidity,
      mortality, and length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital are reduced [6].
