      the rest of their lives. If they stop, their immune system may reject the transplanted liver.
      All anti-rejection medications have side effects. Because of the side effects of
      anti-rejection medications, an important goal of transplant research is to allow people to
      accept their transplanted organ without long term use of anti-rejection medications. This is
      called tolerance. In this study, participants who received a liver transplant will have their
      anti-rejection medication(s) gradually reduced over a period of time and then stopped. The
      study calls this 'immunosuppression withdrawal'.

      The purpose of this research study is to see how many people will develop tolerance after
      immunosuppression withdrawal. The researchers also want to find out if there are blood or
      liver biopsy tests that can help transplant doctors in the future predict whether it is safe
      to decrease or stop anti-rejection medications in people who received a liver transplant.
