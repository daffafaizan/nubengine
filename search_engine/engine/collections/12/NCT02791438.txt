      pediatric participants with hypertension.

      The study enrolled 27 participants. Following a 2-week Placebo Run-in Period, participants
      were assigned to one of the two treatment groups based on weight:

        -  Azilsartan 2.5 - 20 mg (Participants < 50 kg)

        -  Azilsartan 5 - 40 mg (Participants ≥ 50 kg)

      Participants weighing < 50 kg were asked to take an initial dose azilsartan 2.5 mg (titrated
      as needed to the highest dose of 20 mg) and participants weighing ≥ 50 kg were asked to take
      an initial dose of 5 mg azilsartan (titrated as needed to the highest dose of 40 mg).

      This multi-centre trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      is 56 weeks. The study consisted of a Run-in Period (Week -2 to Week 0), a 52-week Treatment
      Period, and a 2-week Follow-up Period (up to Week 54). Participants made multiple visits to
      the clinic and a final visit 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug for follow-up
      assessment.
