    
      Primary objective(s): To determine the feasibility and clinical utility of performing HIVM in
      patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis during standard course of treatment (cytoreductive
      surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or CRS-HIPEC).

      Secondary objective(s):

        1. Compare the microscopic observation of the tumor-associated vessels with normal tissue
           (peritoneal surface) in each individual subject.

        2. Correlate the microscopic observations of the tumor-associated vessels with pathologic
           grade of tumor implants.

        3. Correlate the microscopic observation of the microvasculature with tumor-specific and
           overall survival.
