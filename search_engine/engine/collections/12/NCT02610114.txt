      current and world-wide used scoring system of fertilized oocytes (zygotes) implemented by
      Scott in 1998, to determine whether this leads to an increase in pregnancy rates in women
      undergoing assisted reproductive techniques. If successful this could in the future lead to a
      reduction in the numbers of embryos required to achieve a pregnancy. Transferring only one
      embryo means minimizing the incidence of high order multiple pregnancies.

      Regularly couples gain several fertilized oocytes (zygotes) due to artificial reproductive
      techniques. As a routine, these cells are archived using pictures and videos for quality and
      safety reasons in different stages of development. Because it is planned to transfer only one
      or two developed embryos to the uterus, investigators have to select the zygotes with the
      highest potential for implantation and pregnancy. The remaining cells are preserved using
      vitrification.

      In the study, investigators use in addition to the established Zygote-score (Z-score) by
      Scott a new selection method for one group of patients: The quality of the zygotes of all
      patients is classified according to the described Scott system. Patients are randomized to
      two groups. Group 1 is the control group without any further intervention. If needed for
      selection, the quality of the zygotes of the patients of group 2 is additionally scored with
      a new method. The pictures of the cells, already taken for quality and safety reasons, are
      taken and the cells surface is analysed using a computer algorithm.
