      physician by an announcement made verbally or via email. The motion capture will be performed
      under Matthew Cornelius, MS using the Vicon Bonita Motion Capture system in the Fine Arts
      Department of NYIT. Following the motion capture, body biomechanics will be analyzed to
      determine the range of motion of each joint in sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes as
      well as the timing and sequence of the movements. The motion analysis will be compared to the
      Sports Physical exam, including the general, structural/neuromusculoskeletal, and central
      neurological (ImPACT) exams. The comparison will add validity to the physical exam. In
      addition, determining if the quantitative, 3-dimensional motion analysis can be correlated
      with information from the physical exam with regards to restrictions to motion may be useful
      for athletes to optimize their abilities in the future. If during the course of the athlete's
      training and competition season s/he sustains an injury, s/he will be evaluated by the NYIT
      athletics physician, who will randomly assign the injured athletes to either the 'standard of
      care without OMM' or 'standard of care with OMM' cohorts when medically appropriate. OMM will
      be performed by an NYITCOM physician specializing in family medicine and OMT or
      neuromusculoskeletal systems and OMM. "Return to play' time and
      post-intervention/post-control quantitative motion analysis of biomechanics during the
      athletes demonstration of the same athletic maneuvers as before the injury.
