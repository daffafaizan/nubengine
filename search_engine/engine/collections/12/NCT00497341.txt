      of antibiotic prophylaxis has not been well defined. Currently, antibiotics are given 10
      minutes before ischemia and the infection rate is about 3-5%. In 2005 we performed a study
      where the efficacy of the standard prophylaxis was compared with a new regimen that consisted
      in administering the antibiotic 10 min. before tourniquet release. The results were positive
      although the difference was not statistically significant. In the present study we are
      proposing a new protocol where the antibiotic is given 10 min. before the inflation of
      tourniquet and 10 min. before its release. Methodology: all patients who undergo a total knee
      arthroplasty will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens of antibiotic
      prophylaxis:Standard: cefuroxime 1.5 g i.v. 10 min before tourniquet + placebo 10 min before
      tourniquet release + cefuroxime 1'5 g i.v. 6h after closing surgical wound.Experimental:
      cefuroxime 1.5 g i.v. 10 min before tourniquet + cefuroxime 1.5 g i.v. 10 min before
      tourniquet release + cefuroxime 1'5 g i.v. 6h after closing surgical wound.The infection rate
      with standard regimen is 3.4%. We believe that the new regimen will decrease the rate of
      infection to 1%. To demonstrate differences between both arms, it will be necessary to
      include 666 patients per arm.
