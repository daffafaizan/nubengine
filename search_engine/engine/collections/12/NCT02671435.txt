      exploration (Part 3). Part 1 will evaluate dose escalation of durvalumab in combination with
      monalizumab in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 2 will
      evaluate further the identified dose of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab from Part
      1 in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 3 will evaluate dose
      exploration of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab and standard of care systemic
      therapy with or without biological agent, and monalizumab in combination with biological
      agent in adult subjects with CRC.
