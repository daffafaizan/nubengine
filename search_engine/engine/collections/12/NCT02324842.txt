    
      Specific Aim 1.To examine whether the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin can
      prevent the increase in HGP following institution of canagliflozin therapy and produce an
      additive or even synergistic effect to lower the plasma glucose concentration and A1c. We
      will examine this hypothesis by comparing the effect of administration of liraglutide alone,
      canagliflozin alone, and the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin on:(i) the rate of
      HGP; (ii) decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration; (iii) counter-regulatory hormone
      response and (iv) A1c. We anticipate that the addition of liraglutide to canagliflozin will
      prevent the increase in plasma glucagon concentration, augment insulin secretion, and
      blunt/block the increase in HGP in response to canagliflozin, resulting in a greater decrease
      in fasting plasma glucose concentration and A1c than observed with each therapy alone.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin
      can produce an additive, or even synergistic, effect to promote weight loss and reduction in
      hepatic and visceral fat content.

      Specific Aim 3. To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin
      can produce an additive or even synergistic effect to reduce systolic/diastolic blood
      pressure and 24-hour integrated blood pressure.
