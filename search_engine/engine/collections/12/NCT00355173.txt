      achieve the goal of supporting the cervical spine, they limit the possibilities for jaw
      thrust or other airway manipulations. Definitive airway protection usually must be achieved
      by orotracheal intubation. Thee Lubo collar is a device that simultaneously maintains
      cervical spine control and keeps an open airway in a non-invasive manner that is simple to
      operate. The objective of the study is to test the safety of the collar volunteers. The study
      is composed of two stages:1.healthy volunteers that will not undergo any intervention except
      testing the LCC.2. second group of patients scheduled to undergo an operation under general
      anesthesia with endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway.
