      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study. All subjects undergo screening
      and baseline visits, followed by system implantation, and randomization after 2 weeks to
      either a treatment Group (stimulation) or Control Group (delayed stimulation).

      Randomized subjects complete a 10-week, double-blind phase. At the 14-week visit, subjects
      are unblinded, control group subjects begin receiving stimulation, and all subjects are
      followed for an additional 9-month open-label treatment phase.

      Subjects continue receiving stimulation for an extended follow-up phase involving annual
      visits through 5 years.

      Study Visits:

      Screening and baseline visits. Laparoscopic implantable pulse generator (IPG) and lead
      implant procedure. Post-implant follow-up office visits at 2 weeks/randomization, 6, 10, 14,
      24 and 48 weeks, followed by annual visits through 5 years.

      Sample Size and Scope:

      Forty-six subjects will be implanted and followed to 12 months after stimulation treatment at
      3 investigational sites.
