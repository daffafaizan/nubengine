      cardiovascular diseases [1]. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is present in up to 24% of
      middle-aged adults [2], and is far more prevalent in patients with existing cardiovascular
      disease [3]. Patients with OSA are at increased risk of developing diabetes l [4]. OSA is an
      established cause of hypertension[5], and has an estimated prevalence of 40% in all patients
      with hypertension [6-8]. Similarly a strong association exists between OSA, coronary artery
      disease [6, 7] and stroke [8]. OSA may be present in over 50% of patients with heart failure
      [9]. Patients with chronic non-healing wounds stand to benefit from identification and
      treatment of severe co-morbidities such as OSA. Such identification and treatment of OSA will
      impact the survival of these patients [10, 11], and may also contribute to improved morbidity
      via impacting wound healing.

      Several unexplored links exist between OSA and wound healing. OSA is a disorder of
      intermittent hypoxia and is associated with increased oxidative stress [12]. Humans with OSA
      and animal models of intermittent hypoxia developed impaired vascular function and nitric
      oxide deficiency. Patients with OSA have impaired endothelial function even in the absence of
      clinically apparent cardiovascular disease [13-15]. Increased sympathetic activity and
      episodic pressor response are well documented in OSA. Patients with OSA have increased
      vascular tone and baseline vasoconstriction [16]. Impaired vascular reactivity to hypoxia was
      also demonstrated in animal models exposed to 2 weeks of intermittent hypoxia[17]. Therefore,
      in patients with chronic non-healing wounds, OSA is likely to further complicate the healing
      process.

      OSA as a disorder of oxidative stress and vascular impairment is most likely an important
      co-morbidity in patients with non-healing wounds. Other potential mechanisms of interaction
      are the inflammatory response associated with OSA
