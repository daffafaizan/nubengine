      if times from injury were at least one year. Participants had an AIS grades of A-D with
      spasticity. We evaluated that participants with AIS A and B SCI were motor complete group,
      AIS C and D SCI were motor incomplete group. Spasticity was assessed with Modified Ashworth
      Scale (MAS) and spasms were assessed with Penn Spasm Frequency Scale (PSFS). Hip adductor and
      extensor spasticity, knee extensor and flexor spasticity and ankle plantar flexor spasticity
      were assessed by using MAS. Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry. All participants underwent a 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
      Insulin sensitivity was assessed by calculating Matsuda index and HOMA-IR. Investigators
      assessed the effects of spasticity on glucose metabolism and body composition in participants
      with SCI.
