    
      The main scope of the Registry is to report the epidemiology and outcome of children with AKI
      treated with dialysis in over 30 Pediatric Nephrology Centers in Europe. Secondary aims are
      to verify the association of a specific dialysis modality with the outcome and the
      association of primary disease, co-morbidities, nephrotoxic agents, fluid overload, anuria,
      basic hemodynamic parameters (BP, HR), basic nutritional intakes (protein and calorie supply)
      with the outcome.

      Data capture will be exclusively web-based via electronic case report forms. Every
      participating site will be provided with a unique code and password that identify the
      corresponding site.
