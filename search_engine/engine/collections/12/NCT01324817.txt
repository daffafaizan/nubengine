      monitor respiratory rate. Specifically, in clinically stable neonatal patients the study aims
      to:

        1. Obtain respiratory effort data of neonatal patients with remote Doppler radar systems
           modified from a system cleared by the FDA for adult use.

        2. Determine if remote Doppler radar systems can accurately detect the respiratory rate of
           neonatal patients, compared with standard measurement systems.

        3. Determine if unattended Doppler radar systems, operating for 4 hours, can accurately
           detect the respiratory rate of neonatal patients.
