      positioned in lateral decubitus with the surgical side up, and prepping para-spinous area
      with antiseptic solution. Ultrasound high frequency linear transducer is positioned in a
      para-sagittal plane at the level of fifth thoracic vertebra. Scanning of interested
      structures from superficial to deep planes, Trapezius muscle, Rhomboid major muscle, Erector
      spina muscle and transverse process of fifth thoracic vertebra.

      Comparator: serratus anterior plane block After giving general anesthesia, patient is
      positioned in lateral decubitus, with the surgical side up. The upper arm is abducted and
      elevated above the head level. Under sterile aseptic technique, a linear ultrasound
      transducer (6-15 MHz) is placed in a sagittal oblique plane over the fourth and fifth ribs at
      the mid-axillary line. The following muscles are identified overlying the fourth/ fifth rib:
      the latissimus dorsi (superficial) and serratus anterior muscle (deep) overlying the ribs.
