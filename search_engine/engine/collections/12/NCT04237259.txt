    
      Objectives: To preliminarily assess the effects and feasibility of parent-delivered TCM
      pediatric massage for ADHD symptoms in preschool children.

      Hypothesis: The parent-delivered TCM pediatric massage group would have greater improvement
      in children's hyperactivity, anxiety, and sleep disturbance symptoms when compared to the
      parent-child interaction group.

      Design and subjects: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 60 pair of children with
      pre-specified ADHD symptoms and their parent will be recruited and randomized to
      parent-administered TCM pediatric massage comparison group, and parent-child interaction
      group at a 1: 1 ratio.

      Interventions: Parents of subjects in the parent-administered TCM massage group (n=30) will
      attend 2 training sessions (5 hours in total) to learn and practice the parent-administered
      TCM massage for ADHD before treatment starts. The parents will be told to practice the TCM
      massage on their child every 2 days for 2 months. Parents in the parent-child interaction
      group (comparison group, n=30) will attend a 3-hour training course on line and spend extra
      time on interacting with their child at home.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Parent
      Scale (SNAP-IV-P). Other outcomes include Preschool Anxiety Scale (PAS), Children's Sleep
      Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Parental Stress Scale (PSS) for parental stress, and the
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI).

      Data Analysis: Differences in the scale scores and test parameters between groups will be
      examined using a linear mixed-effects model.

      Expected results: Subjects in the parent-administered TCM massage group will have greater
      improvements in the ADHD symptoms compared to those in the parent-child interaction group at
      week 4 and week 8.
