      programs. Participation rates in CRC screening, including primary colonoscopy programs,
      remain suboptimal. It is known that one of the strongest predictors of CRC screening
      participation rate is a physician, especially primary care physician (PCP), recommendation.
      Engaging a PCP tends to improve participation rate in organized and opportunistic cancer
      screening programs.

      To our best knowledge there are no randomized controlled trials, dedicated specifically to
      assess the effect of physician's counseling on participation rate in primary colonoscopy CRC
      screening programs. There is also no data on the impact of physician's counseling on
      patient's decision to choose unsedated (not in sedation) or sedated colonoscopy.

      In this study we aimed to quantitatively estimate the impact of a PCP's counseling on
      screening participation rate and utilization of sedation in the opportunistic primary CRC
      screening program when compared to the effect obtained by using a standardized information
      leaflet only.
