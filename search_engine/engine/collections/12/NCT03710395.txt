      gene, is highly expressed on the human lactating breast. Nifedipine, a known substrate of
      ABCG2, is used for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. ABCG2
      plays an important role on secreting drugs and xenobiotics into milk. The aim of the present
      study was to evaluate the effect of ABCG2 c.421C>A on nifedipine breast milk/plasma
      concentration ratio in hypertensive breastfeeding women. Nineteen hypertensive breastfeeding
      women treated with 20 mg slow-release nifedipine every 12 hours were investigated. Blood and
      breast milk samples were collected simultaneously 15-30 days after delivery and at least 15
      days after drug treatment, in order to reach drug steady state. All patients were genotyped
      for ABCG2 c.421C>A using real time-PCR. Nifedipine concentration was determined in plasma and
      breast milk by high-performance liquid chromatography using UV detection. The comprehension
      of the variability in the transport of nifedipine to breast milk in hypertensive
      breastfeeding women will contribute to the evaluation of drug exposure in breast-fed infants
      to nifedipine and other ABCG2 substrates.
