      intolerance (COI). COI can be a manifestation of primary chronic autonomic failure, which is
      covered under a separate protocol. The present protocol concerns patients with COI who under
      resting conditions have intact sympathetic neurocirculatory function. COI can reflect
      different pathophysiologic mechanisms; until now, few studies have attempted to distinguish
      these mechanisms in individual patients. We hypothesize that results of clinical assessment
      and physiologic, chemical, pharmacologic, and imaging tests will reveal internally consistent
      patterns that distinguish particular forms of COI. We wish to determine the relative
      frequencies of these forms in a referral population. The first phase of testing is to
      identify sympathetic neurocirculatory failure, baroreflex failure, and secondary causes of
      COI (hypovolemia, excessive orthostatic venous pooling, or excessive orthostatic
      extravasation). In a subsequent inpatient phase, tilt table testing is done, with concurrent
      hemodynamic and chemical measurements, to confirm subtypes of postural tachycardia syndrome
      and neurocardiogenic syncope. The results of these evaluations will be used for
      stratification of specific, pathophysiologically defined diagnostic groups for therapeutic
      protocols. In an off-site study, we will evaluate members of a large family where COI seems
      to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.
