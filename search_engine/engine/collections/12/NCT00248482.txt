      Primary

        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate in patients with c-kit positive,
           extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with maintenance therapy comprising
           imatinib mesylate after induction therapy comprising irinotecan and cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of imatinib mesylate maintenance therapy in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with irinotecan and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
           cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a response (partial or
           complete) or stable disease proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily for 6 months in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients may continue
           to receive therapy for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
