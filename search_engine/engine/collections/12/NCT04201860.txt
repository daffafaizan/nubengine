      detonation of micro-charges, while the cave unblocking procedure was performed by volunteers
      of blaster group and non blasters group of the Italian National Mountain and Cave Rescue, in
      a cave in Trieste (Italy; altitude entrance: 348 meters above sea level; total length: 413,5
      meters; total depth of 307 meters).

      Before going into the cave (Time 0), the following clinical data were collected: age, sex,
      body mass index; smoke (yes/no), heart rate, arterial blood pressure (mean arterial
      pressure), oxygen saturation measured with pulse oxymetry, epitympanic temperature, blood
      gases analyses and the haemostasis measures.

      After the accidental uncontrolled detonation of micro-charges, (Time 1) heart rate, arterial
      blood pressure, oxygen saturation measured with pulse oxymetry, epitympanic temperature,
      blood gases analyses and the haemostasis measures were recorded in each volunteers.
