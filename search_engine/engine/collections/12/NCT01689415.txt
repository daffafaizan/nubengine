      used in treatment for hypertensive patients, where the sympathetic nerves to the kidneys
      ablates. RND shows a significant reduction in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
      patients with treatment resistant hypertension.

      The hypothesis is that RDN is able to reduce the blood pressure in patients with previous
      stroke and treatment resistant hypertension and thereby reduce the risk of a new stroke.

      Aim of study:

        1. To validate the reduction in blood pressure after RND in patients with stroke and
           treatment resistant hypertension compared to the results achieved in patients only with
           essential hypertension

        2. To examine if this treatment is possible on patients after stroke (procedure related
           limitations and security of the patient)

        3. To describe the effect of RND in the development of changes in the white matter over
           time
