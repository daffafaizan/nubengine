      be recruited consecutively. Subjects who meets the inclusion criteria and agree to
      participate in the study will take coronary artery calcium scoring CT and asthma CT
      (inspiration and expiration images). The correlation between the degree of coronary
      calcification and airway diameter, airway wall thickness, air-trapping and emphysema will be
      evaluated as well as clinical parameters of asthma. We will also compare those correlations
      from the images of healthy control subjects who performed the coronary calcium scoring CT for
      health checkup purpose.
