    
      Aim 1: To improve the results notification system among all female adolescents who test
      positive for STIs in the ED using mobile phone texting technology.

      Hypothesis 1: We will increase our contact rate for STI positive adolescents in the ED from
      65-82%.

      Hypothesis 2: We will decrease the time interval between testing and appropriate STI
      treatment by the ED.

      Hypothesis 3: We will decrease the recidivism rates for STI positive patients diagnosed in
      the ED.

      Aim 2: To explore qualitatively the barriers to and preferences for partner notification and
      treatment among 14-21 year-old females and males being tested for STIs in the ED.

      Aim 3: To determine baseline rates of partner notification and preferences around partner
      notification among STI-positive females in the ED, and to explore the feasibility of ED
      personnel notifying their sexual partners.
