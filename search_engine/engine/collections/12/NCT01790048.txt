      the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with one of two supplementary foods for a
      period of up to 12 weeks. The overall purpose of this research is to see if your child will
      grow and gain weight more rapidly using one of two peanut butter foods as he/she recovers
      from protein-energy malnutrition.

      Subjects will be given a soy or dairy peanut butter food at their home. The peanut butter
      food has either small amounts of soya protein and minerals (iron, zinc) or whey powder and
      minerals added to them. Subjects will have enough food to feed the child for 2 weeks, and
      asked to return every 2 weeks to be weighed, measured and given more food. The parents of the
      subjects will be asked to feed their child this food until his/her weight has returned to
      what is considered normal for the child's height. Subjects will then return after 3, 6 and 12
      months for a check-up. At these check-ups, he/she will be measured and examined.

      The current standard of care is to allow the child to recover without food or with
      supplemental flour thus all participation is related to research. Participation in this study
      is expected to last 8-12 weeks of therapy with follow up in 12 months after completion of the
      therapy.
