      disease-specific indices, core stability, and balance in ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
      patients. AS patients were randomly assigned to either the Pilates group (PG) or control
      group (CG). The PG participated in Pilates training 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Patients in
      the CG were instructed to follow a home exercise program 3 times a week for 8 weeks.
      Assessments were performed before and after the interventions. Outcome measures were
      disease-specific indices, core endurance, and balance. Disease-specific indices were: Bath AS
      Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), Bath AS Spinal Mobility
      Index (BASMI), and the AS Quality of Life (ASqOL) questionnaire. Static core endurance was
      assessed with trunk flexor, extensor endurance, and lateral side bridge tests, while dynamic
      core endurance was assessed using modified sit-up test. Balance was assessed with static,
      dynamic, and single-leg stance postural stability (PS) and limits of stability (LOS) tests
      using the Biodex Balance System SD.
