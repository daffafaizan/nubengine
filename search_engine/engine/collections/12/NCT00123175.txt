    
      Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia is a condition usually caused by excessive stimulation
      of the uterine lining (endometrium) by estrogens, and may cause irregular bleeding as a
      presenting symptom, but rarely may progress to endometrial cancer, which makes treatment
      important. The only treatment approved so far is medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets
      (progesterone), also known as Provera.
