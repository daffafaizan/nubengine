      To compare the efficacy of the self-Epley manoeuvre to the Brandt-Daroff exercise in
      resolving vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV.

      Study Design:

      Single-blind randomized controlled study

      Sample Size:

      Fifty patients were recruited in the study and were divided with 25 patients in each
      treatment arm.

      Study Method:

      Patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and have given informed consent were randomized
      into the 2 treatment groups. A dedicated physiotherapist will demonstrate the selected
      exercise (either SEM or BDE) and observed the patient performing the exercise twice to ensure
      the ability of the patient to perform it correctly at home. A diary was provided for the
      patients to chart the therapy sessions performed at home as well as a pamphlet with simple
      illustrated instructions of the chosen exercise. The patients were asked to perform the
      home-based exercise for 2 weeks.

      Primary Outcome Measure

      - Resolution of vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV.

      Secondary Outcome Measures

        -  Vertigo resolution at 1 and 6 months;

        -  The conversion of positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test between both groups after 1
           month;

        -  Vertigo intensity in unresolved vertigo patients at 1 & 6 months;

        -  The Dizziness Handicap Inventory between both groups at 1 and 6 months.
