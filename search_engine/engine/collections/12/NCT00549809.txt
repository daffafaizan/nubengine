      mandatory ventilation associated with pressure support (SIMV/PS) related to duration of
      mechanical ventilation/weaning and length of stay in PICU (LS). Design: randomized clinical
      trial. Setting: Pediatric intensive care unit at a university-affiliated hospital. Patients:
      children between 28 days and 4 years old, admitted between 10/2002 and 06/2004, and receiving
      mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours. Patients were randomly assigned into two
      groups: IMV (IMVG; n=35) and SIMV/PS (SIMVG; n=35). Children with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome and tracheostomy were excluded. Ventilation and oxygenation data were recorded at
      admission and beginning of weaning. Results: Groups were not statistically different for age,
      gender, MV indications, PRISM score, COMFORT scale, sedatives, and ventilation and
      oxygenation parameters. Median of MV duration was 5 days for both groups (p>0.05). Also,
      there were no statistical differences for duration of weaning [IMVG: 1 day (1 - 6) vs. SIMVG:
      1 day (1 - 6); p>0.05] and LS [IMVG: 8 days (2 - 22) vs. SIMVG: 6 days (3 - 20); p>0.05].
      Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference between IMV and SIMV/PS in
      these children related to MV and weaning duration, and PICU length of stay.
