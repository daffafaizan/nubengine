    
      This study is a 12-week open trial to assess the efficacy of duloxetine (Cymbalta) for the
      treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD).

      Participants will visit the clinic 8 times to meet with the psychiatrist. They will receive
      duloxetine to see if it helps their major depression and Irritable Bowel symptoms. Upon study
      completion at 12 weeks, they will receive an additional 3 months of free medication treatment
      at our clinic.
