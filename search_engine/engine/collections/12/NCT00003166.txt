      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of bryostatin 1 as a 24 hour infusion and
      vincristine when administered sequentially.

      II. To determine the effect of this combination on programmed cell death (apoptosis).

      III. To determine the immunomodulatory effect of bryostatin 1. IV. To observe patients for
      clinical antitumor response after giving combination bryostatin 1 and vincristine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours followed immediately by vincristine IV.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients completing 6 courses of therapy may receive subsequent courses every 3
      weeks and then every 4 weeks after 24 months of treatment. Patients may return to a 2- or
      3-week treatment course at the discretion of the principal investigator.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1
      of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
