      infection diagnosed either on microbiologic cultures or strong clinical evidence of an
      infection..Worldwide, neonatal sepsis is responsible for 4 million deaths annually and 99% of
      them occur in developing countries.. . morbidity associated with sepsis includes
      sensorineural hearing loss, visual disturbances, seizures, and neurodevelopmental issues..
      Blood culture is considered as gold standard for diagnosis of sepsis. The ideal diagnostic
      test should be inexpensive, have quick results Hematologic scoring system(HSS) of Rodwell et
      al. includes the following: a) White blood cell and platelet count b) White blood
      differential count c) Nucleated red blood cell count (to correct WBC count) d) Assessment of
      neutrophil morphology for degenerative changes. A modified HSS(modified hematological scoring
      system) was developed by removing the repetitive parameters, adding a new parameter -
      nucleated RBC.
