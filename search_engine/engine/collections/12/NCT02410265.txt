      survey. Based on their answers, they are categorized into clinical, subclinical, and
      asymptomatic for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Those who meet the diagnostic criteria
      for GAD as detailed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 4th
      Edition are classified as clinical. Those who score a 5.7 or above using dimensional scoring
      of the GAD-Q-IV but are not "clinical" are classified as subclinical. All others are
      asymptomatic. After ruling out those with a clinical PTSD diagnosis (scoring 38 or above on
      the PCL5) and those currently receiving mental healthcare treatment, those who are clinical
      and subclinical are offered the opportunity to use one of the online programs. Those who
      accept are randomized between a guided self-help program, a self-help program, and a waitlist
      control group. Each student who enrolls will be reassessed at post-intervention (3 months)
      and followup (6 months later, or 9 months after completing baseline). Additionally, those who
      are classified as asymptomatic are invited to complete additional followup surveys at 3 and 9
      months to provide data on anxiety symptom change over time.
