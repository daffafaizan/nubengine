    
      This is an interventional, multi-national, multi-site, open-label extension study in patients
      with mild to moderate AD who completed the 24-week lead-in study 14861A (NCT01955161) or
      14862A (NCT02006641).

      Patients received 28-weeks of open-label treatment with idalopirdine 60 mg/day (option to
      reduce to 30 mg/day) as adjunctive treatment to donepezil. Approximately 100 patients, who
      had completed the initial 28-week period (OLEX), were included in a 24 week open-label
      treatment period with memantine (OLEX-MEM) that evaluated the safety and tolerability of
      concomitant memantine therapy in patients who were already on a stable treatment with
      idalopirdine and donepezil and for whom memantine treatment was clinically indicated.
