      university-based acute care general medical service. Patients will be asked to identify a
      CarePartner (CP) living outside their household; CPs will be spouses, adult children, and
      others in their social network willing to play an active role in their transition support.
      Patients will be randomized to the intervention or usual care. Intervention patients will
      receive automated assessment and behavior change calls, and their CPs will receive structured
      feedback and advice following each assessment. Patients' clinical team will have access to
      patients' assessment results via the web, will receive automated reports about urgent health
      problems, and will be able to communicate asynchronously with patients and CPs using a secure
      web page and a specially designed voicemail service. Patients will complete surveys at
      baseline, 30- and 90- days post discharge; utilization data will be obtained from hospital
      records. CPs and clinicians will be interviewed to evaluate intervention effects on processes
      of self-care support, caregiver stress and communication, and the intervention's potential
      for broader implementation. The primary outcome will be 30 day readmission rates; 2ndary
      outcomes include functional status, self-care behaviors, and mortality risk.
