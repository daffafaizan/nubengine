      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of SU5416 in
      combination with irinotecan in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      II. Determine time to disease progression, objective response rate, and survival time in
      these patients receiving this regimen at the MTD.

      III. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SU5416.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and SU5416 IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 4 of weeks 1-6. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are accrued to receive treatment with SU5416 and irinotecan at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
