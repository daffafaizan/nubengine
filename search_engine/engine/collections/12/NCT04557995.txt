      altitude polycythemia. People reside in highland diagnosed as high-altitude polycythemia were
      included and randomly divided into two groups. In one group, routine therapy including oxygen
      inspiration would be performed, while in another erythropheresis would be added. Symptom
      relief, blood oxygenation, and 6-minute walk test would be assessed and compared in the above
      two groups.
