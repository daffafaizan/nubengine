      record data that a computer constructs into two- or three-dimensional images. A small amount
      of a radioactive drug is injected into the body and a scanner is used to make detailed images
      of areas inside the body where the radioactive material is taken up by the cells. Using a
      gamma camera (a special kind of scanner), we can create a better picture of the lymph node
      region. We will compare these pictures to images from your CT scan, to help plan your
      therapy.

      The research in this study involves seeing if it is feasible to use SPECT scanning procedures
      for the purpose of planning your radiation treatment. We hope that doing so will allow us to
      more accurately and precisely plan radiation treatment to potential sites of cancer, and
      avoid delivering too much radiation to normal
