    
      This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial of evolocumab versus placebo in patients
      with ASCVD and DM on clopidogrel and aspirin undergoing ePCI. The study is aimed to assess

        1. the effect of evolocumab therapy on platelet activation and reactivity;

        2. the effect of evolocumab on biomarkers of platelet activation and inflammation.

      Eligible patients will be randomized prior to start the PCI equally to either:

        1. 420 mg evolocumab ; or

        2. placebo. The randomized treatment will be administered in subcutaneous injections.

      The laboratory assessments will be performed before (baseline), and 16-24 hours and 30-days
      after randomization.

      Subject participation will be 30 days from the randomization.
