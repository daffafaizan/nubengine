      evaluated. Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with
      continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in
      this study. Alternative dosing schedules of OMP-54F28 may be explored based on emerging
      nonclinical and clinical data for safety, PD, PK and efficacy. The starting dose for a new
      dosing schedule will be chosen to result in an AUC equivalent to the highest dose level that
      cleared on the previously studied dosing schedule. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be
      allowed within a dose cohort.

      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined,
      up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the
      safety, tolerability and PK of OMP-54F28 combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Up to
      approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.
