    
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the changes in genomic and immune biomarkers in tumor,
      peripheral blood and stool samples, in addition to changes in radiomic profiles, of subjects
      with advanced Mismatch Repair Proficient Coloretal Cancer (MMRp-CRC), Pancreatic
      Adenocarcinoma (PA), or Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) during combination treatment of durvalumab
      (inhibitor of PD-L1) with either olaparib (inhibitor of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP])
      or cediranib (inhibitor of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor [VEGFR] tyrosine
      kinases).
