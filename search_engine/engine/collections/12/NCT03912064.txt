      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses. This drug has been used in other research
      studies and is now FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma. Many people have also received
      ipilimumab on research studies for possible treatment of prostate cancer, lymphoma, kidney
      cancer, ovarian cancer and HIV infection. Information from those other research studies
      suggests that ipilimumab may help to treat the participant's cancer.

      Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against CTLA-4. An antibody is a common type of protein
      produced by the body that the immune system (a system that defends the body against
      potentially harmful particles) uses to find and destroy foreign molecules (particles not
      typically found in the body) such as bacteria and viruses.
