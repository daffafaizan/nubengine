      anesthesia. Manometry of the esophagus is not a standard part of surgery or general
      anesthesia. The investigators will be using standard solid state high resolution manometry.
      One of the authors (JPC) evaluates all routine manometry for patients undergoing such
      procedures at both UCSF and SFGH. The use of manometry in patients recovering from anesthesia
      will permit the investigators to assess the recovery of a normal swallowing mechanism. An
      adequate determination of return of normal swallowing sequence is likely to determine the
      safe time for extubation. The investigators propose to, as a research study, investigate
      esophageal motor function using standard high resolution esophageal manometry in 10 patients
      recovering from general anesthesia. These studies are likely to document that the return of
      normal pharyngoesophageal function will coordinate with verbal commands to initiate
      swallowing. This pilot study will help clarify the precise timing of the return of normal
      function in the oropharynx and the proximal esophagus and thus determine the safe time for
      removal of the endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.
