      crystalloid and colloid groups. Crystalloid group receive only crystalloid, and colloid group
      receive hydroxyethyl starch (HES, 130/0.4). The maximum volume of HES is limited less than 30
      ml/kg. The same transfusion protocol will be applied in both groups. From the day of
      operation to postoperative 7 days, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinin level
      (Cr) will be checked. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined when there is more than 50%
      increase in Cr when compared to baseline level. The investigator will compare the clinical
      outcomes including AKI between two groups.
