      scans for complicated cysts, the trial to obtain the enhanced accuracy using CT scan would be
      still valuable, when we consider its widespread use. A previous study demonstrated that the
      enhancement of HU with intravenous administration of contrast material on CT scan by 15 HU
      would be "almost always indicative of a pathologic process although not always a malignancy",
      another study showed the cut-off as 42 or 47 HU gap would be helpful in the prediction of
      renal malignancy.
