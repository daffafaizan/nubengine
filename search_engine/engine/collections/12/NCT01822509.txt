    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ipilimumab or nivolumab administered to
      patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies following allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. (Phase I) II. To characterize the toxicity of ipilimumab or nivolumab
      administered at the MTD in this patient population. (Phase Ib)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate. II. To assess progression free and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the phenotypic and functional effects of ipilimumab or nivolumab on immune
      cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 14 days for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 12
      weeks beginning at cycle 5 (24 weeks after the first dose of ipilimumab) for up to 4 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving clinical
      benefit will have the option to continue with ongoing maintenance dosing every 12 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab
      IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to a total of 60 weeks (including Induction)
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
