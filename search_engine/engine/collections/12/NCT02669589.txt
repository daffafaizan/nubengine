      To evaluate the effect of regional citrate anticoagulation within the scope of continuous
      renal replacement (CRRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on filter
      life span and 90-day all cause mortality.

      Patient population: critically ill patients with acute kidney injury requiring renal
      replacement therapy.

      Primary objective:

      Anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit is required in continuous RRT (CRRT). To this
      date, it is not clear which anticoagulant should be used for CRRT. Regional citrate
      anticoagulation (RCA) for CRRT in critically ill patients with AKI prolongs filter life span
      and reduces 90-day all cause mortality by approximately 8% (from 48% to 40%) compared to
      systemic heparin anticoagulation for CRRT
