      will be presented with the protocol. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled all the
      procedures will be planned. A 18F-FDG PET/CT will be done. Surgery will be conducted within 3
      hours after the I.V. injection of 18F-FDG according to the standard procedure applied in the
      visceral surgery department. During the surgery, emission of Î²+ from the lesion (s) seen
      during the PET/CT will be detected with the probe.

      Resected pieces will be analysed histologically.
