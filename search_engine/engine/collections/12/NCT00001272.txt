    
      This is a Phase I study which addresses the feasibility and toxicity of adding taxol to the
      two drug combination which now comprises the standard of care in newly diagnosed advanced
      stage ovarian cancer, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. These drugs will be given in a dose
      intensive fashion with the colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF. Newly diagnosed patients with
      ovarian cancer will be treated with this regimen to determine the optimal dose of this
      combination. The pharmacokinetics of taxol and cisplatin DNA-adducts will be studied as well.
