    
      This is a randomized, multi-center, dose finding, open label, positive controlled Phase II
      study of the efficacy and safety of once-per-cycle of F-627 compared with Neulasta®
      (pegfilgrastim) in women with breast cancer who are receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy (TC:
      docetaxel + cyclophosphamide or TAC: docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various single
      cycle doses of F-627 as compared with the standard dosing of Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) in
      breast cancer patients experiencing myelotoxic chemotherapy. Myelotoxicity in this study will
      be defined by the duration of moderate neutropenia; the number of days in which the patient
      has had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.0 × 10^9/L during the first cycle of their
      chemotherapy treatment (each chemotherapy cycle is expected to last 21 days). This, by
      definition, includes grade 3 (moderate) and grade 4 (severe) neutropenia. Doses of F-627 to
      be tested for subjects receiving TC chemotherapy are 80 µg/kg/dose, 240 µg/kg/dose, and 320
      µg/kg/dose. For subjects receiving TAC chemotherapy, only 240 µg/kg/dose and 320 µg/kg/dose
      are to be tested.
