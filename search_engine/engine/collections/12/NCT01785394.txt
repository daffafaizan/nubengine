      immunotherapy. Their selection will be done in accordance with the criteria listed in Chapter
      9 of the World Allergy Organization Position Paper on specific immunotherapy 2009 and in
      compliance with the rules for good clinical practice.

      Proposed primary variable: the difference between the changes of exhaled breath temperature
      before and in the pollen season of subjects treated with grass-pollen sublingual
      immunotherapy and the untreated control patients.

      Suggested secondary variables: changes over time of exhaled breath temperature in the two
      groups, difference in symptoms scores, methacholine responsiveness, rescue medication usage.

      Statistical analysis: On the basis of the available data about the variability of exhaled
      breath changes and its changes upon flare up of airway inflammation or after
      anti-inflammatory treatment we have calculated a sample size of 20 subjects in each group to
      be sufficient to prove differences in the primary variable with a significance level <0.05.
      However, as this is "first time ever" type of pilot study on sublingual immunotherapy and
      exhaled breath temperature in grass-pollen patients, this estimate is relative. By all means
      this study will identify trends to be used for sample size calculations in future studies.
      During the second year of the study when all patients will be on active treatment with 5
      grass allergen extract, carry over effects from the first year of treatment with 5 grass
      allergen extract or placebo on exhaled breath temperature will be explored.
