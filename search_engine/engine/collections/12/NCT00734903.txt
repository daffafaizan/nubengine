      ones. The goal of this study was to examine the efficacy a gender-focused model of SUD
      treatment (A Woman's Path to Recovery, WPR) compared to an evidence-based active comparator
      that is not gender-specific (12-Step Facilitation, 12SF), in a sample of for women Veterans.
      The investigators randomized 66 women Veterans, ages 18-65, who were diagnosed with current
      SUD and used substances in the last 90 days. The treatment phase was 12 weekly individual
      therapy sessions and all participants could also obtain treatment-as-usual (any other
      treatments they chose to attend). Assessments were conducted at baseline, end of treatment
      and 3-month follow up. Sample size was based on power analysis (an effect of .80 at a .05
      level of significance). The primary outcome variable was substance use, with various
      secondary outcomes also studied (e.g., psychosocial functioning, psychiatric symptoms, coping
      skills, 12-step attendance). Urinalysis / breathalyzer (biological measures) were also
      included to validate substance use self-report. The investigators hypothesized that
      participants in the experimental condition (WPR) would have more positive outcomes on both
      primary and secondary variables compared to those in the comparison condition (12SF). The
      investigators also hypothesized that WPR patients would increase coping skills more and 12SF
      would increase 12-step attendance more, relative to the other condition.
