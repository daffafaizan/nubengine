      between 70 - 80% of all HCC are in the Asia-Pacific because of the prevalence of chronic
      viral hepatitis in the region. The increase in the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in the
      Western world however predicts that HCC will similarly be an important cause of death there
      in the next 20 years.

      Only 15-20% of HCC are today potentially curable by surgery at the time of diagnosis. Another
      10-15% of patients may benefit from potentially curative locally ablative therapy such as
      radio-frequency ablation. Prognosis in the majority of patients has been dismal as
      conventional systemic therapies have been largely inefficacious. The first successfully
      trialed systemic targeted therapy, sorafenib (2007) prolonged survival by a modest average of
      3 months in patients with good underlying liver function.

      While the liver is radio-sensitive, external beam radiation causes significant
      radio-toxicity. To overcome this, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) was developed
      to deliver a radiation source directly to liver cancer via the arterial route. Sir-sphere is
      radioactive yttrium on a 90 micro-meter diameter resin carrier and is an established therapy
      in colorectal metastasis. Sir-sphere has been reported to cause significantly tumour
      regression in HCC.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of SIRT using SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres
      compared to sorafenib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced primary HCC.
