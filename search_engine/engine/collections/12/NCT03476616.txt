    
      The present study plans to enroll obese patients (BMI= 30-40 kg/m2) of 30-75 years of age,
      with untreated or never-treated essential hypertension to either eplerenone-based or
      valsartan-based therapy Patients visiting hypertension center(s), eligible to participate in
      the study and meeting study's inclusion criteria, will at first thoroughly be informed of
      study's protocol rationale, including scheduled follow-up visits. There will be a period of
      2-4 weeks, at which medical history will be taken, as well as somatometrics, including
      height, weight, BMI and waist circumference. Moreover, a thorough clinical examination will
      take place, including office blood pressure, ECG, heart-echo, renal ultrasound, blood and
      urine ultrasound. All women of gestational age should have pregnancy test.

      At randomization visit, patients still meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomized (1:1) to either eplerenone (E) 25mg bd or valsartan (V) 160mg od for 8 weeks. At
      8, 16 and 24 weeks, patients at both arms will be evaluated with ambulatory BP measurements
      primary, as well as home and office BP measurements. At week 8, patients with controlled
      hypertension (mean ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) <130/80mmHg), will continue
      in monotherapy with eplerenone or valsartan and patients with uncontrolled hypertension (mean
      24-h ambulatoryâ‰¥130/80mmHg) will continue with the addition of calcium-channel blocker,
      amlodipine (C) 5 mg od. At week 16, patients achieving BP control will continue in either
      monotherapy (E), (V) or dual therapy (E+C), (V+C). However, in patients not achieving blood
      pressure target, a third drug, thiazide-like-diuretic will be added [indapamide (D) 1.25 mg
      od]. All groups at both arms will be finally evaluated at 24 weeks.
