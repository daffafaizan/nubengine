      (HVPS) are both electrotherapeutic agents which can be used for pain relief in
      musculoskeletal conditions. Standard TENS devices usually deliver biphasic pulsed currents
      with a pulse duration between 50 μs and 1000 μs and pulse frequencies between 1 and 250 pps.
      HVPS devices are TENS-like devices which deliver direct current with twin monophasic spiked
      pulses of 10-500 V (500-ohm load) with a short pulse duration (microseconds). In both
      conventional TENS technique and HVPS for pain relief, the aim is to activate spinal gating
      mechanism by selectively stimulating large diameter Aβ fibers. Theoretically, high-frequency
      (~10-250 pps), low-intensity (nonpainful) currents are most efficient in selectively
      activating Aβ fibers, which is practically recognized by the user reporting 'strong but
      comfortable' nonpainful electrical paresthesia beneath the electrodes. There is no available
      evidence for the efficacy of TENS in patients with subacromial pain. Also, there has been
      little experimental work on the effects of HVPS on pain relief in the literature, as well as
      no known study for its efficacy in SAPS.
