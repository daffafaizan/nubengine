    
      In the CLL2-BCG-trial, a total of 62 patients of an allcomer CLL population (irrespective of
      physical fitness, previous therapies and prognostic factors) with an indication for treatment
      will be included. Patients will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with bendamustine
      unless contraindications (e.g. refractoriness) are present or a debulking is not indicated
      due to a low tumor burden. Afterwards, 6 cycles of induction treatment with GA101
      (obinutuzumab, 3 doses in the first cycle and monthly in cycles 2-6) and CAL-101 (idelalisib,
      continuously starting in cycle 2) will be applied. The primary endpoint overall response rate
      will be assessed at final restaging (2 months after end of induction treatment). Patients
      benefitting from treatment receive further therapy with GA101 (3 monthly) and CAL-101
      (continuously) in a maintenance phase for up to 24 months. Maintenance treatment will be
      stopped in case of achievement of a complete remission and confirmation of MRD (minimal
      residual disease) negativity in peripheral blood or if unacceptable toxicity or progression
      occurs.
