      pediatric and family medicine) from across Northeast Ohio who have at least a 20% Medicaid
      patient population. We are using a cross-over study design. After the run-in period during
      which baseline data is collected via chart review and all practices receive basic education
      in the 3 focal areas of lead, dental and obesity screening, the practices will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups.

      The Phase 1 group will receive the practice-tailored intervention with the Practice
      Facilitator (PF) starting immediately after randomization and continuing for 6 months. The
      Phase 2 group will start their practice-tailored intervention with the PF 4 months
      post-randomization and continue through post-randomization month 10.

      This design gives us a natural 'control' group (Phase 2 group) for the first four months
      post-randomization. The Phase 2 group will have had the same Run-in Phase education as the
      Phase 1 group, but will not be starting the practice-tailored intervention with the study
      facilitator for 4 months, at which time they will cross-over to their Intervention Phase.

      Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 groups will have a 2 month Follow-up Phase after the completion of
      their 6 month Intervention Phase. During the Follow-up Phase they will strive to continue
      reaching the outcome measures on their own without the support of the PF. This will give us
      an opportunity to assess short-term sustainability of the rates of delivery of services
      achieved during the Intervention Phase.
