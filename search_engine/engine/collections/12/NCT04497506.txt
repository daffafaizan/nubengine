      Adolescents and young people learn and develop new competencies and facets in the digital
      society. Hence, a large part of their social relationships takes place through social
      media.This offers them numerous positive opportunities for the emotional and social
      development of adolescents and young people. They can develop positive interactions through
      prosocial behaviors, empathy, and social support towards others. At the same time it is not
      without potential risks, especially in adolescence, a stage of psychological vulnerability
      for risky behaviors. Very recently, interest in scientific social psychology has grown due to
      a new approach to interventions, which have been called "wise interventions." This approach
      involves a set of rigorous techniques, based on theory and research, that address specific
      psychological processes to help people thrive in various life environments. The main
      objective of this project is to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a wise intervention
      based on self-affirmation (SA) and Implicit Theories of Personality (ITP) to promote various
      online prosocial behaviors (help, empathy, collaboration) and prevent online risk and
      harassment behaviors (online bullying, sexting, grooming). Secondary objectives are (1) to
      assess the moderating role of gender and the degree of evolutionary development of
      adolescents and young people, and (2) to evaluate potential mediating mechanisms for the
      effectiveness of the interventions. The study will involve the evaluation of the intervention
      in a sample of around 1000 young and adolescents randomly allocated to experimental and
      control condition.
