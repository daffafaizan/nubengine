        1. Measure and compare the physical activity of the anesthesiology residents and attendings
           during routine daily work in the main operating room as determined by the
           pedometer-counted steps walked by every individual

        2. Estimate the physical activity outside of work by responding to survey of the past seven
           day exercise recall

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the physical activity of resident and
      attending anesthesiologists. We hypothesize that the attendings will walk more steps than
      residents at work, but it is possible that the residents will be more active in their spare
      time. In addition, we hypothesize that the first year residents, likely associated with
      inefficiency in work pattern, will have more physical activity at work compared to the third
      year residents. The final objective of this study is to compare the physical activity of
      these two groups to the recommended guidelines for healthy lifestyle.

      We anticipate that this study will provide us with an idea of the physical activity of the
      'average anesthesiologist' in USA and will be useful for determining the need of promoting
      exercise for healthier lifestyle.
