      groups depending on whether postoperative delirium or not. This study aims to characterise
      the gut microbiota in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with postoperative
      delirium. The CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit) was used for
      delirium assessment.

      General anesthesia was induced as follows: 0.3 mg kg-1 intravenous (IV) etomidate, 2 mg IV
      midazolam, 0.4 μg kg-1 IV sufentanil, and 0.2 mg kg-1 IV cisatracurium. Anesthesia was
      maintained with an end-tidal concentration of 2-3 vol% sevoflurane and 0.2-0.3 μg kg-1h-1
      sufentanil to maintain the bispectral index between 40 and 60.
