      abdominal wall and 2 electrodes into the muscularis propria of the stomach. Well established
      procedure, called pyloroplasty, will be performed during the implantation of GES system,
      therefore all participants will have both surgeries done at the same time. Half of them will
      be randomized to keep GES ON after surgery, and other half will have GES turned OFF for 3
      months.

      Both groups will be followed for additional 3 more months. Study related questionnaires and
      diagnostic/ clinical tests will be obtained at all points of interest of this study.
