    
      GS-9256 (an HCV NS3 protease inhibitor) plus GS-9190 (non-nucleoside HCV NS5B inhibitor) will
      be administered for 28 days with and without RIBA (weight-based dosing) and with PEG/RIBA in
      treatment-na√Øve subjects with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection. In Part A, thirty (30)
      subjects with genotype 1 will be randomized to 75 mg GS-9256 BID plus 40 mg GS-9190 BID or 75
      mg GS-9256 BID plus 40 mg GS-9190 BID plus RIBA 1000-1200 mg/day for 28 days. In Part B, an
      additional fifteen (15) subjects with genotype 1 will receive 75 mg GS-9256 BID plus 40 mg
      GS-9190 BID in combination with PEG/RIBA for 28 days. After the 28-day treatment period,
      subjects will receive PEG/RIBA as standard of care (SOC).

      In Part A, for any subjects meeting pre-defined, individual, virologic criteria, PEG/RIBA
      standard of care will be started prior to Day 28.

      Both PEG and RIBA will be administered at their currently approved dosages for treatment of
      HCV infection in accordance with appropriate labeling. Subjects will be monitored for safety
      (including ECG monitoring), antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, and resistance 2-3 times
      weekly through Day 28.
