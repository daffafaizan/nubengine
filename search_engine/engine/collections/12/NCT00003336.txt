        -  Determine the rates of durable engraftment in patients with severe aplastic anemia,
           myelodysplastic syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism, or inherited hematopoietic
           disorders, refractory to medical management, who are undergoing high-dose
           chemoradiotherapy followed by unrelated cord blood (UCB) transplantation.

        -  Evaluate the rate and quality of immunologic reconstitution in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to weight (under 45 kg vs over 45 kg).

      Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy as a conditioning regimen
      beginning 6-9 days before the umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). The regimen varies
      according to the underlying cause of the anemia, but could include busulfan, cyclophosphamide
      or melphalan, anti-thymocyte globulin or methylprednisolone, and/or radiation therapy. One
      day after the conditioning regimen is completed, patients receive the UCBT.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 months, then every 6 months for 2.5 years,
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-90 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
