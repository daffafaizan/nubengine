      protein during the induction of airway inflammation in asthma. This aminopeptidase-like
      protein may be involved in processing of the type I TNF receptor to a soluble form. We
      propose to study the role of this aminopeptidase-like protein in the setting of late phase
      asthmatic airway inflammatory responses following segmental allergen challenge in mild
      allergic asthmatics.
