      "standard" or "MET/MI" treatment, with a 1- and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures
      will include (1) treatment retention (e.g., number of sessions/weeks completed, the rate of
      patients completing 3 or more subsequent sessions, and (2) substance use (e.g., urinalyses,
      days of opioid, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol use, rates of abstinence). Secondary outcomes
      will include motivation, psychosocial functioning, HIV risk behaviors, treatment utilization,
      and patient satisfaction. Process assessments will include measures of the working alliance
      as well as therapist adherence/competence ratings which will evaluate how effectively MET/MI
      was implemented. Participating CTPs will implement one of two independent protocols,
      depending on which is the best suited or feasible for the intake procedures at their clinic.
      Thus, following an invitation to participate, explanation of the study, and provision of
      informed consent, patients would complete a brief assessment battery followed by either: 1)
      Random assignment to 3 individual sessions of standard treatment (treatment as usual) at the
      program versus 3 individual sessions of MET. or 2) Random assignment to 1 individual standard
      assessment/evaluation session.
