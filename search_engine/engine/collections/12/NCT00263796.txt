      characterized by social and language deficits and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests.
      Functional imaging is becoming a very useful tool in trying to understand the neurobiology of
      autism. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the brain to assist with labor and lactation.
      Recent evidence suggests that it may be involved in social attachment and in repetitive
      behaviors. In this project, we will study how oxytocin changes the way the brain of autistic
      adults processes faces, and deals with response inhibition (the ability to interrupt ongoing
      responses should they prove ineffective or interfering with attaining a goal). There is
      currently no functional imaging data assessing the effect of oxytocin on the brain. We will
      explore the activation patterns in response to oxytocin across circuits involved in social
      cognition (face fusiform area) and response inhibition (caudate, orbitofrontal and
      dorsolateral cortex) by administering a specific fMRI task activating those circuits before
      and during an oxytocin infusion. We will also explore the effect of oxytocin in these areas
      by administering specific cognitive testing not associated with fMRI before and during
      oxytocin infusion.
