    
      Falls and fall injuries are common-potentially preventable-causes of mortality, morbidity,
      functional decline, and increased health-care use and cost among community-living seniors
      over 75 years of age.

      The knowledge gained from this project will directly address the Canadian Patient Safety
      Institute's priority areas for research in the Applied Health Services Research Stream by
      evaluating an innovative approach to reducing adverse events in a community-based (home care)
      setting.

      The project will also identify the prevalence, determinants and costs of falls and fall
      injuries among older people requiring home care services. The design will be a two-armed;
      single blind randomized controlled trial of 110 older people 75 years and over, at risk for
      falls receiving hom care in Ontario. Subjects will be randomly allocated to either usual home
      care (control) or the interdisciplinary team. In the interdisciplinary group, a team of
      professional home care service providers, with specialized training in falls prevention, will
      proactively provide a comprehensive, coordinated and evidence based approach to falls
      prevention. The results will inform policies and practice related to the allocation and
      delivery of home care services for falls prevention across Canada.
