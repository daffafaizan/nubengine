      cancers of the head and neck. The standard treatment is surgical excision, followed by
      radiotherapy in selected cases, such as high-grade tumors, and/or in the presence of
      perineural invasion, and/or in the presence of advanced disease. Some selected salivary gland
      histotypes such as salivary duct carcinomas (SDC) and adenocarcinomas, NOS (not otherwise
      specified) distinguish themselves for the expression of androgen receptors (AR), which is
      reported in 21% to 43% of the cases. Thus, similarly to prostate cancer (Pca), androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) has been suggested to be beneficial in patients with recurrent or
      disseminated AR-expressing disease.

      The proven activity of ADT in AR expressing SGC as well as in Pca, suggests a common clinical
      behaviour by apparently sharing the same biological background. Once Pca becomes resistant to
      castration it still remains driven by ligand-dependent AR signaling and further hormonal
      manipulations are active and efficacious. Abiraterone acetate is currently approved by FDA
      for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We treated with abiraterone two patients
      with AR-positive adenocarcinoma who had progressed on ADT, both patients showed a partial
      response suggesting the activity of a second line hormonal therapy in SGCs.

      Based on the above biological and clinical evidences, the aim of the trial is to assess the
      activity of abiraterone in AR-expressing castration resistant SGCs.
