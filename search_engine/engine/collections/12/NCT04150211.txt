    
      Triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, pilot safety, and efficacy
      study.

      30 healthy physically active males (40 to 60 years old) suffering from knee joint
      inflammation and pain after training were randomly assigned to the Exten(d) or Placebo group.
      During the first visit and after 4 weeks supplementation (either 2 g daily of Exten(d)
      capsules or placebo capsules) the participants were subjected to a three-stage exercise
      session: (i) running biomechanical assessment, (ii) exercise physiology maximal effort test
      and (iii) running biomechanical assessment after the incremental exercise to exhaustion. The
      volunteers have been assessed to determine: (1) inflammation by I-R thermography and pain
      perception, (2) running technics though biomechanic analysis and (3) performance.
