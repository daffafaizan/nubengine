        -  Determine the confirmed complete and partial response rate in patients with locally
           advanced or metastatic epidermoid carcinoma of the penis treated with docetaxel.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-5.8
      years.
