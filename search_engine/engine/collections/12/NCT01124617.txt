      hospital or medical school team works on a medical research study), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-control (participants
      are randomly assigned to a test treatment or to an identical-appearing treatment that does
      not contain the test drug), and parallel-group (each group of participant will be treated at
      the same time) comparison study in Japanese participants with chronic pain due to painful
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia. The duration of study will be 14
      weeks. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (1 Week before study commences on Day 1);
      Treatment (12 weeks and will include titration period [from the initiation of the study
      treatment to determination of the individual's maintenance dose] and maintenance period [from
      completion of the titration period up to12 week]); and Follow-up (1 Week). Tapentadol
      hydrochloride ER oral tablet or matching placebo will be administered twice daily for 12
      weeks. Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated through Numerical Rating
      Scale (NRS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
