      colonoscopy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients will be randomized
      into one of two study arms using a computer generated randomization list. 160 patients will
      be enrolled in total. All patients will be instructed by the study coordinator on the
      importance of adherence to the protocol in the leaflet emphasizing its importance to the
      colonoscopy quality. In addition, patients in Arm 2 will be given information about the
      application features. The application will have push notifications to inform patient on time
      of start of dietary changes, type of diet, time of preparing the solution, time of drinking
      the solution, reminder of their appointment, etc. All patients will then be interviewed by
      the research coordinator to evaluate the adherence to the assigned diet and compliance with
      the prep protocol as the main outcome and the ease of the application and the patient's
      attitude towards having such application as secondary outcomes. Based on the results of
      similar studies that assessed the use of software system to improve compliance, the
      investigators' sample size was a calculated assuming similar results. Calculations showed
      that 78 patients per arm will be enough to attain significance. The number 80 was chosen as
      attrition is presumed to be low. As for the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be
      used for data entry and analysis.
