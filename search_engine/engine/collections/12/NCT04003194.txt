      includes two treatment periods [control period (½ c. green beans each day) and pinto beans (½
      c each day)], each 12-weeks in duration with a 4- week wash-out period to determine the
      impact on fasting glucose, postprandial glucose and HbA1c concentrations. After a baseline
      wash-in period, 16 participants are randomly assigned to 2 treatment periods [control period
      and pinto beans], each 12-weeks in duration. On 28 randomized days during the wash-in period
      and interventions, participants keep diet records and measure a postprandial capillary
      glucose concentration using a glucometer 1 hour after the meal during which the pinto beans
      or control are consumed. Before and after each 12-week intervention, participants provide a
      fasted venous blood sample for glucose and HbA1c analyses.
