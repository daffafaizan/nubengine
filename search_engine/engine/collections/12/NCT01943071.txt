      of the day care centre programs by comparing results from municipalities with (intervention
      group) and without (comparison group) a day care centre program designed for people with
      dementia using standardized assessment tools. Furthermore, a survey will be used to explore
      the communication and co-operation between the professional staff at the day care centre, the
      patients and the family carers by administering questionnaires to all three parties. Only
      patients with mild degree of dementia will be asked to participate in the questionnaire.
      Finally, qualitative interviews will be made with 20 dyads of patients and family carers to
      collect their in depth experience with the day care centre program. Five of these patients
      and their family carers will be followed closely as case examples for two years.
