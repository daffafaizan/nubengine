      Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM as pulp capping agents in primary molars. The objective of
      this study include the evaluation of clinical and radiographic efficacy of Calcium Hydroxide
      cement (Dycal) 速 and Calcium Silicate cement (Biodentine)TM, and their response in direct
      pulp capping treatment on primary molars during a 6 months follow up. After following the
      proper standardized procedure for direct pulp cap. In the current study direct pulp capping
      was performed using calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal)速 and Calcium Silicate cement
      (Biodentine)TM on 60 primary teeth of children equally divided between 2 study groups
      randomly of both the sexes aged 4-9 years old. Complete case history was recorded in detail
      and intraoral periapical radiograph was also taken for teeth indicated for direct pulp
      capping. Written consent was obtained from the parents of participants before starting the
      procedure. Strict standardized procedure had been followed and the pulp capping agent
      (Dycal速/BiodentineTM) were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions.Each patient
      was evaluated clinically and radiographically for any abnormal clinical signs and symptoms at
      1,3 and 6 months postoperatively.Better results for the success of the study could be
      relatively enhanced by close attention to rigid criteria for case selection, standardization
      of direct pulp capping procedure and meticulous performance of the procedure appear to be
      prerequisites for successful treatment.
