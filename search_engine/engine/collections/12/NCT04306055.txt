    
      In order to assess the effects of a questionnaire on blood donor recruitment, the
      investigators designed two kinds of self-administered, standardized and structured
      questionnaires. In addition of the basic socio-demographic characteristics, one questionnaire
      includes the information of precautions of blood donation during epidemic, and the other dose
      not.

      Information of precautions of blood donation during epidemic included taking donor's
      temperature and enhancing hand disinfection before donation etc.

      The questionnaires were randomly sent to ever blood donors, and at the same day, equal number
      of ever blood donors as the ones who filled the questionnaire are coded as control.
