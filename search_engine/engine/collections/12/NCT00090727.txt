    
      This study is for people who have advanced cancer for which standard chemotherapy did not
      work or for which there are no reliably, effective treatments.

      AQ4N is an experimental chemotherapy that is thought to target tumor areas with low oxygen
      content and low blood supply; tumor areas that are usually the most resistant to standard
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment. AQ4N may be beneficial in cancer treatment by
      interfering with a protein that is required for cells to grow and divide, causing tumors to
      die or to delay their growth.

      All patients in this study will receive AQ4N. The dose will be increased for each new patient
      or group of patients until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.
