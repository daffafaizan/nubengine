      will be randomized to the ultrasound monitoring group or the symptoms alone group. In the
      symptoms alone group, urination is monitored by asking at regular intervals about the onset
      of spontaneous urination and the patient is catheterized only on a symptomatic basis or if
      spontaneous voiding has not started 10 hours after the spinal anesthesia. Symptoms that
      indicate catheterization are lower abdominal pain or need to void. In the ultrasound group,
      urinary retention is monitored according to current practice with an ultrasound scanner and
      the patient is catheterized if residual urine exceeds 800 ml or if the patient is
      symptomatic.

      The primary outcome variable is the change in IPSS score from the baseline to 3 months after
      the procedure. The baseline score is evaluated preoperatively.
