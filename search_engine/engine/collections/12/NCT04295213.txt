      precursor of functional constipation in childhood. The cause of harder stools in childhood is
      incompletely understood. But it is likely that harder stools in childhood are linked to among
      others withholding behaviour of stools and a low fibre intake. As hard stools may precede
      functional constipation, the aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a prebiotic
      fiber versus a placebo on defecation parameters in healthy children with hard or lumpy
      stools. We hypothesize that consumption of a prebiotic fiber results in softer stools.
