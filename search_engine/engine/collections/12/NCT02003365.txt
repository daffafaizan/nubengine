      patients â‰¥40 years of age with OA of the knee.

      Patients were enrolled sequentially with 8 patients per cohort, as follows:

      Cohort A: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 20 Cohort B: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 16
      Cohort C: FX006 10 mg, Final Visit at Week 12 Cohort D: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 12
      Cohort E: Triamcinolone acetonide immediate-release (TCA IR) 40 mg, Final Visit Week 12

      Each patient was evaluated for up to 12, 16, or 20 weeks following a single IA injection
      depending on the assigned cohort. Following the screening visit, safety was evaluated at 3
      out-patient visits and synovial fluid was collected at Day 1 for baseline measurements and
      the Final Visit for drug concentration measurements.
