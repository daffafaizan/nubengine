      trial with follow-up immediately after the injection and at day 2, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and
      12. In this study investigators will compare the effectiveness of ketorolac compared to
      corticosteroid.

      Subjects being seen for a rotator cuff injury will be randomized into one of three treatment
      groups pertaining to their pathology. The intervention will begin once the subject has
      consented and answered the Baseline Outcome Shoulder Questionnaire. The Baseline Outcome
      Questionnaire consists of the Visual Analog Score, American Shoulder and Elbow Score, Single
      Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Short Form-12, and questions
      pertaining to patient characteristics, injury characteristics, co-morbidities, patient
      history, medications, and demographics.
