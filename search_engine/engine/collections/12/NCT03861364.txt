      general anesthesia. When combining anesthetic drugs, the hypnotic effects are often
      synergistic. Propofol is associated with hypotension and bradycardia and used together with
      remifentanil or sedative agents it may give synergistic or additive sedative and hemodynamic
      effects.

      Claeys (1988) and Fairfield (1991) examined the cardiovascular effects of propofol 2-2.5
      mg/kg induction dose and found significant reductions i SBP and SVR and small changes in CO,
      SV and HR. De Wit (2016) examined hemodynamic changes in different steady state propofol
      serum concentrations, and found a dose dependent SBP reduction, reduction in resistance of
      arterial and systemic circulation and a reduction in mean systemic filling pressures (MSFP)
      indicative of a reduction in "stressed volumes". The effective dose (ED) 95% for loss of
      consciousness for propofol was determined to 1.75 mg/kg when used alone, and 1.38 mg/kg when
      used together with remifentanil 0.25 microg/kg/min (total induction dose 1.75 microg/kg
      remifentanil) in a study by Koh et al. We want to examine the hemodynamic effects of giving a
      low (1.4 mg/kg) vs a high (2.4 mg/kg) propofol dose combined with a moderate remifentanil
      dose (about 1.5 microg/kg).
