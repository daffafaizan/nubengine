      neurodevelopmental disability. Data from animal models suggest that brain cooling immediately
      after injury is neuroprotective. Experience with total body cooling during surgery,
      accidental near drownings, and one Phase I trial of term infants suggest that it is effective
      and safe in children.

      This large multicenter trial tested whether cerebral cooling initiated within 6 hours of
      birth and continued for 72 hours would reduce the risk of death and moderate to severe
      neurodevelopmental injury at 18-22 months corrected age. Infants at least 36 weeks gestation
      with an abnormal blood gas within 1 hour of birth, or a history of an acute perinatal event
      and a 10-min Apgar score <5, or continued need for ventilation were screened. Following a
      neurological exam, those with moderate to severe encephalopathy were randomized to a 72-hour
      period of total body cooling (cooling blanket, followed by slow re-warming). The study was
      conducted in two phases: Phase I (20 infants) were examined for the safety of an esophageal
      temperature of 34-35 C; Phase II (main trial, 200 infants) were evaluated for the safety and
      efficacy of an esophageal temperature of 33-34 C. Cardio-respiratory, electroencephalograms
      (EEGs), renal, metabolic, and hematologic status, and esophageal and abdominal skin
      temperature were monitored during the 72 hours of intervention.

      Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 18-22 mos of age by masked certified examiners.
      The outcome at 18-22 months showed that whole-body cooling reduces the risk of death or
      moderate to severe disability in infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

      Surviving infants were assessed at 6-7 years (school age).
