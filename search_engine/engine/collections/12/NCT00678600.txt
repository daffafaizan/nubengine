    
      This study will compare the effectiveness of standard and enhanced care alerts in HIV
      infected participants at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

      Participants will be a part of this study for 4 years or until they are no longer followed at
      Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants will be assigned randomly to one of two arms.
      Participants assigned to Arm 1 will receive standard care, involving standard provider alerts
      which will be posted on the participant's health record. Participants assigned to Arm 2 will
      receive enhanced care, involving improved functionality. Experimental informatics-based
      provider alerts and support systems will be used to develop a pilot system designed to
      optimize delivery of HIV clinical care.

      All participants will be monitored for new laboratory toxicities, suboptimal follow up, and
      virologic failure at their normally scheduled appointments.
