      viral replication such as protease and polymerase inhibitors, nowadays the standard treatment
      in genotype 1-chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the combination of peghylated interferon (PEG-IFN)
      and ribavirin for 48 weeks. It has been extensively shown that patients infected with HCV
      genotype 1 have a lower rate of viral response than those infected with genotype 2 and 3. In
      large randomized multinational trials, sustained virological response (SVR) of around 50% has
      been obtained with peginterferon α2a plus ribavirin in the more difficult to treat subgroup
      of patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Furthermore, advanced fibrosis is a predictive
      factor of non response to antiviral treatment in genotype 1 virus [5-7]. Very few studies
      have evaluated SVR difference, if any, between subtypes 1a and 1b.

      We have carried out an observational study on a large cohort of HCV "naïve" patients to
      evaluate the influence of HCV subtypes 1 on the response to treatment with Peg-INF plus
      ribavirin.
