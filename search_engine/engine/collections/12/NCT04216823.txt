      reported for infraclavicular brachial plexus block, axillary brachial plexus block,
      interscalene brachial plexus block, and supraclavicular brachial plexus in adult patients.
      The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of perfusion index on success of
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block in pediatric patients.
