      the uterine vasculature, embolization procedures of the left and right uterine arteries (as
      required) will be performed on each patient, using OCL 503 as the embolic agent. Patients in
      Cohort 1 will proceed to hysterectomy 1 week after embolization, and patients in Cohort 2
      will undergo hysterectomy 1 month after embolization. Tumor response, as measured by changes
      in leiomyomata size and perfusion, will be determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging or
      Magnetic Resonance Angiography. Histology of the resected uterus will be conducted to
      evaluate inflammatory response and viable tumour tissue.
