      the loss of CD4+ T cells and the cytokines these cells secrete, especially IL-2 and
      interferon-gamma. Antiretroviral agents do not directly address the problem of immune
      impairment. Replacement of IL-2 at nontoxic doses may prevent or delay clinical
      immunosuppression and its attendant opportunistic infections. Also, since patients with HIV-1
      infection respond suboptimally to routine protein and polysaccharide immunizations, IL-2 may
      provide an adjuvant effect on vaccine responses.

      Patients are randomized initially to receive their own antiretroviral therapy alone or in
      combination with IL-2 for 24 weeks, after which each group is crossed over to the other
      treatment assignment (i.e., IL-2 is either added or deleted from the regimen) for an
      additional 24 weeks. Patients who are vaccine eligible receive influenza, tetanus and
      diphtheria toxoid, and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines at week 4, and those who have
      not received pneumococcal vaccine prior to study entry will receive it at week 8.
