      year and their incidence shows an exponential rise after the age of 40. Since life expectancy
      is dramatically and continuously increasing worldwide, hematological diseases promise to
      become a substantial burden for the health care systems of the European society. The
      management of hematological malignancies is further complicated by the high level of disease
      heterogeneity in terms of pathogenic and molecular mechanisms. Due to the high level of
      heterogeneity in terms of cytogenetic, genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional,
      post-transcriptional and metabolic alterations, an accurate molecular classification of
      hematological diseases is needed to improve clinical outcomes and patients' management. This
      is an exploratory multicenter, non-interventional, translational, retrospective and
      prospective study. All patients with a diagnosis of hematologic disorder or malignancy for
      whom biological samples and clinical data are available may be included in this study, after
      obtaining informed consent. The primary objective is to improve our knowledge of the
      pathogenic mechanisms driving malignant disorders and transformation. The secondary
      objectives aim to improve diagnosis and stratification of onco-hematological patients and
      study drug response at preclinical level. After signing informed consent to the study, each
      patient will donate part of the samples (peripheral blood, bone marrow, biopsies) collected
      as per routine clinical practice for the management of their disease.
