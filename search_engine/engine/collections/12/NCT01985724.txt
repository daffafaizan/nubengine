      positive breast cancer. At least five large randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the
      addition or sequential administration of a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an
      anthracycline-based regimen resulted in superior clinical outcome for women with node
      positive or high risk node-negative early breast cancer. In two large randomized studies the
      dose dense administration with G-CSF support of anthracycline-based and paclitaxel
      combination was superior to the same regimen administered every three weeks without growth
      factors as adjuvant therapy in women with axillary node positive breast cancer. In one
      randomized trial, docetaxel was proved superior to paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      Data from at least one trial suggest that four cycles of a non-anthracycline but
      taxane-containing adjuvant regimen (docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide) provide outcomes that
      are at least as good, if not better than four cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
      combination.
