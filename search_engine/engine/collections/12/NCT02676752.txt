      I. To obtain pilot data of the elasticity of skin/soft tissues using shear wave elasticity at
      the defined anatomical sites in head and neck cancer survivors with lymphedema and fibrosis
      (LEF).

      II. To explore the correlation between elasticity of skin/soft tissues and the following: 1)
      symptoms as measured by the Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-Head and Neck
      (LSIDS-HN); 2) functional impact as measured by Cervical Range of Motion Device and the
      Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey; and 3) physical exam findings as measured by Head
      and Neck LEF Grading Criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be evaluated for LEF status using the Head and Neck External Lymphedema -
      Fibrosis (HN-LEF) Grading Criteria and neck range of motion using the Cervical Range of
      Motion Device. Participants also complete study questionnaires, including Vanderbilt Head and
      Neck Symptom Survey (VHNSS) and Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey - Head and
      Neck (LSIDS-H&N). Participants undergo ultrasound shear wave elastography over 20-25 minutes.
      Participants' cancer disease and treatment information will be gathered from their medical
      records.
