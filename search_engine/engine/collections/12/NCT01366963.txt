    
      Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that affects an estimated 500,000 people
      in the United States alone and is an important source of disability in young adults. It shows
      a strong predilection for females. POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance characterized by
      an excessive increase in heart rate (>30 bpm) on assuming the upright position associated
      with orthostatic symptoms, but in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. Their symptoms of
      dizziness, nausea, tremor, chronic fatigue and exercise intolerance make even simple
      activities of daily living exhausting prospects.

      Brain fog or cognitive dysfunction is a common and almost universal complaint among persons
      with POTS. There is a lack of pathophysiological understanding to this cognitive dysfunction
      and is also a major roadblock to the development of effective therapies for people with POTS.

      The purpose of this study is to better define the cognitive dysfunction seen in patients with
      POTS. We will use a series of validated neuropsychological tools in order to characterize
      POTS cognitive dysfunction and compare this data to age and gender matched control subjects.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To assess whether POTS patients have more neuropsychological abnormalities than control
           subjects during seated assessments.

        2. To assess whether POTS patients have more neuropsychological abnormalities than control
           subjects during assessments while standing.

        3. To ascertain the phenomenology of any neuropsychological deficits distinguishing POTS
           patients from controls.
