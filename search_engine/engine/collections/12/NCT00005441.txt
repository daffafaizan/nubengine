      Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death among postmenopausal women. Yet few
      studies have examined the potential for altering risk factors for coronary heart diseases
      among postmenopausal women, especially as a result of comprehensive lifestyle changes. A
      pressing need existed for controlled studies to evaluate the effects of comprehensive
      lifestyle changes on risks for coronary heart disease among postmenopausal women.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The comprehensive lifestyle management program appeared to produce substantial cardiovascular
      benefits among men but little was known about the behavioral processes through which change
      occurred. Its generalizability and applicability -- especially for high-risk women --was
      uncertain. The program was compared to a usual care condition in an initial randomized trial.
      Outcome measures included patient self-care behaviors and health outcomes (serum lipid
      profiles, blood pressure, relative weight, and glycemic control). Process measures included
      self-efficacy, personal health models, perceived stress, social support and problem-solving
      skills. Subjects participated in the intervention for three years, with gradual fading of the
      program in the third year to evaluate the long-term effects of the program. Analyses included
      assessments of between groups differences on physiological risk factors, behavioral
      (lifestyle) measures and process measures as well as maintenance over time. Based upon the
      results of this study, the long-term goal was to design a second outcome study in which the
      revised intervention would be evaluated with a larger sample to determine the relative
      contribution of adding moderate exercise and the effects on reversal of coronary heart
      disease.
