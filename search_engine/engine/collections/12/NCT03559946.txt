      efficacy of treating patients with OAB. We will compare the efficacy of a condensed (twice
      weekly) protocol to the standard (once per week) protocol of PTNS therapy.

      Objective #1 (6-wk CP vs. 12-wk SP) is to show that 6 weeks of the condensed protocol (CP)
      will yield a higher efficacy compared to the standard 12-week protocol (SP). If this 6-week
      CP is proven effective, candidates for PTNS treatment could potentially experience symptom
      relief in half the time as the current standard of care, improving their quality of life
      quicker. Objective #2 (12-wk CP vs. 12-wk SP) is to show that 12 weeks of the CP will have a
      higher efficacy compared to the 12-week SP. If the superiority of this 12-week CP is proven,
      it could be beneficial in treating patients with refractory OAB.
