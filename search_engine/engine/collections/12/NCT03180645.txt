      treatment groups: test product/positive control, test product/no treatment or positive
      control/no treatment at the baseline visit. Product application within treatment group will
      be further randomised to either the right or left side of the face. Participants will apply
      one of the assigned treatments to one side of the face (left or right) and another assigned
      treatment to the other side of the face as per the randomisation schedule. Participants will
      be instructed to apply the assigned treatments twice daily (morning and evening,
      approximately 8-12 hours apart) for 4 weeks (28 days).
