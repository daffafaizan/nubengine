    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and cohort expansion study designed to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor
      activity of MGD013 administered by IV infusion every 2 weeks. The study consists of a Dose
      Escalation Phase to determine the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD) of MGD013 if no MTD
      is defined, followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial
      antitumor activity of MGD013 with the dose established in the Dose Escalation Phase.

      In the Dose Escalation Phase, MGD013 will be evaluated in sequential escalating flat doses in
      successive cohorts of 1 to 6 patients each. Upon completion of the Dose Escalation Phase, a
      Cohort Expansion Phase will be initiated at the MTD/MAD.

      Patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors of any histology will
      be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase. The Cohort Expansion Phase will be limited to
      selected cohorts of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors
      or hematologic malignancies for whom there is no available therapy likely to confer clinical
      benefit. Two additional cohorts will enroll patients with gastric/gastroesophageal cancer or
      epithelial ovarian cancer, with MGD013 given every 3 weeks.

      A separate cohort will evaluate the combination of MGD013 with margetuximab (anti-HER2
      monoclonal antibody) in approximately 99 patients, in subgroups with HER2-positive gastric or
      gastroesophageal cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer, and any other HER2-positive cancer.
