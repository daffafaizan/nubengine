      treatments for pulmonary artery stenosis. Specifically, vessels that fail to respond to
      balloon inflation at 8 ATM will be individually randomized to 1 of 2 treatment pathways. In
      the first treatment pathway, the vessel is dilated using a CB, followed by additional low
      pressure balloon dilation (< 8ATM). In the second pathway,the vessel is dilated with high
      pressure balloon angioplasty, with balloon inflation pressures exceeding 15 ATM. Cross-over
      therapy will be permitted for failed high pressure treatment starting with enrollment of
      patient #15. The primary outcome assessment for efficacy will be a comparison of percent
      change in minimum lumen diameter before and after randomized therapy, as determined by a core
      laboratory blinded to pathway assignment. The primary outcome assessment for safety will be a
      comparison of the proportion of vessel dilations resulting in any serious adverse events, as
      determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Patient-level safety endpoints will also
      be tabulated. Patients can have multiple vessels enrolled; analytical techniques will adjust
      for potential intra-patient correlation.
