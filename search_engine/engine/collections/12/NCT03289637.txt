      analysed. In those with a 25-OH-vitamin D level <50nmol/L the patients that accept
      participation, will be randomised into active supplementation as described below, or placebo.

        -  In those with a 25-OH-vitamin D level <25nmol/L there will be a supplementation of
           2400IU daily

        -  In those with a vitamin D level 25-50nmol/L there will be a supplementation of 1600IU
           daily,

        -  or placebo. Thus based on the basal level of vitamin D the screened patients will either
           be excluded due to high level of vitamin D, or given one ot the two options of vitamin D
           dosage based on the basal patient level - or placebo.

      The intervention time will be 12 months. In the project 200 heart failure patients will be
      included. Blood samples including heart failure biomarkers, and biomarkers for inflammation
      and oxidative stress will be drawn at 3,6, 9 and 12 months.

      Health related quality of life will be evaluated by use of Euro-QoL-5D Minnesota Living with
      Heart Failure.Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20
      questionnaire, as also hospitalisation during the project time.

      Cardiac function according to echocardiography will be analysed at start, and study end.
