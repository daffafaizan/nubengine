      hip/knee/ glenohumeral joint will be enrolled according to strict inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All patients will be selected and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups
      based on clinical presentation. Participants will be exposed to abdominal liposuction
      procedure under local anesthesia for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC)
      harvesting. Stem cells will be separated from fat cells in the adipose tissue then activated
      in the Polish Stem Cell Bank. The activated stem cells will be injected into the knee joint
      via 22G spinal needle. The intra-articular stem cells injections will be performed under
      ultrasound guidance at the theater under spinal anesthesia. Each patient will receive a
      single dose of at least 10 million of ADMSC in 3 mL of normal saline every three months for
      12 months (maximum four doses in total and at least 40 million of ADMSC in total) via
      ultrasound guided intra-articular injection. During the study period and 24 months after last
      injection they will be followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the injected joint. The local and systemic safety of the
      procedure and therapy with ADMSC will be also determined during study.
