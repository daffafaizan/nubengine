      cirrhosis. Post-hoc analyses of one of these studies suggested that treatment with
      spironolactone had a positive effect on muscle strength and endurance. This effect was
      probably caused by an increase in concentration of Na, K-pumps (sodium-potassium pumps)
      enabling the muscle cell perform better.

      To verify this finding we have designed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial with skeletal muscle strength, -endurance, Na, K-pump content, cardiac
      systolic, and diastolic function as primary endpoints. Spironolactone is tested against
      placebo in 40 participants included among our admitted and out-clinic patients. Muscle
      function-tests, muscle biopsy and trans-thoracic echocardiography is performed before and
      after 12 weeks of treatment.
