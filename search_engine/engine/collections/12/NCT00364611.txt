        -  Study registration on Day 1: Treatment Cycle 1 was initiated within 14 days of signing
           informed consent

        -  Treatment was administered in 3 week treatment cycles until the participant developed
           unacceptable toxicity, had disease progression, withdrew consent, or died

        -  If participants experienced a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable
           disease (SD) at Cycle 8 or beyond or had unacceptable toxicity due to docetaxel, they
           could continue on bevacizumab and/or trastuzumab until they developed unacceptable
           toxicity, had disease progression, or withdrew consent

        -  Participants had follow-up assessments within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment
           with the last of the study drugs for any reason other than death
