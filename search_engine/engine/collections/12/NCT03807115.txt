      shows that walking capacity can be improved by rehabilitation interventions such as motor
      imagery, rhythmic auditory cueing, task-oriented training and aerobic exercise. Despite
      strong evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions on walking capacity, many
      clinicians (occupational therapists (OTs) and physical therapists (PTs)) do not use these in
      their practice. This knowledge translation (KT) pilot study aims to support evidence-based
      practice amongst rehabilitation clinicians working in stroke rehabilitation and collect data
      to inform a future larger clinical trial that will investigate if having repeated exposure to
      an innovative KT intervention will: increase clinicians' use of four targeted rehabilitation
      interventions (listed above) and positively affect walking capacity and independence in daily
      activities in patients after stroke. The investigators will recruit 2-3 OTs and 2-3 PTs per
      site from 6 major inpatient stroke rehabilitation centres across Canada to participate in a
      KT intervention consisting of an interactive and readily accessible web-based platform to
      deliver evidence-based knowledge on 4 rehabilitation interventions targeting walking
      capacity. This will be done via email in short online educational capsules including
      strategies for implementing the interventions and tools to promote reflection on current and
      future practice. They will then ask clinicians for feedback on: 1) the value of the knowledge
      delivered via email; 2) their perceptions about the success of using the guidelines with
      specific stroke patients; 3) the barriers they experienced when using the platform; and 4)
      the actual benefits for their patients. Through this innovative KT intervention, clinicians
      will have an opportunity to reflect upon and subsequently modify their practice to include
      evidence-based interventions known to improve walking capacity and functional independence.
