      (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin) for one week. With routine dose applied,
      (dapagliflozin 10mg/d, empagliflozin 10mg/d, canagliflozin 100mg/d), blood glucose level
      could be improved with small expected effect on body weight and no effect in lipid metabolism
      after the treatment period of one week. Normal glucose tolerance subjects (diagnosed of OGTT)
      were included as the control group.According to previous studies in three major SGLT2
      inhibitors currently on the market, an increase in urinary glucose excretion and a decrease
      in blood glucose within three days after application in mice and human could be observed.
      Therefore, the short-term treatment cycle in this study is intended to be set at one week,
      and can be extended to two weeks if there is no significant decrease in blood glucose.

      The insulin sensitivity, islet beta cell secretion function and islet alpha cell function of
      diabetic patients were measured at baseline (before taking SGLT2 inhibitors) and one week
      after taking SGLT2 inhibitors, of normal glucose tolerance subjects were measured only at
      baseline. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on islet cell function and insulin sensitivity would
      be evaluated in order to study the extrarenal action mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors.
