    
      PASSIVATE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIa trial that investigates
      how 12 months of treatment with AZD5718 modifies coronary plaque volume. Patients with recent
      STEMI or NSTEMI will receive an additional oral dose of AZD5718 (or placebo) once daily to
      standard clinical care for 12 months. The primary hypothesis being tested in PASSIVATE is
      that 12 months of treatment with AZD5718 attenuates the progression of non-calcified plaque
      (NCP) volume on serial computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) studies.

      Patients who gave consent (within 30 days after their index event) will undergo a CTCA scan
      and start treatment (AZD5718 or Placebo). The treatment duration will be 12 months. During
      the treatment period, patients will come to the clinic for follow-ups. At 12 months (end
      treatment), the patients will undergo their 2nd CTCA scan. A follow-up visit will be
      performed 4 weeks after the last dose in order to ensure the safety and well-being of the
      patients.
