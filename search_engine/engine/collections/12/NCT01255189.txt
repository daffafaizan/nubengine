      intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leucomalacia. Near infrared spectroscopy
      offers the possibility of noninvasive and continuous bedside investigation of cerebral
      oxygenation in newborn infants. Using this technique we investigated the effect of positional
      changes on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants.
