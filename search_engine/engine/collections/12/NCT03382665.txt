      study will serve the purpose of confirming long-term safety and performance of the Hyperion®
      system. The performance of the Hyperion® THA System will be evaluated using standard scoring
      systems (Merle d'Aubigné Score, HOOS Score). Safety will be evaluated by adverse event
      reporting.

      The study will be performed at 6 sites, enrolling in total 70 patients. Follow-up visits are
      planned after 3 to 6 month, 1, 2 and 5 years. The scores will be filled in pre-operatively
      and post-operatively until 5 years. In order to obtain mid- to long-term patient satisfaction
      data the patient questionnaire will be send to the patient at 7 and 10 years, additionally.
      Xrays will be done pre-operatively, immediate post-operatively and at each of the Follow-up
      visits.
