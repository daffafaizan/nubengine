      the U.S. population, one subgroup within the epidemic remains on the fringe of scientific
      study and effective treatment options. The super obese patient, in this instance defined as
      those with a BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2, presents a difficult treatment challenge in managing this level
      of obesity. While bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic
      diversion with duodenal switch, have been shown to be effective in severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40
      kg/m2), the risks involved with surgical intervention in the super obese patient are high.

      Qsymia provides a potential opportunity to develop an effective treatment plan that would be
      an adjunct to surgical intervention in the super obese patient. Use of Qsymia in addition to
      a low-calorie dietary prescription pre-operatively would effectively decrease weight prior to
      surgical intervention, lowering surgical risk to some extent. Additionally, if continued
      post-operatively, Qsymia as an adjunct to the post-surgical dietary plan would potentially
      extend the weight loss horizon so that the probability of the typical weight loss plateau at
      12-18 months is decreased.
