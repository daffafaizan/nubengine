      individuals maintain a number of relationships but still report feeling lonely. Thus, a
      neurobiological account of loneliness requires that we understand how the brain represents
      our subjective connections to others and how loneliness alters these representations. The
      long-term goal of this proposal is to identify how subjective isolation is represented in the
      brain in order to identify novel ways to intervene on this representation to attenuate
      loneliness. We propose that the brain organizes our representations of people based on our
      subjective connection to them and that loneliness systematically alters this organization. In
      Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether subjective closeness organizes self and other
      representations in the brain. While undergoing fMRI, participants will complete tasks in
      which they reflect on themselves and other people. They will also report on their subjective
      closeness to the other people. We will test whether the brain organizes mental
      representations of the self and one's own social network members based on subjective
      closeness. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how loneliness modulates self and other
      representations in the brain. In Specific, Exploratory Aim 3, we will determine the cognitive
      consequences of altered self and other representation in loneliness. Our proposal is
      imperative for ultimately revealing neurocognitive mechanisms to intervene on to reduce
      loneliness.
