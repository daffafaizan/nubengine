      receive, the longer they live. One uses the drugs capecitabine and oxaliplatin which all
      patients on this study will receive. Bevacizumab is an antibody which blocks blood flow to
      tumors and increases how long patients with colorectal cancer live. However, it can increase
      the risk of stroke and heart attack. Bevacizumab is currently a standard part of treatment
      for colorectal cancer. Cetuximab is an antibody which blocks a protein called EGFR which
      shrinks colorectal cancer. It may be helpful with initial chemotherapy and with bevacizumab.
      One goal of this study is to find out the response rate (chance of tumor shrinking) with two
      treatments for colorectal cancer. All patients will get capecitabine, oxaliplatin and
      cetuximab. Half will receive bevacizumab. All drugs in this study are approved to treat
      colorectal cancer. This research study is being done to find the best, safest way to combine
      these therapies.
