    
      This is a pilot, phase I, placebo controlled clinical trial of short-term high-dose thyroid
      hormone to promote remyelination in MS. Permanent clinical disability in MS is likely caused
      by the neuronal damage and degeneration that follows recurrent demyelination with progressive
      failure of remyelination. Thyroid hormone (TH) is required for central nervous system (CNS)
      myelination during development, and CNS remyelination in animal models of MS, a process
      similar to developmental myelination, has also been found to be promoted by TH. This study
      will ascertain the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of TH in people with MS,
      explore reliability for a potential signal of treatment efficacy and mechanism, and optimize
      procedures for a full scale clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of pulsed TH for
      promotion of remyelination in MS.

      The safety and tolerability of this treatment will be assessed using subjects' self-report of
      symptoms, the validated Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale (HSS), and blood pressure measurements. a
