      strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment. Improved treatments for patients with
      BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes. This study aims to test the
      efficacy of Naltrexone/Bupropion (NB; FDA-approved anti-obesity combination medication) for
      the treatment of BED in patients with and without obesity. The RCT will provide new findings
      regarding the efficacy of NB medication for reducing binge-eating episodes among patients
      with BED, for reducing weight among patients with BED and obesity, and whether patients with
      and without obesity derive differential benefit from NB.
