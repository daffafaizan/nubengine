      diseases. Although great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side
      effects associated with transplantation,acute graft-versus-host disease(aGVHD) remains an
      important complication that occurs in 35-80% patients. The mortality of aGVHD is positively
      correlated with its severity. At present, glucocorticoids is still the first line treatment
      of aGVHD. If glucocorticoids treatment is ineffective, second line drugs would be taken, such
      as tacrolimus(FK506), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). However,
      no method could be continuously effective. The effective rates of second line treatment to
      aGVHD is only about 60%. The effective rates and prognosis of refractory aGVHD are even
      worse.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and
      treating GVHD after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of refractory
      aGVHD using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor is rarely reported. If such
      treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used
      as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of
      donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status
      of a patient is urgent.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with
      refractory aGVHD.
