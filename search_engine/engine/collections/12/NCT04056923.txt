      surgeons, especially given that more and more patients with ground glass nodules are being
      detected recently. One of the most significant current discussion concerning wedge resection
      is nodule localization. At present, a commonly used localization method is the CT-guided
      percutaneous lung puncture methylene blue staining marker localization, but this method has
      two main disadvantages: 1. the methylene blue dye is easy to spread, affecting the
      intraoperative judgment of nodule position by surgeon; 2. patients often suffer additional CT
      radiation. In recent years, the three-dimensional (3D) printing technique has been gradually
      applied to clinical therapy. However, 3D-printed template-guided (3D-G) localization required
      pre-evaluation by CT scanning. If deviation of more than 2 cm was found on the CT scan, the
      3D-G method was regarded as a failure and traditional CT-G hookwire localization was used. To
      further clarify the confounding factors, the investigators developed their own 3D printing
      localization procedure. In contrast to traditional CT-G percutaneous puncture localization,
      the 3D printing localization procedure was performed in the operating room without CT scan
      evaluation.
