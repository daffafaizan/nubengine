    
      The trial is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial whereby between 40 and 49 type-1
      diabetic, adult volunteers, aged 18 and above, will be recruited per site from 7 secondary
      care centres (Sheffield, Kings College Hospital London, Harrogate District Hospital,
      Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Dumfries and Galloway Royal
      Infirmary and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary). The sites will be required to recruit participants
      to at least 3 CSII DAFNE (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating)courses and 3 MDI DAFNE courses.
      This will mean that in total on the trial, 140 participants are randomised to CSII and 140 to
      MDI. Participants will be recruited through direct approach if already on the waiting list
      for a DAFNE course or through advertisement in various clinics.
