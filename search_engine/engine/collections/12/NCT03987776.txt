      low-grade chronic inflammation is associated with obesity and related cardiometabolic
      disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and some type of cancers. Diet
      has a major role in the etiology of obesity, and there is a growing body of evidence
      suggesting that a variety of dietary factors can modulate obesity-induced chronic low-grade
      inflammation and thus the course of obesity-related chronic non-communicable diseases. The
      present intervention study aims to evaluate the effect of an anti-Inflammatory diet on weight
      loss, body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors and immune system response among younger
      adults. A nutritional intervention based on an energy-restricted anti-inflammatory diet will
      be compared with an isocaloric standard diet (55-60% carbohydrates, 25% fat, 15-20% protein).
      The inflammatory potential of the diet will be assessed with the Dietary Inflammatory IndexÂ®.
