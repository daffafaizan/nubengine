      of sperm DNA contamination. With the switch from cleavage stage biopsy to biopsy of the full
      (hatching) blastocyst, this potential risk of contamination can be neglected and could allow
      the use of conventional IVF in PGT cases. Especially in cases of non-male factor infertility,
      the use of conventional IVF can be applied as a more 'natural' insemination method.

      The investigators will perform a pilot study on sibling oocytes including participants with
      non-male factor infertility and requesting PGT-A (PGT for aneuploidy). If at least 10 cumulus
      oocyte complexes (COCs) are obtained after oocyte retrieval, half of the oocytes will be
      subjected to ICSI and the other half to conventional IVF. Preimplantation development is
      followed by time lapse imaging and blastocysts (day 5-7) fulfilling the biopsy criteria will
      undergo trophectoderm biopsy to detect the ploidy state and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
      copy number.

      The main objective is to analyse if the use a more physiological insemination method (IVF)
      has a beneficial impact on the ploidy state of the blastocyst as compared to ICSI within the
      same participant. As the embryos will be cultured in a time lapse imaging system, annotations
      can be made and the differences in maturation rate, fertilization rate and embryo development
      between both insemination methods can be analysed as secondary outcome parameter. On top of
      this, the PGT-A outcome will also display the mtDNA copy number which can be compared between
      IVF and ICSI biopsied sibling blastocyst. Euploid blastocysts will be transferred in
      subsequent frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles and give an indication on the clinical outcome
      between IVF and ICSI.
