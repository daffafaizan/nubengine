      routes will be admitted to this 6-week inpatient, crossover study. They will participate in
      15 experimental test sessions, each lasting approximately 6.5 hours, during which they will
      receive a range of acute doses of aprepitant, including placebo, followed by challenge with
      oxycodone or placebo (given intranasally or orally). Multi-dimensional outcomes, including
      physiological (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pupil diameter), subjective (questionnaires
      related to mood, abuse liability) and observer ratings will be collected repeatedly
      throughout each session. Data will be analyzed using parametric approaches to within-subject
      designs.
