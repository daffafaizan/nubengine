      possible to anticipate not-inferiors results with full posology and to determine the benefit
      ratio/risk improvement. This could lead to an important reduction of the treatment costs.
      This study also aims to better identy the "non responders" patients in order to refine the
      indications. Thanks to the participation of a French urologic paediatric surgery centers, the
      study hope to homogenize practices and to use standardized common criteria of judgement.

      Lastly, this study should appreciate if it is possible not to more bring back posology to the
      weight of the child, but on detrusor surface allowing a more precise estimation of the
      amounts to be managed.

      A complementary study on the quality of life of these children before and after treatment
      will be carried out thanks to Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ 50). The diagram of the study
      is a randomized therapeutic test controlled not-inferiority aiming at comparing an amount
      full versus an half-amount with TBA.

      The population of the study will be made up children from 3 to 15 years treated for detrusor
      hyperactivity, confirmed by an aurodynamic assessment according to the criteria of
      International the Society Continence, origin neurological, and resistant to the medical care
      associated with the usual accompanying measures.
