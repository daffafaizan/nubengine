      dialysis or kidney transplantation. Dialysis, despite its effectiveness in prolonging ESRD
      patients' lives, is a burden. Successfulness in kidney transplantation will restore good
      quality of life in ESRD patients. However, one of the most important complications that lead
      to transplant failure is graft rejection. It is already known that the pathophysiology of the
      rejection is immune response. Recent evidence showed that regulatory T cell (Treg) plays a
      central role in preventing graft rejection by inhibiting recipient alloimmune response (1-3).
      Characterization of Treg numbers and/or functional changes under various conditions may lead
      to a new preventive measure and/or a novel therapeutic strategy for graft rejection.

      Kidney transplantation is conducted under general anesthesia. Interestingly, several agents
      used in general anesthesia have also modulated immune functions (4-12). Although the effect
      of inhalation anesthetic agents on leukocyte count has been shown, the effect on Treg
      function has totally been unknown. Knowing the effects of inhalation agents on Treg numbers
      and functions will be beneficial to intraoperative management during transplant surgery,
      aiming toward reducing the risk of graft rejection in the future.
