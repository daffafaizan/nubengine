    
      Cook MyoSite, Inc. (Cook MyoSite) is committed to conducting rigorous, controlled clinical
      trials with variable inclusion and exclusion criteria based upon the indicated use under
      investigation. Participation in our clinical trials is the first and most preferable route to
      access our investigational product.

      We understand that there may be patients with a serious, life-threatening disease or
      condition that have explored all other treatment options and are unable or ineligible to
      participate in our clinical trials. Expanded access, otherwise known as "compassionate use"
      or "pre-approval access," is a potential pathway to access an investigational product that a
      patient may otherwise be unable to receive.

      Cook MyoSite will consider providing an investigational product to a qualified requesting
      physician currently licensed within the United States via the United States Food and Drug
      Administration's (FDA's) expanded access pathway outside of an active clinical trial when
      eligibility criteria are met.
