      conditions in obesity, which may influence the prognosis in patients undergoing surgery.
      There is a need for simple screening tools to identify such patients at high risk. The
      current multicenter observational study aims to investigate occurrence of OSA and OHS in
      obese individuals undergoing elective abdominal surgery by using questionnaires (STOPBANG
      questionnaire, Berlin Questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and arterial blood gases.
      Perioperative and 72-h postoperative complications will be documented.
