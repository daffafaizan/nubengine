      subjects initiating HAART will be assigned to HAART + zoledronic acid or HAART + placebo.
      Serial assessment of serum levels of bone markers, cellular expression of OPG/RANKL and other
      cytokines, cellular immune activation markers, serum bone regulating hormones, and bone
      mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be undertaken at
      pre-defined time points from baseline through week 144 of HAART.

      In the primary analysis, changes in serum C-Terminal Telopeptide (CTx) level, BMD, and
      cellular OPG/RANKL expression from baseline through week 24 will be quantitated and
      subsequently compared between treatment arms. In addition, the impact of zoledronic acid
      administration on these covariates will be assessed at various study time points. The
      relationship between OPG/RANKL expression, immune activation, serum bone regulating hormonal
      levels, and bone turnover will be evaluated.
