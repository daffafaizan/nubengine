    
      This study will employ a non-randomised controlled design in which three different 24-week
      exercise programs and a non-exercising control group will be compared in the residential aged
      care (RAC) setting. The three programs are the GrACE and the GrACE plus a gait specific
      training program.

      Data Collection

      ~40 participants from two RAC facilities will be recruited into the study. This number of
      participants will provide 80% statistical power to identify moderate effect size between
      group differences on the primary outcome measures. The control group will be drawn from each
      of the RAC facility approached receiving exercise treatment. Participation will be informed
      by a discussion with the facilities Service Manager about the eligibility of participants and
      a medical history screen undertaken. All participants will provide informed written consent
      prior to participation.

      Participants in the exercise group will perform twice weekly training for 24 weeks. Data will
      be collected at 0 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks in the control and exercise groups.
