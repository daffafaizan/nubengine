      materials has shown successful results. However, it is very difficult to induce bleeding and
      place mineral trioxide aggregate over a blood clot. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), a
      second-generation platelet concentrate. PRF is a matrix of autologous fibrin containing a
      large quantity of platelets, growth factors and leukocytes. PRF preparation technique is very
      simple, inexpensive and doesn't require any chemical agents. The purpose of this study is to
      test the hypothesis that the use of PRF in regenerative endodontic procedure of immature
      permanent teeth with apical periodontitis will accelerate periapical bone healing and
      stimulate the root maturation.
