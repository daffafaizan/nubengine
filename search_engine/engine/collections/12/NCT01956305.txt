    
      DS-7309 is being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This will be
      a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind (subject and investigator-blinded,
      sponsor-unblinded), sequential, multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), and Pharmacodynamic (PD) of multiple doses of DS-7309 in
      subjects with T2DM. The safety and tolerability of each new dose level will be tested in a
      single day administration prior to start of repeated dosing.
