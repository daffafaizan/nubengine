      nine patients with senile cortico-nuclear cataract. A standardized surgical technique and
      post-operative regimen were applied. Six months postoperatively best corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA), refraction and complications (especially) posterior capsule opacification (PCO) were
      analysed.
