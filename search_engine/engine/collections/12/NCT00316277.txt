      treatment settings. The main objective of this study is to identify an effective sublingual
      buprenorphine/naloxone treatment regimen for subjects dependent on prescription opioids.
      Phase 1 of this study will assess the prevailing one-month detoxification practice. This
      phase will assess the benefits of individual drug counseling in a short-term treatment
      paradigm. The second phase of this study will assess the benefit of individual drug
      counseling in a longer-term treatment paradigm for participants who did not respond
      successfully to the short-term buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. There is also a long-term
      follow-up assessment to determine outcomes at 1.5 years, 2.5 years, and 3.5 years after
      treatment.
