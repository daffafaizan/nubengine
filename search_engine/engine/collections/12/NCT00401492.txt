      patient selection and outcome assessment. In the two studies of cisplatin-based doublets, a
      dose-finding phase is planned, with subsequent cohorts of 6 patients treated with increasing
      doses of cisplatin (50-60-70 mg/m²). Following this phase, patients will be assigned to the
      three studies through a randomization procedure, to reduce selection biases.

      Arm A: gemcitabine:

      Gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 intravenously in 2 hours (10 mg/m²/minute) on days 1 & 8 of each
      cycle, every 21 days, for a maximum of 6 cycles.

      Arm B: cisplatin + vinorelbine:

      Vinorelbine 25 mg/m² on days 1 & 8, followed by Cisplatin (50 or 60 or 70 mg/m²) on day 1 of
      each cycle, every 21 days, for a maximum of 6 cycles.

      Arm C: cisplatin + gemcitabine:

      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2,, on days 1 & 8, followed by Cisplatin (50 or 60 or 70 mg/m²) on day 1
      of each cycle, every 21 days, for a maximum of 6 cycles.
