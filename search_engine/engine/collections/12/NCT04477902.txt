      better understanding of COVID-19 from the perspective of a diverse national population.

      This multi-phase study will use an action research approach to identify specific ways that
      physician groups, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), public health departments, and
      other health and social services systems in the United States can address healthcare needs
      and mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. Email surveys will be used to assess the
      historical and current status of participants by medical condition, geography, and
      demographic characteristics, as well as their history of symptoms (e.g. recent cough, fever,
      loss of sense of taste or smell, etc.) and their current psychosocial needs.

      The study will provide the structure for an iterative exploration of trends over time (up to
      24 months). The opt-in survey will be posted and available to individuals 18 and older who
      choose to participate. Survey frequency will be every two weeks.

      To analyze broader trends, all survey responses will be de-identified and aggregated. Overall
      general findings will not be linked to individuals or physician groups when reporting and
      publishing study results.
