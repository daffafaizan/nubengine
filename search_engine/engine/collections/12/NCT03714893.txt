      behavioral data using worn sensors on psychiatric patients suffering from schizophrenia,
      bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. It is a known fact that patients suffering from these
      disorders are more prone to changes in their mental health condition. Sometimes this change
      is due to change in medical treatment(whether it was the doctor's decision or low adherence
      to medication treatment).The mental health condition influences physiological, physical and
      behavioral aspects which could be detected through the personal digital algorithm and could
      prevent psychiatric deterioration. For example, in a case of a person in a manic episode
      investigators would expect to find changes in the personal digital algorithm in physiological
      aspects(increased heart rate, elevated Heart Rate Variability), physical aspects such as
      increased number of steps per day, and behavioral aspects(increased hours spent outside of
      home, excessive activity). An early detection can help in the prevention of psychiatric
      deterioration in this case and help minimize the suffering caused to the patient and
      caregivers and perhaps assist in minimizing the need for hospitalization.

      The data will be collected using wrist watches. The sensors will collect the physiological
      data(Heart Rate Variability), physical data(number of steps per day) and the behavioral
      data(quality of sleep). This data will then be collected and analyzed through big data
      analysis.
