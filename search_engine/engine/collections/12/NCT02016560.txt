    
      This study was conducted in 2 phases: a Phase 2 Exploratory Phase and a Phase 3 Confirmatory
      Phase. An overarching goal of the Exploratory Phase of this protocol was to further
      investigate the pattern of flortaucipir PET imaging across the disease course, in cognitively
      healthy subjects through patients with cognitive decline. To accomplish this goal, the
      protocol investigated flortaucipir results in younger and older cognitively healthy normal
      volunteers and patients with clinical diagnoses for cognitive complaints, ranging from MCI to
      mild and moderate AD dementia. Additionally, the Exploratory Phase of this protocol
      investigated relationships between flortaucipir PET signal and cognitive decline over the
      18-month study period.

      The second, Confirmatory Phase of the study was designed to provide independent validation of
      the relationships observed in the exploratory analyses of the first phase. In particular, the
      goal of the second phase was to confirm the relationship between flortaucipir uptake in the
      brain as measured by PET signals at baseline and the subsequent rate of cognitive decline
      observed over the 18-month longitudinal follow up.
