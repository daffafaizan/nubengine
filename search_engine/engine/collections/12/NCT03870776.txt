      study in male or female patients with drug resistant depression.

      This study targets the antidepressant non-responders' patients who have already experienced
      at least 2 antidepressant treatments with no success. It is estimated that about 2/3 of the
      patients treated with antidepressant drugs do not respond partially or completely to the
      actual conventional treatments (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor and Serotonin and
      Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor).

      110 patients with drug resistant depression episode, aged 18 to 65 will be included in the
      study. They will be recruited from psychiatric consultations in the centers participating to
      the study.
