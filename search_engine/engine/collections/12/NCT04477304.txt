      Clinics randomized to the behavioral intervention arm receive electronic health record
      (EHR)-based nudges. Eligible participants are clinicians who practice ambulatory primary care
      at the participating clinical sites in Illinois and California. At the time of opioid
      prescribing, clinicians in clinics randomized to the intervention group will be prompted with
      an EHR nudge when the prescribing history for the patient falls into one of the following
      three mutually exclusive categories: Opioid na√Øve, opioid refill, or chronic high-dose
      opioids. These EHR-based nudges include accountable justification, defaults and
      precommitments. The control arm receives no EHR-based intervention. Both arms receive
      guideline education. The primary outcome is the change in clinician aggregate daily milligram
      morphine equivalent (MME) dose and the secondary outcome is the proportion of dosages that
      equal or exceed 50 MME per day. These outcomes will be estimated by treatment arm with an
      intent-to-treat difference-in-differences framework using a mixed-effects regression model on
      clinician MME daily dose. The intervention period will be 18-months, with a 6-month follow-up
      period to measure the persistence of effects after the interventions conclude.
