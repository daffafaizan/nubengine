      who have advanced malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum
      tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) for
      alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days.

      This open label study enrolled 59 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of 10 dose
      escalation arms:

        -  Alisertib 5 mg once daily (QD) for 7 Days (D)

        -  Alisertib 80 mg QD 7D

        -  Alisertib 150 mg QD 7D

        -  Alisertib 50 mg twice daily (BID) 7D

        -  Alisertib 60 mg BID 7D

        -  Alisertib 75 mg BID 7D

        -  Alisertib 100 mg BID 7D

        -  Alisertib 50 mg QD 14D

        -  Alisertib 50 mg QD 21D

        -  Alisertib 70 mg QD 21D

      All participants received treatment until their disease progressed or they experienced
      unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Spain. The overall time to participate in this study
      was 730 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30
      days after receiving their last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.
