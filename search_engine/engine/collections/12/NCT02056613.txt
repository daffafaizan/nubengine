      Clinical protocols to treat several diseases using iPSCs or cells derived from iPSCs are
      being developed by intramural investigators, i.e., investigators in National Institute of
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Eye Institute (NEI). This clinical
      protocol will allow personnel in the Cell Processing Service (CPS) of the Department of
      Transfusion Medicine (DTM) to collect blood from healthy donors or patients with diseases
      targeted in IRB-approved treatment protocols to manufacture iPSCs or iPSC derived products to
      support these intramural investigators. CPS DTM will submit a Drug Master File (DMF) to the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the manufacture and testing of these products. When
      iPSCs are used clinically in some cases the donors will be the recipients of the iPSCs, or
      the ex vivo expanded and differentiated iPSCs (autologous therapy). In other cases, healthy
      subjects will serve as donors of the blood used as starting material for manufacturing iPSCs
      (allogeneic therapy) where no matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the
      healthy blood donor and the iPSC recipient. While methods to produce and expand iPSCs have
      been described, they must be modified periodically to meet changing Good Manufacturing
      Practices (GMP) requirements for manufacturing clinical cell and gene therapies, therefore
      peripheral blood for iPSCs from normal donors is needed for research and development.
