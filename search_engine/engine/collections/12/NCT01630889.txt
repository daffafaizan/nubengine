      non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease patients who have completed the Treatment Period of an
      FG-4592 FibroGen-sponsored anemia Study. Subjects assigned to FG-4592 in the previous study
      will continue to receive the same FG-4592 dose and dosing frequency, unless a dose adjustment
      is required. An optional treatment group may allow subjects assigned to placebo in the
      previous study to start active FG-4592 study treatment.
