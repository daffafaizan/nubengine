      benefit of EBOV convalescent plasma containing antibodies to EBOV. The risk of exposure to
      plasma from donors who may be infected with other transfusion-transmitted pathogens, not
      detectable by current licensed donor testing procedures, will be mitigated by using pathogen
      inactivation to minimize the risk of the TTI from these donors, who would otherwise be
      deferred and ineligible for blood donation.

      The study is designed as a prospective, open label, multi-center, single arm study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of INTERCEPT plasma prepared from EBOV convalescent donors
      for passive immune therapy in subjects with acute EVD.

      Data will be collected to assess the safety of this intervention by monitoring adverse events
      in the immediate 24-hour post transfusion period. Efficacy will be assessed by monitoring the
      clinical status of treated subjects with respect to clearance of EBOV by using nucleic acid
      assays to measure pre and post treatment viral titers. A number of clinical parameters
      indicative of end-organ damage during acute EVD will be monitored to determine if passive
      immune therapy affects the onset and duration of renal failure and acute lung injury. In
      addition, blood samples will be collected pre and post transfusion of convalescent EBOV
      INTERCEPT plasma to determine if biomarkers of endothelial injury are impacted, and if they
      can be used to guide plasma transfusion therapy to establish a dosing regimen and duration of
      treatment.
