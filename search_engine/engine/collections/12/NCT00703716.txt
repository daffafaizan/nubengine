      increase fourfold worldwide by the year 2050. This affliction is obviously linked to the
      aging of the population and the absence of a systematic prevention of osteoporosis.

      This leads to the creation of a minimally invasive, or ever percutaneous, implantable
      osteosynthesis material which associates :

        -  the well-known reliability of osteosynthesis using screw-plate with barrel,

        -  the safety of the fixation with Surfix concept, locking the screws to the plate using
           lock-screws,

        -  a modularity thanks to the choice between 3 sizes of barrel,

        -  the creation of a simple material, easing the operative surgery by minimally invasive
           approach.

      The TRAUMAX answers to all those characteristics.
