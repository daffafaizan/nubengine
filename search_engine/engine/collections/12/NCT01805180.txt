    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the procedures for the collection of granulocyte/
      polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells on Terumo BCT's Spectra Optia® and COBE® Spectra Apheresis
      Systems and to establish the non-inferiority of the Spectra Optia Apheresis System with
      respect to the primary study endpoint, granulocyte/PMN cell collection efficiency.
