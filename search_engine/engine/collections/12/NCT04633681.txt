    
      This protocol has the overall objective to evaluate the acute (short-term, 1 day) and
      repeated (medium-term, 2 week) effects of combinations of sweeteners and sweetness enhancers
      (S&SEs) on metabolic, sensory, neuro-behavioural and microbiota-mediated processes involved
      in satiety, consumer preference and health, and to explore mechanistic processes, genetic
      background, safety issues and consumer perspectives.

      There are 5 products being tested in 3 different formulations (sucrose-sweetened control vs 2
      reformulated with S&SE). Each product will be tested at 2 intervention sites in double-blind
      cross-over trials with 48 subjects (24 per site) tested per product. Therefore a total of 240
      subjects will take part across the 5 intervention sites (Navarra, Leeds, Liverpool,
      Copenhagen, Lyon).

      Using identical procedures each trial will consist of 2 Clinical Investigation Days (CIDs)
      scheduled 12 days apart for each of the 3 product formulations. A 2-week wash-out period will
      be given between formulations.

      The total duration of WP2 Phase 2 is 12 months, including a 5-month duration for each
      cross-over trial.
