    
      This is a natural history study designed to investigate forms of primary immunodeficiency
      disorders (PIDs), and to better define both new and previously described forms of PID,
      including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), combined immunodeficiency, natural killer
      (NK) cell deficiency, and other disorders. Patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence
      of PID will be recruited at Children s National Health System (CNHS) and the National
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Infants identified at birth with a
      positive newborn screening for SCID and confirmed to have T-cell lymphocytopenia will also be
      recruited at CNHS. Subjects with a known or unknown PID and infants with T-cell
      lymphocytopenia will provide one or more blood donations during the course of the study to
      enable immunologic and genetic investigations of immune pathways contributing to PIDs. These
      subjects will also be followed clinically to longitudinally assess the natural history of
      novel and known PIDs. Subjects will be followed over time with regard to their immunologic
      phenotype, clinical disease (including incidence of infections, autoimmune phenomena,
      allergic disease, or malignancies), and response to both preventative and definitive
      therapies. Biological relatives who do not have PID and healthy adult volunteers will also be
      eligible to serve as controls for this study.
