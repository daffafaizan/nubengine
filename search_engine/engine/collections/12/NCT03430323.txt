      stratified by age, sex, and BMI. Following consent, each participant will undergo:

        -  6 DXA whole body scans. The primary measure is bone mineral mass and body volume. DXA
           body volume is measured using equations from previous work that relate the fat, lean,
           and bone masses to individual volumes in an image pixel using the physical densities of
           the components and the know area of the pixel.

        -  Total body water measurement using standard deuterium dilution methods. The primary
           measure is total body water in liters.

        -  Body volume measurement using air displacement plethsymography. The primary measure is
           volume in liters.

        -  Whole body 3D optical surface scans. The primary measures mesh points that make up a
           point cloud of the surface of the body. Approximately 500,000 mesh points are used and
           placed on the surface of the participants body image. The variation of the location of
           these mesh points can be described using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In
           addition, the 3D optical scans can be used to measure the thickness of the body along
           the path of each X-ray that goes through the body resulting in a tissue thickness for
           each DXA image pixel.

        -  Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The primary measure is percent body fat, and
           total body water.

        -  Physical anthropometry. The primary measure is waist circumference.
