    
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial using a parallel group design that involves
      women with a confirmed diagnosis of avulsion and suffering from urinary incontinence.
      Participants will be randomized into either physiotherapy or a waiting-list control group.
      Both groups will be evaluated at baseline, post-treatment (3 months post-randomization) and 9
      months after randomization. Women in the control group will receive full-body relaxation
      massage which has shown no effect on continence but was selected to control for effects of
      attention received by the therapist. After the 9-month assessment, women assigned to the
      control group will receive the same physiotherapy treatment and undergo a last assessment.
