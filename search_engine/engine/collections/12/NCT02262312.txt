      performed due to serious side-effects and risks in this patientgroup.

      The results of the transient elastography will be compared to the patient's ferritin levels
      and the numbers of months the patients have had MDS to find out if there is a correlation.
      Furthermore we will compare the liver stiffness measurements in the patients with higher
      ferritin levels to those who have lower ferritin levels. We will also compare the liver
      stiffness measurements in patients who are red blood cell transfusion dependent compared to
      those who are red blood cell transfusion independent. We will also compare liver stiffness
      measurements in the patients with a high alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) compared to those
      with normal ALAT.
