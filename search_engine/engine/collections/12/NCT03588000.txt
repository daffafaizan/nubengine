      health service centers are the main body of implementing treatment and community diabetes
      patients are the objects of intervention. 498 T2DM patients with poor blood glucose control
      (7%<HbA1câ‰¤9.5%) from 4 different community health service centers will be randomized into two
      groups (strengthen group and control group). Strengthen self-monitoring of blood glucose by
      APP is the intervention and its duration is 12 months. Follow-up time of this study is 24
      months (12 months after the intervention stopped). The diabetes treatment of patients from
      both groups follows Chinese guidelines (CDS 2017).
