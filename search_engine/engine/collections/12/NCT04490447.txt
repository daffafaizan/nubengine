      and progressive dilation of the large airways, bronchi and bronchioles, which severely
      impairs the life quality of patients and increases the social and economic burden. It is also
      a heterogenous disease affected by multiple factors such as geography and ethnicity. The
      incidence of bronchiectasis among the Chinese population is about 1.2%, which has clearly
      been underestimated. However, due to the lack of awareness, the research of bronchiectasis in
      China is still in its infancy. Colonization and recurrent infection of pathogen is the
      primary unsolved problem in clinical practice. With the proposition of "gut-lung axis"
      theory, the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases has been
      gradually revealed. Evidences have shown that gut microbiota regulates respiratory immunity
      via releasing soluble bacterial components and its metabolites into the circulation, as well
      as facilitating the migration of immune cells directly to the lung. In the 1980s, a patient
      after a colectomy has been reported to generate bronchiectasis. The most common clinical
      manifestation of pulmonary involved IBD patients is also bronchiectasis, suggesting that the
      "gut-lung axis" may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Therefore, clarifying
      the role and mechanism of gut microbiota in bronchiectasis and its gut microbiome is expected
      to provide new theoretical basis and ideas for its diagnosis and treatment.
