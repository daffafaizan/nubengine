    
      This is an interventional, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study of the use of
      magnesium in fibromyalgia. The effect of magnesium on stress measured by DASS-42 over 28 days
      after taking magnesium / placebo will be studied.

      The secondary objectives will evaluate the evolution of the scores of all the tests and
      questionnaires carried out before taking magnesium or placebo (D0: Visit 2), then at D0 + 28
      (visit 3) and D0 + 84 days (visit 4 corresponding to the end-of-study visit).

      Secondary parameters are the following :

      Impact of fibromyalgia, heart rate variability, pain intensity, cognition, feelings of
      patients, impression of change, sleep quality, fatigue intensity, social vulnerability,
      catastrophism, presence of small fiber neuropathy, stress induced by colors, pain induced by
      thermal stimulation, concentration of magnesium, analysis of microbiota and evaluation of
      genetic factor.

      Blood magnesium and magnesuria will be measured.
