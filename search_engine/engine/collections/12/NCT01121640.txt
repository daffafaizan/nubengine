      thus early detection is likely to play an important role in reducing its mortality. Within
      the Ovarian Specialized Programs of Research Excellence Pacific Ovarian Cancer Research
      Consortium (POCRC) researchers have been working for a decade to discover, develop, and
      validate biomarkers (proteins or substances found in blood) that could help save lives by
      detecting EOC early. During the last five years several biomarkers, including CA125, have
      been evaluated for their ability to detect EOC at an earlier stage. The best markers will now
      be studied in a new randomized controlled trial of ovarian cancer screening.
