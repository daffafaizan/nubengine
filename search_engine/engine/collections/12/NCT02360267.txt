      outcomes and de-identified demographic information detailed in the attached case report
      forms. In each case where a diagnosis of bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II, or bipolar
      disorder NOS is determined, the child/adolescent will be added to the PBR and provided with
      information about local providers that are qualified to treat their diagnosis. Each subject
      can elect to be notified about future research studies s/he may qualify for. Furthermore, the
      investigators will provide ongoing newsletters with useful information that addresses the
      latest research underway in the field with the families. If requested, the investigators will
      provide a written report to their current provider detailing our evaluation. The potential
      for a breach in confidentiality always exists; however, information that is obtained will be
      stored in password a protected database and locked file drawers in locked offices; data will
      have identifying information sheered from it to prevent loss of confidentiality, and all
      staff must sign confidentiality certificates. If child abuse is detected, the research team
      is obligated to follow mandatory state reporting laws. To the investigators' knowledge, there
      is no registry for Pediatric Bipolar Disorder in the city of Houston or the state of Texas
      that provides the comprehensive evaluation that we are proposing for these children and
      adolescents and their families. Therefore, this will be a novel service within this division
      that will provide research to families and potential clients for providers managing these
      families across the State of Texas.
