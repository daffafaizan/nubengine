      increase growth rate in these patients. They include oxandrolone (1), growth hormone (2, 3),
      and low dose estrogen (4). However, the ability of these hormone treatments to increase adult
      height has never been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.

      We propose to evaluate the effect on adult height of low dose estrogen, growth hormone, and
      the combination of low dose estrogen and growth hormone. Patients will be entered into the
      study from ages 5 to 12 and will be assigned randomly to one of the four groups (the 3 above
      treatment groups or placebo). The randomized assignment will be double-blind throughout the
      study. Treatment will be maintained to adult height (the first height measurement at which
      the preceding annual growth rate was < 1.5 cm). Beginning at age 12, the estrogen treatment
      in all 4 groups will be changed to a standardized regimen of increasing estrogen dose, so
      that all children in the study will undergo secondary sexual changes at an appropriate age.

      In addition, the study will assess the effect of growth hormone and estrogen treatment on
      bone density and, in a parallel, separate, study, the effect of treatment on cognition and
      learning ability.
