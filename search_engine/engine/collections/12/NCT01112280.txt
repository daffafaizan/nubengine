      to be 20-25%. Transparent cap-assisted colonoscopy has been suggested to improve
      visualization of the lesion that are difficult to access, such as tangentially located
      lesions and those located within a limited luminal space. Chromoendoscopy with indigocarmine
      spraying was reported to increases the detection rates of polyp, especially in right colon
      and rectum. However, there also have been mixed results regarding polyp detection rates of
      the endoscopic methods. Moreover, there is no data regarding the impact of the screening
      tools on longterm recurrence rate of colorectal polyp. Therefore, in this study, we intend to
      perform a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of
      cap-assisted chromoendoscopy as a screening test for detection of colorectal polyps. This
      study will be performed using web-based research network, e-VELOS in Korea.
