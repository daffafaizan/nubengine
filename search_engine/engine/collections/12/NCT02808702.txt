      processing. The investigators will assess baseline resting state connectivity within the
      default network, as well as regional brain activation using a well-validated event-related
      fMRI task that manipulates self-focused processing in patients with body dysmorphic and
      socially anxious symptoms, compared to healthy controls. This clinical sample was selected
      because such patients display heightened self-focused attention, and sampling individuals
      across these symptom dimensions will ensure greater variability on this dimension of
      maladaptive self-focused processing. Second, the investigators will examine the neural
      correlates of self-focused processing as a predictor of treatment response. Neuroimaging data
      will be acquired from patients with body dysmorphic and socially anxious symptoms during two
      scan sessions, before and after 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy, and
      compared with healthy controls scanned twice at a 12 week interval. Finally, the
      investigators will compare the prediction of treatment response between neural measures and
      behavioral measures of self-focused processing. The investigators will assess the behavioral
      correlates of self-focused processing using a self-reference effect paradigm, and assess
      their relation to treatment response. If the investigators hypotheses are borne out, the
      investigators will have new targets for treatment, a method to identify promising candidates
      for treatment, and sensitive surrogate markers of treatment response.
