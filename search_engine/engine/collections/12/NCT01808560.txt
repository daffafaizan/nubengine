    
      This is a post-market, prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized multi-center
      clinical trial evaluating treatment with the LipiFlow System in patients with meibomian gland
      dysfunction prior to planned bilateral cataract surgery. All subjects undergo examination to
      determine study eligibility and to capture the Baseline status prior to surgery. Subjects are
      randomized to receive LipiFlow treatment (Pre-treatment group) one month before cataract
      surgery or no LipiFlow treatment (Untreated Control group). Cataract surgery is performed on
      both eyes of each subject with the second eye surgery completed within two months of the
      first eye. All subjects are evaluated at one month and three months after cataract surgery on
      the second eye with comparison of the study endpoints between the Pre-treatment and Untreated
      groups. To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated Control group receives crossover
      LipiFlow treatment for MGD (Post-treatment group) three months after cataract surgery on the
      second eye.
