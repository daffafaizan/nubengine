      cancer-related lymphedema and recommended compression garments will be included in the study
      on a voluntary basis, after obtaining their written consent. Patients who have received a
      standard treatment and an education about the use of compression garments from a single
      center will be asked to answer our 28-question questionnaire about the use of compression
      garments. The patients will be asked whether compression garments were recommended or not,
      how long they have used compression garments, the type and model of the recommended
      compression garment, whether they can buy the recommended compression garment, how often it
      is changed, how long it is recommended to wear it during the day, whether it is used for the
      recommended time, how long wore during the day, the reasons for using and not using the
      garment. Compliance to compression garments and the factors affecting this will be
      questioned. Patients who use their garments for the recommended time and manner and those who
      do not will be compared in terms of these factors. Patients who used their garments for the
      recommended time and manner will be considered as compliant.
