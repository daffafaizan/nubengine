      responses to multiple concentrations of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in elderly
      volunteers. The research design thus capitalizes on the antibody response to a novel, benign
      antigen to which our subjects will be immunologically na√Øve. The use of a range of antigen
      concentrations will provide a sensitive indicator for the effects of intervention.

      The Aims of the study are the following:

        1. To examine the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on immunological
           outcomes, perceived health, and psychological well-being in a sample of seniors 65 years
           of age and older.

        2. To examine whether treatment effects are moderated by age, personality traits, physical
           health status, or depression.

        3. To examine the effects of behavioral, psychological, and physiological mediators of
           immune outcome.
