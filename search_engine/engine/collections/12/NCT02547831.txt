    
      This is a prospective, multicenter observational study under the umbrella of the ISG (Italian
      Sarcoma Group) evaluating local progression-free survival at 3 years of patients affected by
      extra-abdominal primary fibromatosis managed with front-line conservative approach and
      treated only in case of demonstrated progressive disease.

      All patients included will be placed on wait and see approach and then shifted to treatment
      in case of documented radiological progressive disease.

      For patient primarily evaluated for suspected desmoid tumor, a core-needle biopsy (eventually
      under CT/ultrasound guide) will be obtained for histological diagnosis and mutational
      analysis of CTNNB1 exon 3 (gene encoding Beta-catenin). If incisional biopsy or surgical
      procedure has done elsewhere, samples will be requested for histological confirmation and
      mutational analysis (centralization at our Institution) and in selected cases a new biopsy
      will be obtained.

      In case of progression at 3 months, defined as tumor growth documented radiologically (by
      contrast enhanced MRI) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), administered
      treatments will be proposed and then registered in the clinical database (radiological
      evaluation will be centralized at Istituto Rizzoli, Bologna- Dr. Vandel).

      Therapy will include the following options:

        -  Surgery

        -  Radiotherapy

        -  Medical treatment including hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, toremifene), low-dose
           chemotherapy (e.g.,methotrexate and vinorelbine/vinblastine), NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib),
           and target therapy (Glivec)

        -  Combination The choice of the treatment and eventually the possibility of continuation
           of " surveillance only" will be at the discretion of Institution's Multidisciplinary
           Sarcoma Committee or as part of clinical trials with the consent of patient.
