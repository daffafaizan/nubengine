      oro-pharyngo-laryngeal joints and the articulatory precision of the beatboxers and (2) the
      respiratory management which allows the artists to beatbox continuously without interrupting
      their performance. These two points, very characteristic of this technique, allow them to
      best imitate diverse and varied musical tones.

      The Human Beatbox is still little studied and the literature on this subject is quite
      limited. Percussive sounds (for example imitations of bass drums, hi-hat or snare) seem to be
      characterized by articulatory strategies, melodic sounds (for example wind instruments,
      strings) seem to be based on both articulatory and phonatory strategies, and finally,
      electronic sounds seem to mainly use complex phonatory strategies.

      Our objectives are to better understand the articulatory capacities and limits of the vocal
      tract at different levels (articulation capacities, sound production mechanisms, muscular and
      acoustic temporal relationships, strategies of efficiency...).

      It is possible to find clinical applications of the Human Beatbox in the context of
      congenital speech disorders (for example dyspraxia) or acquired (for example
      oro-pharyngo-laryngeal surgery of the partial glossectomy type).
