      function during aging process. More specifically, protein intake is important to maintain
      muscle function in older adults. Another non pharmacological intervention and well recognized
      for its efficacy, it's exercise training.

      Recently, it has been observed than muscle quality is more important to maintain physical
      autonomy than muscle mass per se. In addition, muscle quality is more related to functional
      capacities than muscle mass.

      Due to this recent finding, it has been proposed that muscle power training would be the best
      exercise intervention to prevent the loss of mobility.
