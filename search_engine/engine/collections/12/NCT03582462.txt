    
      This will be a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study
      conducted at a single center. The study consists of 4 escalating single-dose cohorts (n = 8
      per cohort, randomized 3 IONIS FXI-LRx active:1 placebo), 3 escalating multiple-dose cohorts
      with weekly Study Drug (IONIS FXI-LRx or placebo) administration for 8 healthy volunteers per
      cohort, randomized 3 active:1 placebo, and 1 multiple-dose cohort of 10 healthy volunteers
      randomized 3 active:2 placebo with Study Drug administration every 4 weeks.

      Approximately 66 healthy volunteers are planned to be enrolled in this study. Additional
      healthy volunteers may be added to better assess the safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetic
      profile of IONIS FXI-LRx to meet study objectives.
