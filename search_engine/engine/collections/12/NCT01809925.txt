      women will be enrolled, with a race distribution consistent with the US population. Eligible
      subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 test product sequences at Test Period 1 (Visit
      2) using a block randomization. Subjects will participate in 3 test periods (Test Period 1,
      Visits 2-4; Test Period 2, Visits 5-7; and Test Period 3, Visits 8-10) and will receive test
      product once a day before breakfast for 3 days within each period. Test periods will be
      separated by a minimum 4-day washout period in which no test product will be administered.
