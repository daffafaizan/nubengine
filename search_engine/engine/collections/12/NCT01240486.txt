    
      IMPAACT P1073 is a prospective clinical, observational and pathogenesis study of HIV-infected
      infants and children who are ART-naïve and will be initiating a HAART regimen at an IMPAACT
      study site. Where possible, infants and children co-enrolled in IMPAACT studies will be given
      preference for enrollment in P1073.

      The plan is to enroll subjects in P1073 at a timepoint ≤ 1 week prior to starting HAART. For
      DMC purposes, this is Step 1 for P1073, and subjects are designated as a Non-case, according
      to the Study Flow Chart
