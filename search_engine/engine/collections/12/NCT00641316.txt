      and with compromised soft tissue contours. A variety of methods have been proposed to
      overcome varied patterns of post-extraction healing.

      An increasingly common practice combines skilled surgical technique with post-extraction site
      grafting utilizing both natural and synthetic bone-graft materials. These procedures are
      thought to retard resorption of the socket volume while lending some control over bone-fill -
      thereby preserving the integrity of the alveolar ridge for future reconstruction with dental
      implants.

      Limited evidence-based data exist to support a variety of bone-graft materials including
      grafts enriched with autologous platelet-rich plasma(PRP)and grafts enriched with recombinant
      human platelet-derived growth factors(PDGF). Despite emerging clinical acceptance the most
      efficacious intervention remains undetermined.

      In an effort to establish clinical evidence, this study will assess the efficacy of ridge
      preservation using three different bone grafting applications in post-extraction sockets
      compared to extraction alone.

      The study will also asses longitudinal success of restoring the study sites with dental
      implants. Two innovative dental implant designs will be used in the study; an implant with a
      resorbable blast textured(RBT)surface and an implant with a laser thread-textured
      (LTT)surface.
