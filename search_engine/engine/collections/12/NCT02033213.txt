      Hospital Centre Zagreb and scheduled for esophageal carcinoma surgery were enrolled
      prospectively in the study between June 2011 and August 2012.

      Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, one of which received â‰¤ 8ml/kg/h of
      intraoperative fluid ("restrictive group") and another that received > 8 ml/kg/h of fluid
      ("liberal group").

      Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years; if they had severe lung disease,
      chronic renal insufficiency, or a physical status classification > III on the American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scale; or if it was impossible to perform epidural
      catheter placement or thoraco-phreno-laparotomy.

      All patients underwent esophagectomy carried out according to the Lewis-Tanner approach.

      Data on arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2), and the
      ratio PaO2/FiO2 were collected 10 min after anesthesia was induced and again 6 h after
      surgery. Data on the metabolic markers creatinine and lactate were collected 10 min after
      anesthesia induction and 6 h after surgery.

      ANOVA tests were performed to determine significant differences in mean values between study
      groups. Independent-sample t-tests were used to test differences in mean values between the
      restrictive and liberal groups for each of the two sets of measurements separately (10
      minutes after anesthesia induction and 6 hr after surgery). P < 0.05 was considered
      significant.
