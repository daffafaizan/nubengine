      women is unclear. The investigators hypothesize that progesterone slows LH pulse frequency
      within 10 hours. The investigators propose to assess this further with a randomized,
      cross-over, placebo-controlled study. Regularly cycling women without hyperandrogenism will
      be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit on cycle day 5-9 (mid-follicular phase) for a
      frequent sampling study. Beginning at 0900 h, blood for LH, FSH, estradiol, progesterone, and
      testosterone will be obtained over a 10-hour period. Either oral micronized progesterone (100
      mg p.o.) suspension or placebo will be administered at 0900 h. During a subsequent menstrual
      cycle, subjects will undergo another study identical to the first except that oral
      progesterone will be exchanged for placebo or vice versa in accordance with a crossover
      design. The primary endpoint of interest is LH pulse frequency; the investigators will
      compare LH pulse frequency after progesterone administration to LH pulse frequency after
      placebo administration.
