      radiotherapy given for limited stage small cell lung cancer are poor and emerging evidence
      from several studies suggests that intensifying the radiotherapy dose given may further
      improve patient outcomes, but at the cost of increased radiotherapy side effects. This
      proposal aims to study a novel method of intensifying chest radiotherapy dose via increasing
      the daily radiotherapy dose which is directed at regions of visible disease only. This
      strategy allows for delivery of increased radiation doses without prolonging overall
      treatment time and allowing potential regrowth of cancer cells. We aim to determine the
      maximum radiation dose which can be safely given with chemotherapy for limited stage small
      cell lung cancer and study the effects this type of radiation regimen with chemotherapy has
      on patient side effects and quality of life. Results from this trial will contribute to the
      development of the ideal radiotherapy regimen for limited stage small cell lung cancer. Our
      results will add to the literature studying the effects dose-intense radiation strategies for
      lung cancer have on patient quality of life.
