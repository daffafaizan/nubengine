      Numerous studies suggest that alteration of the intestinal barrier may induce abnormal immune
      responses implicated in development or persistence of arthritis. This paves the way to new
      therapeutic options aiming to reestablish intestinal homeostasis to treat arthritis or to
      prevent disease flares. This study investigates the efficacy of probiotic VSL#3 as an add on
      standard care on the activity of the disease in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.
