      tumor sizes) underwent initial surgical therapy at our institution. Of these, 2441 patients
      (48.4%) had PTMCs â‰¤ 1 cm in diameter, with 1270 undergoing TT and 1171 undergoing LT.
      Complete follow-up data for major clinical events were available for 2014 patients (82.5%),
      including 1015 (79.9%) of the TT group and 999 (85.3%) of the LT group (p=0.083). Patients
      were followed-up for a median 11.8 years (range, 5 to 26 years). All histopathologic
      diagnoses were reviewed and verified by endocrine pathologists using WHO criteria. The study
      protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Details of patients' presentations,
      surgical and pathologic findings, and adjunctive treatments were obtained from the Yonsei
      University Thyroid Cancer Database.

      Management strategy In patients diagnosed with PTMC after a complete radiologic and
      histologic examination, the extent of thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RI) therapy were
      based on prognostic factors. However, the protocol of our institution as to how PTMC should
      be appropriately managed has been changed according to update of clinical reports and
      validated treatment guidelines. Therefore, the lack of a standardized approach during the
      study period allowed us to assess the impact of various therapeutic modalities, especially
      extent of thyroidectomy, in patients with PTMC.
