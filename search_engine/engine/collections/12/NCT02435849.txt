      and safety of CTL019 in pediatric patients with r/r B-cell ALL (Main Cohort closed for an
      enrollment), high risk B-cell ALL patients at first relapse (Cohort 1 open for an
      enrollment), and feasibility and safety of CTL019 in high risk B-cell ALL patients that
      relapsed <6 months post allo-HSCT (Cohort 2 is open for an enrollment).

      The study will have the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product
      Preparation & Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Primary Follow-up, Secondary
      Follow-up (if applicable) and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 5 years
      from CTL019 cell infusion.
