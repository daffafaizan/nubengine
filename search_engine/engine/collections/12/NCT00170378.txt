      Patients with traumatic brain injury usually have effective VTE prophylaxis withheld
      secondary to concerns of exacerbating intracranial hemorrhage. This study examines the safety
      and efficacy of early administration (within 24 hrs of admission) of low molecular weight
      heparin to this patient population with very high VTE risk.
