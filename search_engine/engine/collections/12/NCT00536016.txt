      neovascularization, making α5β1 an attractive target for therapeutic strategies directed at
      pathological angiogenesis. JSM6427 may also interfere with other key processes in the
      pathogenesis of AMD, namely inflammation and fibrosis. Further, non-clinical data show that
      JSM6427 inhibits scarring and inflammation. Thus, JSM6427 may target multiple important
      pathways in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD.
