      participates in the ejection and the filling of the left ventricle. Postnatal hemodynamic
      modifications are major and probably affect this mechanism.

      The main objective is to compare the left ventricular twist mechanism in healthy newborns, at
      birth and at their third month of life, using the peak LV twist as primary endpoint.
      Secondarily, we compare other LV rotation and deformation parameters during the same period:
      peak LV torsion, peak LV twist rate, peak LV untwist rate, circumferential strain and radial
      strain. Finally, we compare the endo- and epicardial LV deformation, using the inner and
      outer circumferential strain as endpoints.

      This is a longitudinal, prospective and monocentric study in the Grenoble-Alpes University
      Hospital between April 2018 and September 2018.

      The number of required subjects is 30 with a statistical power of 80% and a p-value of 0,05
