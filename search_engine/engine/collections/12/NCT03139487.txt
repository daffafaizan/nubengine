      hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer who have venous thromboembolism (VTE), including
      pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and
      stratified by performance status, type of cancer and medical centers. The enrolled patients
      will receive either subcutaneous dalteparin or DOAC(rivaroxaban, apixavan) according to
      randomization until the end of planned treatment schedules (six months), recurrence of VTE,
      clinical relevant bleeding, major bleeding, death or discontinuation of study treatment for
      any other reason (e.g. withdrawal of consent or discretion of the investigator). The primary
      end-point is the rate of clinical relevant bleeding event as defined as overt bleeding which
      was associated with medical intervention. In addition to time to clinical relevant bleeding
      event, time to event of major bleeding, total bleeding including minor event, time to
      recurrent VTE, overall bleeding rate and overall VTE recurrent rate will be analyzed to
      compare safety and efficacy of both anticoagulants. The final analysis will be conducted when
      the last enrolled patient has an event or has completed as least six months follow up in the
      study. Patients without bleeding and recurrent VTE events at data cut-off are censored at the
      last date the patient is known to be free of events.

      Planned interim analysis will be conducted in the intentions to treatment analysis set. The
      interim analysis for the randomized portion of the study will be performed when at least 40%
      of estimated bleeding events have been observed. The purpose of interim analysis is for early
      stopping of the study for safety. This study will use a Data Monitoring Committee.
