    
      Single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 33 healthy volunteers
      with 2 sessions. Each session consisted of a run-in day for baseline assessments, 8 treatment
      days and 5 additional days for followup assessments. Subjects were randomised to start with
      either the prucalopride or placebo session. The prucalopride dose was consecutively escalated
      in 2 mg steps per day, starting from 2 mg up to 10 mg once daily If a subject did not
      tolerate the 10- or 8-mg dose, 1 step back in the dosage scheme was allowed, from 10 to 8 mg
      on Day 6, or from 8 to 6 mg on Day 5. Subjects with intolerance for doses of less than 6 mg,
      were withdrawn from the study. Repeated dosing (6, 8 or 10 mg) was continued once daily until
      Day 8, to achieve steady-state. During placebo, the number of placebo tablets was
      consecutively escalated in an identical way as described for prucalopride. Between the 2
      sessions, there was a washout period of 14 to 21 days, to avoid any carry-over effect.
