      develop diabetes within a defined time period. In the last years, many diabetes risk
      prediction models were developed worldwide. It has been proposed that using diabetes risk
      scores as first step of diabetes screening is more practical than blood glucose tests as the
      latter are time consuming and costly. Given the rapid development of diabetes risk scores and
      a simultaneous reluctance of primary care physicians (PCPs) to implement diabetes risk scores
      in everyday practice, there is an urgent need to expand our knowledge of the impact of
      diabetes risk scores in the primary health care setting. Thus, the aim of the study is to
      investigate the impact of a non-invasive risk prediction model in the primary health care
      setting as component of routine health checks on change in physical activity.
