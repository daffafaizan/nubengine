      measurements. This has dramatically changed by the discovery that hiPSC can be generated from
      somatic cells (e.g. fibroblasts) by transduction of pluripotency genes. The investigators and
      others have shown that pluripotent stem cells can be efficiently differentiated into beating
      cardiac myocytes. This allows for the first time to study the function of cardiac myocytes
      from an individual patient. However, at present, only alterations were reproduced in hiPSC
      cells that were known previously and important limitations have to be resolved:

        -  Immaturity of hiPSC-derived cardiac myocytes

        -  Variability of hiPSC-generation, cardiac myocyte differentiation and experimental
           analyses

        -  No readout of contractile force, the parameter mostly affected in heart failure

        -  No modeling of hemodynamic stress in vitro

        -  No statistically valid correlation of hiPSC-cardiac myocyte function with
           clinical/genetic data

        -  Uncertainty as to standard values and adequate controls

        -  Unclear predictive value

      The research challenge for the coming years is to resolve these shortcomings. IndivuHeart
      formulates a number of hypotheses and goals that are based on the researchers' longstanding
      expertise in tissue engineering and recent, still unpublished data on the pathophysiology of
      HCM and its modeling in EHT. The study will

        -  reveal standard values for hiPSC-EHT function in a statistically valid manner, both
           under basal and stress conditions,

        -  define a "cardiomyopathy phenotype" in vitro,

        -  allow new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of human HCM and DCM,

        -  uncover HCM-like abnormalities in HFpEF,

        -  allow individualized drug testing (acute and chronic).
