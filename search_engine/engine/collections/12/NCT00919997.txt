        -  Describe the prevalence of penile, anal, and oral human papilloma virus (HPV) infection
           in HIV-seropositive Indian men who have sex with men.

        -  Determine the spectrum of HPV types at these anatomic sites in these patients.

        -  Determine the distribution of strain variants of HPV 16, 18, and 31 at these anatomic
           sites in these patients.

        -  Describe risk factors for penile, anal, and oral HPV infection in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete interviewer-administered questionnaires on demographics, native place,
      socioeconomic status, medical history, numbers of sexual partners and sexual practices,
      circumcision status, and risk factors for oral malignancies and human papilloma virus (HPV),
      including oral sex, smoking or chewing tobacco, drug use, oral hygiene, and tooth loss.

      Patients undergo cell sample collection from the penis, scrotum, anus, and mouth, and saliva
      sample collection for HPV DNA testing by PCR. Patients also undergo blood sample collection
      to measure CD4+ count and HIV viral load by FACS and PCR.
