      brain metastasis(10%) and any other reasons for screen failure rate(50%), it is esimated that
      88 patients will be randomized from 5 sites. Patients will be randomized 1:1, the
      experimental arm is upfront Osimertinib with WBI sequential therapy, while the control arm is
      Osimertinib plus WBI. Osimertinib at a dose of 80 mg once per day, until unacceptable adverse
      events or disease progression occurred. WBI could be given to patients in experimental arm at
      any time base on investigator's decision after treatment initiated. Patients will be
      stratifed at randomization by GPA score (3.5-4 vs <3.5) and the mutation type (Ex19Del /
      L858R). Patients will undergo the neurocognition, efficacy and safety assessments at
      baseline, and every 8 weeks until treatment is completed or discontinued. About time to brain
      metastases symptoms deterioration, the assessment was repeated in the first week (on site),
      second week (through telephone) and fourth week (on site). The rest assessment will be as
      well as other evaluations repeated every 8 weeks. To evaluate the correlation and predictive
      or prognostic value between gene dynamic changes and clinical efficacy, the tissue, plasma
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected at baseline. CSF will be collected in
      patients with intracranial progression. Plasma will be collected in all the patients at
      disease progression, while tissue is optional. Also, plasma will be collected at week 8(first
      evaluation of efficacy).
