    
      This is a large prospective, multi-center study explore the impact of the CAPTURE tool on
      clinical care and patient outcomes across a broad range of primary care settings in a cluster
      randomized controlled clinical trial.

      The CAPTURE tool consists of a 5-item self-administered questionnaire and selected use of
      peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement, designed to identify clinically significant COPD.

      The study will enroll approximately 5,000 patients across 100 participating primary care
      clinics associated with practice-based research networks (PBRNs). Participants will be
      assessed with the CAPTURE Tool and have research spirometry testing.

      Participating primary care practices will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the
      following interventions:

        -  Arm 1: Practice clinicians will receive basic COPD education, and patient-level CAPTURE
           information with CAPTURE interpretation education (CAPTURE+ COPD education).

        -  Arm 2: Practice clinicians will receive basic COPD education only (COPD education) and
           will be blinded to patient-level CAPTURE information.

      A predefined subgroup of participants will undergo longitudinal follow-up at 12 months to
      determine the impact of the CAPTURE Tool on clinical care and patient outcomes. Participant
      reported data will be collected through in-person visits, telephone and mail-based
      methodologies, depending upon practice site preferences and feasibility. Clinic site data
      will also be collected from the medical record to assess for changes in practice-level care.
