      entered the extension study within 12 weeks from the last investigational product
      administration in the previous study and had shown an increase in platelet counts ≥ 20 x
      109/L from baseline at least once during the 13-week treatment period (excluding 4 weeks
      after receiving rescue medication), they were treated with romiplostim at the same weekly
      dose (last dose on study) received in the previous study. Otherwise, subjects were treated
      with romiplostim at a starting dose of 3 μg/kg. Dose adjustment based on platelet counts was
      allowed throughout the treatment period to allow subjects to maintain platelet counts in the
      target range of ≥ 50 to ≤ 200 x 109/L, up to a maximum permitted dose of 10 μg/kg.
