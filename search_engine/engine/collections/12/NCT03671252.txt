    
      Outline: This is a multicenter,prospectively,randomized control ,phase III clinical
      study.Patients are stratified according to the distance from the tumor to the anal
      margin（≤5cm，>5cm） and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimen.Patients will receive full
      supportive care while on this study.

      Objectives：

      Primary: To compare neoadjuvant chemotherpay of FOLFOXIRI with conventional capecitabine
      single-agent radiotherapy in local advanced rectal cancer with respect to 3-year disease free
      survival rate (DFS) .

      Secondary:

        1. To compare postoperative 3-year local recurrence rate, 3-year distance metastasis free
           survival rate, 3-year overall survival between neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI with capecitabine
           single-agent radiotherapy groups.

        2. To compare R0 Resection rate and surgical complication between the two groups.

        3. To evaluate the tumor regression grade(TRG) between the two groups.

        4. To evaluate the adverse event profile and Long term quality of life between the two
           groups.
