      girls and to assess whether such factors track across a four year period. The innovation is
      to use novel methods and an integrated approach, to measure the influence of risk-taking
      behaviour, body composition, bone microstructure, motor proficiency, diet and physical
      activity in one model across growth. This will provide a more comprehensive picture of the
      key multi-factorial predictors of fracture within- and between-sexes. This essential
      information will provide the basis for change in public health policy, clinical practice,
      community programs, and targeted interventions.
