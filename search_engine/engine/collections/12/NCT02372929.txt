    
      This will be an observational prospective study. The investigators will aim to enroll 100
      male and female adult patients (aged 19 years and over) of all ethnicities/races, who have
      been referred to Florida Hospital for Endoscopic Ultrasound staging of esophageal cancer. All
      vulnerable populations will be excluded.

      The investigators will be using a standardized data collection form to record presenting
      symptoms, endoscopy findings, Endoscopic Ultrasound features and final esophageal cancer
      staging. This is an observational study in which standard of care is being practiced and also
      as the patients are not placed at additional risk from participating in this study. However,
      as the investigators are collecting data prospectively, all participants will sign consent.
      An attempt will be made to see if there is a correlation between stricture tightness
      encountered at endoscopy (EGD) with advanced disease stage diagnosed at Endoscopic
      Ultrasound.
