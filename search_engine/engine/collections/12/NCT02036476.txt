    
      Cabozantinib (XL184) is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and was approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 29 November 2012 for the treatment of
      patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. It is commercially available
      as COMETRIQâ„¢ in the United States.

      During the Pre Treatment Period, participants are consented and qualified (screened) for the
      study. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.

      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days, during which time the participant will be taking the
      study drug, cabozantinib, once daily. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary
      for each treatment cycle. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the
      study drug.

      - Participants will be followed for 8 weeks after removal from study or until death,
      whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will
      be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
