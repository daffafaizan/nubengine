      ACLS bradycardia algorithm in which a high-fidelity mannequin required external pacing. The
      scenario was considered a success if the material was correctly set by the participant to
      obtain electrical and mechanical pacing in nine minutes. All participants were wearing Tobii
      Glasses® which is a mobile eye-tracking system that automatically aggregates gaze data.
      Infrared markers were placed in the simulation room to create Area of Interest (AOI), from
      which results were obtained. Three AOI were created: the vital signs monitor, the
      defibrillator/pacing unit and the head of the patient. Eye-tracking data were analyzed using
      the Tobii Studio® program.
