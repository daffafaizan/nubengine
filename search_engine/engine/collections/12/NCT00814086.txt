      I. Determine the feasibility of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin and intravenous (IV)
      paclitaxel followed by IP paclitaxel in patients with stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV ovarian
      epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the types of surgical
      and catheter complications that may occur after surgery or during the course of treatment in
      these patients.

      III. Estimate the response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin intraperitoneally (IP) on day 1 and
      paclitaxel IP on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
