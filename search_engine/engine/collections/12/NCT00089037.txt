      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of sirolimus when administered with tacrolimus and
           methotrexate for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients
           with hematological malignancies undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from
           unrelated donors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the absorption and pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate sirolimus blood concentration with prevention of GVHD or toxicity in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the severity of post-transplantation mucositis in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral sirolimus once daily on days -3 to 175 and tacrolimus IV continuously
      beginning on day -3 and continuing until the patient is able to tolerate food and then orally
      twice daily until day 175. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.
      Treatment continues in the absence of acute graft-vs-host disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
