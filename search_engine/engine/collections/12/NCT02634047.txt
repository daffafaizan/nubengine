      that required transesophageal echocardiography insertion, will be randomized by means of a
      computer-generated randomization order into two groups: Conventional group (Group C), and
      videolaryngoscope group (group VL).

      Success rate of the selected technique (first attempt and overall), duration of insertion for
      selected technique, complications such as oropharyngeal mucosal injury and hematoma will be
      noted.
