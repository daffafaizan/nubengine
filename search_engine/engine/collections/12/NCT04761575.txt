      intake for the previous 4 weeks against a widely-used, validated computer based 24-hour
      dietary recall system (Intake24), which is the dietary assessment tool currently used by the
      UK's National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme. The second objective, the
      reproducibility of the FFQ 65+ dietary data, will also be tested by asking participants to
      complete the eNutri FFQ on two separate occasions with a 14-day interval between both. In
      addition, after completing the first FFQ, DBS will be collected from all participants to
      further validate the FFQ results against selected biomarkers, for example markers of nutrient
      intake, such as carotenoids, and markers of health, such as cholesterol.
