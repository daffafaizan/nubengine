    
      A Rectal Prolapse (RP), or procidentia, is the descent of the upper rectum. This descensus in
      the full-thickness of the rectum, and can be either internal, called an internal rectal
      prolapse or intussusception (IRP), or through the anus (called an external rectal prolapse
      (ERP)).

      RP mainly occurs in women (80-90%) of which most in the 6-7th decade. Risk factors for
      developing a rectal prolapse are the presence of an abnormal deep pouch of Douglas, laxity
      and atonic condition of the muscles of the pelvic floor and anal canal. Moreover, weakness of
      both internal and external sphincters, often with evidence of pudendal nerve neuropathy and
      the lack of normal fixation of the rectum may lead to RP. This also frequently leads to other
      pelvic organ prolapses like vesicoceles, enteroceles and genital prolapses. In this study the
      investigators will focus on the treatment of RP.

      Rectal prolapses cause anal incontinence in more than half of the patients. Another frequent
      symptom of RP is constipation. Furthermore, the rectal prolapse can lead to anal pain as a
      result of incarceration leading to ulcers, necrosis and perforation.

      Besides the fact that this disease has a considerable impact on the individual quality of
      life, it also carries significant socio-economic consequences as incontinence products have
      to be used in large amounts.
