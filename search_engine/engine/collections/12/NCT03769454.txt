      randomised study, safety and tolerability of PP-001 eye drops is assessed in healthy, adult
      volunteers. PP-001 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase
      (DHODH) with anti-inflammatory properties. PP-001 eye drops will be administered up to 4
      times per day over a period of 13 days in ascending doses. Participants will be monitored for
      safety and tolerability evaluation of the study drug.
