      reproductive age. It is characterized by elevated circulating insulin, reduced insulin
      sensitivity, infertility, hyperandrogenism, and a multitude of symptoms that result in a
      decreased quality of life. The elevated insulin characteristic of PCOS is likely to play a
      major role in its pathogenesis by reducing insulin sensitivity and stimulating excess
      androgen production hence causing an hormonal imbalance.

      Low calories diets have shown to improve pcos symptoms but the optimal diet for all pcos
      women is still unknown.

      In this study, our purpose is to compare two lowering insulin restricted calories diets in
      order to find the optimal diet for improving metabolic and endocrin outcomes in pcos women we
      will also investigate which diet has the best long lasting compliance.
