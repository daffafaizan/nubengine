      United Kingdom may have the potential to increase levels of lipid peroxidation products in
      donor human milk. It is therefore important to quantify the extent of this increase. This
      project aims to quantify for the first time the levels of lipid peroxidation products in
      donor human milk that is provided to infants on the neonatal unit.

      Donor human milk samples will be collected from two neonatal units in the United Kingdom,
      served by different human milk banks. Fresh mature term breast milk, collected from healthy
      mothers in the community, and preterm transitional/mature breast milk, collected from healthy
      mothers at a neonatal unit, will be used for comparison. For each group, 10 x 5 mL samples
      will be analysed for the lipid peroxidation products, malondialdehyde, 4 hydroxy-2-nonenal,
      hexanal, and 8-iso-PGF2Î±. The fatty acid content and total antioxidant capacity will also be
      measured. All analysis will be undertaken at Bournemouth University.
