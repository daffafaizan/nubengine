        1. Dyad (patient-caregiver) participation in health care management and problem-solving
           method use with professionals will be greater in the experimental group than the control
           group

        2. Dyad reactive depression will be lower in the experimental group than the control group

        3. Dyad quality of life will be higher in the experimental group than the control group

        4. Dyad health status scores will be higher and the dyad sleepiness scale will be lower in
           experimental group than the control group

        5. Dyad Health Services Use will be lower in the experimental group than the control group

        6. Catheter-related infections will be lower in the experimental than control patients

      Aim #2 Hypotheses:

        1. What is the cost of using the FamTechCare system compared to traditional care?

        2. Is there a difference between efficiency scores of the experimental and control groups
           intervention, boosters and relative to dyads long-term health services use at 24 months?

        3. What are the relationships among patient outcome variables and caregivers' rating of
           virtual nurse caring and caregiver adaption?

        4. What are the relationships among use of FamTechCare, dyad participation in health care
           management scale score and dyad access to the Internet Weighted Score?
