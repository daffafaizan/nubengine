      and symptoms of DED will be randomly assigned to receive either a single concentration of
      AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution or AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution Vehicle.

      A screening visit will be followed by a baseline period where subjects will dose with AXR-159
      Ophthalmic Solution Vehicle for 14 days. At the end of the baseline period patients who still
      exhibit signs and symptoms of DED will be enrolled into a 3-month bouble-masked treatment
      period.
