      function in T2DM. Abundant support for the glucotoxicity hypothesis has been provided by in
      vivo and in vitro studies in animals, but a rigorous test of this hypothesis in man is
      lacking. The investigators propose to test the glucotoxicity hypothesis by chronically
      reducing the plasma glucose in type 2 diabetic subjects (T2DM) with an inhibitor of renal
      glucose transport, dapaglifozin, and examining the effect of restoration of normoglycemia on
      mitochondrial function and insulin signaling/sensitivity. Lastly, the investigators will test
      the "glucolipotoxicity" hypothesis, which states that the toxic effects of elevated plasma
      FFA on insulin sensitive tissues (i.e., muscle) are magnified in the presence of concurrent
      hyperglycemia. Thus, high glucose levels increase malonyl CoA, which inhibits CPT I, leading
      to accumulation of FACoA/DAG, which impair mitochondrial function and inhibit insulin action.
