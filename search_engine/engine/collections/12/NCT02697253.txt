      world-wide, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) surgeries are
      effective treatments. A barrier to progress is that between 25% and 40% patients were not
      successful in achieving and maintaining at least 30% weight loss, which is considered
      medically successful for this operation. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to
      success or failure of this operation is an unsolved problem in obesity research, which this
      proposal is addressing. The focus of this project is to identify mechanisms that contribute
      to suppression of food intake following bariatric surgery, and to investigate whether these
      mechanisms predict long-term success following bariatric surgery
