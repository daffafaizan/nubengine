    
      Hypothesis 1: Severe sepsis will be associated with downregulation of anabolic signaling
      molecules and genes, upregulation of catabolic signaling molecules and genes, and the
      development of histologic and electrophysiologic abnormalities within skeletal muscle.

      Hypothesis 2: Electrical stimulation will improve muscle strength in patients with sepsis.

      Hypothesis 3: Electrical stimulation will be associated with upregulation of anabolic
      signaling molecules and genes, downregulation of catabolic signaling molecules and genes, and
      improvement of histologic and electrophysiologic parameters within skeletal muscle of
      patients with sepsis.

      Hypothesis 4: The ratio of catabolic:anabolic gene expression on Day 3 will be positively
      correlated with the severity of clinical weakness on Day 7
