      measures contribute to 50% increase of incidence. The investigators are to investigate the
      VTE in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and delineate the risk factors to establish a VTE
      risk model system helping clinicians to differentiate VTE high risk population and apply
      early prevention in order to reduce the incidence of VTE.
