      neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The etiology of ASD is
      complicated and remains largely unknown. Evidences indicate the high heritability (54-77%) in
      ASD, and researchers also found copy number variations (CNVs) play an important role in the
      etiology of ASD. However, due to the ethical issue, researchers haven't had an appropriate
      platform to investigate the copy number change effect to date. In the following study,
      researchers are going to derive ASD-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons for
      disease modeling.

      10 ASD patients and 10 healthy controls will be included in the present study and iPSCs and
      neurons will be generated from their PBMCs. Electrophysiological recording and analysis of
      neuronal morphology will be conducted to reveal the cellular phenotype of ASD after comparing
      differences between patients and healthy controls.

      The study will provide a platform to reveal the etiology of genetic basis and molecular
      mechanism of ASD. The cellular phenotype of ASD will be revealed by comparing differences
      between patients and healthy controls. The findings from this work are expected to contribute
      to the basic and clinical research on ASD.
