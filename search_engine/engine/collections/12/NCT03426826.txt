      21st century. Although most children with ASD exhibit core social communication deficits,
      very limited interests, repetitive behaviors and sensory problems, the severity of symptoms
      and how well each child responds to standard behavioral therapies can vary tremendously from
      patient to patient. This makes it difficult to enact effective interventions. Other variables
      also influence the outcomes for ASD patients, including age at first diagnosis, access to
      care, the quality of treatments and the expertise of interventionists.

      Children with ASD also have medical disturbances, which affects their quality of life and
      compliance in intervention programs. For example, approximately 40 percent of children with
      ASD have gastrointestinal disturbances (GIDs). Genetics plays a substantial role in risk, but
      scientists also have determined that non-heritable factors can trigger the expression and
      severity of ASD symptoms. Clinical research studies from PI laboratories have focused on the
      gut-brain link that influences ASD symptoms, how a child functions and even responds to
      interventions .

      The investigators hypothesize that children with ASD will tolerate single endoscopic delivery
      of fecal transplant therapy which will modify their gut microbial profile leading to
      reduction of repetitive and rigid-compulsive behaviors, based on the Repetitive Behavioral
      Scales-Revised (RBS-R). Secondary outcomes include improved score in social responsiveness
      scale and gastrointestinal symptoms . Investigators propose a phase I safety study for the
      use of FMT in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
