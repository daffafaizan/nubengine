    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To test the hypothesis that the addition of a targeted agent, such as vandetanib, to
           standard chemotherapy with docetaxel will result in incremental responses in patients
           with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To study the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical site.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV once every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV as in arm I and oral vandetanib (100 mg) once
           daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive docetaxel IV as in arm I and oral vandetanib (300 mg) once
           daily.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 5 years.
