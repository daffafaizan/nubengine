    
      Aim 1: This study will compare changes in cognitive function and brain health in
      post-menopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) randomized to either: 1) a community-based
      aerobic exercise program; or 2) a health education program (control group).

      Aim 2: Gather information on the intervention's potential for scalability using the RE-AIM
      framework.

      Eligible BCS (N=160) will be randomized to one of the following 6-month programs: Aerobic
      Exercise Training (n=80; progressive moderate-intensity exercise delivered by community
      fitness center personal trainers) or Health Education (n=80; attention control receiving
      cancer support and education). To assess Aim 1, participants will complete measures at
      baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (Month 6), and follow-up (Month 12; i.e., 6 months
      after post-intervention). Aim 1 measures include: neurocognitive tasks, functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI; M0 and M6 only), graded exercise testing, physical activity
      monitoring (i.e., accelerometry), and questionnaires. To assess Aim 2, outcomes defined by
      the RE-AIM framework (a dissemination and implementation framework) will be measured,
      including: study reach(e.g., participation rate), intervention effectiveness (i.e., Aim 1),
      intervention adoption (e.g.,number of community sites invited that participate),
      implementation (e.g., fidelity of intervention delivery, participant satisfaction), and
      maintenance (e.g., Aim 1 maintenance of effects, participant retention). Findings of this
      study will lay the groundwork toward our long-term goal of disseminating an evidence-based
      program for managing cognitive impairment in individuals diagnosed with cancer.
