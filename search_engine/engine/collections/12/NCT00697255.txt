    
      This trial will include two separate stages (Ia+Ib and II).

      Stage Ia will be open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore
      whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose recFSH
      provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Stage Ib will be open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore
      whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose hCG
      provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Stage II is open-label and randomized (n=40) to evaluate whether the intended dosing regimen
      of corifollitropin alfa followed by low dose FSH (n=20) or hCG (n=20) provide an appropriate
      response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
