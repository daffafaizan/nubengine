        -  Determine the effect of one year of adjuvant hormonal ablation on disease-free survival
           at 5 years in node-negative radical prostatectomy patients at high risk for progression.

        -  Determine the effect of this treatment on the incidence of androgen independent prostate
           cancer and on disease specific and overall survival.

        -  Determine the impact of one year of total androgen ablation on quality of life and serum
           testosterone levels.

        -  Assess differences in quality of life between wives of patients in the androgen ablation
           condition compared to wives of patients in the control condition.

        -  Obtain blood samples from patients at high risk for failure post-prostatectomy to
           evaluate serum markers of prognosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly once every 3 months and oral
           flutamide three times daily for 1 year.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no initial treatment. Quality of life is assessed every 6
           months for 5 years. Quality of life of wives/partners of patients is assessed every 6
           months for two years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 496 patients (248 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.5 years.
