      following vitrification and subsequent warming with both slush nitrogen and liquid nitrogen.
      After warming, fertilization and embryology outcomes will be assessed.

      Oocyte donors and a single donor sperm source will be utilized. Following enrollment, oocyte
      donors will undergo ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval. The mature (MII) oocytes
      obtained for each patient will then be assigned a number and randomized via block
      randomization to one of two treatment groups (liquid nitogen or slush nitrogen). Through
      block randomization, this will create a paired population of oocytes so that half of each
      patient's oocytes will undergo cryopreservation with liquid nitrogen and half will undergo
      cryopreservation with slush nitrogen. Timing of hyaluronidase stripping and vitrification
      will be consistent with current institutional clinical practice for oocytes.

      Following cryopreservation, oocytes will be warmed and intracytoplasmic sperm injection will
      be performed and subsequent embryology outcomes tracked.
