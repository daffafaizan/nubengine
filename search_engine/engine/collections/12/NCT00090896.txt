    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of anti-cytotoxic
           T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (CTLA4-blocking monoclonal
           antibody; CP-675,206) administered with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with MART-1
           antigen in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the biological activity and immune effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate CTLA4 genotype with safety of this regimen and/or immune response in these
           patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of clinical benefit
           rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (CTLA4-blocking monoclonal antibody;
      CP-675,206).

      Patients receive CP-675,206 IV on days 0, 28, 60, and 90 and autologous dendritic cells
      pulsed with MART-1 antigen intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28. After day 120, patients with
      stable or responding disease may receive additional doses of CP-675,206 monthly in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CP-675,206 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-21 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-10
      months.
