      to instruct residents in the basics of knee arthroscopy. Twenty-four medical students with no
      prior arthroscopic or laparoscopic experience were enrolled as subjects. Sixteen subjects
      were randomized to participate in four hours of either the cigar box arthroscopy trainer
      (CBAT) or a previously validated anatomic knee arthroscopy trainer (AKAT). The remaining
      eight subjects served as controls (CO). All subjects underwent a one-hour formalized training
      session provided by our orthopaedic sports faculty. Subjects' skills were assessed by one of
      two faculty members through repeated attempts at performing a diagnostic knee arthroscopy on
      a cadaveric specimen. Objective scores were given using the Basic Arthroscopic Knee Skill
      Scoring System. Total cost differences were also calculated.
