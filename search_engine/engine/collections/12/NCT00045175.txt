        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of UCN-01 and
           topotecan in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
           peritoneal cavity cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of this regimen
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 and topotecan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 additional
      ovarian epithelial cancer patients are then treated at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10
      months.
