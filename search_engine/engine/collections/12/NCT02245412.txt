      PK/PD, and efficacy of ALXN1007 (a C5a inhibitor) in up to 36 participants with newly
      diagnosed acute GVHD of the lower GI tract. All participants meeting the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria for the study were to receive ALXN1007 over an 8 week treatment period.
      Participants in Cohort 1, the first dosing cohort, were to receive 10 milligrams/kilogram
      (mg/kg) ALXN1007 administered IV once weekly for 8 weeks. Participants in Cohort 2 were to
      receive 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 IV once weekly for 8 weeks. Participants in Cohort 3 were to
      receive 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 IV twice weekly for 8 weeks. All doses of ALXN1007 were to be
      administered as a continuous IV infusion.
