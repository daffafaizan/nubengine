      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, estimate graft-versus-host disease free relapse free
      (GRFS) survival at 1- year post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days post-transplant.

      II. Estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1- and 2-years post-transplant.

      III. Estimate the probabilities of overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS) at 1- and
      2-years post-transplant.

      IV. Estimate rate of infection and development of second malignancies including
      lymphoproliferative disorders at 1- and 2-years post-transplant.

      V. Assess patients' quality of life (QOL) at day 100 and 1 year post alloHCT.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize and evaluate hematologic recovery, donor cell engraftment and immune
      reconstitution by cell count and flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets.

      II. Characterize changes in aGVHD biomarkers (Reg-3alpha, TNF-RI, and ST2) and a composite
      biomarker panel (IL2Ralpha, TNF-R1, IL-8, and hepatocyte growth factor), JAK-regulated
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNFalpha, CRP, Beta2 Microglobulin, and IFNgamma) and
      STAT3 phosphorylation (downstream of JAK signaling) over time and by aGVHD status/grade.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (RIC): Patients receive fludarabine via infusion on days -9 to
      -5 and melphalan on day -4 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (HSCT): Patients undergo HSCT on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day -3
      and continuing until day 100 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) or PO and sirolimus PO beginning day -3
      and continuing until day 100 with a taper in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically
      for up to 2 years post- transplantation.
