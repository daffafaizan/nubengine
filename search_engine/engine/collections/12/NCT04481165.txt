      pathway for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.

      The literature highlights a paradox between scientific data and clinical practice, based on
      expert consensus. There are a very few qualitative studies in this subject and none of them
      concern adolescents.

      The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the experience and opinion of adolescents
      suffering from anorexia nervosa confronted with the prescription of antidepressants
