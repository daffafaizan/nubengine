        -  Determine the frequency of hematologic responses in patients with myelodysplastic
           syndrome treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG
           chimera.

        -  Correlate phenotypic, cytogenetic, and functional disease characteristics with treatment
           responses in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 8 hours daily for 4 days followed
      by tumor necrosis factor receptor IgG chimera subcutaneously twice weekly for 16 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 8, 16, and 20 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
