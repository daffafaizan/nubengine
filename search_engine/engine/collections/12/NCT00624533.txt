      lifetime prevalence of more than 70%. It is responsible for a major portion of work
      absenteeism and is actually among those conditions which generate the greatest expense due to
      health and labor costs.

      The Spanish National Health Service is a universal and free health care system. Non-specific
      low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent disorder, generating large health and social costs.

      There is considerable variation in LBP related clinical practice and a considerable number of
      clinical guidelines have been developed for the management of subacute and chronic LBP
      patients.

      Experience in Primary Care Centers of Madrid shows that physiotherapeutic intervention based
      on GDS Method for Articular and Muscular Chains is an efficient technique in the treatment of
      patients with diagnosis of non-specific low back pain compared with conventional
      physiotherapy treatment in Primary Care based on electrotherapy (TENS and microwave)

      Currently, no randomized studies examining the effects of this method for patients with
      subacute or chronic non-specific low back pain have been published.
