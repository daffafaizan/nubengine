      system in patients with liver fibrosis (Cohort 1, n = 150) and healthy volunteers (Cohort 2,
      n = 50), for a total of 200 participants. The physician operator of the FibroScan, and the
      operator of the Shear wave vibro-elastography (S-WAVE) system, will not be blinded to the
      clinical diagnoses of the patients. All patients will undergo the testing with both FibroScan
      and Liver Incyte system at a single in-clinic visit.

      The liver stiffness of each participant will be assessed with the Liver Incyte Model B device
      and with FibroScan. The elasticity measurements from these two devices will be the primary
      outcome measure.

      The Liver Incyte system is designed as two models with differences in the ultrasound
      components only, description of the two models is below. Two sub-studies are included in this
      design as exploratory objectives. Model B will be utilized at all study sites and all study
      participants. Participants at the LAIR study site will also be evaluated using Model A, as
      well as Model B, for verification and to confirm consistency between designs. Participants
      will have the option to participate in the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and Proton
      Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) portion of the study. MRE/PDFF is an optional procedure, which
      makes up a sub-study for this trial, this would require approximately 1 hour, and is open to
      any participant who is willing and has time for the extra study visit. The results of the
      MRE/PDFF sub-study will be included as an exploratory objective.
