    
      40 acute subjects will be randomized and split into 5 groups.

      Each group will receive one of the following tDCS montages :

      Anodal : Anode placer over the affected primary motor cortex, cathode over contralateral
      supra orbital area Bilateral : Anode placer over the affected primary motor cortex, cathode
      over unaffected motor cortex Cathodal : Cathode placer over the unaffected primary motor
      cortex, anode over contralateral supra orbital area Extracephalic : Anode placer over the
      affected primary motor cortex, cathode over right shoulder Placebo : anode montage but
      current is ramped up over 15 secondes, then ramped down.

      Subjects will receive, in addition to conventional rehabilitation (Â±1.5h/weekday), 2mA for 20
      mins of their attributed tDCS, 5 times a week.

      Evaluations will take place before the first stimulation period (48h post stroke), after 1,
      2, 3 and 4 weeks. Evaluations consist of the Wolf Motor Function Test, the Fugl Meyer, and
      the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament Test

      All researchers, therapists, data analysis and patients are blinded by a code system
      implemented in the tDCS machine
