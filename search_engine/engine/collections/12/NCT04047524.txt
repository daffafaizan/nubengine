      Trust will be enrolled to a pilot randomised controlled trial. They will randomised to either
      a home-based trimodal prehabilitation programme, delivered by the use of FitBit Smart Watches
      and Smartphone applications, or a control group who will receive a FitBit for physical
      activity monitoring only, for a period of 2-6 weeks prior to surgery. The prehabilitation
      programme will include exercise, nutritional, and psychological components. Study outcomes
      will include 6MWT (6-minute walk test), HADS (hospital anxiety and depression score), steps
      per day, length of stay post-operatively, and post-operative complications.
