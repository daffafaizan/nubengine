      Therapy (AST) developed collaboratively with the University of Michigan, to enable placement
      of dental implants in patients who lack adequate alveolar bone. This project addresses
      specifically the placement of dental implants following bone regenerative sinus floor
      augmentation. This novel therapy mitigates the risks of other therapies, providing additional
      benefits of adequate cell numbers for high quality bone regeneration, and has the potential
      to become the new standard of care. In Aastrom's patented manufacturing technology, iliac
      bone marrow aspirates are expanded ex-vivo to enrich for adult multipotent cells (Bone Repair
      Cells- BRC) capable of regenerating bone and blood vessels. BRC will then be mixed with bone
      matrix graft extender, beta-tricalcium phosphate (Î²-TCP), before their implantation into the
      regenerative site.
