      32,1% of all deliveries in 2011.

      Several studies describe instances in which pregnancies following a previous Cesarean section
      were accompanied by complications such as life-threatening bleeding, placenta previa,
      placenta accreta, increta or percreta and dehiscence or uterine rupture.

      The risk of those complications increases further with the uterine scar tissue of a second
      Cesarean section.

      Today it is already common practice to resect uterine scars if the scar of a previous
      Cesarean section becomes symptomatic, or when a non-symptomatic uterine rupture or serious
      dehiscence are discovered during a Cesarean delivery.

      In this study all participants of the interventional group are examined via intraoperative
      ultrasound to identify the first uterine Cesarean section scar and resect it completely.

      Six to nine months after the resection participants will return for a one time follow-up. At
      this time, the investigators will measure the number of uterine scars and median myometrial
      thickness using transvaginal ultrasound. The results will be compared with those of two
      control groups, consisting of women who underwent either one or two Cesarean sections without
      the intervention.

      The aim of the present study is to asses if the number of uterine scars and median myometrial
      thickness can be improved by the resection of the first uterine scar during a subsequent
      Cesarean section.

      This will allow the investigators to draw conclusions regarding the benefit of routine
      resections of uterine Cesarean section scars, and whether this practice could lead to a
      decreased risk for women undergoing two or more Cesarean sections.
