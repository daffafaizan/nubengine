    
      Main objective

      To determine in treatment-naïve HIV-2 infected patients, with CD4 counts above 200 cells/mm3,
      which of the following three regimens of first line treatment, Tenofovir (TDF), Emtricitabine
      or lamivudine (FTC or 3TC) plus Zidovudine (ZDV); TDF-FTC (3TC) plus Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV
      / r); or TDF-FTC (3TC) plus raltegravir (RAL), will result in an "global success" rate of >
      55% at week 96.

      Number of participants : 210

      Main outcome :

      The proportion of patients with "global success" at W96, defined by survival with a plasma
      HIV-2 RNA viral load of <50 copies/ml and the non-occurrence of AIDS classified events
      (excluding tuberculosis) and the non-occurrence of severe morbidities non-AIDS-defining
      illness (cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, severe bacterial disease) and a delta of CD4
      depending on the initial CD4 count (CD4 delta > +100cells/mm3 for initial CD4s between 201
      and 500 cells/mm3 or delta ≥0 cells/mm3 for initial CD4s > +500 cells/mm3)

        -  Naïve for antiretroviral therapy (including antiretroviral treatment in the context of
           PMTCT except taking a dose of Nevirapine for PMTCT)

        -  CD4 >200 cells/mm3

        -  Resident of the city where the study is held or of city suburbs to facilitate
           participation
