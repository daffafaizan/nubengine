    
      This is an exploratory, pilot, proof of concept Phase 2 study. The objectives include the
      comparison of efficacy of ALZ-1101 to latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution in reducing
      elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension who have IOP not adequately controlled with latanoprost.

      70 Subjects (35 per arm) will be treated once daily (QD) in the evening with either ALZ-1101
      or latanoprost for 28 days.

      Efficacy will be assessed at 3 separate times (8 AM, 10 AM and 4 PM) on each treatment visit
      (Days 0, 7, 14 and 28) by Goldmann applanation tonometry.

      Safety assessments will include slit lamp examination/anterior chamber cell and flare
      grading, ophthalmoscopy/fundus examination, visual acuity, visual field testing and
      colelction of adverse events. Subject rating of study medication comfort will be collected at
      each visit.

      Primary efficacy endpoint is the between-group comparison of the mean IOP at the 10 am time
      point at visit 5 (Day 28). Secondary endpoints include the between-group comparisons of the
      mean change from baseline in IOP at all time-points, between group comparison of the mean
      change from baseline in diurnal IOP at all post-baseline visits and the proportion of
      subjects with IOP â‰¤ 18 mm Hg at all time points at all post-baseline visits.
