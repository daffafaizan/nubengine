      due to maladaptive CNS (central nervous system facility) plasticity and thus could be
      decreased by retraining the sensorimotor cortex using Mental Motor Imaging guided through a
      novel BCI-RV feedback system : "Ghost". The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of this BCI pain treatment developed by our team.
