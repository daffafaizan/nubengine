    
      Participants receive evaluations (1/week for 3 months period) of

        -  motor function (Include: MMSE, brunnstr√∂m stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical
           Performance, Box and Block Test of Manual Dexterity, Functional Independence Measure)

        -  cortical perfusion detection during performing limb movements (using NIRS)

      Then use path analysis to investigate the relationship between motor cortex
      oxygenation/metabolism and motor function recovery after stroke.
