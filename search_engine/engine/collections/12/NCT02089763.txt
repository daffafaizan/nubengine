    
      This is a phase II, single-arm clinical trial. Approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled in
      the study. All subjects will be treated with PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg weekly (day1, 8 and 15).
      Three week treatment of PEG-BCT-100 is considered as 1 cycle. All subjects will receive
      PEG-BCT-100 till progressive disease, intolerable toxicity or patients withdraw consent.

      The clinical effects of PEG-BCT-100 on disease response will be evaluated every 6 weeks until
      disease progression. Disease response evaluation will be based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. The
      disease response based on modified RECIST criteria will also be evaluated and documented for
      reference only.

      Safety parameters will be evaluated throughout the study. Adverse event (AE) will be graded
      according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      version 4.0 (NCI CTC AE v4).

      All subjects will undergo a tumor tissue biopsy at baseline for evaluation of the biomarkers
      of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and arginine succinate synthetase (ASS) except for those
      subjects whose tumor tissue blocks have been obtained within 1 year and are available for the
      biomarkers evaluation. The association between the levels of the 2 biomarkers and disease
      response to PEG-BCT-100 treatment will be explored in the study.

      The effects on patients' quality of life will be evaluated every 2 cycles of the PEG-BCT-100
      treatment.
