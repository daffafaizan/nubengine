      without concurrent or historical controls.

      The primary objective of the study is to generate early feasibility data for the CardiAQâ„¢
      Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implant System with the Transfemoral and Transapical Delivery
      Systems for the treatment of moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation in patients who
      are considered high risk for mortality and morbidity from conventional open-heart surgery.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the long-term safety of the device and
      the effects of the device on performance, functional, quality of life parameters, and
      technical, device, procedural, and individual patient successes.

      The study is to be performed at a maximum of 5 investigational sites in the US.
