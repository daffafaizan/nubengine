    
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

      This protocol will create a central repository for banking tumor and other tissues as well as
      serum from patients with uterine corpus tumors. In addition, this protocol will also serve as
      a central repository for serum and tissue to healthy post-menopausal and peri-menopausal
      controls.

      There will be an "internal" bank. The internal bank will have samples available to UNM
      investigators.
