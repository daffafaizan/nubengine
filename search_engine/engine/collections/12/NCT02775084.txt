      often characterized by reduced muscle and cognitive function. Although much of the
      aging-associated inflammation has been attributed to chronic activation of the innate host
      defense system, activated CD4+ T cells have been shown to contribute directly to the
      pathogenesis of several other inflammatory diseases. In humans, dietary n-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
      have anti-inflammatory properties and reduce disease symptoms, in part, through suppression
      of CD4+ T cell activation. Therefore, the Researchers' overall hypothesis is that dietary
      supplementation with DHA and EPA in humans will ameliorate inflammatory symptoms, in part, by
      suppressing CD4+ T cell activation, positively affecting muscle and cognitive function.
