      to improve different facets of quality of life. Briefly, the two interventions are:

        1. A palliative symptom management and psychosocial care intervention named Collaborative
           Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness (CASA) that includes

             1. evidence-based palliative symptom management of breathlessness, fatigue, and pain,
                provided by a nurse;

             2. a 6-session structured psychosocial care protocol targeting depression and
                adjustment to illness, supplemented by informal (family) caregiver assessment and
                support, provided by a social worker or psychologist; and

             3. brief weekly team meetings with the nurse, social worker/psychologist and a
                palliative care specialist, cardiologist, and primary care provider.

        2. A psychospiritual intervention that is home-based, self-guided, and requires minimal
           resources. It will be delivered in written modular form via US Mail along with brief
           weekly telephone support.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        1. Examine intervention feasibility and determine preliminary estimates of intervention
           effect

             1. Determine patient participation rates and cohort retention

             2. Conduct a preliminary assessment of outcomes by measuring pre-post changes in
                quality of life, depressive symptoms, health status, life meaning, and
                spirituality.

        2. Obtain qualitative feedback from study participants, the persons providing the
           intervention, and providers/leaders in primary care, mental health, palliative care,
           chaplaincy, and hospital operations.
