      investigating the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1603 on fasted
      condition.Up to 4 cohorts of 32 eligible participants totally are planned to be enrolled.
      This is a two-arm clinical trial that ZSP1603 and matching placebo will be orally
      administered once daily. Two subjects in the first cohort will be assigned in a opened
      fashion to receive 7.5mg of ZSP1603 while another three cohorts of volunteers will be
      randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive either a single dose of ZSP1603 or matching
      placebo in an ascending dose fashion. To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (Holter, 12-lead
      ECG, Vital signs, Physical examination, Clinical Laboratory), and detect the pharmacokinetics
      of ZSP1603.
