      to increase further. As individuals with diabetes are at high risk of accelerated
      atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular events, the significant proportion of the
      cardiovascular disease burden is projected to be among this population. JPAD is a multicenter
      study with a prospective randomized open, blinded end-point (PROBE) design. The doses
      administered are aspirin 81 mg/day or 100 mg/day, the latter being enteric-coated Aspirin.

      The primary objective was to compare the effect of aspirin on atherosclerotic events
      including cardiovascular events, cerebral vascular event, and other vascular events.

      We also analyze hemorrhagic events in this RCT.
