      paclitaxel, etoposide, and estramustine vs ketoconazole, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and
      estramustine in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer, as measured by prostate
      specific antigen (PSA)-based response rate, time to progression, and overall survival. II.
      Identify the most promising regimen to use in a phase III trial based on toxic effects,
      PSA-based response rates, and clinical benefit.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk
      group: low volume disease (no more than 2 lesions on bone scan), intermediate volume (more
      than 2 bone lesions confined to axial skeleton), or high volume (bone lesions in appendicular
      skeletal or visceral lesions). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral estramustine three times a day and oral etoposide twice daily on days
      1-14 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days. Arm II:
      Patients receive doxorubicin IV on days 1, 15, and 29, vinblastine IV on days 8, 22, and 36,
      oral ketoconazole three times a day on days 1-7, 15-21, and 29-35, and oral estramustine
      three times a day on days 8-14, 22-28, and 36-42. This regimen consists of 6 weeks of
      alternating chemotherapy and 2 weeks rest, for an 8 week course. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (46 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
