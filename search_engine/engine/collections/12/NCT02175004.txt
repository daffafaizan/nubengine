    
      Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a rare, hereditary disease caused by mutations in
      the transthyretin (TTR) protein. TTR is made by the liver and secreted into the blood. TTR
      mutations cause it to misfold and deposit in multiple organs causing FAP.

      IONIS-TTR Rx is an antisense drug that is designed to decrease the amount of mutant and
      normal TTR made by the liver. It is predicted that decreasing the amount of TTR protein will
      result in a decrease in the formation of TTR deposits, and thus slow or stop disease
      progression.

      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of extended dosing with IONIS-TTR Rx in
      patients with Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy.
