      evaluate liver and spleen fibrosis in patients with Gaucher Disease. To compare the
      elastography with the biomarkers that taken at the GD haematology clinic and to check the
      correlation with severity of liver and spleen fibrosis.

      SWE is a safe with diagnostic accuracy regarding the liver (& Spleen) fibrosis. Estimating
      spleen fibrosis is an innovative approach in liver disease and Gaucher.

      The evaluation of fibrosis with this relatively new and safe method could avoid complications
      and invasive procedure in GD patients .
