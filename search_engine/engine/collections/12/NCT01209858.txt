      The study has 2 parts: Part A investigating the effects of steady state perampanel on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single-dose oral contraceptive (OC) containing ethinylestradiol
      (EE) and levonorgestrel (LN) (Microgynon-30) and Part B investigating the effects of repeated
      dosing of an OC containing EE and LN (Microgynon-30) on the PK of a single dose of
      perampanel.
