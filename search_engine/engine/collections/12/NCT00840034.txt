    
      This is a 12 week multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of
      LY2216684 augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in participants
      with MDD who have a partial response to treatment with an SSRI. While remaining on a steady
      dose of their SSRI treatment at entry into the study, participants will be randomly assigned
      to adjunctive treatment with LY2216684 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio for 10 weeks of acute
      treatment.
