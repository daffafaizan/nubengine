      chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by esophagectomy based on the NCCN guideline. The rate of
      pathologic complete response (pCR) after nCRT was around 25-30%, reflecting potential cure of
      unresectable esophageal cancer receiving CRT. Since esophagectomy might have substantial
      morbidity and mortality rate, establishing the model for predicting nCRT response and
      survival will guide neoadjuvant treatment decisions and personalized treatment. Thus surgery
      might be spared in some patients with complete responses after nCRT, and surgery could be
      selectively reserved for those with only partial or no response to CRT. However, reported
      models yield unsatisfactory results due to small sample size and low accuracy, and most cases
      were adenocarcinoma and few models were used to predict survival. This study will
      prospectively collect the tissue and blood samples of locally advanced esophageal cancer
      patients, detect CRT resistance biomarkers, assess the SUV value and texture parameters of
      18F-FDG PET-CT as well as ADC values DWI-MRI. The investigators will use advanced statistical
      tools to establish the model and further validate the model in another group of patients.The
      investigators will also establish a model for survival prediction. This model might possibly
      guide the personalized treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients in China.
