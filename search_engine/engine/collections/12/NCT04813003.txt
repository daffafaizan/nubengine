      adults undergoing bariatric surgery. To this end, the study consists of an experimental
      setting combining neurobehavioural tasks, computational modelling and functional brain
      imaging.

      The main objective is to assess changes in neural coding and food behaviour in obese adults
      undergoing bariatric surgery. The investigators hypothesize that changes in the subjective
      neural processes of nutritional food attributes are related to changes in the respective
      neural coding structure. More specifically, if a given attribute has a more precise (i.e.,
      more structured) neural representation after bariatric surgery, then these attributes should
      exert more weight during dietary choices (and vice versa for more imprecise representations).

      The further objective is to elucidate if neural coding and food behaviour differ between
      obese adults and lean adults, and to see whether these differences tend to be reduced
      post-surgery among obese participants. The investigators hypothesize that subjective neural
      processes of nutritional food attributes differ between the obese and control participants,
      showing an unhealthier pattern among obese participants.

      To this aim, the outcomes will be compared between groups (surgery group and control group)
      and the changes pre- and post- surgery will be assessed for the surgery group.
