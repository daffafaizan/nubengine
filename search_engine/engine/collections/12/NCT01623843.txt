      ball and socket in the hip joint. This mismatch creates abnormal contact in the hip which can
      cause patients to experience hip pain. This can eventually lead to hip damage and
      osteoarthritis. Hip arthroscopy, a form of minimally invasive surgery has become a popular
      treatment option. The investigators are conducting a definitive randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) to determine whether surgical correction of the impingement morphology via arthroscopic
      osteochondroplasty (shaving of bone) will provide improved clinical results (decreased pain
      and improved function) in adult FAI patients compared to arthroscopic lavage (washing out of
      painful inflammation debris) and treating obvious damage of the hip joint.

      Like most RCTs, FIRST is designed to demonstrate efficacy (i.e. that an intervention can work
      theoretically under optimal conditions). In order to address generalizability and improve
      external validity of the FIRST trial, we are including an external validation cohort using a
      "RCT with and Embedded ProspectIve Cohort design" (FIRST-EPIC). This pragmatic cohort will
      allow us to: 1) safeguard against bias attributable to patients declining to take part in the
      RCT; 2) corroborate or refute whether our efficacy (RCT) population represents the best case
      scenario (i.e. those with optimal response to osteochondroplasty); 3) evaluate effectiveness
      of osteochondroplasty and other standard of care treatments for FAI in patients with
      potentially distinct prognostic factors; and 4) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
      interventions.
