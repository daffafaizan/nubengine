      randomization office into two groups:

      CONTROL group: cervical length was measured but the result was blinded to the physician in
      charge and women was managed according to the standard protocol.

      STUDY group: cervical length was measured and the result was reported to the physician in
      charge. If cervical length was of 25 mm or more, discharge in 12-24 h was recommended. If
      cervical length was less than 25 mm, decision on discharge was made following clinical
