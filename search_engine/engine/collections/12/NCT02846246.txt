      will include 270 home care recipients >65 years, 270 family members and 65 staff in
      intervention group and control group respectively. Participants will be recruited from a
      municipality in northern Sweden. The intervention involves letting the person and family
      together with contact nurse prioritise care content and make rearrangements to make sure the
      home care service maximises the potential to satisfy psychosocial, physical, and functional
      needs and increasing health. Outcome assessment will focus on; a) quality of life (primary
      outcomes), thriving and satisfaction with care for older people, b) caregiver strain,
      informal caregiving engagement and satisfaction with care for relatives, c) job satisfaction
      and stress for care staff. Evaluation will be performed by questionnaires and interviews.

      Person-centred home care services have the potential to improve the recurrently reported
      sub-standard experiences of home care services and the study result will hopefully lead the
      way in establish a person-centred and health-promoting model in aged care and living
      conditions for older people.
