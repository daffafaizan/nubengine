      vitamin D metabolites are influenced by calcium intake, so participants will be asked to
      complete a seven day diet diary before the first vitamin D measurement. Measured vitamin D is
      influenced by vitamin D binding protein, lipids and inflammatory cytokines, so the
      investigators will include and correct for these measurements.

      Part 2: Measurement of vitamin D clearance rate (adults only) Kinetic studies will be
      perturbed by acute changes in vitamin D (most likely to be caused by sunlight exposure on a
      sunny day), and so the studies will all be conducted in the autumn, winter, and early spring
      when sunlight in Sheffield will not be strong enough to deliver large doses of vitamin D.

      The administration and sampling protocol for the kinetics study has been developed by
      statisticians at the Sheffield School of Health and Related Research (ScHaRR) in
      collaboration with the Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Unit, based on modelling from
      their previous use of the stable isotope tracer method.

      The effect of obesity on vitamin D metabolites will be determined by regression models of BMI
      and vitamin D measurements corrected for age and gender.

      The effects of obesity on vitamin D kinetics will be determined by modelling metabolic
      clearance rate on age, gender and BMI.

      Subjects' previous data from the 'Effects of obesity on bone structure and strength'study
      (STH 15688) and the 'Body weight and bone' study (STH16199) will be used to evaluate
      relationships between vitamin D metabolism and body fat distribution, bone density and
      structure, and bone biochemistry.
