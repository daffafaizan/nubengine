    
      The study is designed as randomized, single blind, prospective, clinical trial over 12
      months. The subjects for this study will be recruited from the University of California at
      San Francisco UCSF, School of Dentistry, Orthodontic Clinic.

      Participants in the study will be patients, who are in orthodontic treatment or will start
      orthodontic treatment; subjects must have full fixed appliances, with brackets bonded to the
      buccal surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, canines and first bicuspids.
      Subjects will be of moderate or high caries risk according to Caries Risk Assessment and ATP
      (Adenosine triphosphate) bacteria testing. Subjects will present with at least two active
      white spot lesions on his/her anterior teeth at the start of the study. The age limitation is
      â‰¥ 11 years.

      The subjects will be randomly assigned to 1) Experimental group: MI Varnish and MI Paste Plus
      or 2) Control standard of care group: 1,100 ppm Fluoride tooth paste and recommendation to
      use OTC (Over-the-counter) Fluoride-rinse in the evening at home.

      The clinical study investigator will evaluate the labial/buccal surfaces of upper and lower
      anterior teeth (first bicuspid to first bicuspid) for white spot lesions (WSL) at baseline
      and at the end of 3, 6, and 12 months. Newly formed lesions and changes in existing white
      spot lesions will be documented (using Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI), ICDAS II, light
      digital photographs and blue fluorescence photography SOPROLIFE and QLF- Quantitative Light
      Fluorescence).

      All subjects will receive one professional tooth cleaning at baseline and at each other
      evaluation office visit to allow WSL evaluation (cleaning with ultrasonic device, and
      prophylaxis brush) and treatment application.
