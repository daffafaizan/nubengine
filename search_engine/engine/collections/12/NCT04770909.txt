      videoconference. They will be randomized to receive adjunctive financial incentives for
      dietary self-monitoring, weight loss, both, or neither. The study will be conducted in three
      phases: Phase I (months 1-6) involves weight loss with incentives; Phase II (months 7-12)
      involves weight loss maintenance with incentives; and Phase III (months 13-18) involves
      weight loss maintenance without incentives.
