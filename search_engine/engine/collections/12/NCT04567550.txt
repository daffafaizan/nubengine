      and tolerability of RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with DR without CI-DME. Approximately 40
      participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into one of 2 dose
      cohorts. Efficacy will be the primary focus of the study. Participants will be evaluated for
      safety and tolerability of RGX-314 throughout the study.
