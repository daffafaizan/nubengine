      effects. Few existing data sources systematically captured opioid-related side effects and
      their impact on patient outcomes and physician practice. This study is expected to lead to an
      in-depth understanding of patient and prescriber perceptions of both effectiveness and side
      effects associated with medications containing the most widely prescribed oral Schedule II
      immediate release opioid for pain management, oxycodone immediate release (OXYRX), alone (eg,
      Roxicodone®) or in combination (eg, Percocet®, Tylox®) in actual clinical practice. This is a
      prospective, multi-center, observational patient registry. Adult outpatients who have pain
      due to a non-cancerous condition meeting study eligibility will be enrolled. Prescribers will
      treat patients according to their usual practice. Prescribers will treat patients, meeting
      study eligibility, with OXYRX according to their usual practice.
