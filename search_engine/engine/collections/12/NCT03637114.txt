    
      Low altitude baseline measurements will be performed in Zurich (460m asl) including
      Echocardiography, Right heart catheterization, six-minute walk test (6MWT), pulmonary
      function test, clinical assessment and blood gas analysis.

      Randomly assigned to the order of testing, the participants will be tested under simulated
      altitude (FiO2: 15.1% with the "AMC altitrainer") and shamed altitude with the same device.

      At rest and under exercise data from ABGA and near infrared spectroscopy will be compared
      under simulated altitude and shamed altitude.
