      of São Paulo Medical School. Male adults with a sleep study within 1 month showing severe OSA
      (>30 events of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep) and naive to treatment will be
      considered for the study. Age and body mass index matched controls will be recruited from the
      hospital staff and their relatives. All volunteers will be previously screening for the risk
      of OSA with Berlin Questionnaire. To minimize confounding risk factors, we will exclude
      subjects older than 60 years and those with a body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2, diabetes
      mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, valvular heart disease, renal failure,
      current or past smoking history, and chronic use of any medication. Hypertension will be
      excluded after 3 or more normal blood pressure values (<140/90mm Hg) obtained on separate
      occasions with a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer.

      Sleep Study. All participants will perform a standard overnight polysomnography. Apnea will
      be defined as complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, associated with oxygen
      desaturation of 3%. Hypopnea will be defined as a significant reduction (>50%) in respiratory
      signals for at least 10 seconds associated with oxygen desaturation of 3%. The apnea-hypopnea
      index will be calculated as the total number of respiratory events (apneas plus hypopneas)
      per hour of sleep. Normal values will be considered when the apnea-hypopnea index will be
      <5events/hour.

      The participants will be randomly assigned to no treatment (control) or treatment with CPAP
      for 3 months, according to a computer-generated list of random numbers. At baseline and after
      3 months, the participants will be submitted to cardiac MRI.

      Magnetic resonance imaging methods. Participants will perform MRI examination on 1.5 - T GE
      CV/i system. Short and long-axis of the heart will be obtained during breath-hold and
      triggered on electrocardiogram pulse sequences. The first sequence will be a gradient-echo
      (steady-sate free procession) to assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV)
      morphology and function. The second sequence will be an inversion-recovery prepared
      gradient-echo to obtain MDE (10 to 20 minutes after intravenous bolus of 0.2 mmol/Kg of
      gadolinium-based contrast). We will use the following parameters: repetition time 3.9/7.1ms,
      echo time 1.7/3.1 ms, flip angle 45º/20º, cardiac phases 20/1, views per segment 8/16 to 32,
      matrix 256 x 128/256 x 192, slice thickness 8/8mm, gap between slices 2/2mm and field of view
      32 to 38/32 to 38 cm, inversion time none/150 to 250 ms, receiver bandwidth 125/31,25 kHz,
      number of excitations 1/2.

      Blood Samples. Venous blood will be collected from all participants between 8 and 10 AM for
      the measurement of glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density
      lipoprotein, and red blood cell count.

      24-hour blood pressure monitoring. All participants will be submitted to a 24-hour blood
      pressure monitoring with a SpaceLabs device (model 90207).
