      dose of high dose cyclophosphamide with amifostine pretreatment, and peripheral blood stem
      cell rescue in patients with ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Monitor engraftment kinetics such
      as granulocyte and platelet recovery. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in
      this patient population. IV. Document the response of this patient population to this regimen
      in terms of time to progression, event free survival, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo apheresis over 2-4 days to
      mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). They then receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes.
      Fifteen minutes later, carboplatin is administered over 30 minutes on days -6 through -3.
      Cyclophosphamide IV is administered 1 hour after the carboplatin infusion is completed on
      days -6 through -4. PBSC are infused on day 0. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered beginning
      on day 4. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level. At least 15 days must pass
      between the day of PBSC infusion and the next dose escalation. The dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) is defined as the dose producing grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity in 2 of 6
      patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as one dose level below the DLT dose.
      At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every
      2-3 months for 1 year, and annually until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 28 patients over 2 years.
