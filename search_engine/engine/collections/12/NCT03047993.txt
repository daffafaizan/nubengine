    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of glutaminase inhibitor
      CB-839 (CB-839) in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for patients with advanced
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CB-839 in combination with AZA. II. To explore the
      pharmacodynamics (PDn) of CB-839 in combination with AZA. III. To assess overall survival,
      event-free survival and duration of response of CB-839 in combination with AZA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and
      azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
