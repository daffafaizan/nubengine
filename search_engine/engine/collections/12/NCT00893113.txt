    
      This protocol is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. Patients will be
      screened and then randomized to Group A or Group B at a 1:1 ratio to receive a placebo tablet
      once daily or Alfuzosin (10 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Patients will then crossover with the
      original placebo group receiving Alfuzosin for 12 weeks and the original Alfuzosin group
      receiving placebo. At every visit the patients will complete an IIEF and an AUA symptom
      index.
