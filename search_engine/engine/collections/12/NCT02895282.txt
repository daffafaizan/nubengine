      y. As consequence, increasingly children and adolescents suffer from elevated blood pressure,
      impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia. Obesity has a multifactorial
      etiology since there are potentially numerous contributors to its development and
      progression. Chronobiology, the science that studies periodic (cyclic) changes in living
      organisms, has been recently proposed as a new and promising topic to investigate.
      Alterations of circadian (24 h oscillations) system may contribute to obesity and its
      complications development such as high blood pressure, insulin resistance, altered fasting
      lipid profile. Conversely, in a vicious manner, obesity has been regarded as a fault in the
      circadian system explainable by the association with imbalances and fluctuations of
      hormones/genes expressions rhythms under the influence of body weight changes.

      Thus, the study will examine changes in circadian rhythmicity over a week period. The primary
      end point will be to evaluate differences between obese/overweight and non-obese children in
      chronotypes and the responses of these parameters to meal patterns. In particular,
      non-invasive measures that are well-established determinants of chronotypes will form the
      core endpoints for the study. Well designed and age-appropriate questionnaires will provide
      further information in order to study correlations with eating, sleeping and sedentary/active
      behaviors.
