      control group. The investigators will use of a model of experimentally induced low back pain
      to investigate the effects of manipulative and body-based interventions in acute onset low
      back pain without some of the clinical confounds. The investigators will collect fMRI and
      psychophysical data about pain sensitivity before and after the induction of pain, and before
      and after interventions for that pain.
