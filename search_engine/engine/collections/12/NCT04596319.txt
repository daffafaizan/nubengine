    
      The study consists of two parts. Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis and chronic pulmonary
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection will be enrolled in either Part 1 (single-ascending
      dose cohorts) or Part 2 (multiple-ascending dose cohorts).

      Part 1 will evaluate single doses of AP-PA02 at three ascending dose levels, administered by
      inhalation. Treatment assignment will be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled in each
      of three ascending dose cohorts. Part 2 will also be double-blinded, randomized, placebo
      controlled, and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of AP-PA02 in each of
      three ascending dose level cohorts.

      Subjects in both Parts 1 and 2 will be followed for approximately 4 weeks and evaluated for
      safety, tolerability, phage titer profile and immunogenicity.
