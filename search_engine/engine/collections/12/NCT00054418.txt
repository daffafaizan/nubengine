    
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      stratified according to planned tamoxifen therapy (yes vs no vs undecided), planned taxane
      therapy (yes vs no vs undecided), time from last menses (1-3 months vs longer than 3 months
      to 6 months), and age (under 40 vs 40 to 49 vs 50 and over). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms. In both arms, treatment begins during the first month of chemotherapy and
      continues for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. For more information regarding
      the treatment arms, please see the "Arms" section below. Questionnaires about cessation of
      menses, ovarian failure, and menopausal symptoms are completed at baseline, monthly during
      chemotherapy, at 6 months, and then at 1 and 2 years.

      Patients are followed for 1 year. A summary of study goals is listed below.

      Goals:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of risedronate at a weekly oral dose of 35 mg versus
           placebo in the prevention of bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant or
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer.

        2. To evaluate the degree of bone loss over one year in premenopausal women undergoing
           adjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer according to menopausal status at one
           year after therapy begins.

        3. To evaluate the relationship of current climacteric symptoms, menstrual and reproductive
           history, and chemotherapy regimen with ovarian failure (permanent cessation of menses)
           in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary
           breast cancer.

        4. To evaluate the relationship of baseline serum estradiol levels with ovarian failure in
           premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast
           cancer.
