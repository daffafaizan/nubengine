      and/or plasma in adult subjects with Gaucher disease. Fifteen milliliter blood sample will be
      collected during three independent visits over a period of approximately 3 months. These
      samples will be processed to separate plasma from red blood cells and frozen until assays are
      performed. Standardized immunoassay methods and LC/MS based methods will be adopted to assay
      a series of biomarkers in these samples. These data will be correlated with currently used
      diagnostic biomarkers.
