      physicians' use of negative or positive assays compared to patients managed using SOC methods
      without assay findings. The repeat biopsy rate at 12 months from study entry will be used for
      the primary endpoint analysis. All patients will be followed for 24 months from the date of
      the previous negative biopsy to evaluate an extended period of observation to track repeat
      biopsies and cancer detection.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a lower repeat biopsy rate by using the
      negative results of ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer in practice rather than current SOC. All
      patients will have the tissue from their previous negative biopsy tested with the assay. Only
      data from Cases (informed of ConfirmMDx assay results) and Controls (blinded of the
      ConfirmMDx assay result) patients with negative test results will be used for the primary
      objective.
