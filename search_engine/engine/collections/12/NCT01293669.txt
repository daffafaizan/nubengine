    
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic parameters of TC-6987
      in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study is organized into three phases:
      (a) Screening phase consisting of a 1-week Screening (Week -5)and a 4-week Washout (Week -4
      to Day 1); (b) 4-week, Double-Blind Treatment (Day 1 to Week 4) during which subjects are
      randomized to either TC-6987 (20 mg on Day 1 and 10 mg from Day 2 to Week 4) or placebo; and
      (c) 2-week Follow-Up (Week 6). Unscheduled visits will be allowed between visits from Washout
      through Follow-up to evaluate a subject's glycemic status or other safety issues, as
      required. Subjects will fast overnight for a minimum of 10 hrs and refrain from drinking
      alcohol 24 hrs prior to each visit.
