    
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study which comprises two parts,
      (dose escalation part and dose expansion part), and each volunteer will only be invited to
      join either one part. The duration of each part is around one (1) year, including screening,
      dosing and follow up visits.
