      mucogingival surgery The principal outcome is compare the millimeters of new attachment
      create after a connective tissue graft and after the use of a porcine collagen matrix in
      teeth that have to been extracted (because of the orthodontic planing treatment) after
      mucogingival surgery .

      The secondary outcomes are:

        1. length of new cementum (histometry results)

        2. length of the junctional epithelium (histometry results)

        3. length of connective tissue attachment (histometry results)

        4. complete root coverage (clinical results)

        5. width of keratinized tissue
