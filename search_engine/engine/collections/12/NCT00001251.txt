    
      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy of intrathecal mafosfamide, a preactivated
      derivative of cyclophosphamide against meningeal malignancies refractory to conventional
      therapy (radiation therapy and chemotherapy). The maximally tolerated dose for intrathecal
      mafosfamide will be established in a limited dosage escalation schedule. The CSF
      pharmacokinetics of intrathecal mafosfamide will also be studied.

      Mafosfamide will be administered intrathecally on a bi-weekly basis for four weeks, followed
      by twice monthly administration for four months and then monthly IT administration. A minimum
      of 9 patients will be studied in each disease category (leukemias, lymphomas, and other
      malignancies refractory to conventional therapy).
