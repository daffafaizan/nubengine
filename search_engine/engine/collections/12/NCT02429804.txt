      I. Estimate the performance of simultaneous NaF/FDG PET/MRI for the prediction of treatment
      response in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      II. Estimate the performance of simultaneous NaF/FDG PET/MRI for detection of extra-skeletal
      disease progression during treatment in mCRPC patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F NaF and 18F FDG intravenously (IV) over 30 seconds-1 minute and then
      undergo PET/MRI and contrast-enhanced MRI after 45-60 minutes. Patients undergo imaging at
      baseline, after course 3 (12 weeks), and after course 6 (24 weeks) of treatment with Ra-223.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.
