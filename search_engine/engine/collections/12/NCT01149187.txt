      Surgical biopsy, thirty percents of the patients were diagnosed as benign nodules and about
      six percents were diagnosed as tuberculosis in Seoul National University Hospital during
      2007-2008.

      The investigators want to know whether conducting an interferon-gamma release assay in
      addition to percutaneous needle biopsy is helpful in diagnosis of lung nodules.
