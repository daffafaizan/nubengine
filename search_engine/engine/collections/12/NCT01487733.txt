    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the association between biomarkers (HPV tumor status and ERCC1
           expression) and clinical outcomes in a population of patients with recurrent or
           metastatic head and neck cancer.

        -  To develop the ability to select patients likely to respond to therapy and to avoid
           treatment with ineffective therapies, especially since these therapies have substantial
           toxicity.

        -  To estimate response and survival rates of HPV-negative and -positive patients in each
           study. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Tumor HPV status is determined by in situ hybridization (ISH) and all samples also
      undergo immunostaining for p16. ERCC1 expression is evaluated with AQUA, a quantitative IHC
      analysis.

      Samples are classified into two categories based on their biomarker status: HPV tumor status
      (negative versus positive), and ERCC1 expression level (low versus high).
