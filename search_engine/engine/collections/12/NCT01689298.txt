    
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. In 80%
      cases of PPH, the primary cause is failure of the uterus to contract after delivery of the
      baby, which then requires further treatment of the mother with uterotonic drugs (drugs used
      to contract uterus and thus prevent bleeding).

      Patients participating in this study will be asked to donate a very small sample of uterine
      tissue during Cesarean section, which will be tested in the laboratory for the ability to
      contract in response to the uterotonics oxytocin and carbetocin. We will seek to better
      understand the effects of these drugs by comparing their contractile capability in isolated
      uterine tissue.
