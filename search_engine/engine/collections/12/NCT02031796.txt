    
      1. Compare utility of CAVAREC to standard DynaCT and cardiac CT for clinical assessment of
           the aortic valve and relevant, nearby anatomical structures.

        2. Investigate the utility of CAVAREC to assess calcification within and surrounding the
           native aortic valve.

        3. Investigate the utility of CAVAREC to assess procedural success, including prosthetic
           valve placement and annular anatomic correlates of paravalvular leak.

        4. Validate utility of CAVAREC for images acquired during normal sinus rhythm.
