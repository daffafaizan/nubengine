      role as an improved biomarker to be used for the diagnosis, assessment and management of
      patients with heart failure. We will test blood cell samples for the levels of this molecule,
      called "G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2" (GRK2) using both the existing method of GRK2
      quantification in the Koch laboratory and using a prototype enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method
      being developed by Johnson & Johnson, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (OCD).
