      standard of care treatment, can improve pain and function in adults with plantar fasciosis.
      Investigators hypothesize that there will be a significant improvement in both pain and
      functional outcomes, both acutely and over time, in the experimental group compared to the
      control group. Investigators will measure foot pain immediately prior to treatment
      (baseline), immediately after the initial treatment and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months.
      The Foot Function Index Revised short form will be used during the same intervals to evaluate
      foot function. At 3 months, patients in the non-acupuncture group will cross-over into the
      acupuncture group if still experiencing pain.
