    
      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem. with 10-30%
      prevalence worldwide , and is a common cause of chronic liver disease and the third most
      common cause of liver transplantation .

      NAFLD can range from simple steatosis in the absence of inflammation to nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) .

      Major risk factors for NAFLD include obesity, hypertension , hyperlipidemia ,
      hypertriglyceridemia , and type-2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM) .

      The gold standard in the diagnosis of NAFLD is liver biopsy; however, it is sometimes
      associated with some complications that include bleeding, bile leak, infection, and other
      potential life-threatening issues. The accuracy of the MRI, computed tomography, and
      ultrasound imaging in diagnosis of NAFLD is low; hence, Fibroscan was introduced .

      This is a non-invasive, simple-to-perform imaging modality with high accuracy to assess liver
      stiffness and hepatic fat deposition. Non-invasive diagnosis is based on clinical and
      biochemical markers, scoring models, and algorithms of methods which have sufficient
      sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility .
