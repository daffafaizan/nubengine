      study has been designed to observe the patient profile and outcomes for hospitalized positive
      Covid-19 patients that may help to understand the effectiveness of different treatment
      strategies. This is a retrospective and prospective, observational study based on collection
      of data related to COVID-19 admitted patients treated in the hospitals of Max Healthcare as
      per the standard treatment protocol and policy for COVID 19 at Max Healthcare.

      Covid19 patients shall be approached at the time of admission for participation in this
      study. If the patient consents, the participating investigator or designated study personnel
      will collect the baseline demographic details of the patient, along with medical history;
      current disease status; current and previous treatment details; and the results of all the
      laboratory tests performed, as per the standard clinical practices. Daily follow up will be
      done on a structured case record form (CRF) till the discharge or death.
