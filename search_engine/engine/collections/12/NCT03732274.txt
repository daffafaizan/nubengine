      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of vactosertib in combination with durvalumab in
      patients advanced NSCLC. This study has been designed to allow for an investigation of the
      optimal dose of vactosertib in combination with durvalumab. There are two parts to this
      study: Phase 1b, vactosertib dose-escalation study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) and Phase 2a, non-randomized parallel dose expansion study to confirm RP2D.

      In the current dose-escalation (Phase 1b) study to determine RP2D, vactosertib dosing will
      begin at 100 mg BID for 5 days per week in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg, Q4W.
      According to the following dose escalation rule, 200 mg BID oral dose as maximum administered
      dose (MAD) will be administered in combination with durvalumab.

      This phase 2a study is a study designed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of vactosertib in
      combination with durvalumab in a total of 45 patients with PD-L1 positive advanced NSCLC who
      progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy (no prior immunotherapy)
