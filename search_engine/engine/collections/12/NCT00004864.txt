      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Determine any preliminary antitumor
      activity of GEM 231 in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GEM 231 and docetaxel. Patients receive docetaxel
      IV over 1 hour on day 1, immediately followed by GEM 231 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and
      11. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating doses of GEM 231 and docetaxel
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly
      for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 1 patient will be accrued per week for this study until the
      maximum tolerated dose is reached.
