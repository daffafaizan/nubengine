    
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is recognized as a major and common problem worldwide. In the United
      States, AD and related eczematous symptoms affect 17% of the population; 1 in 10 individuals
      report having experienced symptoms causing quality of life (QOL) distress, including
      itching/scratching, red/inflamed rash, excessive dryness/scaling, and/or symptoms lasting â‰¥
      14 days. Two-thirds of these subjects noted at least moderate to severe symptoms, with itch
      being the most disturbing. Effective treatment of AD and of pruritus (itching) are
      interconnected. Treating AD will decrease the stimulus for the itch, whereas treating
      pruritus will decrease the feedback cycle brought on when a patient scratches the skin
      continually. Effective medications for AD and related symptoms include topical
      corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Oftentimes, these remedies are insufficient at
      treating the itch component of the disease. There is demand for alternative, complementary
      treatments for AD-related pruritus.
