      but ≤ 40 weeks after elective percutaneous coronary intervention. The total study duration is
      expected to be approximately 14 weeks per patient, including a screening period, a 12±1 week
      treatment period, Randomization was computer generated. After screening, eligible subjects
      will be randomly assigned into one of the following two groups: Berberine+therapy Arm or
      Standard therapy Arm. The primary objective is to determine whether a combination of
      berberine and coronary artery disease standard therapy is preferable to either berberine
      alone or standard therapy alone.

      The visit schedule will be as follows:

      Visit 1: Day -7 to Day -1, Screening/Enrolment; Visit 2: Day 1, Randomization/First dose;
      Visit 3: Week 4±1, Dose adjustment 1, BBR (100mg, tid); Visit 4: Week 8±1, Dose adjustment 2,
      BBR (200mg, tid); Visit 5: Week 12±1, End of Treatment (EOT) /Last dose, BBR (300mg, tid);
      Safety visit.

      We perform cross-sectional comparisons between the two arms and longitudinal comparisons
      within each arm to evaluate the indicators as follows:

        1. . Endothelial function, as measured by Flow mediated dilation (FMD) from baseline to
           12-week follow-up;

        2. . Gut microbiota, as sequenced by metagenomic sequencing from baseline to 12-week
           follow-up.

      Blood and feces samples will be collected before and after treatment. Flow mediated dilation
      (FMD), HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipids and cholesterol level, inflammatory
      factors, amino acids, bile acids and other metabolic related components and parameters will
      be measured. Furthermore, the change of gut microbiota will be evaluated too.
