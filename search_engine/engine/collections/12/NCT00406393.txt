      Stem cell transplantation is a standard therapy for acute and chronic leukemias and
      myelodysplastic disorders. A common problem that may occur after a stem cell transplant is a
      condition known as GVHD. The purpose of this study is to compare two combinations of
      medications to see which is better at preventing GVHD. The combinations of medications in
      this study are:

        -  Sirolimus and tacrolimus

        -  Methotrexate and tacrolimus

      Doctors want to know if one combination is better than the other or if they both have the
      same result.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Participants will receive one of the two conditioning regimens described in the protocol, at
      the discretion of the transplant physician. The transplant physician must choose among these
      regimens prior to the participant's assignment to the GVHD prophylaxis treatment.
      Conditioning regimens will vary by center, but will be the same for all participants at each
      center. Stem cell donors will donate peripheral blood stem cells according to local
      institutional practices. Peripheral blood stem cells will not be manipulated or T-depleted
      prior to administration. Standard post-transplant care will be administered. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two GVHD prophylaxis regimens and will be followed for
      the endpoints of interest.

      Participants will be followed for 114 days post-randomization for evaluation of the primary
      endpoint, with additional follow-up for 2 years after transplantation for evaluation of
      secondary endpoints.
