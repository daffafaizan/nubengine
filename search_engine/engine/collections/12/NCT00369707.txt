    
      This is a multicenter, prospective study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, 15, and
           22. Patients also receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on day 1
           of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 3 courses. Patients
           achieving a complete response, partial response, or stable disease proceed to
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after induction therapy, patients receive
           bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 60
           days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study treatment.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
