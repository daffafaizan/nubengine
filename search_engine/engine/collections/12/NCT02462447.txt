      prostate tissues and further increased in metastases from prostate cancer. This research
      project is designed to test whether 11C-sarcosine (a chemical that is linked to short lived
      radioactivity) would be useful to detect prostate cancer in men using PET/CT imaging. The
      uptake and distribution of 11C-sarcosine in men with known or suspected prostate cancer will
      be determined and compared with results from 11C-choline PET/CT.
