      admitted to the Asian University Hospital. Within 24 hours they admitted to the hospital, we
      collected the Mini Nutritional Assessment scores, surface electromyography data, handgrip
      strength, self-assessment swallowing ability score, and clinical objective data. We performed
      the statistics for independent t-test, Pearson correlation analysis, and binary logistic
      regression with SPSS 23 software.
