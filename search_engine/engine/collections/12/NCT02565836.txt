    
      Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), is the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant.
      Warfarin-associated major hemorrhage occurs at a rate of 1.7% to 3.4% in routine clinical
      practice and warrants rapid reversal of anticoagulation by correcting supratherapeutic
      international normalized ratio (INR) values.

      Warfarin inhibits synthesis of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X,
      and strategies for reversal of warfarin-associated coagulopathy are aimed at restoring
      deficient factors. Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) contain the
      coagulation factors which warfarin inhibits and are an attractive option for rapid reversal
      due to ease of reconstitution and no requirement for blood-type matching.

      Manufacturer dosing recommendations exist for PCCs based on patient weight, baseline INR, and
      target INR, but studies have suggested fixed dosing strategies in an effort to determine the
      most efficacious dose for VKA-reversal while sparing adverse events. These studies have also
      utilized different PCC formulations, with some studies utilizing 4-factor activated PCC
      (aPCC), which denotes product containment of factor VII in an activated state.

      In the United States, product availability is limited to a single 4-factor aPCC (FEIBA VH,
      Baxter) indicated for hemophilia patients with inhibitors and a single 4-factor inactivated
      PCC (Kcentra, CSL Behring) approved for VKA-reversal. Various institutions choose to utilize
      off-label fixed dosing strategies of 4-factor aPCC in an effort to administer the lowest
      possible dose to reverse VKAs, while others utilize manufacturer recommended dosing of
      4-factor inactivated PCC.
