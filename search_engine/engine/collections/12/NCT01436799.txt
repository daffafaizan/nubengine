      propofol is likely to reduce rSO2 more than sevoflurane when patients are raised to the
      sitting position. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
      desflurane and propofol on rSO2 values during the beach chair position for shoulder
      arthroscopy.
