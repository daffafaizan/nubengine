      NCT03200314) (i.e. an expected frequency of successful blood flow reduction of 66.7%), using
      a one-sample Chi square test, a two-sided type-1 error of 5%, a power of 80%, a total of 68
      patients is needed to show that the proportion of patients with a secure ECMO blood flow
      reduction is greater than 50%. Presumably, 136 Patients have to be included into the trial to
      study 68 patients with a relevant Rf since not all patients on V-V ECMO suffer from a high
      Rf.
