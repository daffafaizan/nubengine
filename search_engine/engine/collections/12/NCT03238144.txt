      mechanical waves to quantitatively assess the viscoelastic properties of tumours and the
      shift in interstitial fluid pressure (or stiffness) of tissues.

      It generates 3D images of applied deformation via low frequency acoustic waves within the
      tissue and provides a snapshot of the apparent stiffening of the tumour border zone. Growth
      induced stretch of the tumour not only increases stiffness but also alters the apparent
      change in stiffness due to additional loading. Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF) provides
      measures of MRE and macro-deformation at multiple load states therefore enabling estimation
      of tissue properties as well as the stress load relation. Since the stress load relation is
      related to tumour swelling and modifications, it can be directly linked to the tumour
      pre-strain and provides an indicator of the underlying interstitial tumour pressure. Using
      biomechanical models it is possible to directly translate the stress load relation into an
      estimate of IFP. The same approach also allows quantifying the active pull by cell traction
      forces (CTFs) coming from the tumour and exerted onto its surroundings. While that force is
      directed inwards, the force generated by the elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is
      directed outwards allowing separation of both effects from each other. These forces represent
      one of the biomarkers which we will quantify within the this project using MRF.
