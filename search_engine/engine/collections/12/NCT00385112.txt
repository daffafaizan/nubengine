      (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was used for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow
      tract in children that underwent surgery at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. These children
      were born with heart problems that made it difficult for blood to flow from the lower right
      chamber of the heart to the lungs where it would normally pick up oxygen to be used by the
      body. Consequently, these children required surgery to repair the valve and eliminate this
      restriction of blood flow to the lungs in order to preserve life. In this case, the Freestyle
      valve was used. It is a relatively new valve and it is not known how it functions and how it
      impacts overall heart function over a long period of time. We are requesting permission to
      recruit volunteers that have received the Freestyle valve for this purpose in order to
      determine its long term performance. Specifically, we are seeking volunteers that are willing
      to have an echocardiogram performed. It is through the evaluation of a recent echocardiogram,
      as it compares to previous echocardiograms performed on the same patient, that the usefulness
      of the Freestyle valve will be evaluated for its durability and its long term impact on heart
      function.
