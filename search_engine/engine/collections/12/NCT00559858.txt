      Primary

        -  Determine whether pyridoxine can reduce the incidence of capecitabine dose modifications
           (dose delay and dose reductions) due to toxicity.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of hand-foot syndrome (HFS).

        -  Determine the overall toxicity.

        -  Determine the quality of life.

        -  Determine the response to chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival.

        -  Determine the level of biomarkers which might predict the occurrence of HFS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (breast
      cancer vs colorectal cancer). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral pyridoxine hydrochloride 3 times daily beginning with the
           initiation of capecitabine chemotherapy and continuing until completion of chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times daily beginning with the initiation of
           capecitabine chemotherapy and continuing until completion of chemotherapy.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Evidence of hand-foot syndrome is assessed at baseline and before each course of
      capecitabine. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks.
