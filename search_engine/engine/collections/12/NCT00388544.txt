      some time in the course of their illness. These behaviors are a source of caregiver burden
      and often precipitate nursing home placement. There are a number of drugs that can be used to
      treat these behaviors, but they are costly and have serious adverse effects in a sizable
      number of people. Non-drug interventions, such as recreational activities, are recommended as
      the first line of treatment for behavioral symptoms. However, we don't know which activities
      are most effective for individual residents. The "one size fits all" approach has not been
      very effective. We are testing an approach that individualizes activities for residents based
      on their personality style of interest and functional level. We anticipate that this approach
      will be more effective for reducing behavioral symptoms than routine activities given to all
      residents. Consenting residents are assessed for personality and functional level and are
      videotaped during a baseline period and during activities so we can reliably measure
      behaviors, affect and engagement.
