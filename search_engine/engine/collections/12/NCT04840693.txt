    
      For each participant, easily accessible biological samples will be taken (blood, urine,
      saliva). From these samples, a large number of molecular markers will be generated (genomics,
      metabolomics), in search of signatures specifically associated with each complication.

      Three main types of complications will be analyzed: diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis.

      The analysis is planned in 4 stages:

        -  Identify markers for each type of complication in the context of excess frank
           glucocorticoids, by comparing affected patients and those not affected for each type of
           complication.

        -  Subtraction of non-specific markers of diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis,
           identified by the analysis of diabetic, hypertensive and osteoporotic patients who do
           not have excess glucocorticoids

        -  Test the performance of these markers in an independent cohort of patients presenting an
           excess of glucocorticoids at variable levels: frank and at least (endogenous, exogenous)

        -  Test the performance of these markers in a cohort of patients with substituted adrenal
           insufficiency
