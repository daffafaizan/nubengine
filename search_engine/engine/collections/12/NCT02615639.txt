    
      Patients who have been on anti-HBV therapy Complying with the inclusion criteria will be
      enrolled into our research, Nucleoside analogues (NAs,entecavir） treatment for more than 1
      year or interferon（IFN)-a-2a (IFN-a-2a,Pegasys） treatment for more than 24 weeks. The
      patients will be randomly assigned to experimental group and control group with the ratio of
      2:1, one group (control group) will go on receive the anti-HBV drugs treatment solely;
      another group (experimental group) after enrollment will immediately receive the Hepatitis B
      Vaccine activated-DCs (HPDC-T cells) for 24 weeks (every 2 weeks once for 24 weeks, 12 times
      in total), at the same time co-use anti-HBV drugs treatment, as for Pegasys, it will go on to
      be used for 12 weeks after HPDC-T cells treatment completed.

      The technical route of HBV-T cells prepared: First, investigators collect fresh blood of CHB,
      mononuclear cells were isolated, and induced to HBsAg pulsed DCs in Hepatitis B vaccine
      (Shenzhen kangtai, Shenzhen, China) and interleukin-4（IL-4)/granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF） (Perprotech, New Jersey, USA) (7 days), then co-culture of
      DCs and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell(PBMCs ）7days, obtain HBV specific T cells, return
      to the patient finally.
