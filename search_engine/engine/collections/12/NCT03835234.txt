      and anaesthesia. Due to advanced techniques in the field of anaesthesia and surgery, patients
      are commonly operated on under regional anaesthesia (RA) rather than general anaesthesia
      (GA). Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) still occurs with regional anaesthesia, but
      the incidence and associated factors in our setting remain unknown. An optimal management of
      PONV is important because they can lead to increased morbidity.

      The main aim of the study is to determine the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting
      among surgical patients undergoing regional anaesthesia and the factors associated with it.

      This will be a prospective cohort study. Patients aged 18 years and above in whom surgery
      under regional anaesthesia is planned at Mulago hospital will be consented and enrolled into
      the study over 6months. Data will be collected using semi structured and pre-tested
      questionnaires. Patients will be observed for up to 24 hours post operatively to determine
      the incidence of and factors associated with PONV in regional anaesthesia at Mulago hospital.
      After recruitment, patients will be followed up once at 24 hours post-operatively.

      Results from this study will determine the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in
      surgical patients undergoing regional anaesthesia and the associated factors, data which we
      do not have in our setting. This will help to guide practice on the prevention and management
      of post-operative nausea and vomiting.
