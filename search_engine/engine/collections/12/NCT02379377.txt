    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the relationship between 18F-FSPG PET/computed tomography (CT), pathology, and
      cancer metabolism in patients with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) scheduled for
      liver resection surgery and orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).

      II. To compare 18F-FSPG PET/CT with standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostic MRI imaging in patients
      with suspected HCC scheduled for liver resection surgery or OLT.

      III. To compare the uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT with 11C-acetate PET/CT AND 18F-FDG PET/CT in
      suspected HCC and background liver in patients scheduled for liver resection surgery or OLT.

      IV. To evaluate uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT in benign liver lesions compared to background.

      V. To evaluate uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT in malignant non-HCC liver tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FSPG PET and either carbon-11 (11C)-acetate PET or 18F-FDG PET scans
      within 4 weeks of surgery or OLT.
