      following standard neuropsychological evaluation (their neuro-oncologist may refer them to
      this study). If meeting inclusion criteria (described in later sections on participants),
      participants will be recruited and enrolled in the study. Two groups will be formed: High
      grade gliomas (WHO grade III or IV; n=15) and Low grade gliomas (WHO grade II; n=15).
      Participants will be followed over 11 months. The two groups will follow identical study
      timelines.
