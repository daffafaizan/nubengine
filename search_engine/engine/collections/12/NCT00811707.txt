      epidural blocks. A low frequency ultrasound (2-5 MHz) with a curved array transducer is used
      to obtain spinal sonography for each subject. The paramedian axis was used to obtain optimal
      ultrasound image for spinal sonography. Outcome was evaluated by the diameter and depth of
      epidural space at three lumbar interspaces. Paired T-test was carried out to evaluate the
      statistical significance of epidual diameter and depth.
