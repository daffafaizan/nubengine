      be avoided both due to the discomfort and the risk to the patients and for the corresponding
      increment of hospital costs.

      There are some studies indicating that transfusion of autologous salvaged blood may reduce
      postoperative infections. This may be due to immunostimulating cytokines released in these
      products. However, as these cytokines also may cause adverse events as febrile transfusion
      reactions and activation of the complement and the coagulation cascades, the overall impact
      may be different.

      There are two publications from an Austrian group indicating that allogeneic blood
      transfusion in orthopedic patients cause increased postoperative infection rate
      irrespectively of the leukocyte content of the red cell concentrates.

      The Austrian studies were not randomized. Therefore, it would be useful to perform a
      randomized, prospective study where the patients receive transfusion of salvaged blood versus
      allogeneic red cell concentrate as their primary replacement product, respectively.

      The purpose of the pilot study is to evaluate if transfusion of autologous salvaged blood
      reduces the infection rate in orthopedic patients compared with patients receiving allogeneic
      blood transfusion. The study is limited to one source of autologous blood; blood collected by
      the Sangvia Blood Collection System, and the study is partially sponsored by the
      manufacturer.
