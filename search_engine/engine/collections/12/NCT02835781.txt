      acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with expander use in first phase of reconstruction will be
      included. The permanent breast implants will be implanted approximately half year during
      second surgery. Acellular dermal matrix is a soft tissue graft that is formed by
      decellularization, however with intact extracellular dermal matrix. Such structure is able to
      re-create adequate skeleton for host cells with subsequent incorporation and
      revascularization. The safety and appropriateness of such ADM in breast reconstruction
      surgery will be analyzed.
