      of kidney transplant and after one year of protocol. Once adequate kidney function is
      established, both groups take by mouth a weekly capsule (the control group has a placebo; the
      treatment group has risedronate 35 mg). Both groups undergo baseline, 6 month and 12 month
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone mineral density scans. Both groups undergo bone
      hormonal studies at regular intervals.
