      guided using 40-60mL of local anesthetic. The study plans to investigate the difference in
      hand grip strength post-operatively in patients who will receive interscalene blocks with
      40mL versus a lower dose (20mL) of local anesthetic. We suspect the lower dose will achieve
      adequate surgical anesthesia while creating less motor block and thus, increase patient
      satisfaction, present fewer complications or adverse affects and decrease time in the
      recovery room.
