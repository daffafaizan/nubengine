    
      Sleeve gastrectomy may affect drug pharmacokinetics in several potential ways. We will
      measure pharmakokinetics of paracetamol (in consenting subjects that are undergoing sleeve
      gastrectomy) and antiepileptic drugs (in consenting subjects that are chronically treated by
      a stable dose) before and 6 months after sleeve gastrectomy in 10 subjects.

      Blood tests will be taken for drug levels before and 4-8 times after the subject takes the
      drug. A pharmacokinetic curve will be calculated and compared for each subject between prior
      to surgery and after surgery.
