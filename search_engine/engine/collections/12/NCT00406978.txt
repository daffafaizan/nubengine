    
      Defibrotide (DF) is a novel orally bioavailable polydisperse oligonucleotide with
      anti-thrombotic and anti-adhesive effects, which has been shown to be active in various
      microangiopathies, including the treatment and prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease. While
      DF has minimal inhibitory effect on multiple myeloma (MM) in cell isolates, it showed single
      agent activity on human MM xenografts in SCID/NOD mice and markedly increased responsiveness
      of MM to cytotoxic agents, including melphalan, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in the
      same models. DF might thus enhance the response rate of Melphalan, Prednisone and
      Thalidomide, while protecting against the prothrombotic state seen with this combination in
      the treatment of MM. In this multicenter, open label, non-randomised phase I/II trial, dosing
      safety and efficacy of melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide, and DF (MPTD) were determined in
      pts with relapsed/refractory MM.

      Primary refractory or pts receiving therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded. Oral melphalan
      was administered at 0,25 mg/Kg on D1-4, oral prednisone at 1,5 mg/kg on D 1-4, thalidomide
      was delivered at 50 mg on D1-35 on cycle 1 and at 100 mg from cycle 2 to cycle 6.

      Level + 1 DF = 17 mg/Kg i.v. or 2.4 g p.o. D1-4, followed by 1.6 g p.o. through D 35 Level +
      2 DF = 34 mg/Kg i.v. or 4.8 g p.o. D 1-4, followed by 3.2 g p.o. through D 35 Level + 3 DF =
      51 mg/Kg i.v. or 7.2 g p.o. D 1-4, followed by 4.8 g p.o. through D 35.

      Each course was repeated every 35d for a total of 6 courses and no DVT prophylaxis was used.
