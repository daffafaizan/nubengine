      However, some RCTs indicate that enlarging the FE causes postoperative pain, flare-up, and
      destroy the apical constriction, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms
      of pain when a FE has been performed. The investigators, therefore, would like to conduct a
      RCT to increase both sample size and the number of published studies to do a systematic
      review for this topic.
