      course of treatment prescribed for pulmonary TB. Subjects will begin screening for study
      participation when they have completed 4 calendar months of TB treatment. Subjects meeting
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized within a study group in a 3:1 ratio (N=18
      AERAS-456; N=6 placebo) to receive two 0.5 mL intramuscular injections of AERAS-456 or
      placebo eight weeks apart, on Study Day 0 and Study Day 56.
