      is poor. First line therapy exists of platinum-based chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. No
      standard subsequent-line therapy has been described.The combination of Poly(ADP-ribose)
      polymerases (PARP) inhibition and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking has great
      potential in the treatment of recurrent endometrial cancer. The DOMEC trial is designed to
      investigate this treatment combination among all molecular subgroups.

      The DOMEC trial is designed as a DGOG, prospective, multi-center, phase II study for 55
      patients with advanced (recurrent, refractory or metastatic) endometrial cancer, including
      carcinosarcoma of the uterus. Patients must have had one prior platinum-based
      chemotherapeutic regimen or not be able/willing to get chemotherapy. The aim is to
      investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy of olaparib tablets 300mg twice daily
      orally and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion every 4 weeks in terms of progression free
      survival. Secondary objectives are to investigate objective response rate, overall survival,
      safety and predictive biomarkers.
