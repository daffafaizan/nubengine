      responsible for economic costs in excess of $1 billion CAD annually. In high-risk
      environments, such as long-term care (LTC) facilities, 60% of residents will experience at
      least one fall each year. Moreover, approximately 30% of falls in LTC residents result in
      injury, and 3 to 5% cause fractures.

      A promising strategy for reducing the incidence of fall-related injuries in LTC facilities is
      to decrease the stiffness of the ground surface, and the subsequent force applied to the body
      parts at impact. Purpose-designed compliant flooring can reduce the force applied to the hip
      during a fall by up to 35 % (to allow a raw egg to be successfully bounced without cracking).
      Yet, few LTC facilities have flooring designed to reduce the impact of falls. This study will
      address this gap.

      Resident rooms at a local LTC facility will be randomly assigned to installation of compliant
      flooring or control (non-compliant) flooring. Following installation, primary and secondary
      outcomes, including fall-related injuries and falls, will be monitored for 4 years and
      compared between resident rooms with and without compliant flooring. In addition, health
      resource utilization and their costs will be compared between resident rooms with and without
      compliant flooring. Perceptions about compliant flooring will be assessed among staff,
      residents, and their families.
