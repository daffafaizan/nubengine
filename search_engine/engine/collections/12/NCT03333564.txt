    
      The data about effect of vitamin D3 (VD3) and omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3FA) on serum levels
      of estradiol (E2) are scarce and conflicting and nothing is published in the literature about
      the effect of the combination of VD3 and omega-3FA on the E2 levels.

      This study was conducted to investigate effect of VD3 and omega-3FA alone and with each other
      on serum E2 levels in premenopausal females with vitamin D deficiency (VDD).

      This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to test effects of 50,000 IU
      VD3 weekly and 300 mg omega-3FA daily for eight weeks, separately and with each other, on the
      mid-follicular serum levels of E2 and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD). This study was conducted
      during winter in 86 healthy premenopausal Jordanian females with VDD with a mean age of (32.8
      Â± 8.9) years. Fasting serum levels for 25OHD, E2, PTH (parathyroid hormon), calcium,
      phosphate, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and urea were assessed at baseline and the end of
      the trial.
