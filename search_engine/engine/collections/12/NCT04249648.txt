        1. What is the incidence of hyperkalaemia following RAASi therapy initiation and
           uptitration in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF including those with a new
           diagnosis of post myocardial infarction (MI) left ventricular systolic dysfunction?

        2. How does it impact on RAASi prescription?

        3. How does hyperkalaemia impact on RAASi therapy according to the clinical indication for
           the drug(s) in an adult population of patients who are hospitalised or attending the
           emergency department (and not receiving dialysis) with hyperkalaemia and receiving
           RAASi?

        4. At what level of hyperkalaemia do healthcare professionals consider making changes to
           RAASi and does it vary according to the clinical indication for the drug(s)?
