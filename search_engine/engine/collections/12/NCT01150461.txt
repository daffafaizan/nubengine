      failure, ischemia even in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias.
      The pathological features of HCM include hypertrophy and disarray, interstitial fibrosis, and
      increased arteriolar wall thickness. Hypertrophy and fibrosis are major determinants of
      morbidity and mortality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Some investigators have demonstrated
      that interstitial fibrosis and hypertrophy occur secondarily, in response to trophic and
      mitotic factors in the heart. Therefore, blocking trophic factors may attenuate or
      potentially reverse hypertrophy and fibrosis in HCM.

      Angiotensin II has trophic and profibrotic effects on the heart, and blockade of angiotensin
      II type I receptors has been shown to attenuate myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in
      acquired cardiac disease in humans and animal models.

      We hypothesize that treatment with the selective angiotensin II type receptor antagonist,
      losartan, will decrease both hypertrophy and fibrosis, improve diastolic function, reduce
      symptoms, and improve functional status in patients with HCM.
