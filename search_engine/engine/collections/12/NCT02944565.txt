      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of decreasing the infusion time of daratumumab in
      patients that have already received 2+ doses of daratumumab and are continuing on
      daratumumab.

      II. Estimate the time savings versus (vs) predicted infusion time.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 1.5 hours. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
