      use and early sexual initiation within a population of urban African American and Latina
      adolescent females who are at high risk for HIV, AIDS, and other STI. Past research by the
      investigative team has documented that nearly 10% of females in our target population have
      initiated sex by fall of 7th grade and more than half have done so by spring of 10thgrade.
      Although alcohol use is more comparable with national figures, the combination of early
      alcohol and early sexual initiation is troubling, yet under-addressed by existing
      interventions. We will develop and test an intervention that builds upon a promising strategy
      for influencing adolescents: parent education. Three parenting mechanisms shown to influence
      adolescent risk behavior are targeted: parental monitoring, household rule setting, and
      communication. Informed by a community advisory board and a series of focus groups, a set of
      three audio-cds for parents of young adolescents will be developed. Through dramatic
      role-model stories, these CDs will help parents address alcohol prevention and the link
      between early alcohol use and sexual initiation and risk taking. Families and middle school
      daughters will then be enrolled into a randomized pilot test of the intervention's efficacy.
      Parent and student surveys will be conducted at baseline and 3-month post-intervention follow
      up to assess whether the intervention is beneficial in terms of promoting positive parenting
      practices, positive attitudes toward healthy behaviors, and reducing girls' risks.
