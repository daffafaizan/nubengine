    
      This study will provide a basis for evaluating the safety of idursulfase administered to
      Hunter syndrome patients who are â‰¤ 5 years old. Additionally, this study will provide a basis
      for evaluating the idursulfase single- and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profiles as well as
      the pharmacodynamic effect (as measured by urinary GAG excretion) in this pediatric
      population. Additional exploratory measures will include abdominal ultrasound measurements of
      liver and spleen volumes, assessments of growth with comparisons to normal population growth
      data, assessments of annualized growth velocity, assessments of routine developmental
      milestones using the Denver II, and assessments of clinical events, including the first
      occurrence of certain hearing-related events (e.g., hearing loss, otitis media),
      respiratory-related events (e.g., upper and lower respiratory infections), and specific
      surgical procedures (e.g., adenoidectomy, placement of PE tubes).

      All patients in this open-label study will receive once-weekly infusions of idursulfase at a
      dose of 0.5 mg/kg.
