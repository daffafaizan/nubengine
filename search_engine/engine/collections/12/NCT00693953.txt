    
      The research method will be: gathering, analyzing and utilizing data.

      We will observe research subjects through neuroelectrical instrumentation, then, compare
      results to retrospective information collected from research subjects and a normative
      database.

      A qualified neurologist thoroughly familiar with electrophysiology will interpret the data,
      and analyze it to explore the abnormalities.

      The hypothesis will be evaluated.

      We will, then, utilize the results to find data-based forms of treatment for those with the
      disorder.
