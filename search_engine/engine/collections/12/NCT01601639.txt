    
      Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is a vascular structural malformation in the stomach
      that can lead to active or chronic intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic
      iron-deficiency anemia.

      The current standard endoscopic treatment is with APC. There have been multiple reports and
      case series in the literature about successful treatment with EBL for GAVE, even in cases
      where APC was unsuccessful for treatment of GAVE. Our goal is to compare the standard APC
      treatment with EBL in patients with Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia.
