      plaque gets accumulated, especially around brackets, bands, wires, and other attachments;
      this facilitates the development of white spot lesions. Probiotics act by competitively
      inhibiting the pathogenic bacteria because they have greater adhesion to the tissues while
      Chlorhexidine is often used as an active ingredient in mouthwash designed to reduce dental
      plaque around orthodontic appliances. AIM & OBJECTIVE - The objectives of the study is to
      evaluate and compare the effects of the topical application of probiotic toothpaste and
      chlorhexidine mouthwash on the Streptococcus Mutans levels in the plaque of orthodontic
      patients hence improving the oral micro-flora of oral cavity by competitive inhibition of
      Streptococcus Mutans in plaque present around brackets.

      MATERIAL & METHOD - The study consists of thirty randomly selected orthodontic patients
      undergoing fixed appliance treatment. The patients were divided into three groups - Control
      Group (Group 1), Probiotic Toothpaste Group (Group 2) & Chlorhexidine Mouthwash Group (Group
      3). Samples were collected at two times interval: before the study began (Phase 1) and after
      thirty days (Phase 2).
