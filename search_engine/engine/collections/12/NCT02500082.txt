      triheptanoin (UX007), for the treatment of neurological symptoms related to citrate
      transporter deficiency, a disease with no existing treatment. The hypothesis is that
      triheptanoin will restore deficient energy metabolism in these patients, leading to improved
      seizure control, mental clarity, and physical strength.

      Based on the literature, the SLC13A5 gene product is a citrate transporter. However, there is
      the possibility that other compounds are transported as well. The gene may be expressed in
      human neurons and function at the level of the plasma membrane. The hypothesis is that the
      transport of citrate across the plasma membrane from the extracellular space into the
      cytoplasm plays a role in maintaining the pool size of citrate in both the cytoplasm and
      mitochondrial matrix. Triheptanoin therapy may increase the metabolism of odd-chain fatty
      acids in neuronal mitochondria and thereby increase the levels of succinyl-CoA, leading to an
      increase in citrate concentrations. The increased level of citrate in the mitochondrial
      matrix may lead to an increased efflux of citrate from the matrix to the cytoplasm, thus
      increasing the cytoplasmic pool of citrate and allowing the malfunctioning citrate
      transporter to be bypassed. If successful, triheptanoin treatment will improve neuronal
      function and lead to an improvement in CNS function for patients.

      While investigators will follow the course of subjects with considerable interest and may use
      some of the collected data for clinical research, this study is done for humanitarian
      reasons.
