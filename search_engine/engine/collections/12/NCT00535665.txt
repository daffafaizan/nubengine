      strain NIBRG-14 which was prepared by NIBSC. The strain is a reassortant between
      A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/PR/8/34 by reverse genetics.

      Total 400 volunteers aged from 18 to 60 years old are to be enrolled with 100 subjects in
      each group. The eligible volunteers will receive two doses vaccine of 5μg，10μg or 15μg
      haemagglutinin antigen. The schedule is day 0,14 or day 0,28. The subjects will donate their
      blood samples for the detection of HI antibody and microneutralization antibody. Local and
      systematic adverse reactions will be recorded during the study.
