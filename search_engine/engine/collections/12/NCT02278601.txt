      (CIPCEA) (variable flexible background infusion) and variable-frequency automated mandatory
      bolus (VAMB) focused on individualization of analgesic requirements. This phase 3
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial will compare the two novel regimens, and each with
      conventional PCEA, in reducing breakthrough pain (failure of the regimen to provide adequate
      pain relief, necessitating unscheduled epidural supplementation) incidence as the primary
      outcome in nulliparous term women requesting labour epidural analgesia. In addition, a
      discrete choice experiment (DCE) in the format of a survey will be administered to estimate
      the women's preferences in treatment attributes related to epidural analgesia, including
      control over epidural dosage, chance of having breakthrough pain, motor block, instrumental
      delivery and out-of-pocket cost for epidural analgesia.
