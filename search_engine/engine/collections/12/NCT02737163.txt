      susceptible CSF shunts, specifically those with Strata (Medtronic, Dublin) valves implanted.
      All evaluations will be performed during routine patient care in the hospital, the emergency
      department and in the outpatient facilities. Valve settings will be checked transcutaneously
      in the standard manner, before and after any MRI studies.

      Evaluating IR and making correlations between exposure to MRI or environmental magnets and
      symptoms and radiographic changes (when available) will require the patient or family to
      complete a brief questionnaire. It will then require the study team and delegated providers
      to check the valve setting before and after MRI, and to gather clinical information from the
      medical record and from the current clinical evaluation.

      Each patient's initial enrollment will require the acquisition of an informed consent, which
      will cover all future evaluations of IR during the three year study period for that patient.
      However, every time a patient enrolled in the study encounters the neurosurgical service, all
      study steps will be performed, including the valve check before and after MRI, the
      participant's completion of the questionnaire, and the research staff's completion of the
      data sheets.
