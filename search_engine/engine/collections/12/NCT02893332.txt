    
      This protocol is a randomized phase III trial of TKI versus consolidative Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus TKI for patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be tested with positive EGFR
      mutation. Patients who with fewer than or equal to 5 sites of oligometastatic disease will be
      randomized toTKI or consolidative SBRT to all sites of disease (followed by TKI at the
      medical oncologist's discretion). Choices of TKI will be determined by the medical oncologist
      based on clinical appropriateness.
