      common in the ICU setting. Static resuscitation endpoints such as heart rate, blood pressure,
      and CVP are frequently used to guide this therapy, despite compelling evidence they are
      unreliable in predicting patient response to therapeutic volume administration or as an
      endpoint for ongoing therapy. Dynamic parameters such as continuous stroke volume and cardiac
      output (index) monitoring, along with pulse pressure and stroke volume variance measures are
      more reliable in predicting and measuring response to fluid challenge and therapeutic volume
      administration. The purpose of this study is to observe changes in stroke volume (SV) and
      cardiac output (CO) during a passive leg raise maneuver (PLR) as a surrogate to volume
      challenge, and to determine if these changes can predict changes in the same parameters with
      fluid or blood product administration in surgical patients. The PLR maneuver involves
      positioning the patient to the supine position and elevating the legs to 45 degrees. The PLR
      moves blood from the capacitance vessels of the legs to the heart, potentially improving
      stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO), without the administration of intravenous fluids.
      PLR may predict whether SV or CO would improve with administration of fluids, and guide
      decisions on whether fluid administration would be beneficial. Stroke volume and cardiac
      output (index) will be calculated by a commercial pulse power arterial pressure cardiac
      output system (LIDCORapid), using the patients' measured heart rate and blood pressure
      imported from the bedside monitor. By using the combination of a reversible volume challenge
      (PLR) and a minimally invasive monitoring system, it is hoped that a more reliable method
      will emerge to both predict a response and guide therapeutic volume administration, while
      reducing the risk associated with fluid volume overload.
