      cancer.

      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in industrialized countries. Most
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with advanced disease, and despite
      recent advances in multi-modality therapy, the overall 10-year survival rate is less than
      10%. A significant minority of patients (25-30%) with NSCLC have stage I disease and receive
      surgical intervention alone. Although 35-50% of patients with stage I disease will relapse
      within 5 years, it is not currently possible to identify specific high-risk patients. In
      addition, for patients with metastatic disease, standard chemotherapeutic approaches result
      in less than 50% response rate, meaning that more than half of patients do not benefit and
      only suffer from side effects.

      Only very limited data exists on markers capable of predicting response to chemotherapy.

      This population would certainly also benefit from more of those markers. Another situation
      where a biomarker could be potentially very useful is the situation where a pulmonary nodule
      is diagnosed and has to be characterized. In this situation a biomarker could predict whether
      the nodule is or is not cancerous and thus, make CT Scan follow up unnecessary.
