      possible in patients with a number of pulmonary disorders. However there is limited data on
      the sensitivity of this imaging technique, which would be essential for clinical use. This
      study is a double blinded study with two cohorts, each cohort being made up of patients with
      confirmed diagnosis of COPD. One group will receive a placebo while the other will receive
      treatment. A comparison of the data will resume once twenty patients have been consented and
      completed the study procedures.
