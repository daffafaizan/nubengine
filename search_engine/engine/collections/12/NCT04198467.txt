      indulge in daily activities. OA related disability has been affecting millions of older
      adults throughout the world, and the number has almost doubled in 2019.

      Though the process of OA could not be reversed, efficient management strategies could help in
      minimizing primary pain with physical exercises, surgical procedures, and medications.

      Prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been dramatically
      associated with mild to severe side effects, limiting its continuous use. Chondro-protective
      agents (CPAs) have been proven to provide only minimal symptomatic benefit. Platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP) has emerged as a supreme therapy in OA knee however exact dose ,preparation and
      duration of benefit still remains unclear.

      Study was undertaken to demonstrate the potential of leukocyte depleted PRP in cartilage
      repair of knee OA using WOMAC scores as subjective assessment tool.

      Our research also evaluated objective criteria ing joint space width (JSW),cartilage
      thickness on MRI, Ultrasound that would improve knee joint function in patients with knee OA.
