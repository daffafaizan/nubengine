        -  Determine the effectiveness of octreotide in the palliation of bowel obstruction
           secondary to cancer.

        -  Characterize the dose and tolerability of octreotide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive octreotide subcutaneously or IV over 24 hours on days 2-5.

      Patients who respond well to study may continue octreotide for palliative effects.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-25 patients will be accrued for this study over 9 months.
