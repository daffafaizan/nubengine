    
      The main purpose of this proposed study is to determine whether the immunometabolic
      phenotypes of CD4+T cells from obese children is skewed towards Teff with mTOR-driven
      glycolysis and away from Tregs with AMPK-driven OXPHOS and whether metformin can reverse the
      immunometabolic phenotypes.

      This study consists of:

        1. An observational cross sectional immune and metabolic analysis of several groups of
           children including lean, overweight/obese, and T2D.

        2. A prospective immune and metabolic analysis of newly diagnosed children with T2D or
           insulin resistance who will be or were recently prescribed metformin as part of their
           clinical care.

      Children with T2D or insulin resistance who will be or were recently prescribed metformin,
      will be asked to complete two study visits. If completed, the second visit will occur 6
      months (+/- 2 weeks) after beginning metformin as part of their clinical care. All other
      children, will be asked to complete only the first visit.
