      greater. When conservative management fails, patients are often offered a type of knee
      replacement as treatment. The choices are a total knee replacement or a partial knee
      replacement, which carry distinct advantages and disadvantages. Typically, patients with
      partial knee replacement have less post operative pain, quicker recovery and enhanced
      function with greater knee bend. There is however a higher chance of revision where the pain
      is not relieved or the implant fails. The decision for which replacement to offer is now
      primarily surgeon driven, shaped by their experience, review of evidence and capability to
      perform either of these options. Canadian patients would benefit from a decision making model
      so their own values can shape and determine the decision. This research hopes to evaluate the
      merits of a patient based decision aid which explicitly details the risks and benefits of
      both procedures as they are best understood today. Further, the quality of the current
      evidence is only moderately strong limited by patient selection biases and there is a need
      for contemporary comparative study trial of the 2 procedures to help clinicians and patients
      make the decision.

      A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial is being proposed to evaluate the
      outcomes of both procedures, which will help shape a multicentre Canadian study.
