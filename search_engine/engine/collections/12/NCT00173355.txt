      Protuberans (PDFSP) was even rare. To our knowledge, the largest report constituted of 19
      cases (five of them had no follow-up (FU) status) (1). So we proposed this retrospective
      study based on the cancer registry of our hospital. Twelve cases who were diagnosed as DFSP
      before age of 18 were identified. But all of them had been lost of FU for at least two years.
      So we will try to contact these patients and asked them to be back to our clinic for routine
      surveillance (history taking and physical exam and optional local image/chest xray) and
      quality of life (QoL) evaluation after pathological review if this clinical study was
      approved (2)
