      study.

      Group 1: Patients are infused with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or
      placebo over 5 minutes. A cohort of 5 patients is infused at each dose level of alpha-MSH
      until the minimum effective dose (MED) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are determined.

      Group 2: Patients receive a single dose of the MED of alpha-MSH IV over 5 minutes at the time
      anastomoses are complete. Other patients receive alpha-MSH at the MTD. Cohorts of 5 patients
      each are treated at the MED and the MTD.

      Group 3: Patients receive alpha-MSH as in group 2. Additional dose levels are also tested.
