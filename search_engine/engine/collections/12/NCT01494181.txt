      If the patient is interested in participating the study, he/she will be screened and
      consented. Undetected or untreated OSA will be established by STOP-Bang questionnaire and
      subsequent overnight PSG by using Apnea Link Plus which is level ( 2 ) at patient's home.The
      following data will be recorded: including age, gender, history of coronary artery disease,
      prior revascularization, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, critical
      aortic valvular stenosis, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes treated
      with insulin or an oral diabetic drug, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia treated with drug
      therapy, tobacco use, renal insufficiency and the type of surgery. For all study patients,
      the nocturnal blood oxygen saturation will be monitored by a pulse oximeter (PULSOX 300i) for
      first 3 nights postoperatively.During their stay in hospital, patients will be followed
      daily, and outcomes will be recorded, until discharge.. ECG will be measured preoperatively
      and repeated on day 1 to 3 after surgery. Venous blood will be collected 6-12 hours and on
      the first 3 days after surgery for measuring cTnT concentration.If patient's ECG is abnormal
      and/or patient is positive for troponin test, treating physician will be contacted for
      further treatment. Patient will be contacted 30 days after surgery by phone to ascertain if
      they have experienced any adverse out come.
