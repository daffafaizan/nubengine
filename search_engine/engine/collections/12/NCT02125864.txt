    
      Macular edema secondary to exudative age-related macular degeneration is treated today
      primarily with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, anti-VEGF.

      There are currently four anti-VEGF drugs that are either approved or off-label used in
      ophthalmology. Pegaptanib (Macugen, Pfizer), ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis) aflibercept
      (Eylea, Bayer) and bevacizumab Avastin, Roche) . They have different molecules and
      pharmacodynamics .

      VEGF plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Studies
      have shown that even low-dose intravitreal treatment with bevacizumab leads to significant
      reduction of VEGF plasma concentration up to a month after treatment in patients with
      exudative AMD.

      No significant systemic effect could be detected after intravitreal administration of
      ranibizumab or pegaptanib.

      The purpose of this study is :

        -  To determine if intravitreal treatment with Eylea affects VEGF plasma levels in patients
           with exudative AMD

        -  How long after intravitreal injection is VEGF plasma concentration affected?
