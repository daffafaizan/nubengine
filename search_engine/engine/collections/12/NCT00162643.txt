      ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NNRTI). Recent data suggests that the rate of response to PI based therapy may be slightly
      compromised if the baseline CD4 count is ≤ 200/mm3 and the plasma HIV-1-RNA ≥ 100,000
      copies/mL. This may not be equally apparent if ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors are
      used. The effect of baseline CD4 count and HIV-1-RNA levels on the antiviral efficacy of
      NNRTI based regimens has been less well characterized. A significant number of patients
      currently initiate therapy at late stages of progression, typically with baseline CD4 count
      is ≤ 200/mm3. In Mexico approximately 60% of patients who initiate therapy are within this
      range of CD4 cell counts. Currently, the two combinations recommended as preferred are with
      two NRTIs and either Efavirenz or Lopinavir/ritonavir, while other combinations of PIs and
      ritonavir are considered alternative.

      Comparison: The efficacy of ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor based therapy versus NNRTI
      based therapy in patients who are antiretroviral therapy naïve and initiate therapy with a
      CD4 count ≤ 200/mm3.
