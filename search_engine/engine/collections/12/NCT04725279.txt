      between February and July 2019, with a stabilometric platform and with movement sensors, the
      investigators want to demonstrate that the rehabilitation works in those patients with
      vertigo or dizziness of cervical origin. For this, the data obtained from that sample, which
      was of 67 patients, will be analyzed in a pre-post rehabilitation treatment study,
      objectifying whether the patients improved or not, both in terms of imbalance and cervical
      pain, if any. The 67 patients attended the rehabilitation consultation where, after taking
      the anamnesis, they began to perform balance tests with a stabilometric platform and those
      patients with associated neck pain, with cervical motion sensors. Treatment with conventional
      physiotherapy, electrotherapy or exercises at home was prescribed as appropriate to each one.
      3 months later, the patients were examined again in consultation, using a new anamnesis, the
      platform and the sensors. With the data obtained in said field work, carried out in 2019, the
      present study aims to analyze the usefulness of rehabilitation treatment in vertigo.
