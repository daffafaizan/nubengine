      (Soliris) to prevent/reduce destruction of islets of Langerhans after portal infusion of the
      islets in patients with diabetics accepted for islet transplant. Ten patients from 2 centres
      (Uppsala University Hospital and Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm) will be
      transplanted. The purpose of the study is to investigate if selective complement inhibition
      by eculizumab combined with standard anticoagulation during and after transplantation can
      further reduce the extent of early tissue loss after portal infusion of islets.
