        -  Determine the dosimetry of holmium Ho 166 DOTMP in patients with metastatic Ewing's
           sarcoma family of tumors or rhabdomyosarcoma with bone metastases.

        -  Provide treatment with holmium Ho 166 DOTMP for these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the change in tumor cell content in peripheral blood and bone marrow after
           treatment with this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a trace dose of holmium Ho 166 DOTMP IV over 10 minutes on day -7
      and an assigned dose over 10 minutes on day 0. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are
      infused on days 7-10.

      Patients are followed at least weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 1 year or until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4 patients will be accrued for this study.
