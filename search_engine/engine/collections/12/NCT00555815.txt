      extensive. Standard hygiene measures included empiric accepted measures (e.g. gloves, masks,
      disinfection). Extensive hygiene measures included among others: double gloving, astro caps,
      extensive disinfection, extensive intraoperative rinsing. In addition, intraoperative
      adherence to the rules of asepsis were registered by an independent observer.

      Patients were followed for 30 days.
