      anesthesiology. This is in part due to less invasive surgical procedures, surgical enhanced
      recovery protocols as well as the incorporation of ultrasonography into the daily practice of
      regional anesthesia.

      The aim of this retrospective survey is to track and analyse the changes in everyday practice
      of regional anesthesia in Poland that have occurred in the year 2018.

      An invitation to the survey will be sent to all heads of anesthesiology departments in
      Poland. The answers to the survey will be collected using an internet based website created
      by the authors of the study.
