      coils that fulfill all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Patients with
      both homogeneous and heterogeneous emphysema will be included.

      The main study intervention is the performance of a cyclo ergometry (not included in daily
      clinical practice) before (basal) and 6 months after going through the eLVR with coils.

      The subgroup of patients with homogeneous emphysema will be randomly assigned to the
      following therapeutic approaches:

        -  Group A: treatment with 10 coils in upper lobes

        -  Group B: treatment with 15 coils spared in upper and lower lobes

      Thus, the study includes:

        -  for all patients, the performance of two cycloergometries, before and 6 months after the
           eLVR

        -  Also, for the subset of homogeneous emphysema patients, an open label, randomized,
           parallel, two arm exploratory clinical trial.

      Sample size has not been formally calculated as there are no previous available data for the
      primary endpoint (change inspiratory capacity). Thus, 35 patients will be included according
      to the expected number of patients. Recruitment period will be 24 months and patient follow
      up will be 6 months.
