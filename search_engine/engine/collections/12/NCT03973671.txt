      pathological and follow-up data of UC patients after signing informed consent. The specific
      usage of these prospectively collected clinical data will be described in future trials.

      Templates for data collection, which also include clinical outcome parameters and quality
      indicators, were developed in InfoPath™ as an electronic case report form (eCRF) and were
      implemented within our hospital's electronic patient file system (called Klinisch Werkstation
      (KWS), which runs in different Flemish hospitals). These eCRFs have been developed based on
      the recommendations of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines and the Canadian
      Urological Association (CUA) white paper. Three separate eCRFs were developed for the
      management of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients: surgery report, bladder
      instillation form, and multidisciplinary team (MDT) form. With the scientific output
      parameters and quality indicators based on the current knowledge, patient flow-charts for the
      diagnosis of bladder cancer, and management of low-, intermediate- and high-risk NMIBCs have
      been developed.

      This databank will be first used to externally validate the European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Club Urologico Español de Tratamiento
      Oncologico (CUETO) nomograms for recurrence and progression in patients with NMIBC who have
      been treated according to the state of the art and prospectively followed up. In-depth
      analysis of the data generated in this registry will give us the opportunity to define
      improvements in patient follow-up protocol. Moreover, based on this dataset, we aim to
      develop a risk calculator for disease recurrence and progression, which will be readily
      available for Flemish hospitals to use.
