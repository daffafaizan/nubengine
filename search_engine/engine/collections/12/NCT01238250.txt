      changes and participation through remote formats, either online or by phone. This allows
      English and Spanish-speaking families from across the world to participate at times that are
      convenient to their schedule. Participants can donate blood, saliva, or both. These samples
      are then linked to medical, behavioral, learning, and developmental data in order to
      understand the effects of specific gene changes.

      Information provided by participants will be stripped of any personal identifying information
      and made available to qualified scientists around the world.

      The Simons Foundation, a New York-based private foundation, is committed to finding
      science-based solutions and working towards the development of targeted treatments to improve
      the lives of people who have genetic and developmental differences.
