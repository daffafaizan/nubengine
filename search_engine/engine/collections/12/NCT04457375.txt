    
      Skin tissue dielectric constant (TDC) measurements will non-invasively be made bilaterally at
      two neck sites, bilaterally on two forearm sites and one site at the chin sub-mental area.

      Measurements are made with subjects fully clothed and seated. Measurements are made in
      triplicate and averaged at each site. Full measurements take about 5-7 minutest to complete.
      Data will be analyzed to determine the neck-to-arm ratios and chin-to-arm ratios to establish
      normal ranges of these parameters for subsequent use as comparisons to evaluate and track
      changes in patients with head and neck lymphedema.
