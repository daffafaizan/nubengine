      children with DD, however very few interventions have targeted this health disparity. Not
      only do significant disparities exist when children with DD are compared to their peers
      without disabilities, but without intervention, physical activity behaviors in children with
      DD further decline with age. The investigators, have successfully worked together on animal
      assisted interventions, ultimately focused on promoting physical activity in children with
      disabilities. Preliminary data strongly support the conclusion that physical activity,
      quality of life and social wellbeing improves with a family-dog-assisted intervention. While
      dog-assisted interventions have become increasingly popular across applied settings, the need
      for further empirical evaluation is clear. Given the rapid growth of scientific knowledge in
      the areas of developmental disabilities, human-animal interactions and canine behavior in
      recent years, the development and empirical evaluation of new animal assisted intervention
      programs built on a solid theoretical foundation and targeted to the needs of children with
      DD is especially critical. In addition to the development of this intervention, we will
      employ an experimental design to conduct within- and between-group evaluations that will be
      used to assess the efficacy of the proposed DAID intervention, as well as its relative value
      when compared with a traditional dog walking intervention and waitlist control (true
      control). To further strengthen our approach, the investigators will use a combination of
      objective validated physical (physical activity accelerometers), self-report (Quality of
      Life, Dog Care Responsibility Inventory, and Pet Relationship & Friendship Scales) and
      behavioral measures (Child-dog/Dog-child proximity seeking, sociability and attachment) to
      evaluate program outcomes.
