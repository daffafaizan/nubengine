      infected pancreatic necrosis. Due to its rising incidence it remains an important healthcare
      problem in Europe and US. The assessment of the severity of pancreatitis is crucial for the
      further management and the prognosis. Several quite complex scores like Ranson or APACHE II
      scores has been used in the past with reasonable sensitivity for necrosis or superinfection
      as well as inflammation markers like c-reactive Protein.

      Copeptin, the C-terminal part of antidiuretic hormone, is a relatively stable peptide in
      blood circulation. Several studies investigated Copeptin in the presence of Systemic
      Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, myocardial infarction, lower respiratory
      tract infection and cerebral stroke. Copeptin has shown to be a helpful prognostic marker in
      these diseases. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate whether Copeptin can be
      used to assess the severity of pancreatitis.
