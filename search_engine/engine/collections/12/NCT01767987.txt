      diastolic function, and cardiac metabolism. Furthermore it has been associated with reduced
      cardiac arrhythmias, including non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.
      It has not been studied as an acute cardioprotective agent in percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI).

      We hypothesize that upfront administration of Ranolazine could decrease the myocardial injury
      associated with PCI due to all the factors listed above (i.e. precondition the myocardium).
      We plan to screen all patients scheduled for an elective coronary angiogram. Those who meet
      criteria and consent will be randomized to either receive Ranolazine or placebo twice a day
      for 3 days leading up to the PCI.
