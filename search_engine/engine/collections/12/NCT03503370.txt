    
      Population: Up to 200 Veterans at risk for diabetic foot ulcer recurrence

      Site: VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS)

      Study Duration: Approximately 5 years

      Study Design: Randomized double-blind clinical trial comparing a) a daily foot care regimen
      with cloths containing 2% chlorhexidine to b) a daily foot care regimen with cloths not
      containing 2% chlorhexidine

      Objectives:

      Primary: To determine if chlorhexidine reduces the recurrence of foot complications including
      chronic foot ulcer, foot infection or foot amputation.

      Secondary: To determine if chlorhexidine increases antibiotic resistance among bacterial
      pathogens on feet.

      Exploratory: To describe changes in the microbiota of the feet with chlorhexidine and foot
      complications

      Treatment Regimens: 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloths versus Bath Cloths

      Route of Administration: Topical application on the feet

      Dose and Interval: 1 cloth daily

      Duration of Participant's Participation: Up to 13 months
