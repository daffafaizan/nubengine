    
      Prospective, investigator-blinded, single-institution randomized-control trial . Consecutive
      adult patients with IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) admitted to the hospital will
      be screened for eligibility, and eligible patients will be approached and consented to
      participate. Subjects will be randomized to receive the P.A.I.N.-Sparing bundle or usual
      care. Patient randomization will be stratified by provider to avoid bias, using a web-based
      in-house system (RANDI3). Subjects will also be provided with a fitness tracker (Fitbit(R))
      to measure functional status during their hospital stay.
