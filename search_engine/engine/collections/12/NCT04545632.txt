    
      Ethanol-induced symptoms questionnaire will be administered three times during the baseline
      visit (Visit 1) - before, during, and within 30 minutes after treatment with docetaxel - and
      then during the follow-up visit (or phone call) at 24 hours after the treatment. There will
      be no restrictions as to what concomitant medications can be used before and after treatment
      with ethanol-containing docetaxel, and investigators will determine the manufacturer,
      preparation method, and dosage regimen of docetaxel as per routine care at their study site.

      The following data will be collected:

        -  Demographics (gender, age, drinking history)

        -  Height, body weight and body mass index (BMI)

        -  Cancer-related data (diagnosis, date of diagnosis)

        -  ECOG PS

        -  Underlying diseases

        -  Prior and concomitant medications

        -  Data on docetaxel therapy (timing of initiation of the chemotherapy,
           monotherapy/combination therapy, intervals between chemotherapy treatments, product
           name, dose (mg), administered ethanol dose (g), blood alcohol content (BAC*), type and
           volume of intravenous (IV) fluid administered before and after treatment and fluid mixed
           with docetaxel, duration of injection)

           * Blood alcohol content (BAC): Widmark formula = administered ethanol dose (g) / body
           weight (kg) Ã— gender constant (0.68 for males and 0.55 for females)
