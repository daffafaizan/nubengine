      purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and explore the effectiveness of resveratrol,
      a plant polyphenol, being re-purposed for patients with early COVID-19. Published in vitro
      data supports that this polyphenol inhibits coronavirus replication while separately
      published in silico (computer molecular docking analysis) reports have identified specific
      molecular targets of resveratrol against SARS-CoV2. Animal studies also demonstrate that
      resveratrol is effective at preventing lung injury and death in certain animal models of
      viral infections. Furthermore, the products long history as an anti-inflammatory might
      prevent the cytokine storm that is associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19.

      200 subjects, 45 and older, (100 receiving the plant polyphenol, 100 receiving placebo) will
      be enrolled in study to compare whether taking resveratrol will reduce the rate of
      hospitalization. Subjects will take capsules 4 times a day for a minimum of 7 days (up to 15
      days depending on duration of symptoms) plus both groups will receive Vitamin D3 100,000 IU
      to augment the effects of resveratrol. Resveratrol will be given as 1gm 4 times per day.
      Placebo tablets will contain brown rice flour in visually identical capsules. The primary
      outcome measure for this trial is reduction in hospitalization at 21 days from enrollment.
