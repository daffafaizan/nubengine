      TMD symptoms were reviewed to determine the treatment modalities used and their outcomes. The
      subjects were examined and diagnosed according to the Turkish translation version of The
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD-Axis 1 questionnaire and
      examination form). The pain intensity, maximal mouth opening (MMO) amounts, and self-reported
      outcome variables of twenty-two patients who underwent non-invasive therapies (occlusal
      stabilization splints, behavioral modifications, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) but did
      not benefit from them and volunteered for the ATNB instead of invasive therapies
      (arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, and discectomy) were also evaluated. Prior to the ATNB, written
      informed consent was obtained from each participant. Also, each participant was warned about
      complications of the ATNB before the administration, such as hematoma at the injection site,
      positive aspiration, and temporary anesthesia of the facial nerve.
