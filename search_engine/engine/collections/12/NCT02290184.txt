      in the United States. They have one of the highest rates of insulin resistance (type 2
      diabetes = T2DM) and central obesity (fat distributions primarily in the abdominal region).
      T2DM and central obesity are two of five major risk factors for metabolic syndrome that lead
      to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Key factors contributing to obesity and T2DM in
      Filipinos are their physical inactivity, and a diet high in fat and soda intake. However,
      there are very few research studies on improving health behaviors to reduce risks for
      metabolic syndrome in Filipino Americans. To help reduce the risk of developing metabolic
      syndrome in overweight/obese Filipino Americans with T2DM, the proposed project will test a
      culturally appropriate health behavior intervention program to reduce weight and waist
      circumference, through increasing physical activity, and lowering fat and sugar sweetened
      beverage intake. This intervention uses a mobile phone health app and social networking to
      encourage adherence to target health behaviors. The goals are to:

        1. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the culturally appropriate PilAm Go4Health
           Weight Loss Program

        2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of the intervention on weight

        3. To conduct post-program process evaluations too improve the intervention relevancy for
           the target population.
