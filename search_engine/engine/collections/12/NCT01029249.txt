      population. Recent research in the United States and Europe has also found that HIV-infected
      people have a higher risk of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer than HIV-uninfected
      people. In one study, it was found that HPV seropositivity was associated with an increased
      risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP). In addition to SCCOP, another
      HPV-related health concern is oral warts, a condition for which there is no effective
      treatment. Even after beginning treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),
      active HPV replication in the mouth and oropharynx may persist in HIV-infected people,
      leading to an increased risk of SCCOP and oral warts. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the frequency of oral HPV DNA shedding and oral warts in HIV-infected people prior
      to HAART initiation and at regular time points after HAART initiation.

      ACTG A5257 is a study that is comparing the effectiveness of three non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-sparing HAART regimens in treatment-na√Øve participants. This
      study will enroll participants from the ACTG A5257 study. Participants will attend a baseline
      study visit at the same time as their ACTG A5257 baseline study visit. At baseline and at
      Week 4, 16, 24, and 48 study visits, participants will undergo an examination of their mouth,
      throat wash and saliva collection, and behavioral questionnaires. A blood collection will
      also occur at Week 24.
