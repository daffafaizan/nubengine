      visit (Week -4) and undergo the Bellafill skin test. At Visit 1 (Day 0), all subjects will
      commence microneedling treatment for their atrophic acne scars. Subjects will then return to
      the clinic at Week 3 and Week 6 (Visits 2 and 3, respectively) for follow-up evaluation and
      additional cycles of microneedling treatment.

      At Week 12 (Visit 4), all subjects commence Period II and are randomized to Bellafill
      Treatment (Track A) or to No Treatment (Track B):

        -  Track A: Consists of three (3) study visits. At Visit 4, subjects randomized to the
           "Bellafill" group will receive treatment with Bellafill for their atrophic acne scars.
           Subjects return for Visit 5A (Month 1 after randomization) for evaluation and follow-up,
           and will receive touch-up injections with Bellafill to achieve optimal correction (if
           necessary). Subjects will then be followed-up at Visits 6A and 7A which will occur at
           Month 3 and Month 6, respectively, after their last Bellafill treatment.

        -  Track B: Consists of one (1) study visit. At Visit 4, subjects randomized to the "No
           Treatment" group will complete visit evaluations and then return for follow-up at Visit
           5B (approx. Month 3 after randomization).
