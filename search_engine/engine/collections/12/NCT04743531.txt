      staggered implementation pilot design. The aims will test whether the implementation of a
      parent-child interaction intervention, focusing on eating and activity behaviors, will
      improve children's eating behaviors, motor performance and parent-child interactions in these
      domains. This project seeks to answer the following research questions:

        1. Do children participating in the family-based intervention demonstrate enhanced PA and
           eating behaviors?

             -  Hypothesis 1.1: Children receiving the family-based intervention will have higher
                PA levels and enhanced motor skills compared to children in the control group.

             -  Hypothesis 1.2: Children receiving the family-based intervention will demonstrate
                enhanced eating behaviors compared to children in the control group.

        2. Can the home environment be improved by parents' self-monitoring of food availability
           and electronic devices; and the application of mindful parenting strategies?

             -  Hypothesis 2.1: Evaluation of food items in the home and electronic devices in the
                child's bedroom will demonstrate a more positive home environment of participants
                receiving the family-based HEROs intervention.

             -  Hypothesis 2.2: Parents will report more positive parent-child interactions after
                receiving the family-based HEROs intervention.
