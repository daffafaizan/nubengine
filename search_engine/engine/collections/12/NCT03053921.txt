    
      STUDY DESIGN A total number of 60 teeth in 15 subjects were selected. Patients with bilateral
      Miller's class I and II gingival recession defects in the maxillary or mandibular anterior
      and premolar region were selected and divided into two groups using a split mouth design.

      GroupI (Control) -30 recession defects treated with coronally advanced flap alone, using
      Zucchelli's technique.

      Group II (Test) - 30 recession defects treated with coronally advanced flap, using
      Zucchelli's technique along with placental membrane.

      .

      CLINICAL PARAMETERS:

        1. Probing Pocket Depth(PPD)

        2. Clinical Attachment Level(CAL)

        3. Height of Gingival Recession(HGR)

        4. Width of Gingival Recession(WGR)

        5. Width of Keratinized Gingiva(WKG) The clinical parameters were assessed & recorded on 0
           day, 90th day and 180th day
