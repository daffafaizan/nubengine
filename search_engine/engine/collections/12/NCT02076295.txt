      the radioligand [18F]flubatine and MRI on one day and extensive neuropsychological testing on
      another day. The degree of nicotinic receptor expression obtained with PET imaging will be
      correlated with the neuropsychology test results.

      Positive [18F]flubatine PET findings in this study would establish nicotinic receptors as an
      important contributor to cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and could kindle
      pharmaceutical interest in pursuing these agents for Parkinson's disease applications.

      We expect that lower nicotinic receptor expression is associated with impaired cognitive
      functioning in Parkinson's disease. In a personalized medicine approach the PET radioligand
      [18F]flubatine could serve as an important marker to identify those patients who are expected
      to benefit most from nicotinic receptor drug treatment.
