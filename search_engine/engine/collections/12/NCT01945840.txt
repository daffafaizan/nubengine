    
      This study is designed to investigate whether chronic elevation of glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin and peptide YY (PYY) in combination is responsible for the majority of
      the metabolic effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) including improved glycaemia,
      increased energy expenditure, reduced food intake, weight loss, reduced preference for high
      calorie foods and reduced activation in brain reward areas in response to visual food cues.
