      myocardial infarction (MI) are being reported. Gender specific presentations of MI in
      particular have contributed to underdiagnosis of cardiac events in women. Furthermore,
      previous studies from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factors Screening Surveillance demonstrated
      decreased compliance with standard cardiovascular health practices in women compared to men.
      We seek to validate these findings in a population of women undergoing screening mammography
      and annual gynecology visit to identify current state of knowledge regarding cardiovascular
      risk in women.
