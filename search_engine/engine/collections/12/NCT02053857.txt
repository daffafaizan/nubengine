      growth of bacteria because of the low moisture content, does not require cooking, and has led
      to greater recovery rates than liquid milk formulations in direct comparisons. One expected
      benefit of the RUTF-P is improved outcomes due to the higher levels of essential fatty acids.

      The essential fatty acid profile (i.e., the level of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) of
      RUTF-P may have important implications for cognitive development of children, especially
      infants, with SAM who consume these foods as their sole dietary source for several weeks. In
      particular, an excess of omega-6 fatty acids (from sources such as peanut and corn oil) and a
      minimum of omega-3 fatty acids (from sources like flax) may fail to support optimal cognitive
      development and neural function.

      In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical effectiveness trial, we
      will compare two RUTF products in the treatment of SAM to test the effects of the two
      different RUTF products on essential fatty acid status.
