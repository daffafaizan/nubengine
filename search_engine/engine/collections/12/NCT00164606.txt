      the Triple-P system or to a waitlist control condition. University of South Carolina staff
      will train health care professionals in the nine dissemination counties to use the Triple-P
      parenting programs. Triple-P is a parenting program that uses a tiered system of
      interventions of increasing strength depending on parents' and children's differing needs,
      ranging from media and information-based strategies, to two levels of moderate-intensity
      intervention using a brief consultation format, to two more intensive levels of parent
      training and behavioral family intervention targeting parenting skills and other family
      adversity factors such as marital conflict, depression and high levels of parenting stress.
      The evaluation of the dissemination of Triple-P will rely on two methods: the analysis of
      aggregate data on child maltreatment, injuries and hospitalizations, and annual surveys of
      families to examining parenting education, practices, and child behavior.
