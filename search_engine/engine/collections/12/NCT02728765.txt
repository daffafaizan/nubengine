      study on all the patients with biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) being
      followed up at the Hepatology Clinic, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, in phase one of
      this study. The following conditions have already been excluded as the underlying cause of
      liver disease in this specific NAFLD cohort: history of excessive alcoholic consumption (more
      than 30 g/day for men and 20 g/day for women), secondary causes of hepatic steatosis (such as
      chronic use of systemic corticosteroids), positive hepatitis B surface antigen,
      anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, or histological evidence of other concomitant chronic liver
      diseases.

      OSA syndrome is defined by apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of 5 per hours or more of sleep plus
      excessive daytime sleepiness or two of the following symptoms: choking or gasping during
      sleep, recurrent awakenings from sleep, unrefreshed sleep, daytime fatigue, and impaired
      concentration. All patients with suspected OSA will undergo initial assessment at the
      respiratory clinic with the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) and symptoms evaluation. Patients
      who have ESS score >9 or at least two OSA symptoms as described above will be invited to join
      phase two of the study. They will be invited to undergo a home sleep study.

      Those with biopsy proven NAFLD who have AHIâ‰¥ 5/hr will be randomized into either group A )
      auto CPAP with range 4-12 cmH20 or group B) Subtherapeutic CPAP with the auto CPAP fixed at 4
      cmH20 by a balanced block design by a third party not involved in the trial.
