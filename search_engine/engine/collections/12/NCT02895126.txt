      program by evaluating its impact on the development of children aged from 0 to 3 years. The
      secondary objectives are to study the effects of the intervention on: the mother-child
      interactions, the degree of therapeutic alliance between parent and professionals, the
      parenting skills feeling, perceived social support, anxiety and depression of parents,
      frequency of legal interventions (placements, educational measures). An assessment of stress
      among professionals involved in the study and evaluation of the therapeutic alliance with
      families will also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the supervision included in
      the program.

      Hypothesis: Scores on Symptom Check List after 18 months of follow up will be significantly
      higher in subjects who benefited the Appui Parental program compared to subjects with
      conventional parental support. Similarly, it is expected that other developmental assessments
      of children have the best results in the Appui Parental Program group than in the control
      group. Finally, it is assumed that the mother-child interactions, the parenting skills
      feeling, and the therapeutic alliance between parent and professional are better in the Appui
      Parental program than in the control group.
