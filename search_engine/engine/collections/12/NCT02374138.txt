      remain adherent to their management plans. Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), when
      indicated for persistent or uncontrolled asthma, is a critical component of most asthma
      management plans, and other self-management practices such as trigger avoidance are similarly
      related to improved asthma outcomes. Adherence to self-management practices is mediated by
      multiple factors, including psychosocial stress of parents and their children.

      A targeted, culturally appropriate intervention to manage psychosocial stress among the
      parents of young, African American, and socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children with
      asthma who are receiving guideline-based care may improve asthma self-management, and
      therefore asthma outcomes.

      Our overall aim is to implement and evaluate a highly collaborative, multi-dimensional,
      culturally appropriate and community-based asthma intervention to augment existing
      guideline-based best practice. The intervention will target the parents of at-risk, urban,
      African American youth, and will employ individualized psychosocial stress management and
      peer support.

      We will conduct a single blind, prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the IMPACT
      DC Asthma Clinic's existing intervention of guideline-based clinical care, education, and
      short-term care coordination (usual care) to usual care plus parental stress management in a
      cohort of up to 200 parent-child dyads of AA youth aged 4-12 years.
