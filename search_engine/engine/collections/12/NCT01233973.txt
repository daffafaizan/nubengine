    
      A.1. Aim 1: To recruit 101 subjects over the age of 64 who are newly admitted to a nursing
      home facility and randomly assign these subjects to one of two advance care planning (ACP)
      modalities: 1. a video visually depicting the Goals of Care (Life Prolonging Care, Limited
      Care, and Comfort Care) (intervention) or 2. a verbal narrative describing the Goals of Care
      (control) encountered if the subject becomes very ill.

      Hypothesis 1: It is feasible to recruit and randomize newly admitted elderly subjects to each
      of the ACP modalities.

      A.2. Aim 2: To compare the care preferences for their primary goal of care (i.e.,
      life-prolonging care, limited care, or comfort care) among 101 subjects randomized to video
      vs. verbal narrative intervention for ACP.

      Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to the video intervention will be significantly more likely
      to opt for comfort care (vs. life-prolonging or limited care) as the primary goal of care
      compared to those randomized to the verbal narrative.

      A.3. Aim 3: To compare knowledge assessment of the Goals of Care of 101 subjects randomized
      to video vs. verbal narrative intervention for ACP.

      Hypothesis 3: When compared to subjects randomized to the verbal narrative arm, subjects in
      the video group will have higher knowledge assessment scores when asked questions regarding
      their understanding of the Goals of Care.
