      the risk of osteoporotic fractures is nearly 10 times that of community dwelling elderly, few
      are treated and studies are scarce. It is postulated that in frail, LTC women an annual
      infusion of zoledronic acid, an antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis, will:

        1. be effective demonstrated by fracture reduction;

        2. be safe.

      To address these hypotheses, up to 1000 female LTC residents age 65 and older will be
      screened in order to enroll 310 eligible for randomization in a 3 year, randomized,
      double-blind, calcium and vitamin D controlled trial with the antiresorptive agent zoledronic
      acid. Use of an intravenous, once yearly agent avoids concerns of oral bisphosphonate side
      effects, poor absorption and burden on staff. Participants will reside in the long-term care
      settings associated with the Division of Geriatric Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and
      will include women with multiple comorbid conditions, functional and cognitive impairment,
      and limited mobility.
