      practice, Several appliance have suggested for the treatment of class III malocclusion, such
      as the facial mask and chin cup.

      Despite of the efficiency of this extraoral appliance, its external appearance and its big
      size reduce patients' cooperation which decrease its clinical effects.

      Another Class III treatment modality is the Orthodontic Removable Traction Appliance (ORTA).
      It is a removable appliance that can be used in conjunction with rapid palatal expansion or
      fixed appliances, It was developed in the 1980's by Dr. David Musich who developed this
      appliance in order to overcome issues of compliance that Dr. Musich experienced with use of
      the protraction facemask.

      There is only one study that evaluated this appliance which is a retrospective study compared
      the treatment effects of the ORTA and protraction facemask in treatment of Class III
      malocclusions. However, this study has a lot of limitations which made it difficult to
      accurately evaluate the efficiency of this device.

      The aim of this study is studying the dentoskeletal changes that result from treatment by
      this device, by comparing them to the changes in matched untreated group,by studying the
      cephalometric x-rays.
