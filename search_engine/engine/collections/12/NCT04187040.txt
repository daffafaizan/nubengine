      between healthcare workers and patients, and ultimately, healthcare-associated infections.
      However, compliance with both hand hygiene indications and technique (outlining the steps for
      applying hand rub to ensure coverage of all surfaces of the hands) remains insufficient at
      most institutions worldwide. It was previously demonstrated that a hand hygiene technique
      consisting of three steps is superior to the 6-step technique outlined by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) in terms of compliance with both indications and technique in a single
      center study. Furthermore, the 3-step technique was non-inferior regarding microbiological
      efficacy in two experimental studies and during daily clinical practice. To further
      investigate the external validity and generalizability of these findings to different
      settings, this study compares both compliance with hand hygiene indications and technique
      between the 3-step and the 6-step technique for applying hand rub in an international
      multicenter cluster randomized trial.
