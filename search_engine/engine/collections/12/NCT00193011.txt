      arms:

        -  Docetaxel

        -  Cyclophosphamide + Methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil

      This is not a blinded study so both the patient and the investigator will know which
      treatment has been assigned.

      Chemotherapy will be followed by breast and/or regional radiotherapy in appropriate patients,
      and by hormone therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years in patients who are estrogen-receptor
      positive. Patients who are considered poor candidates to receive tamoxifen may receive
      hormonal therapy with anastrazole.
