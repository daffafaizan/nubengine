    
      This is a phase II study of perifosine in patients with chondrosarcomas, alveolar soft part
      sarcomas and extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. Patients will receive perifosine 100 mg
      orally qhs with food until disease progression.

      Perifosine is available in 50 mg tablets. Patients will take two perifosine 50 mg tablets
      orally once a day at bedtime with food. Administering the drug qhs has been shown to decrease
      gastrointestinal toxicity in some patients. Patients may need anti-emetics and/or
      anti-diarrheals. All patients may continue therapy unless disease progression is documented
      on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart. Patients who experience toxicity may continue on
      treatment with doses delayed or reduced. Evaluation of all lesions for progression or
      response will be made at 3-month intervals.

      STUDY KEY POINTS

        -  Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis in 28-day cycles.

        -  Growth factors should not be needed, however, use by patients on this trial is NOT
           prohibited.

        -  A favorable outcome will be defined as a complete or partial response according to the
           Choi criteria or stable disease by the Choi criteria for 6 months or longer.
