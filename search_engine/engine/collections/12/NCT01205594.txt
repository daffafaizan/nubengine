      hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock. The device is inserted within a standard respiratory
      circuit between the patient and the ventilator. It functions by decreasing intrathoracic
      pressure during the expiratory phase to subatmospheric levels after each positive pressure
      ventilation. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure creates a vacuum within the thorax
      relative to the rest of the body thereby enhancing blood return to the heart and consequently
      increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Activation of the device is also accompanied by
      a decrease in SVR. The end result is a device that simultaneously improves cardiac output by
      increasing LVEDP/LVEDV and decreasing SVR while increasing coronary perfusion pressure by
      increasing blood pressure and decreasing LVESP/LVESV.1-8
