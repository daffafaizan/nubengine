    
      Consumption of low Glycemic Index (GI) foods has been shown to not only attenuate blood
      glucose response during the postprandial period immediately following a meal but to have also
      positive metabolic effects at the subsequent meal, known as the "second-meal effect" by
      reducing glucose excursion beyond actual meal. The relative importance of the timing of the
      glycemic load variation (e.g., breakfast or dinner) on the overall, 24h, glycemic control has
      not been investigated in detail.

      We hypothesize that eating low GI foods in a single meal either for breakfast or for dinner
      would have different consequential effects on glycemic control over the following meal and
      thereafter during 24 hours. In order to establish the relative importance of breakfast or
      dinner in predicting glycemic control/response of the following meal and for a 24-hour period
      this study will use comprehensive methods including Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems
      (CGMS) as well as measuring postprandial blood glucose and insulin.
