      motion within a casing to harvest solid biopsies from tissue through the biopsy channel of a
      conventional flexible endoscope. It was originally designed for sampling of tissue from
      submucosal lesions. The investigators´ first study of the instrument is now finished.
      Endodrill is safe to use and generates more submucosal tissue compared to biopsies with a
      conventional biopsy forceps.

      In this study the investigators want to compare the Endodrill instrument´s ability to obtain
      representative tissue samples from tumors in the distal esophagus and cardia with a
      conventional biopsy forceps. In addition the investigators want to compare the tissue samples
      in terms of weight, quality, artefacts and whether either instrument is more suited for
      collecting tissue for genetic analysis. Such analysis will be conducted with Next-Generation
      Sequensing (NGS) of the whole exome, Whole Exome Sequensing (WES). In the event of positive
      results from these analysis the investigators will also conduct RNA-sequencing of the tumor
      tissue in order to start pre-operative mapping of genetic abnormalities.

      20 patients will be enrolled for this study. For each patient the investigators will collect
      10 biopsies, 5 biopsies each with conventional biopsy and the Endodrill instrument
      respectively. The order will be randomized for each patient. For each specific biopsy the
      investigator will choose a particular site on the suspected tumor tissue without knowing
      which instrument that will be used for the biopsy. This procedure will be repeated for all 10
      biopsies.
