    
      Hypothesis: (1) The Zuni Health Initiative (ZHI) can integrate an innovative approach to Home
      based kidney care (HBKC) utilizing tribal Community Health Representatives (CHRs), Point of
      Care (POC) technology, telemedicine and motivational messaging in conjunction with patient
      preferences and Patient Activation Measures (PAM) into the chronic care model to improve the
      detection and treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and related risk factors; (2) This
      model is generalizable to other high-risk communities e.g., Hispanic and American Indians in
      Guadalupe, AZ being studied by NIDDK, NIH-Phoenix.

      Specific Aim 1: Re-phenotype prior participants, to identify incident cases of CKD, estimate
      progression rates, and identify participants for the proposed study of HBKC;

      Specific Aim 2: Conduct a pilot study of HBKC in 120 people. Randomize households in a 1:1
      allocation to usual care versus HBKC. Compare the changes in Patient Activation measure
      (PAM), Adherence, BP, weight, HbA1c, UACR, eGFR and lipid profiles between the two groups
      over the 1-year intervention period;

      Specific Aim 3: Inform the design of the full-scale study by estimating anticipated
      recruitment, adherence and dropout rates, sample size and reassessing the approach;

      Specific Aim 4: Assess the exportability of the HBKC model to Hispanics and American Indians
      in Guadalupe, AZ.

      Study Outcomes: (1) The PAM and adherence; (2) Changes in clinical phenotypes including Cr,
      UACR, A1c, body weight, BMI, fasting glucose, blood pressure (BP), plasma lipids, and
      inflammatory markers; (3) Changes in the quantitative traits such as diet and scores from a
      battery of mental-health, self-efficacy, and quality of life instruments.

      Health Impact: The active participation of the Zuni tribal leadership and IHS in this
      protocol, and the general affordability of Zuni native CHR personnel, render the outcomes
      that will be demonstrated by this proposal easily sustainable over the long term. If
      successful, this program has the potential to change best-practices for CKD progression and
      to reduce health disparities in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.
