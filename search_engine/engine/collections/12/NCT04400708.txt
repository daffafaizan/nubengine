      patients receiving total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. The effect of the
      single-injection adductor canal and continuous adductor canal block in patients receiving
      total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia has been well established. However, due to
      the residual effect of spinal anesthesia, the effect of the single-injection adductor canal
      block needs to be determined. The investigators hypothesize that the single-injection
      adductor canal block will decrease the total sum of 2h, 6h, 12h, and 24h pain score.
