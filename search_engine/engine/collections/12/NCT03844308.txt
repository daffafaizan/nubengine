      burnout among perioperative healthcare providers. To do this, investigators will randomize
      healthy participants to one of two groups: one who will meditate twice daily for six weeks
      (group 1), and the other who will not meditate for first six weeks and then meditate for
      another six weeks (group 2). Investigators will then evaluate stress and burnout using
      validated electronic instruments at baseline and at six weeks for group 1 and at baseline,
      six weeks, and 12 weeks for group 2.
