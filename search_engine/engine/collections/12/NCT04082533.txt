      other disabling knee injuries. Indications have increased to ever younger patients and,
      combined with the aging US population, nearly 700,000 Americans receive TKAs each year. In
      spite of surgery, many patients experience persistent pain, stiffness or instability that
      negatively impacts their quality of life; up to 5% experience TKA failure in the first 10
      years.

      Presently, IV stress dose steroids is an accepted practice for bilateral knee replacement
      (BTKR) leading to decreased pain 24 hours after surgery and improved range of motion (ROM) on
      postoperative day 2 (POD2). These benefits are likely due to suppression of inflammation
      immediately after surgery. It is not clear if IV stress dose steroids improve ROM at later
      time points. Moreover, it is not clear if IV hydrocortisone improves clinical outcomes in
      unilateral TKA, where pain and joint stiffness remain significant challenges weeks after
      surgery. The investigators hypothesize that IV hydrocortisone will increase ROM at 6 weeks
      following surgery.

      This study will enroll 132 patients that will be followed for up to 2 years. By integrating
      cell and molecular biology, biomechanics, and imaging technologies (including a CT scan at 1
      year), this study is designed to comprehensively examine the long term effects of IV
      hydrocortisone on joint stiffness, pain, clinically relevant inflammatory states, and the
      synovium following unilateral TKA. Because subjects with variable ROMs will be enrolled in
      the study and followed over time, the findings may enable the development of biomarker
      prediction tools and the targeting of appropriate prevention and management measures for
      patients at highest risk of joint stiffness and subsequent surgical intervention.
