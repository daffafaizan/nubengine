      relatives of patients to be screened for Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) and
      related disorders of apoptosis, RAS associated leukoproliferative disorder (RALD). Patients
      and relatives will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center if they meet the eligibility
      criteria. This evaluation will include blood and relevant tissue studies along with long-term
      clinical evaluation to define the biology, inheritance, clinical spectrum, and natural
      history of this syndrome. The aim of the research studies is to elucidate mechanisms
      underlying the immune dysregulation due to defective apoptosis in these patients. Knowledge
      gained from these studies provides important insights into the mechanisms of autoimmunity,
      normal thymic and extra thymic T cell differentiation, TCR repertoire selection, and
      lymphomagenesis. Medically indicated management of ALPS-related autoimmune disease and
      cytopenias will also be considered and provided, using standard of care treatments.
