    
      A prospective observation study examining the clinical utility of novel pleural fluid, biopsy
      and serum biomarkers for the investigation of pleural effusions (INVEST). The INVEST study
      will collect blood, pleural fluid and tissue samples from donors, allowing the opportunity to
      apply several novel blood and pleural fluid tests with interpretation of results in the
      context of clinical data and diagnostic suspicion. Through the prospective application of
      multiple tests, we aim to validate the sensitivity and specificity of existing biomarkers and
      identify novel markers that aid in the diagnostic pathway of pleural diseases. Because
      samples and data will be stored for future use, many other different tests, methods and
      techniques may be used in the future to provide information that we cannot foresee.
