      influence on children's health behaviors at this age. Many parents, particularly those from
      lower income and underserved areas may benefit from programs to inspire and enable them to
      raise their toddler age children with good health habits. The experimental group was
      developed to help parents instill healthy habits in their children through a healthy home
      environment. This study will pilot test the experimental group among parent-toddler dyads
      residing in Greater Third Ward neighborhoods, where > 80% of the residents are AA or Hispanic
      and 35%-54% have annual household incomes <$25,000. The aims are to ascertain 1) recruitment
      and retention barriers and facilitators, 2) treatment success barriers and facilitators, and
      3) the estimated effect sizes of outcomes to inform a fully powered RCT. The exploratory
      hypotheses are that compared to those in the control group, parents in the experimental group
      will have greater increases in positive parenting skills (Comprehensive General Parenting
      Questionnaire), and toddlers will have greater increases in indicators of a healthy home
      environments, diets and activity habits (MVPA, sedentary activity, and sleep).
