      temperatures on patients using the InstaTemp MD® device and the traditional method used in
      the clinical setting. Reliability and agreement of the InstaTemp MD® will be compared to the
      current Canadian Paediatric Society's definitely recommended methods of temperature
      measurement in certain age cohorts of infants and children.
