      patients. This study registers motion of the esophageal tumor, using 4D planning CT scans and
      repeated 4D CBCT scanning. Motion of fiducial markers inserted into the esophageal wall, will
      be used as a surrogate for tumor motion in the limited image quality of CBCT scans.

      Patients planned for trimodality treatment will additionally be imaged by serial 4D Pet CT
      and MRI in week 0 (before start chemoradiotherapy), week 3 (during chemoradiotherapy) and
      week 10 (just prior to surgery) to observe (early) signs of tumor response.

      Patients planned for definitive chemoradiation will not receive extra MRI imaging during
      treatment because of the inability to correlate this imaging with pathological response.
