      I. To describe the rate of manifestation of an occult primary tumor in the pharyngeal axis or
      delayed nodal recurrence in a un-dissected and/or non-irradiated neck at 2 years after study
      registration in patients treated with mucosal sparing (and unilateral neck, if applicable)
      radiotherapy after resection using transoral surgery for head and neck cancer of unknown
      primaries (HNCUP).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the rates and severity of acute and late toxicities and PEG dependence
      attributable to mucosal sparing radiotherapy after resection using transoral surgery by
      assessment of grade 3 or higher adverse events National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0 criteria.

      II. To describe the overall survival, recurrence-free survival (manifestation of an occult
      primary in the pharyngeal axis, nodal recurrence in a treated (surgery/radiation therapy
      [RT]) neck, delayed lymph node metastasis in an untreated neck (surgery/RT), and distant
      failure associated with mucosal sparing radiotherapy.

      III. To describe swallowing function changes (assessed via swallowing study) associated with
      transoral surgery and adjuvant mucosal sparing radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients who have recurrence or progression during treatment or observation have medical
      charts reviewed every 6 months for 5 years. Patients who complete adjuvant treatment are
      followed for observation 3 days after radiation therapy, 1 month after radiation therapy,
      every 3 months after radiation therapy for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      annually for 2 years.
