      â‰¤30%) since 2008, which causes dramatic increases in alcohol drinking and binge drinking
      rates. Alcohol use in youth is the leading cause of disability adjusted life-years loss. Most
      adult drinkers start drinking at age 18-21. Evidence shows that alcohol brief intervention
      (ABI) is effective reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol use in university students. The
      proposed trial aims to enhance the ABI by incorporating information communication
      technologies (ICTs) such as instant messaging (IM) Apps (e.g. WhatsApp and WeChat) to provide
      personalized, real-time chat-based support led by nurses. The aims of study are as follows:

        1. To determine the main effect of the Intervention vs. Control group on alcohol
           consumption per week at 6-month (Primary)

        2. To assess the effects on alcohol consumption per week at 12-month, AUDIT scores at 6 and
           12-month, perceived usefulness of IM app at 12-month, intention to use IM app to
           reduce/quit drinking at 12-month, number of standard drinks, episode of binge drinking,
           episode of heavy drinking, planned drinking, Academic Role Expectation and Alcohol
           Scale, Alcohol Problems Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 4-item, Perceived Stress
           Scale 4-item, Covid-19 related drinking behavioral changes, and self-efficacy to
           reduce/quit drinking at 6-month and 12-month

        3. To identify mediators between intervention and outcomes to inform the potential
           mechanisms

        4. To qualitatively explore experience on the interventions for reducing alcohol use and
           related harms
