    
      Pharmacokinetic and safety of caspofungin, in an intermittent dosing schedule, for
      prophylaxis of invasive fungal (IFI) infections will be evaluated in patients receiving
      induction chemotherapy for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome with
      blast crisis or acute lymphatic leukemia.

      For prophylaxis caspofungin once daily will be given three times a week after a loading phase
      of three days. For drug monitoring serum samples will be collected from the first day of
      trial medication till one day after end of therapy (EOT). Invasive fungal infections will be
      diagnosed analog the criteria defined by the European organization for Research and Treatment
      of Cancer and the Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG), revised in 2008.

      Caspofungin prophylaxis will be stopped after the end of neutropenia, in case of documented
      proven or probable invasive fungal disease and in case of a serious adverse event
      attributable to the study drug, for which in view of the investigator further usage of the
      study drug should be avoided.
