      products of genes at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels to provide a global
      view of molecular changes associated with drastic lifestyle modifications designed to reverse
      coronary heart disease (CHD). DNA variants and/or changes in gene and protein expression
      associated with CHD reversal may provide important clues to understanding molecular
      mechanisms of subclinical CHD development and progression.
