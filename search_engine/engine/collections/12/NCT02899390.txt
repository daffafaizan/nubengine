      developing diabetes in adults at risk of the Yaqui tribe established in Hermosillo, through
      the loss of weight and physical activity, all these with an intensive lifestyle intervention
      program that provide them the benefits of a healthy nutrition and physical activity.

      The hypothesis is that a lifestyle intervention program addressed to adults in the Yaqui
      tribe, established in Hermosillo at risk of diabetes can significantly decrease the
      parameters of obesity in a period of 6 months and increase physical activity in the same time
      period.
