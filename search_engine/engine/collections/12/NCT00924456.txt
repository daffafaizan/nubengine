      was a randomized controlled trial of 296 university students randomly allocated to either the
      Transcendental MeditationÂ® program or wait-list control. At baseline and after three months
      posttest, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, psychological distress (total mood
      disturbance, anxiety, depression, anger/hostility) and coping ability (global constructive
      thinking) were measured.
