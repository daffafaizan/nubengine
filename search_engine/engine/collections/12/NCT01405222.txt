      sustained increase in the respiratory symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum volume and sputum
      purulence. Cough is one of the most commonly reported and key symptoms in COPD patients.
      Cough can also be a useful factor in finding patients at risk of progressive airflow
      obstruction and cough along with the breathlessness is the major cause of distress in
      patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD). There is limited literature looking
      into cough and COPD especially objective assessments.

      in clinical practice and in most clinical trials scoring systems ie quality of life
      questionnaires or visual analogue scores, have been used to measure COPD exacerbation
      severity, although these may give an indication of the perceived severity of the symptom,
      they are inherently subjective and may be influenced by other factors. Shortfalls have
      prompted the development of cough recorders as an objective measure of this symptom. With
      this in mind we propose recruit 30 subjects with non-infective exacerbations of COPD and
      monitor their cough frequency as an inpatient in acute exacerbation and for 45 days post
      hospital discharge in order to elucidate the natural history of cough during and after an
      exacerbation.
