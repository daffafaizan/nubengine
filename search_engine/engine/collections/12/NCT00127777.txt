    
      Primary Objective:

        -  Proof that a triple-therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a, ribavirin and amantadine sulphate)
           dispensed over a period of 50 weeks, improves the permanent virological efficacy by more
           than 10% as compared to a combination therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin,
           defined as negative HCV-RNA result obtained by a molecular verification method (e.g.
           Roche AmplicorTM HCV, v.2.0, sensitivity <50 IE/ml) 24 weeks after the end of the
           therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Verification of the initial virological efficacy up to week 12, defined as negative
           HCV-RNA test results by means of quantitative proof methods, e.g. Roche AmplicorTM HCV
           Monitor v.2.0 (sensitivity <600 IE/ml).

        -  Biochemical efficacy, defined by the serum GPT values 24 weeks after the end of the
           therapy.

        -  Virological efficacy, measured on the basis of the HCV-RNA values at the end of the
           therapy.

        -  Biochemical efficacy defined by the serum GPT values at the end of the therapy.
