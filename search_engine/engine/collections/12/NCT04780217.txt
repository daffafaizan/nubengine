      pembrolizumab. The Phase 1 portion of the study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A dose
      escalation of single agent T3011 and Part B dose escalation of T3011 in combination with
      pembrolizumab. The Phase 2a portion will evaluate T3011 in combination with pembrolizumab.
      The objectives of the Phase 1 are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses
      of T3011 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab, and to determine the dose(s) of T3011
      to be further examined. During Phase 2a, the safety and tolerability of T3011 in combination
      with pembrolizumab at the dose selected in Phase 1 Part B will be evaluated. The safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and viral shedding, immunogenicity, and clinical activity of T3011 will
      be evaluated. Pharmacodynamic markers related to T3011 exposure will be characterized.

      This study will enroll patients with pathologically confirmed locally recurrent or metastatic
      solid tumors (Phase 1 Part A and Part B) or patients with histologically and cytologically
      confirmed NSCLC that is recurrent or metastatic or histologically or cytologically diagnosed
      advanced solid tumors with metastasis in liver and/or lung (Phase 2a), who have relapsed, or
      are refractory to or are not considered medically suitable to receive standard of care (SOC)
      treatment. These patients represent a population with a high unmet need. Patients will be
      informed of available treatment options and, in consultation with the study Investigator,
      will decide whether or not to participate in the T3011 study.
