      Shanghai urban population. The 5000 participants in the intervention group will undergo a
      low-dose CT scan at baseline and one year later, and will be managed according to European
      volume-based protocol. The 5000 participants in the control group will undergo a low-dose CT
      scan according to the routine CT protocol and will be managed according to the clinical
      practice. Epidemiological data will be collected through questionnaires. In the fourth year
      from baseline, the diagnosis of the three diseases will be collected. The screening
      performance will be compared between volume-based and standard protocol for managing
      early-detected lung nodules. The effectiveness of quantitative measurement of CT imaging
      biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer, COPD and CVD will be evaluated.

      The detected lung nodules in the intervention group will be classified into three groups
      depending on nodule volume: < 100 mm3 (negative result), 100-300 mm3 (indeterminate result)
      and > 300 mm3 (positive result). In case of a negative result, a CT scan after one year is
      recommended. In case of an indeterminate result, a 3-month follow up CT is recommended at
      which VDT will be assessed. For short VDT (< 400 days), the screening result is positive.
      Long VDT (> 400 days) is considered a negative screening result. In case of a positive
      result, referral to a multidisciplinary team is recommended for further investigation. The
      detected nodules in the control group will be managed according to the recommended cut-off
      values of diameter from NCCN Clinical Practice Guideline in Oncology for Lung Cancer
      Screening.
