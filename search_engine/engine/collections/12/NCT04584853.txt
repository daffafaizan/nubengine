      endocrine therapy) for at least five years after surgery is very effective at reducing the
      risk of the cancer returning. However, for some women their cancer may eventually become
      resistant to these drugs. POETIC-A Registration part will identify those who have a higher
      risk of developing resistance to standard endocrine therapy (ET). 5000 - 6000 women diagnosed
      with early stage breast cancer and have not yet had surgery to remove the cancer will enter
      the Registration stage from 80 centres. Study doctors will use aromatase inhibitors (AIs), a
      type of ET, to treat the cancer for 2 weeks before surgery. A sample will be taken from the
      cancer during surgery and the study laboratory will measure a biological marker called Ki67.
      If the level of Ki67 does not drop after 2 weeks of AI treatment, the patient is likely to be
      less sensitive to endocrine therapy, and the study doctor will explore additional treatments
      after surgery in the POETIC-A Treatment part. Everyone who agrees to join the Treatment stage
      (2500 patients) will be randomly put into one of the 2 treatment groups; Group1: ET only; or
      Group2: ET plus a new drug called abemaciclib. The first aim of the Treatment stage is to
      confirm whether abemaciclib given in combination with ET is more effective than giving ET
      alone in preventing the cancer coming back. The study laboratory will perform a second test
      on the cancer sample, called an AIR-CIS test. This test aims to find out if particular groups
      of patients based on their tumour biology are more suitable for treatment with abemaciclib.
      Patients in Group 2 will receive ET plus abemaciclib for 2 years. Patients in both groups
      will have regular study visits during this period.
