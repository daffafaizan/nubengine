      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in older patients with poor-risk, de novo acute
           myeloid leukemia treated with VNP40101M as induction therapy followed by cytarabine as
           consolidation therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the probability of overall survival, leukemia-free survival, and
           progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 60 minutes on day 1 (course 1).
           Patients without evidence of disease progression who have responding but residual
           disease receive a second course of VNP40101M once between days 35-60. Patients achieving
           complete response or partial response after induction therapy proceed to consolidation
           therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Beginning between days 45-90, patients receive cytarabine IV
           continuously over 5 days (course 1). Patients may receive a second course of cytarabine
           at the discretion of the investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 85 patients will be accrued for this study.
