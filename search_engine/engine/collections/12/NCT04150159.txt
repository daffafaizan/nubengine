      (CHD) risk factors (body weight, body mass index (BMI), body composition, blood pressure,
      serum lipid levels and dysglycemia blood measurements), noninvasive cardiovascular testing
      for endothelial function, arterial stiffness of large and small arteries and autonomic
      function testing in adult subjects over a seven-month study period.
