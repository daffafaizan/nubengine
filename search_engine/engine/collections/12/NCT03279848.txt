      stratification tool to reveal profiles of functional outcomes of patients with stroke in
      inpatient rehabilitation.

      Design: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of the demographic, functional outcomes
      of patients with stroke in an inpatient rehabilitation centre. A total of 2,722 patients
      completed a stroke rehabilitation program from 2011 to 2015 were recruited. The patients were
      divided into seven groups according to their admission Modified Functional Ambulation
      Category (MFAC). The between-group difference in length of stay (LOS), functional outcomes at
      admission and discharge including Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (MRMI) and Modified
      Barthel Index (MBI) as well as MRMI gain, MRMI efficiency, MBI gain and MBI efficiency were
      analyzed.
