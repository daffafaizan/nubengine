      having an ICD implantation will be enrolled up to a total of 500 BrS patients.
      Echocardiography with cardiac deformation analysis, three-dimensional color-coded voltage,
      activation and duration electroanatomical maps before and after ajmaline (1mg/kg in 5
      minutes) wiil determine the site and the size of the arrhythmogenic substrate as
      characterized by abnormally prolonged fragmented ventricular potentials and potential wall
      motion abnormalities. Primary endpoint will be identification and elimination of this
      electrophysiological substrate by RF applications leading to ECG pattern normalization and
      VT/VF non-inducibility before and after ajmaline. Patients will be followed up to 10 years
      after ablation by sequential 12-lead ECG and Holter recording, Echocardiography, ICD
      interrogation, VT/VF inducibility patterns before and after ajmaline test.
