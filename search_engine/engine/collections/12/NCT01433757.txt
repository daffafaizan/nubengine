    
      This is a double-blinded and randomized drug study: neither the patient nor the investigator
      know if patients are taking study drug (Ampicillin) or placebo.

      Three study visits will include neurological exams, review of medical history, genetic test
      results and video-taped BFM-DRS motor scales. Patients will receive medication during
      baseline visit, consisting of either Ampicillin drug or placebo, which will be consumed twice
      daily for 28 days. Following a washout period (no drugs) of 7 days, patient will return to
      clinic for second study visit and receive second set of medication (placebo -vs- Ampicillin).
      Medication will be consumed twice daily for 28 days, with patient returning to clinic after a
      washout period of 7 days for final study visit in clinic.
