      under five in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to limited access to health services in many developing
      countries, a number of global health organizations, including the World Health Organization,
      have strongly advocated the use of community health workers (CHWs) to deliver basic health
      care in the community and to facilitate referral to primary health facilities.

      Existing supported CHWs in the study area will be trained in the assessment and
      classification of children between six months and five years of age presenting with fever
      and/or cough/difficult breathing. In the intervention arm, CHWs will be supplied with rapid
      diagnostic tests (RDTs), Coartem (a fixed dose combination of artemether-lumefantrine) and
      amoxicillin. The intervention CHWs will be trained to use RDTs in patients with reported
      fever and provide those with a positive result with Coartem; and patients suspected of
      pneumonia (based on fast breathing) will be treated with amoxicillin as per the standard of
      care at health facilities and monitored. In the control arm, no RDT will be performed. The
      CHWs will be supplied with Coartem to treat malaria/febrile illness as per the integrated
      management of childhood illnesses (IMCI) guidelines and patients suspected of pneumonia will
      be referred to the health facility for treatment as per the current practice. Data collectors
      will routinely visit CHWs to collect data on their consultations and follow-up patients
      treated by CHWs in their homes..
