      for chronic subdural hematoma in addition to standard treatments, which include close
      observation and surgical evacuation. Middle meningeal artery embolization has emerged
      recently as a minimally invasive and successful method of preventing re-accumulation of
      subdural hematoma, particularly for patients that are not obvious surgical candidates or
      those with recurrent or refractory hematomas. The outcomes of these two groups of patients
      who undergo middle meningeal artery embolization will be compared to matched historical
      controls.

      Middle meningeal artery embolization is a minimally invasive angiography procedure completed
      with use of fluoroscopy. Access is obtained through the femoral or radial artery and a
      catheter is advanced to the MMA. Polyvinyl alcohol particles are then injected to seal off
      this portion of the artery and prevent any further blood flow into the subdural hematoma.
      Hemostasis is obtained at the access site and the patient is observed for 24-48 hours on a
      neurological care unit before discharge.

      A head CT, NIHSS, and modified Rankin Score will be repeated on the following schedule: â€¢
      Pre-Procedure

        -  24 hours post procedure

        -  7-10 days post procedure

        -  30 days post procedure

        -  90 days post procedure

      Patients with chronic subdural hematoma undergo CT scans and neurologic assessments on
      hospital admission, as well as follow up CT scans and neurologic assessments to assess for
      any change in neurologic status or hematoma size. This study utilizes a standard of care
      follow up schedule to avoid exposing participants to extra radiation. Participants will be
      followed for study related purposes for 90 days.
