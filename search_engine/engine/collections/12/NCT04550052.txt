      condition is associated with significant costs. In addition, about 24% of the patients
      discharged with a primary diagnosis of HF are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days,
      representing a significant public health burden. While there have been efforts to predict and
      reduce 30-day hospital readmission initiated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services (CMS), no studies utilized daily physiologic data from wearables to identify at-risk
      patients.

      The overall goal of this proposed pilot feasibility study is to utilize the Spire Health Tags
      in a heart failure patient population to ascertain the feasibility of capturing appropriate
      signals of respiration, pulse rate, activity, sleep patterns, and stress levels
      (calm/focused/tense during the day) for > 80% of the time in patients following HF
      hospitalization for a 30-day period. The investigators will do exploratory analysis of the
      changes in these physiologic variables during a 30-day period following HF hospitalization to
      identify risk markers that could predict 30-day readmission.
