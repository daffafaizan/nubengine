      I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with hepatobiliary cancer treated with
      BMS-247550.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the duration of
      response, median and overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression
