      of cancers have been well documented. This study builds on previous work in St. Louis to
      overcome barriers to access to breast screening, identifying and addressing factors
      associated with access to care once diagnosed, and factors contributing to delay in diagnosis
      and completion of therapy. African American breast cancer patients randomly assigned to the
      intervention arm of the trial will have access to the Survivor Stories Tablet, a tablet
      computer, on which they will browse an archive of 1-3 minute videotaped survivor stories
      about five topics: coping, relationships, experiences with the health care system, follow-up
      care, and quality of life (QOL) living with breast cancer. Patients will have the tablet for
      two weeks after enrollment in the study, and again at 6 and 12 months. Patients in the
      control arm will receive usual care.
