      infection in organ dysfunction aggravation. Maintenance of immune homeostasis of septic
      patients through immunotherapy is the key breakthrough to improve success rate.
      Antigen-presenting cell (APC) is the bridge that connects the innate and adaptive immunity.
      Decrease of count and function of APC has been shown to be associated with worsened clinical
      outcomes in patients with sepsis. Gamma-delta T cells (γδ T cells) are the newly identified
      population of T lymphocytes. Recent studies have found that γδ T cells possess unique and
      powerful antigen-presenting function, making them the hot topic in infection and cancer
      research. Based on the results, the investigator plan to evaluate the antigen-presenting
      function changes of γδ T cells in septic status by analyzing the antigen-presenting related
      molecules on γδ T cells, antigen protein uptake ability, and their function on the
      proliferation and activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the investigator will
      explore the mechanism and signal pathways for the APC function changes of γδ T cells.
      Findings from this research could help explain the mechanism of sepsis induced immune
      dysfunction, enrich our understanding of the important role of γδ T cells, and build a good
      foundation for immunotherapy in sepsis.
