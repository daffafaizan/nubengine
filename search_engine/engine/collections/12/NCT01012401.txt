      anti-cancer therapies. A lung cancer diagnosis often inflicts fear, despair, and hopelessness
      on patients and loved ones. For lung cancer patients in particular, a population where
      palliation rather than cure is often the focus, interventions addressing communication about
      various types of suffering are crucial to quality of life (QOL). Our Center has done
      extensive research testing CHESS (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System), a
      non-commercial, web-based information and support system. The recent Clinician Integration
      Project tested the impact of CHESS versus an Internet only Control group on QOL for
      caregivers of advanced stage lung cancer patients. This study yielded an unanticipated
      finding that CHESS may have a survival benefit for patients as one year survival was
      significantly increased in the CHESS group (50%) compared to Internet (34.2%). As this
      project did not focus on patient outcomes, follow-up with a well-formulated study designed
      and powered to address specific hypotheses of the nature of this effect is critical. The
      proposed study will specifically test QOL and survival effects of CHESS on lung cancer
      patients. Using sites in Wisconsin, Connecticut,Houston, and Chicago, we will randomly assign
      376 advanced lung cancer patients to two study arms: a patient control group receiving Usual
      Care (including access to a computer and Internet) and a group given access to the CHESS
      website. Patients may invite a caregiver to participate. Patients will be followed for 18
      months or until patient death.
