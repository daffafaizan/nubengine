      permeability and endotoxin release that stimulates the Systemic Inflammatory Response that is
      responsible for subsequent death and disability after resuscitation.

      Hypothesis 2: Different degrees of systemic endotoxin activity variably affect Basic
      Metabolic Rate during Therapeutic Hypothermia

      Serial samples of blood, stool and expired gas will be measured at predetermined timepoints
      after ROSC from cardiac arrest.
