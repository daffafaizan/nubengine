      controls. Nineteen NAION patients received 500 mg/day of OS-Citicoline for a 6-months period
      followed by 3-months of wash-out (NC Group); 17 NAION patients were not treated (NN Group)
      from baseline up to 9 months. We assessed in all subjects at baseline, at 6 and 9-months of
      follow-up: Visual acuity (VA), Pattern Electroretinogram (PERG), Visual Evoked Potentials
      (VEP), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL-T) and Humphrey 24-2 visual field mean
      deviation (HFA MD). Mean differences were statistically evaluated by ANOVA between Groups,
      and correlations were verified by Pearson's test.
