      atherosclerosis, often suffer symptoms of intermittent claudication that impair their walking
      ability and adversely affect their quality of life. People with PAD are also at increased
      risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke and death.
      Unfortunately, medical therapies directed to the functional and limb-threatening
      manifestations are limited. Little attention has been paid to the biologic processes that
      cause PAD, and to atherogenic mechanisms that may preferentially affect the peripheral
      circulation.

      Vascular inflammation and insulin resistance are two important and interdependent conditions
      that are associated with atherosclerosis. Subjects in this trial (160 adults with stable
      intermittent claudication who are not taking insulin or insulin-sensitizing medications, such
      as thiazolidinediones) will be randomized in a placebo-controlled, parallel design manner, to
      atorvastatin 80 mg orally daily (to reduce inflammation) and pioglitazone 45 mg orally once
      daily (to improve insulin sensitivity). Forty healthy adult subjects, age and gender-matched
      to a subset of the study group, will be enrolled to serve as a control population. Primary
      and secondary study endpoints include: treadmill walking time, endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation, and insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose uptake.
