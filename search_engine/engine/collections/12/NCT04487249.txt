      exotropia (IXT). The effectiveness of VT as a treatment modality for children with IXT is
      unknown because previous studies have largely limited observational or retrospective case
      series without comparison groups. The objective of this multi-centered pilot randomized trial
      of VT for IXT compared to observation is to 1) determine the short-term effectiveness of VT
      on distance intermittent exotropia and 2) determine the feasibility of recruitment and
      retention of children aged 8 to 16 years old with IXT to participate in a randomized trial of
      20 weeks of in-office VT. The results of this trial will provide the needed information to
      plan and conduct a large-scale randomized trial to determine short-term and long-term
      effectiveness of VT for IXT in children, with the full-scale randomized trial helping to fill
      in the gaps in scientific knowledge concerning VT as a treatment for IXT.
