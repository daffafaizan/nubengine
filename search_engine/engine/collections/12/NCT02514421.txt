    
      This is a phase I dose escalation trial using a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme to evaluate the
      maximum tolerated field strength dose of administered irreversible electroporation in
      combination with chemotherapy. During the first cycle of chemotherapy, patients will receive
      electroporation of the primary pancreatic tumor prior to administration of chemotherapy with
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The schedule of administration of gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel will be administered as per standard of care. The investigators will use
      non-invasive dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect
      and describe changes within the tumor. Safety will be determined by assessing the number of
      class three or higher toxicity events in cohorts of 6 patients at progressively higher
      electroporation voltages. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as one voltage
      level less than the voltage at which two or more patients out of six total patients have a
      class three or higher toxicity event.
