    
      Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem. Worldwide, it is
      estimated that 2 billion people have been infected previously and 350 million are chronically
      infected. While acute HBV infection is associated with significant illness, the risk of
      chronic infection is of great importance since 5-10% of infected adults will not clear the
      infection after the initial phase of the illness. About 25% of people who do not initially
      clear the infection will later develop chronic active hepatitis.

      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HEPLISAV™ when administered to
      adults who have end-stage renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≤ 45 mL/min). Once
      subjects have been consented, screened, and randomized to treatment, subjects will receive a
      total of three injections over a 24-week period, with follow-up visits at 28 and 50 weeks.
      Subjects will receive 1 of the following 2 regimens:

        -  HEPLISAV™ single dose at Day 0, 4 weeks (1 month) and 24 weeks (6 months)

        -  HEPLISAV™ double dose at Day 0, 4 weeks (1 month) and 24 weeks (6 months)

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by occurrence of adverse events, periodic
      laboratory tests, vital signs, and local and systemic reactogenicity.

      Immunogenicity will be evaluated by the proportion of subjects exhibiting a seroprotective
      immune response (anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies [anti-HBsAg] ≥ 10
      milli-international unit (mIU)/mL) at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 28 and 50.
