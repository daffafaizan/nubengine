      with a sodium-channel blocker (lacosamide) in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain with
      and without the irritable nociceptor phenotype. As this is a mechanistic study, the main
      purpose is to compare the change in pain intensity in patients who receive an expected
      sufficiently effective dose of lacosamide. As supportive evidence for a drug-specific
      predictive biomarker, the purpose is also to compare the change in pain intensity during
      lacosamide vs. placebo for the two phenotypes.

      We hypothesize that the sodium-channel blocker lacosamide will be more effective in patients
      with the irritable nociceptor than those without the non-irritable nociceptor phenotype, and
      that lacosamide is more effective than placebo in patients with the irritable nociceptor
      phenotype.
