      and hysteroscopy Database's registration chart. Consequently, validity of these codes needs
      to be ensured to enable their use in further research.

      Thereafter, the prevalence of Danish gynecologists' use of the different suspension methods
      will be investigated. A questionnaire will elucidate a possible relation between the
      suspension methods and pain, life quality and sexuality. Through a register based study in
      the National Patient Register the association between suspension methods and post
      hysterectomy POP and possible confounding will be investigated.
