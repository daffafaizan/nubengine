      (called pacing) through the wires to both the left and right lower chambers of your heart at
      (or near) the same time. This helps the heart pump in a more coordinated way and send more
      blood to your body with each beat. How much energy is used for pacing is called the stimulus
      intensity. Increasing the pacing stimulus intensity of the left ventricular wire can lead to
      an increase in the volume of heart muscle directly stimulated. This has previously been shown
      to produce beneficial effects on the heart function, like strength of contraction and
      increased volume of blood pumped. The purpose of this study is to determine if pacing the
      wires in the left ventricular chamber of the heart using higher stimulus intensity improves
      the strength of the heart's contraction.
