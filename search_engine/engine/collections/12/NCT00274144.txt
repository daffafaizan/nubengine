    
      Methodology:

      Randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group design

      Planned/actual number of subjects:

      Enrolled: 40/50 randomised: 40/42 completed: 40/42

      Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

      Treated essential hypertension with a mean seated DBP/SBP smaller than 95 mmHg/160 mmHg,
      coronary artery disease confirmed by catheterization and age equal or greater than 18 years
      of age.

      Duration of treatment:

      12 weeks: telmisartan 40 mg or placebo 40 mg

      Study Hypothesis:

      The statistical null hypothesis is that in patients with CAD and mild-to-moderate
      hypertension, a 84-day therapy with 40 mg telmisartan causes changes in inflammatory and
      leukocyte adhesion parameters. The alternative hypothesis is that this therapy does not
      influence inflammatory and leukocyte adhesion parameters. This hypothesis is tested by the
      nonparametric Wilcoxon test for unpaired samples.

      Comparison(s):

      Placebo 40 mg
