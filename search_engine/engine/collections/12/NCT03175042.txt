      screened for anemia using blood draw for CBC during the first prenatal visit. Those who are
      found to have anemia will be prospectively enrolled in this proof-of-concept study. Anemia
      will be defined according to the CDC guidelines (first and third trimesters hemoglobin level
      less than 11g/dL, and less than 10.5g/dL in the second trimester). Patients meeting these
      criteria will be approached for inclusion. If patients consent to participate, they will have
      their hemoglobin checked via the non-invasive monitor at the same time as their clinically
      indicated CBC testing. At the UT Medical Branch outpatient obstetric clinic, this is usually
      every 3-4 weeks and determined by the health care provider. The hemoglobin measured by the
      non-invasive monitor will be compared with the hemoglobin obtained via the complete blood
      count. Other data collected from the patient's medical record will include general
      characteristics such as demographics, medical history and hemoglobin levels obtained from
      blood draw.
