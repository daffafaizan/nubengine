      (including bifurcations) were screened by ultrasound in patients who came for a check-up to a
      primary care practice with no known cardiovascular disease and low risk for stroke and heart
      attack according to the AGLA/GSLA risk score which is mostly used in Switzerland.

      All patients agreed and gave written informed consent to be included in this study. Presence
      of plaques was defined as a focal carotid intima-media thickness >0.5 cm on ultrasound.
      Screening was performed by a medical doctor (DP) certified for the procedure using the
      following ultrasound system: Toshiba Nemio XG, probe 7.5 MhZ.
