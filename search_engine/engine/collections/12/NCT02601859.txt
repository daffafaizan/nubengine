      therapeutic benefits are through the inhibition of the enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3
      (GSK-3). GSK3 activity is associated with the development of several aspects of AD and thus
      lithium can regulate an enzyme linked to AD development. As an important step towards
      designing a clinical trial to investigate the potential of lithium for AD prevention the
      investigators propose to establish the minimum dose of lithium needed to block GSK3 in people
      with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a high-risk condition for progression to AD. The study
      will establish whether GSK3 activity is altered in MCI and monitor lithium regulation of GSK3
      biomarkers in this population. At the same time the study will investigate how GSK3 measured
      in blood relates to GSK3 activity in the brain in a small animal study. In further
      preparation for a future large scale trial, this pilot study will generate technical data to
      develop the technique of using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) as a biomarker to detect
      the earliest brain changes of AD.

      Recruitment will be shared between the two sites for this study, Dundee and Oxford. The study
      will involve 12 patients with MCI and 12 controls, who will be asked for two sets of blood
      tests, and 20 patients with MCI who consent to take Lithium who will be asked for blood tests
      at regular intervals. For all participants the study period is 12 weeks.
