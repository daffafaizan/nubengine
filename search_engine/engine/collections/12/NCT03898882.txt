      arterial and venous blood, after oxytocin administration at cesarean delivery, in order to
      assess the validity of venous samples. They will also measure oxytocinase to explore how
      levels vary around the time of delivery of the placenta and to assess the effect that this
      may have on the metabolism of oxytocin.
