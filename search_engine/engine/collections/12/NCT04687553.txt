      disorders of consciousness. The Simplified Evaluation of CONsciousness Disorders is a useful
      tool to assess consciousness of DOC patients in bedside. The aim of this study was to
      translate the SECONDs from English into Chinese and determine the validity of this Chinese
      version. To test internal reliability and inter-rater reliability, both rater A and rater B
      assess the perception of pain on day 1; and to obtain test-retest reliability, rater A
      assessed all patients repeatedly on day 2.
