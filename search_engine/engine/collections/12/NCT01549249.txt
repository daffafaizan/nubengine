      vitrectomy with membrane peeling has become the standard treatment for epiretinal membrane.
      However, visual recovery or symptomatic relief is not always satisfactory in all eyes despite
      successful membrane removal. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a
      non-invasive imaging device for various vitreoretinal diseases. Cone outer segment tips
      (COST) line is a line observed between IS/OS line and RPE in SD-OCT. The investigators
      examined the correlation of visual acuity and the recovery of photoreceptor layer after ERM
      surgery, taking COST line into account as a new parameter
