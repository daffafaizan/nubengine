      blinded, but the person questioning the patient post-op to determine success rate will be
      blinded. There will be two randomized groups of patients: control and test. The control group
      will receive the procedure with traditional methods and equipment currently in use at Cooper
      University. The test group will receive the same procedure utilizing existing ultrasound
      equipment with the supplemental CAIG system.
