      I. Determine the antitumor activity of irofulven in patients with persistent or recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed at approximately 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within at
      least 6 months.
