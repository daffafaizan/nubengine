      eicosahexanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contained in fish oil may have
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. The aim of the present work was
      to evaluate the efficacy of fish oil supplementation on serum proinflammatory cytokines
      levels, oxidative stress markers and disease progression in MS. 50 patients with
      relapsing-remitting MS were enrolled. The experimental group received orally 4 g/day of fish
      oil for 12 months. The primary outcome was serum TNFα levels; Secondary outcomes were IL-1β,
      IL-6, nitric oxide catabolites, lipoperoxides, progression on the expanded disability status
      scale (EDSS) and annualized relapses rate (ARR).
