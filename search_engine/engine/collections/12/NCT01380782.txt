    
      This is a two arm, multicenter, open label phase II trial in adult patients with recurrent
      supratentorial high-grade glioma. One arm (the "bevacizumab naïve" arm) will enroll patients
      who have not received prior bevacizumab therapy, and the other arm (the "post-bevacizumab"
      arm) will enroll patients who have experienced progression on bevacizumab.

      All subjects will receive BIBF 1120 at 200mg orally, twice daily in cycles of 28 days.
      Subjects will come to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle (or within 2 days prior) for blood
      and urine tests and a physical and neurologic exam. Bloods will also be checked within 2 days
      before or after Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. An additional blood sample will be taken on Days 1
      and 8 of Cycle 1, at the start of every even-numbered cycle, and at the end of active study
      treatment. Subjects will have gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI scans performed with tumor
      measurements at screening, at the start of even-numbered cycles, and at the end of active
      study treatment(unless already obtained within 4 weeks of completing study treatment). 40
      study subjects will have diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI at baseline, after 1 week on
      therapy (± 2 days), within 2 days prior to the start of every even-numbered cycle, and at the
      end of treatment (unless already obtained within 4 weeks of completing study treatment).
