      large number of patients who suffer from FGIDs may not be able to fully understand their
      diagnosis, especially when they were told that they had no organic disease and their symptoms
      had a psychosomatic origin rather than a gastrointestinal one. Moreover, subjects with FGIDs
      have concerns and negative perceptions about medications, particularly in the presence of
      psychiatric comorbidity. Fearing of being labeled as insane or incapability, many patients
      with psychosomatic symptoms choose to conceal their illness to family, colleagues and
      doctors. These factors may affect willingness to initiate neuromodulator regimens and
      treatment adherence.
