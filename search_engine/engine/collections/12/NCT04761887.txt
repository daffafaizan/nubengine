      administered at approximately 4°C) or room temperature ropivacaine, administered at
      approximately 20-25°C), during an ultrasound-guided TAP block. Time to anesthesia, or loss of
      sensation, will be recorded for each subject by a single evaluator, employing the pinch
      technique and thermosensory perception, using a glove, filled with a slurry of ice water
      placed on both anesthetized and non-anesthetized areas, for approximately 5 seconds. Time to
      anesthesia will be recorded when there is a definitive difference on a categorical scale
      (painful/not painful or cold/not cold) as measured by the subject, between the anesthetized
      and non-anesthetized areas. Safety outcomes and opioid morphine equivalency will be recorded
      for all subjects, for approximately 48 hours following surgery.
