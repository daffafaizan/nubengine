      underwent any kind of elective cardiac surgery in our university cardiovascular centre
      between 07.01.2018 and 30.06.2020. The database contains descriptive parameters, history of
      past illnesses, recent medication. The investigators record the type of surgery, the list of
      contributory physicians, the length of the surgery and the data of the anaesthesiological
      report. After the surgery the researchers want to record the postoperative parameters on the
      ICU ( infusion - fluid balance, blood transfusion, bleeding, main hemodynamic parameters,
      length of mechanical ventilation,main parameters of arterial blood gas analysis). Moreover th
      investigators want to collect psychosocial tests (Beck Depression Inventory, State Anxiety
      Scale, Trait Anxiety Scale and EQ-5D for the measurement of quality of life) to get more
      information from the postoperative condition of the patients.
