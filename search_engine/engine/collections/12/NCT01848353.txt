      per week for 48 weeks. Clinical and physical assessments will be performed at baseline and
      after 16, 32 and 48 weeks. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups. Each group
      will receive payment for exercise sessions completed but one group will be on a fixed
      schedule of compensation and the other will have a schedule that incentivizes frequency or
      duration of exercise. In addition, two reference groups of age-matched participants who are
      normal weight and subclassified as having either low or high levels of physical activity and
      fitness will be tested. The reference groups will complete baseline tests and will not enter
      the exercise intervention program.
