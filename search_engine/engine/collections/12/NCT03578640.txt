      the development of direct-acting antivirals "DAAs." Since 2013, many DAAs have been approved
      for the treatment of HCV with excellent efficacy and safety profiles. The major hurdle in
      treating patients on a large scale is the high cost of the current treatment regimens.
      Multiple approaches have been proposed, among them, a shortened treatment regimen of 6 to 8
      weeks rather than the standard 12-week-regimen. The strategy of shortening the treatment will
      help in reducing the cost by 33% to 50%. Thus, it will increase the availability of the
      treatment to more patients.

      Zepatier is a combination drug of Elbasvir (EBR), an NS5A inhibitor, and Grazoprevir (GZR), a
      potent NS3/4A inhibitor. This study is being proposed to address two main issues. First,
      collecting information on the safety and efficacy of a shortened course of zepatier (8 weeks
      instead of the standard 12 weeks) in patients who are treatment-na√Øve, non-cirrhotic and
      mono-infected with HCV. Second, to investigate whether this course provides similar clinical
      outcomes to the standard regimen in HCV-Genotype 4, which is the most common genotype in
      Saudi Arabia.
