      error test for their cervical spine, and also have their balance tested through a Neurocom
      Balancemaster. Following these pre-intervention measures, they will receive in a random
      order, either a cervical spine manipulation (CSM) or a sham manipulation, and then have tests
      repeated to analyze for changes and differences between interventions.
