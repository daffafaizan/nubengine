      participate in the study. At this point the investigators will also gather baseline data
      through questionnaires on self-reported adherence (MARS-5) and quality of life (EQ-5D). The
      participants are randomized to the different study arms according to a stratified procedure
      based on their cognitive function.

      The intervention group will have their charts reviewed every second week and be contacted by
      the clinical pharmacist through phone within 7 and after 30 and 60 days respectively to
      discuss their medications. If possible drug-related problems are suspected during the
      interviews that cannot be solved immediately, the physician is contacted.

      Both groups have a follow-up time of 30 and 180 days. After 30 and 180 days, the patients
      will once again report adherence and quality of life. All other data can be gathered from the
      medical charts.
