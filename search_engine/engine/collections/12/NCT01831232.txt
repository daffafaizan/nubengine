      I. To assess the rate of achieving a "good complete response (CR)" after treating patients
      with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with idarubicin, cytarabine and pravastatin
      (pravastatin sodium) (IAP).

      II. To determine the toxicity (death within 28 days of starting therapy = treatment related
      mortality or "TRM") with IAP in newly-diagnosed AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), remission with incomplete blood count
      recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), relapse-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To identify biomarkers (ie. changes in serum cholesterol) associated with clinical
      responses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pravastatin sodium orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-8, idarubicin
      intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on days 4-6, and cytarabine IV continuously on days
      4-7. Treatment repeats every 28-56 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
