    
      Hypotheses:

      We hypothesize that COPD patients with corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia experience higher
      morbidity (infections, ventilator associated pneumonia, length of stay, acute renal failure)
      and mortality compared to COPD patients with normal glucose levels.

      Specific Aim:

      To determine the impact of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia on clinical outcome (length
      of stay, disposition, APACHE score, need for ventilatory support and ICU admission,
      mortality) in patients with COPD exacerbation.
