    
      Managing Type 1 Diabetes requires daily checks of blood glucose and medication adjustments.
      Children and adolescents are known to have more difficulty with this than adults.
      Parents/legal guardians also face the task of helping with this self-management. A weekly
      text message regarding Type 1 Diabetes, sent to the parent or the parent and adolescent, may
      help to remind and motivate an individual to perform the daily tasks needed to manage their
      Type 1 Diabetes.
