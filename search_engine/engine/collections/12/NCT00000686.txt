      the best results to date. Toxic effects in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving AZT
      may limit its usefulness for prolonged treatment. Long-term treatment may be necessary to
      prevent progression of early stage HIV infection to AIDS and to prevent secondary
      transmission. Other drugs that may be equally or more effective than AZT and useful in the
      long- term treatment of HIV infection must be developed and evaluated. Test-tube and animal
      studies of d4T show that the drug can inhibit replication (reproduction) of HIV at
      concentrations similar to concentrations of AZT that have anti-HIV activity. These studies
      also indicate that the drug may stay in the bloodstream longer than AZT. Thus, it may be
      possible for the drug to be as effective as AZT when taken less frequently than AZT. It also
      may have a less disturbing effect on other body functions (such as thymidine metabolism).

      Five patients are enrolled at each dose level and receive d4T for 10 weeks at their initial
      dose level. Escalation to the next higher dose level, using a different group of five
      patients, occurs after three patients in the preceding group have successfully completed at
      least 3 weeks of oral dosing.
