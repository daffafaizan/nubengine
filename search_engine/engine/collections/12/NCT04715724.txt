      maternal-child care providers. No study has evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used baby
      dolls for teaching this skill. In this comparison study, clinical lactation specialists will
      be randomly assigned two baby dolls to evaluate in two back-to-back video-based simulations
      (telesimulations) with a standardized patient wearing the LiquidGoldConcept Lactation
      Simulation Model. Participants will complete a novel competency assessment using 3-second
      video clips to show specific components of positioning and attachment and evaluating whether
      any correction is needed and why or why not.
