    
      This is a randomized case-control trial. A total of 149 HBV carriers with inadequate vitamin
      D (< 30 ng/mL) level were enrolled. They were randomly divided to two groups: one group
      receiving vitamin D supplement (1600 IU/day) for 2 months and another group as controls. The
      serum vitamin D, HBV DNA and qHBsAg levels were measured at baseline and after vitamin D
      supplement. Whether HBV DNA and qHBsAg have significant change after vitamin D supplement can
      be determined.
