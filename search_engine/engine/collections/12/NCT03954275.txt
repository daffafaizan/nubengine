      critically ill population. Analysis will be conducted retrospectively on a multi-center
      database collected by the M@tric research group. M@tric collects data from all intensive care
      units (surgical, medical, cardiac) in 3 Belgian University Hospitals (Leuven, Ghent,
      Antwerp).

      Anonymised admission, demographic, clinical and laboratory data collected from 2013 until the
      present will be retrieved from the M@tric database. These data will then be coded and
      analysed in R statistical software. ARC will be defined based on a 24h creatinine clearance
      (CrCl24h) >=130ml/min/1.73mÂ².

      Epidemiology and risk factors for ARC will be studied in order to confirm and clarify past
      studies which have mostly been done in rather small and specific subsets of patients. A
      predictive algorithm for ARC will be trained and subsequently validated for use in clinical
      practice. Moreover this algorithm will be compared to existing scoring systems, which have
      not yet found their way into clinical practice. This algorithm will provide the ability to
      anticipate ARC on the intensive care unit. Also use of formulae estimating renal function
      will be evaluated in this population. These estimators will be compared to the CrCl24h, which
      is considered the golden standard in clinical practice. A cutoff for the best estimating
      formula in order to detect ARC will be calculated. Finally the impact of ARC on serum levels
      of hydrophilic molecules likes vancomycine and aminoglycosides will be studied. As this
      research follows a retrospective design these levels will be used a surrogate marker for
      clinical impact. This will potentially point out some opportunities for future research on
      the clinical impact of ARC.
