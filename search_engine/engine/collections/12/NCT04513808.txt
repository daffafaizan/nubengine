      esophageal cancer surgery is longer in patients randomized to propofol-based total
      intravenous anesthesia than to volatile sevoflurane anesthesia.

      The investigators will test the secondary hypotheses that propofol-based total intravenous
      anesthesia: 1) speeds discharge from the ICU; 2) speeds discharge from the hospital; and, 3)
      improves the quality of recovery, as assessed by QoR-15 on postoperative day 2.
