      that immune repertoire sequencing (IR-Seq) may help elucidate the dynamic changes of immune
      repertoire (IR) in autoimmune disease states. To further explore the potential application
      value of this technology, we will conduct a series of prospective studies to investigate the
      role of IR-Seq in the diagnosis and disease monitoring in patients with IgA nephropathy.
