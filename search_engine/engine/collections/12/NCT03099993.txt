    
      Quantitative and objective evaluation of upper limb movements will take place in a motion
      analysis laboratory and will take place as follow:

        -  A clinical exam of the participant will be performed by the physician to collect maximal
           passive joint amplitudes with a goniometer and anatomical measures (length,
           circumference) of the upper limb.

        -  The participant will be equipped with surface electromyographic electrodes to measure
           the activation of his superficial muscles, and with retroreflective markers placed on
           anatomical landmarks of his thorax, shoulder, and arm, to measure upper limb kinematics
           with a 3D motion capture system composed of 8 VICON cameras.

        -  Maximal forces of elbow pronosupination and flexion-extension will be measured with a
           portable dynamometer.

        -  The participant will be placed on a height adjustable bench, in the center of the
           laboratory. He will be asked to perform upper limb movements:

             -  A few movements not measured, to familiarize with the equipment;

             -  Recorded movements: a trial is composed of a few consecutive cycles of a movement
                such as elbow flexion-extension. A trial usually last about 10seconds. A few
                seconds-time of rest is imposed between each trial. The required movements are the
                following: elbow flexion-extension, elbow pronosupination, and "hand to mouth".

        -  Finally, the participant will be asked to lie down on an exam table and to rest relax,
           in order to measure the electromyographic signal of his muscles at rest.

      Duration of the protocol is about 1h30, with less than 30seconds of effort, and a few minutes
      of performing simple upper limb movements.
