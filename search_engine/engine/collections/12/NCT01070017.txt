      improve adherence and clinical outcomes among impoverished individuals starting HAART in
      resource-poor settings. Furthermore, the utilization of community health workers may build
      social capital. This is cluster-randomized trial, with randomization at the level of health
      centers. Individuals in both intervention and control clusters will receive community-based
      adherence support (monthly adherence visits) and standard care. In addition, individuals
      residing in intervention clusters will receive 12 months of community-based DOT-HAART. We
      will enroll patients as well as community members (health providers, treatment supporters,
      and community health workers) to assess individual and community-level outcomes.
