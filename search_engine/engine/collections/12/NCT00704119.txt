    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, monocentric Phase I study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic profile of single-dosed and repeat-dosed RhuDex® using a tablet formulation
      as well as to assess the effect of food and the effect with co-administration of a proton
      pump inhibitor on the bioavailability of RhuDex®.

      12 healthy male subjects will receive study medication in 8 different treatment periods in 4
      subsequent steps A, B, C and D.

      Within steps A and B, the subjects will receive different treatments (4 in A and 2 in B),
      sequentially. There will be a wash-out period of at least 4 days between each of the 8
      different treatments/treatment periods of steps A, B, C and D.

      In Step A, each subject will receive increasing doses of RhuDex® in 4 subsequent treatments.
      In Step B, each subject will receive 2 different doses of RhuDex® preceded by pantoprazole
      intake, in 2 subsequent treatments, and in Step C the RhuDex® dosing will be preceded by a
      standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal. In Step D, RhuDex® will be administered twice daily
      for 7 days.

      For assessing the pharmacokinetic profile of RhuDex® in steps A, B and C, blood samples will
      be collected prior to and at different intervals after RhuDex® administration. In step D,
      blood samples will be collected on Days 1, 2, 4 and 7. Cmin, Cmax, tmax, t½ term, CL/F,
      AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞) of RhuDex® will be analyzed.

      Safety will be evaluated by regular observation and documentation of AEs, vital signs,
      physical examination, ECG, and laboratory parameters.
