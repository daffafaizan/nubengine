      accompanied by significant advances in treatment and improvements in prognosis, substance use
      disorder remains highly stigmatized throughout the world. Previous studies suggest that
      portraying alcohol use disorder as treatable can reduce negative attitudes toward persons
      with alcohol use disorder. This randomized controlled trial compares the effects of exposing
      study participants to vignettes portraying persons with untreated and symptomatic alcohol use
      disorder vs. treated alcohol use disorder with complete response vs. treated alcohol use
      disorder with relapse, with and without adverse economic impacts. It is hypothesized, based
      on prior work, that study participants exposed to vignettes depicting treated alcohol use
      disorder with completed response would have the greatest effect on reducing negative
      attitudes toward persons with alcohol use disorder, followed by treated alcohol use disorder
      with relapse and untreated and symptomatic alcohol use disorder, and that adverse economic
      impacts will exacerbate negative attitudes toward persons with alcohol use disorder.
