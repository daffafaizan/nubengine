      be screened to ascertain their suitability for the study according to the patient selection
      criteria (Section 4). Based on clinician assessment, patients will be assigned to receive
      either FOQUEST or VYVANSE. Patients will be titrated to their optimal dose of ADHD medication
      based on Investigator judgement. At monthly visits, patients will have their ADHD
      symptomatology evaluated by the Investigator (ADHD-Rating Scale-DSM 5 Version [ADHD-RS-5])
      and will complete questionnaires on functional outcomes (Weiss Functional Impairment Ratings
      Scale - Parent [WFIRS-P] or Weiss Functional Impairment Ratings Scale - Self [WFIRS-Self]),
      morning and evening behaviours (Daily Parent Rating of Evening and Morning Behaviours -
      Revised [DPREMB-R] or Adult ADHD Quality of Life Rating Scale - Revised [AAQoL-R]) and
      Patient Sleep & Satisfaction survey (PSS). Safety will be evaluated through non-directed
      spontaneous adverse event (AE) reporting. Patients will be monitored for signs of
      suicide-related behavior, as per standard of care. A post-study safety follow-up phone call
      (conducted between 7 and 14 days post-last visit) will assess patients for any adverse events
      that occur following their last dose of medication received as part of the study. Following
      the last dose of study medication, the patient's continuing, post-study ADHD treatment will
      be based on Investigator discretion and standard of care.
