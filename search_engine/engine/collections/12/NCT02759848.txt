      classified into two categories: those with a history of TB and those without. Clinical,
      demographic, and radiological features were meticulously recorded and patients were followed
      up for mortality. 93 patients (15%) had past TB. On average, patients with a history of TB
      were four-year younger (p=0.002). Our study revealed that patients with TB history were
      diagnosed with COPD five-year earlier and died five-year earlier as compared to the patients
      without TB. In addition, in the TB history positive group, the rate of hospital admissions
      per year was higher compared to the group that lacked TB history (2.46±0.26 vs. 1.56±0.88;
      p=0.001). The patients with TB history had higher PaCO2 and lower FEV1 (p=0.008 and p=0.069
      respectively). Median survival was 24 months for patients with past TB, and was 36 months for
      those without. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that although 3-year survival rate was lower in
      patients with TB history, it was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Cox regression
      analysis showed that while factors such as age, PaCO2, hematocrit, BMI and the Charlson index
      affected mortality rates in COPD patients (p<0.05), prior history of TB did not seem to have
      a significant impact on the mortality.

      Our results showed that past TB caused more hospitalizations, lower respiratory functions and
      higher arterial carbon dioxide levels. It was found that, though the mortality rates were
      similar, COPD patients with past TB was diagnosed and died five-year earlier. We conclude
      that history of TB has an important role in natural course of COPD.
