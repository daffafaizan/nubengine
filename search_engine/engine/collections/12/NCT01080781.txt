    
      -  Outcomes

        -  Primary: Expression level of gene encoding Ephrin B1 (quantitative PCR normalized
           against GAPDH gene expression) on human right appendage biopsies

        -  Secondary: a/ Expression level of Ephrin B1 protein on human right appendage using
           Western blot and b/ Heart rate variability in both time and spectral domains

        -  Study design: Exploratory, monocentric , prospective and comparative. Two groups of 15
           patients each, age and sex matched, with or without elevated pressures in right auricles
           or pulmonary arteries will be included.

        -  Eligibility criteria:

             -  Inclusion criteria: patients needing cardiac surgery and who had both right
                catheterism and 24 hours ECG recording before inclusion; stable medications for at
                least 4 weeks; age > 18 years.

             -  Exclusion criteria: Patient with pace-maker or atrial fibrillation

        -  Number of subjects: 30 patients in two groups of 15 patients each.

        -  Statistical analysis: Qualitative and quantitative variables will be compared using
           McNemar test and t test respectively. A p value < 0.05 will be considered as
           significant.
