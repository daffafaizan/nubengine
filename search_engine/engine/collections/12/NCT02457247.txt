      500/400 and Calcichew D3 500/800. Calcichew D3 500/400 and Calcichew D3 500/800 are being
      tested to treat or prevent calcium or vitamin D deficiencies. Calcichew D3 500/400 will be
      compared to Adcal-D3 600/400 as prescribed in clinical practice and Calcichew D3 500/800 will
      be compared to Kalcipos-D 500/800 as prescribed in clinical practice.

      This Crossover study will enroll approximately 276 patients equally divided between the two
      test groups (138 patients each). Within each test group, participants will be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment sequences, as described
      below.

      Test Group 1:

        -  Calcichew D3 500/400 (containing 500 mg calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) chewable tablet

        -  Adcal-D3 600/400 (containing 600 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) chewable tablet

      Test Group 2:

        -  Calcichew D3 500/800 (containing 500 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D) chewable tablets

        -  Kalcipos-D 500/800 (containing 500 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D) chewable
           tablets

      Participants in Test Group 1 will take either Calcichew D3 500/400 or Adcal-D3 600/400 for 14
      days and then will crossover to take either Calcichew D3 500/400 or Adcal-D3 600/400
      treatment for 14 days. Participants in Test Group 2 will take either Calcichew D3 500/800 or
      Kalcipos-D 600/400 for 14 days and then will crossover to take either Calcichew D3 500/800 or
      Kalcipos-D treatment for 14 days.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted In the United Kingdom and Germany. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 28 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      including a final visit assessment at Day 28.
