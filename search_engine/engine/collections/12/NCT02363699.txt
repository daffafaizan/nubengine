      randomly allocated in two groups. The first group received intravenous lidocaine infusion
      during the procedure until one hour postoperatively; meanwhile the second group received
      intravenous saline for the same period of time. The intervention was double-blind. In the
      postoperative period, both groups received dipyrone and morphine PCA. Pain was assessed by
      Visual Numeric Scale (VNS) at rest and when coughing at 1st, 2nd, 4th, 12th e 24th hour after
      the end of the surgery. Blood samples for cytokines measurement were taken at the end of
      procedure and 24 hours later. The total morphine PCA demand, the time for the first flatus
      and the length of hospital stay were also recorded and compared.
