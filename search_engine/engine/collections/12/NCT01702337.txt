      respective trials and published cost data for Taiwan) which estimates the differences in
      lesions, genital warts, cervical cancer and costs from a healthcare payer's perspective
      prevented between HPV-1 and HPV-2 vaccines during one year (when all women are vaccinated).
      It also analyses costs from a societal perspective.
