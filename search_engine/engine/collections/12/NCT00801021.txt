    
      A 7-day treatment with a 28-day follow up has been designed as a "before and after"
      assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection and
      the reduction/eradication of urinary pathogens. Enrollment is targeted to achieving 20
      evaluable subjects by the end of the study. After enrolling in the trial at Day 0 (first day
      of dosing), participants will report back to the study site at Days 3, 7, and 28. At Day 3 or
      any time thereafter, worsening of symptoms and/or increases in quantitative bacteria counts
      will result in removal from the trial and prescription of a rescue medication, which will be
      selected based on microbial susceptibility testing.
