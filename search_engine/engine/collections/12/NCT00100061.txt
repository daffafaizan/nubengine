      symptoms, an optimally effective dose has not been established, and the chemicals responsible
      for the UTI-preventing properties in cranberry-containing products have yet to be determined.
      This study will determine the minimum dose of cranberry-containing product necessary to
      prevent UTIs, the effectiveness of cranberry-containing products in fighting different
      strains of E. coli, and the long-term effects of cranberry-containing product consumption.
      This study will also determine whether plant pigments called proanthocyanidins influence the
      UTI-preventing properties of cranberry-containing products.

      This study will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive varying doses
      of either cranberry-containing products or placebo for 1 year. Some participants will receive
      cranberry or placebo supplement tablets; others will receive cranberry juice or a placebo
      beverage. Clinic visits will occur every 2 months; urine collection will occur at each visit.
      Some participants will be asked to collect 24-hour urine samples every 8 weeks and provide
      urine samples on Days 1, 3, 5 and 7.

      Laboratory tests will be used to assess participants during the study. A 3-day course of
      antibiotics will be provided to participants developing a UTI during the course of the study.
      Telephone interview follow-up at 6 and 12 months after the study will determine whether
      cranberry-containing product use has continued and whether UTIs have recurred.
