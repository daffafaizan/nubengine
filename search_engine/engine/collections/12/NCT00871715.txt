      have considerable residual disability. Sixty-five percent (65%) of patients at 6 months are
      unable to incorporate the paretic hand effectively into daily activities. In turn, this
      degree of functional deficit contributes to a reduced quality of life after stroke. The
      extent of disability has been underplayed by the use of the Barthel Index that captures only
      basic activities of daily living such as self-care and does not extend to activities and
      participation at higher levels of functioning that are most affected by a residual upper
      extremity disability. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of different therapy
      interventions designed to capitalize on the brain's inherent capability to rewire and learn
      well into old age and more importantly for rehabilitation, after injury. The most effective
      arm-focused interventions with the strongest evidence and potentially the most immediate and
      cost-effective appeal for the current health-care environment share a common emphasis on
      focused task-specific training applied with an intensity higher than usual care. Therefore,
      our primary aim is to compare the efficacy of a fully defined, hybrid combination of the most
      effective interventions (forced-use/constraint-induced therapy and
      skill-based/impairment-mitigating motor learning training), the Accelerated Skill Acquisition
      Program (ASAP), to an equivalent dose of usual and customary outpatient therapy.
