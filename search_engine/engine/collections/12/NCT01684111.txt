    
      Patients older than 70 years could be enroled in this clinical trial. The trial is being
      carried out in two trial centres in Germany.

      For the planned sample size it is assumed that two different dosage groups are needed with 6
      patients on each dosage group with the option to deescalate the first dosage. Altogether this
      leads to an estimated sample size of maximal 18 patients.

        -  Duration of treatment/patient: up to 6 month

        -  Follow Up: at least 6 month
