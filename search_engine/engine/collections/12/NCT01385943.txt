      (without cutting into the skik) examination of skin tumors. CRM produces cellular images with
      resolution comparable to histopathology. The procedure is painless, takes about ten minutes
      and has no documented side effects. Studies performed in the past decade have correlated CRM
      features in benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) skin lesions such as moles and
      melanomas, as well as features of inflammatory lesions (such as allergic skin reactions) to
      histopathology.

      Dermoscopy is a complementary technique that has been proven to be superior to the naked eye
      for the diagnosis of melanoma as well as some non-melanocytic skin tumors. Recently,
      correlation of dermoscopic and CRM structures has focused interest in the research in
      different groups that show that both are complementary and render in combination a better
      understanding of skin disease.

      In this study, patients from several research centers in Europe, with lesions suspicious for
      malignancy and scheduled for biopsy will be asked if they would like to participate in the
      study. If they consent to the study, first, a clinical photograph will be taken of the
      lesion. Second, a dermoscopic image will be taken of the lesion, and third, CRM images will
      be taken of the lesion. Finally, the biopsy will be performed as per the standard of care.
      The images will be sent over a secure, private internet connection to physicians specially
      trained in the interpretation of dermoscopic and CRM images. An electronic report will be
      completed and returned to the Study Coordinator, who will correlate the results with the
      histopathologic diagnosis.
