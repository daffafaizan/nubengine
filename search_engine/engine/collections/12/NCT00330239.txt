      ratio to receive either Paxil CR or placebo for 12 weeks. Medication will be initiated at
      12.5mg/day and will be increased weekly as tolerated to a maximum dose of 50mg/day.
      Participants will be seen weekly and will be assessed for side effects, substance use since
      last visit, urine drug screen, breathalyzer readings, vital signs and symptoms of PTSD
      (TOP-8)at each visit. The Davidson Trauma Scale will be completed every two weeks, and the
      CAPS-2 and MADRS will be completed monthly. Those who complete the first 12 weeks of
      double-blind study medication will be eligible to receive open label medication for an
      additional 12 weeks. Medication will be initiated at 12.5mg and increased every 3 days as
      tolerated to the terminal dose in the double-blind phase, then adjusted as needed.
      Participants will come in for assessments every two weeks of the open-label phase. Blood will
      be drawn for blood chemistries and hematology at screening and weeks 12 and 24. Urine
      pregnancy tests will be performed for women of childbearing potential at baseline and again
      at weeks 4, 12 and 24.
