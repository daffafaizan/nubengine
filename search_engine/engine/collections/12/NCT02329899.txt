      in investigating patients with suspected MBD will lead to a better discrimination between
      patients with and without MBD and a more precise characterisation of MBD.

      The primary objective of this diagnostic study is to evaluate the efficiency of a
      standardised procedure of MBD in children and adults referred to their respective outpatient
      clinics for bleeding symptoms. The following endpoints will be evaluated:

        1. The relative number of precise diagnosis (according to recognised classification of
           haemostatic disorders) in each clinical probability category;

        2. The number of biological tests performed per patient in each clinical probability
           category;

        3. The relative number of patients with no specialised investigations in the low risk
           group.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the bleeding events during a one-year follow-up.
      Follow-up will be performed with a phone call one year after the last consultation of the
      patient. The definition of a bleeding event will be any bleeding that promotes any specific
      medical attention (consultation, hospitalisation, transfusion, re-intervention in case of
      surgery). The detailed clinical history regarding each event will be collected. Bleeding
      events will be correlated to the clinical probability assessed at inclusion.
