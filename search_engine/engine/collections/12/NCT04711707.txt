      aims of this pilot randomized controlled trial are the following:

        1. To determine the feasibility of implementation and delivery of a screening-referral
           intervention versus usual care to address social needs of children with obesity enrolled
           in a pediatric weight management program at McMaster Children's Hospital, which will
           include recruitment rates, uptake of the intervention, and follow-up of participants.

        2. To understand impact on health outcomes of a screening-referral intervention versus
           usual care to address social needs of children with obesity enrolled in a pediatric
           weight management program including change in i) body mass index z score (zBMI); ii)
           change in body composition; and iii) change in health-related quality of life.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that health outcomes of children with obesity are connected to the
      social determinants of health, and that an intervention which screens for and refers to
      community supports will improve child obesity outcomes.
