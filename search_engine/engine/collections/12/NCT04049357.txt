      years, who are invited biennially to a fecal test for invisible blood in the stool. If the
      test is positive the citizen is invited for a colonoscopy. 90% of the test-positive undergo
      colonoscopy. The detected cancers are at a significant earlier stage and survival from
      screening detected cancer is higher. It is also expected that cancer incidence will drop due
      to removal of the advanced adenomas before they develop into cancer. Although initial results
      are positive, there is room for improvement. Additionally there are rare but serious
      complications to colonoscopy in the form of bleeding or bowel perforation.

      Through four years the investigators have tested the colon capsule endoscopy method, and find
      that the investigation is associated with significantly less discomfort and that the
      diagnostic ability to find polyps > 1 cm is better than colonoscopy.
