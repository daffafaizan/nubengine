      allocated into three groups: the intravenous dexmedetomidine group (Dex_iv group),
      dexmedetomidine adding to local anesthetic as an adjuvant for subcostal TAP block (Dex_adj
      group), and Control group. All patients receive gastrectomy or partial gastrectomy in general
      anesthesia as standard. Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, the patients in Dex_iv
      group receive 0.5mcg/kg dexmedetomidine infusion for 30 minutes, while the patients in
      Dex_adj group and control group receive 0.125ml/kg 0.9% normal saline IV infusion for 30
      minutes. All patients have ultrasound-guided TAP block single injection after the end of
      surgery and before the tracheal tube extubation. The block agents in Dex_adj group is 40 ml
      of 0.375% ropivacaine with 0.5mcg/kg dexmedetomidine, while in Dex_iv group and control group
      are only 40ml of 0.375% ropivacaine. The IV PCA pump will be set up before patients awaken in
      the post-anesthesia care unit. All patients are assessed for the signs of emergence agitation
      with Riker sedation-agitation scale in the post-anesthesia care unit. The numerical rating
      scale (NRS) for pain intensity assessment, the opioid consumption via IV PCA pump, and the
      patients satisfaction will be documented for postoperative 3 days for the impact evaluation
      of dexmedetomidine in postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery
      with subcostal TAP block.
