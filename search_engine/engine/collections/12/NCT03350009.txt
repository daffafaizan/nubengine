      assessment and scoring system. morhpokinetics introduced recently to IVF laboratories can
      define annotations and provide an algorithm for optimal cleavage rates and embryonic
      development. however more data and validations are requested when it comes to choosing the
      best single embryo from a cohort of available similarly graded embryos. Consequently,
      non-invasive quantitative methods for embryo selection prior to transfer have been sought. In
      the current study metabolic profile of follicular fluid and the embryos produced in IVF
      procedure will be assessed
