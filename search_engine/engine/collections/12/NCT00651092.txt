      periods of time. Endoscopic submucosal inferior turbinectomy is performed in our hospital and
      blunt turbinectomy is performed usually in privat clinics outside the hospital where there is
      no endoscopic equipment. We will examine both subjective (QOL questionaire) and objective
      parameters(rhinomanometry- a non invasive method to evaluate nasal airflow, saccharine test,
      nasal endoscopy) in our comparison of the outcome of these two methods.
