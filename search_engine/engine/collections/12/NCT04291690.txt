      General Hospital; an academic tertiary care center in Montreal, Quebec. Researchers will
      pre-screen stable patients ≥65 years of age admitted to the cardiovascular unit. The
      investigators will target those that consent and have evidence of frailty or pre-frailty
      according to the EFT (score ≥1/5). The EFT consists of a chair rise test to screen for
      physical frailty, a mini-cog test to screen for cognitive impairment, a hemoglobin level and
      a serum albumin level. Patients will be randomly allocated to the usual-care control group,
      or the intervention group that will receive targeted treatments depending on the EFT deficits
      identified. All patients will be outfitted with a hip-worn accelerometer to monitor position,
      step count, and sleep data during the study period. Patients will undergo a structured
      questionnaire and physical performance assessment at baseline (upon index admission) and at
      discharge, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days post-discharge to assess their
      recovery. The primary endpoint will be represented by the EQ-5D scale (mobility, self-care,
      mood, pain, and physical activity) measured by blinded observers.
