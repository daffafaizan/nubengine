      leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally cognitive disturbances in patients with AD
      are associated with and paralleled by a decrease in cerebral glucose metabolism. This AD-like
      reduction in cerebral metabolism has also been associated with insulin-resistance, and may
      contribute to one of the links between diabetes and AD. Therefore manipulating
      neuro-energetics by providing a glucose substitute seems to be a means of improving neuronal
      function.

      Here the investigators will examine the effect of ketone bodies on cognitive performance in
      patients with type 2 diabetes by a randomized cross-over trial. Each subject will meet for
      two experimental visits separated by 2-6 weeks. During the two visit days subjects will, in a
      randomized order, receive ketone bodies (Î²-hydroxybutyrate) or placebo (saline)
      intravenously. On both test days plasma glucose levels will be clamped. After glucose levels
      have been stabilized cognitive performance will be assessed by a battery of validated
      cognitive tests.
