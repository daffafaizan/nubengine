      casualties who are immobilized because of possible spine injuries, and casualties who
      required prolonged field care are at increased risk for pressure injuries. The risk factors
      pressure and shear are potentially modifiable via solutions appropriate for these austere
      conditions. Two interventions (Mepilex and LiquiCell) will be evaluated under conditions
      simulating military medical transport on a standard stretcher or with spinal immobilization
      in a vacuum spine board (VSB) or on a military stretcher used under field conditions. Mepilex
      is a multi-layer dressing that can be placed on the skin (sacrum/buttocks) and LiquiCell is a
      pad filled with pockets of fluid that is placed under the back and buttocks. The effect of
      these interventions compared to not using them will be studied under the three conditions
      with or without the intervention (Mepilex or LiquiCell) using measures obtained on the lower
      back/sacrum including skin interface pressure, oxygen, moisture, and temperature and a
      cytokine indicating possible tissue damage.
