      I. To identify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of PS-341 in patients with
      advanced malignancy and mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency.

      II. Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 for patients
      with varying degrees of renal insufficiency.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      most recent creatinine clearance (greater than 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min vs 20-39 mL/min vs
      less than 20 mL/min vs any creatinine clearance and undergoing renal dialysis).

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional
      cohort of up to 12 patients is treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-69 patients (at least 12 per stratum) will be accrued for
      this study.
