    
      Stroke AF is a prospective, multi-site, randomized, controlled, non-blinded, post-market
      study. The Stroke AF study will compare the incidence rate of atrial fibrillation through 12
      months between the continuous monitoring arm and the control arm in subjects with a recent
      ischemic stroke of presumed known origin. Subjects randomized to the continuous monitoring
      arm will have a Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor inserted within 10 days of the
      qualifying stroke and undergo continuous remote monitoring. Subjects randomized to the
      control arm will be followed per site specific standard of care.
