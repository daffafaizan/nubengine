    
      Ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged
      as a highly effective treatment for essential tremor, which is an incurable, degenerative
      brain disorder that results in progressively debilitating tremor, afflicting an estimated 7
      million people in the US (2.2% of the population). Clinical observation shows, however, that
      disease progression results in eventual recurrence of debilitating tremor in 10 to 20% of VIM
      DBS patients. DBS revision surgery, with replacement of sub-optimally positioned VIM DBS
      leads and addition of an ipsilateral ventralis oralis (VO) DBS lead, has emerged as an
      effective rescue strategy for many such patients with delayed failure of VIM DBS therapy.

      Since essential tremors are typically not continuous, tremor suppressing DBS therapy need not
      necessarily be delivered continuously and could theoretically be effective if delivered only
      when movement intent or tremor is present.

      Our central hypothesis is that a VIM+VO DBS system capable of detecting the neurophysiologic
      markers of essential tremor (ET) associated with goal directed movements, and providing
      responsive dual lead thalamic stimulation in a targeted and personalized manner, would
      provide improved suppression of severe tremor, reduce adverse effects associated with
      continuous stimulation, and prolong the battery life of the implantable neurostimulator
      (INS), decreasing the frequency of surgical procedures necessary to replace devices with
      depleted batteries.
