      delivered within hours. A body of literature suggests that there are processes ongoing
      days-months after stroke that can be targeted therapeutically, and improve function. The
      current study evaluates one such potential therapy, the dopamine agonist ropinirole. The
      current study tests the hypothesis that patients with chronic stroke randomized to
      ropinirole+physiotherapy will show improved gait velocity over the 12 weeks of study
      participation as compared to patients randomized to placebo+physiotherapy. A secondary aim is
      to test the hypothesis that ropinirole will improve three secondary endpoints at 12 weeks
      after study entry: the proportion of patients with no significant disability (Barthel Index â‰¥
      95); overall motor status, measured with the arm/leg FM score; and overall physical function,
      defined as the score on the Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16). This study will also evaluate
      the safety of ropinirole in patients recovering from stroke.
