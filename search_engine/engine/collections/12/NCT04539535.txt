      characterized by the cognitive deficits, hypotonia, motor developmental and sensory function
      problems. The somatosensory system disorder such as touch, proprioception, pain and
      temperature may be seen in these infants and children. There is a delayed peripheral
      conduction of the stimulus and delayed cerebral processing may cause the abnormal tactile
      perception response. In the earliest period of life General Movements (GMs), a gestalt-based
      observation method is one of the most reliable and valid predictors of neurological
      dysfunction, and it is widely used. GMs occur in age-specific patterns and are described as
      fidgety movements between from 3 to 5 months in the post-term age. We did the GMs assessment
      on two different surfaces in the infants with DS and typically infants on the same day, and
      therefore assumed that determining the fidgety movements and the concurrent movement would
      enable to us observe the effect of extroceptive stimulation on the fidgety movements and the
      concurrent movement.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the following questions: (i) are fidgety movements
      and the concurrent motor repertoire of infants with DS depending on different surfaces?, (ii)
      do fidgety movements and the concurrent motor repertoire change in neurotypical infants
      depending on the different surface?, and (iii), what are the differences between infants with
      DS and neurotypical infants?.
