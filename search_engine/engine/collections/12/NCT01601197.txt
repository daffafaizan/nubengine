      and feasible pain-relieving interventions include sugar water, fast injection without
      aspiration, and holding infants during the procedure. These methods, however, do not
      eliminate pain in all infants. Additional interventions are therefore needed.

      Tactile stimulation (rubbing/applying pressure) has been shown to reduce injection pain in
      children and adults, and may be a suitable intervention for infant injections. It is cost
      neutral, requires no preparation, and is easily incorporated into practice.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of tactile stimulation when added to
      other proven analgesic interventions on reducing pain during infant immunization injections.
