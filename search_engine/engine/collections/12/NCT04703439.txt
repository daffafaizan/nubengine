      were assigned to the experimental and control groups, respectively. The mHealth intervention
      in this study had been pilot tested and tailored. Specifically, the experimental group
      received a medication-taking reminder every morning via WeChat app and educational materials
      of coronary heart disease and medication adherence every five days via Message Express app.
      The control group received only general educational materials, which were irrelevant to
      coronary heart disease or medication adherence, every 5 days via Message Express app. All
      participants were diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The specific recruitment criteria of
      participants had been published in peer-reviewed journal.
