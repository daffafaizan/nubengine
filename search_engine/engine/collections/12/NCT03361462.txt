      joyful adventure days in secondary schools in the form of physical activities and
      competitions with the following activities:

        -  Fitness assessment (enjoyment) and in-door games, which will be designed, supervised and
           supported by experienced social workers;

        -  Short interactive talk on SME, positive thinking and understanding of adolescent mental
           health problem (in particular the anxiety disorders) and mental well-being;

        -  Issue achievement / improvement stickers to students, and attractive prizes to the 10
           fittest students by chairperson / members of Parent-Teacher Association (sharing);

        -  Provide physical activity diary after 1st session of adventure day, and invite family
           members / peers to join the competition at the 2nd session.

      The major subjects of Joyful Adventure Day Pilot Project RCT study are 200-300 students. 3
      schools will be included in the evaluation. The classes in the same school will either be
      assigned into intervention group or waitlist control group (the intervention won't be
      provided during evaluation period and will be provided after the evaluation period.).

      There will then be 4 assessments (pre-intervention, immediate post intervention, one month
      and three months after baseline) to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme. In
      the assessments, students will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure the changes in
      fitness enjoyment, physical activity frequency, happiness, well-being and knowledge and
      attitude towards mental health. The satisfaction towards the intervention, as well as the
      level of participation and ratings for the intervention will be evaluated.
