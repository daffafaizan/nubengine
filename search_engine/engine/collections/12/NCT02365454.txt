    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Nexus™ Aortic Arch
      Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies requiring
      landing in the Aortic Arch (zone 0, zone 1, zone 2).

      The Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System is indicated for the endovascular treatment of
      thoracic aortic pathologies involving the aortic arch (such as aneurisms and dissections).
      The Nexus™ is intended to exclude the lesion from the blood circulation in patients diagnosed
      with thoracic aortic pathology and who have appropriate anatomy to accommodate the Nexus™
      system in an endovascular procedure.

      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and performance of the Nexus™
      Aortic Arch Aneurysm Stent Graft System.
