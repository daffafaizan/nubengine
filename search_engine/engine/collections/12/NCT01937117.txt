      pCR in men and women with ER-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive breast cancer receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PT) pre-operatively. This
      has not previously been evaluated in patients receiving anti HER2 therapy alone and as such
      is novel and potentially practice changing. The results from this phase 2 biomarker study
      will be used to plan a randomized study using a predefined cut point for SUV decline such
      that the investigators can further attempt to identify a group of individuals with
      HER2-positive early breast cancer who do not require cytotoxic chemotherapy in addition to
      anti-HER2 agents. This non-invasive biomarker approach will be of great interest to breast
      cancer oncologists and patients by facilitating a personalized approach to managing patients
      with HER2-positive disease that will undoubtedly spare toxicity and reduce the costs
      associated with anti-cancer strategies, without compromising efficacy.
