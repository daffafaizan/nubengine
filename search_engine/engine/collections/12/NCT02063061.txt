      sixty- five percent of men over 40 years of age have erection disorders. Current challenges
      of medical treatment are met with high costs and risks of side effects. Emerging new therapy
      with low-energy shock waves stimulate production of endothelial growth factor and nitrogen
      oxide which results in angiogenesis. It is our aim to assess efficaciousness of this method
      on potential to improve erectile dysfunction. We propose a prospective double-blind,
      randomised, cross-over, sham-controlled trial, to assess how effective shock waves therapy is
      for erectile dysfunction. Patients will receive one treatment per week for ten weeks.
      Subjects will be followed for up to one year after treatment. Standardized questionnaires
      will assess study endpoints for erectile dysfunction. We hypothesize that shock wave therapy
      could represent a low cost, low risk treatment for erectile dysfunction in men.
