      6 communities in this feasibility study. The program is offered by trained facilitators to
      fathers who currently smoke and want to quit. The RE-AIM framework is used to guide the
      evaluation. Open-ended questions in participant surveys, and semi-structured interviews and
      weekly telephone de-briefs with facilitators provide data for a process evaluation. Estimates
      of effectiveness include smoking behavior, fathering and physical activity measures at
      baseline, end of program, and 3-month follow up.
