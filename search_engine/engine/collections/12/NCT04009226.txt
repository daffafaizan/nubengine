    
      GNE myopathy is an ultra- rare condition. Most of the knowledge is coming from case reports
      or small cohort observations. There is a need to more precisely understand the long-term
      disease course and the progression of disease-specific features of GNE myopathy, and in turn
      characterise the overall burden of this illness. Also, to better understand the disease,
      describe it variability, genotype-phenotype correlation, quality of life, epidemiology,
      health-economics aspects and need for assistive walking devices. Collected data needs to be
      harmonised to be compatible collaborative work with Remudy (Japanese patient registry). This
      collaborative effort will enable the analysis of the largest GNE myopathy data set in the
      world. To this end, this study will collect patient information longitudinally. Upon
      patient's agreement, the registry curator can contact nominated clinicians to request
      additional data or data validation.

      Study Objectives

      The objectives of the study are to:

        -  Longitudinally characterize disease-specific features of GNE myopathy

        -  Characterize the burden of illness and quality of life in patients with GNE myopathy

        -  Support recruitment in research activities

        -  Inform registry participants via newsletters about scientific developments in the GNE
           myopathy field
