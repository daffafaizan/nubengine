      subjects without DM. Furthermore, DM as well as depression is known for risk factor for
      dementia.

      The choline metabolism involves in neuropathology of depressive disorders and individuals
      with depressive disorders showed the lower level of choline concentration. Choline

      management.

      an option for these cases. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
      Gliatamin (chonline alphoscerate) on depressive mood in type 2 diabetes patients and
