      means of sampling provide suboptimal accuracy. Both biliary brushings for cytology and
      fluoroscopically-directed biopsies produce highly-variable results. Endoscopic ultrasound
      with fine-needle aspiration has also been employed with variable results. An additional
      modality, using a single-operator cholangioscope during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to obtain cholangioscopically-directed biopsies offers
      promise in increasing the yield of sampling. Initial observational studies have shown an
      improved diagnostic yield, but the technique has not been tested in a randomized, medical
      effectiveness study to better characterize its actual clinical impact. We aim to compare the
      technique of biopsy-on-biopsy derived sampling via single-operator cholangioscopy with
      standard fluoroscopically-directed biopsies and brushings in a pilot study. We also aim to
      perform a medical effectiveness study on the early use of single-operator cholangioscopically
      (SOC) in the evaluation of undiagnosed biliary strictures.
