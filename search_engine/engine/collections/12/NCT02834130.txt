      rare diseases. In last decades, news therapies have dramatically increased life expectancy
      and joint's protection. The recurrence of joint bleedings is responsive of multifocal
      arthropathy in the natural history, but nowadays, the orthopedic outcome is good thanks to
      prophylactic treatments.

      However, the announcement of the diagnosis of such hereditary bleeding disorders at a very
      young age represents a real psychological trauma for parents. Such an announcement may induce
      some psycho-developmental impairment.

      An innovative support has been implemented at the Hemophilia Treatment Center in Marseille,
      in conjunction with the French Hemophilia Society. This program is based on a
      multidisciplinary partnership that favors the psychological support and the reinsurance of
      the parents.

      With Rare Diseases Foundation support, the investigators have initiated this pilot study that
      will include more than 20 patients with severe hemophilia or constitutional bleeding
      disorder, who benefit from the device. This descriptive, monocentric, interventional study
      will permit to describe the psychological status, the quality of life of patients and their
      parents, but also to evaluate the impact of the device on initiation and observance of
      treatments like Long Term Prophylaxis.
