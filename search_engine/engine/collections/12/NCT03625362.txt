      deposition due to causes other than excessive alcohol consumption. NAFLD can cause many liver
      dysfunction-related symptoms and signs, with the disease may progress to non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis, a condition marked by liver inflammation, fibrosis and irreversible damage.
      NAFLD is usually accompanied by insulin resistance and obesity, with up to 30% of population
      in industrialized countries have NAFLD. While NAFLD is rapidly becoming the most common liver
      disease worldwide, its treatment remains elusive, and directed toward correction of the risk
      factors. Since metabolic impairment plays a major role in NAFLD pathogenesis, any agent that
      advance lipid and glucose metabolism could be appropriate to tackle this complex condition.
      Molecular hydrogen (H2) has recently emerged as a novel pro-metabolic agent that might
      positively affect liver health. Supplemental hydrogen improves blood lipid profiles and
      insulin resistance in overweight women, patients with type 2 diabetes, and in subjects with
      potential metabolic syndrome. In addition, drinking hydrogen-rich water reduces hepatic
      oxidative stress and alleviated fatty liver damage in rodents. However, no human studies so
      far evaluated its effectiveness to alter liver steatosis in patients with NAFLD. In this
      pilot trial, we analyze the effects of 4-week hydrogen-rich water intake on liver fat
      deposition, body composition and lab chemistry profiles in overweight patients suffering from
      NAFLD.
