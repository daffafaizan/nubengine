    
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted at multiple sites), non-comparative, single arm study of bortezomib. The study
      consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (21 days before Day 1 of cycle 1); Treatment phase
      (consist of 8 cycles each cycle of 21 days or until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity); and a Follow-up phase (for participants with positive treatment response or stable
      disease at the final visit). Follow-up for disease progression will be done in every 3 months
      up to 2 years. Participants who will experience disease progression after completing at least
      2 cycles of bortezomib treatment or have no change from baseline in stable disease after
      completing at least 4 cycles or as per Investigator's discretion will receive dexamethasone.
      Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of participants with renal compromised
      Multiple Myeloma by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
