      over the world. Standard of care treatment for colon and pancreas cancer is stage dependent
      and includes surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiation therapy. However, the current
      statistics underlines an urgent need for improved treatment. Patient-individualized
      treatments and enhancement of the immune response via vaccination are among new therapeutic
      options.

      The enhancement of the immune response via vaccination is among new therapeutic options.
      Here, either cell-specific antigens, over-expressed tumor specific antigens or mutated
      tumor-specific antigens (neoepitopes) can be employed. Especially the latter possess the
      biggest potential for high specificity but presuppose an extensive characterization of the
      respective tumor. In order to identify a neoepitope-based vaccination approach for
      patient-individualized treatment options the molecular particularities of tumors have to be
      analysed.

      The aim of this study is to identify tumor molecular particularities and neoepitopes among
      patients with colorectal and pancreatic tumors undergoing surgery.
