        -  Evaluate actuarial local in situ and invasive recurrence rates at 5 and 10 years after
           local excision in women with a favorable ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) prognosis.

        -  Evaluate concordance between institutional pathologists and central review pathologists
           with respect to diagnosis and grading of DCIS.

        -  Identify parameters that indicate increased or decreased risk of recurrence in the
           absence of irradiation.

        -  Evaluate patterns of salvage of recurrence and rates of breast conservation.

        -  Evaluate actuarial relapse-free, overall, and cause-specific survival at 5 and 10 years
           post DCIS excision.

      OUTLINE: This is a registration study stratified by histologic grade (high vs low or
      intermediate) and adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive standard clinical and mammographic follow-up for greater than 10 years. If
      recurrence occurs, treatment will be at the discretion of the investigators. Patients may
      receive adjuvant oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years after local excision.

      A follow up magnification view mammogram must be taken after the last local excision, and
      microcalcification must be negative.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for the first 10 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1000 (500 per stratum) eligible and evaluable patients will be enrolled at
      an estimated accrual rate of 250 patients per year.
