      patients with nephropathy that might relate to its effect on N terminal brain natriuretic
      peptide (NT-pro BNP) and C-reactive protein.

      Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiestrase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effects that was used
      in type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy for treatment of diabetes complications.

      NT-Pro BNP, which is released from the heart due to wall stress and pressures, is known as a
      diagnostic and prognostic marker for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in type 2
      diabetes.
