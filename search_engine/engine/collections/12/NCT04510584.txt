      proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections. A monoclonal
      antibody is a special kind of antibody that is created in a laboratory that seeks out
      specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancers to stop tumor growth.

      When tumor cells start to die, broken down pieces of the tumor's DNA gets released into the
      blood stream, called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Looking at ctDNA may be useful in
      determining whether the cancer is responding to treatment.

      The purpose of this research study is to see whether looking at tumor DNA circulating in the
      bloodstream can help to determine which patients may respond to atezolizumab and bevacizumab
      and whether this drug combination is useful, when given as a maintenance treatment for
      patients with TP53 mutant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
