      reproduced in multiple studies and has been seen in multiple races.

      People have been evaluating different hormones and practices associated with pregnancy to
      determine what factors reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in these patients. These
      pronounced findings have been evaluated in great detail by multiple scientists and one of the
      hormones which we think might be associated with a reduction in breast cancer is hCG. This
      statement has been backed by multiple studies which have looked at the direct effect of hCG
      on the growth and death of breast cancer cells in the lab and in animal models of breast
      cancer.

      We want to determine if hCG is given to patients who are at increased risk of breast cancer
      will result in an accentuated decrease in breast cancer risk above and beyond the effect
      received by conventional breast cancer reducing protocols. Our final outcome in this study
      will be breast density on mammographic evaluation which is considered a marker for breast
      cancer. So our study will evaluate whether or not hCG will have an effect on the mammographic
      breast density.

      After recruitment there will be two groups in our study an intervention group and non
      intervention group. In the intervention group patients would undergo a period of hCG
      injections which would last a total of 60 days and consist of 30 subcutaneous injections. The
      non intervention group will continue their conventional chemoprevention medication. Both
      groups will be followed for teo years and the images, cytology and blood samples will be sent
      to our labs for evaluation.
