    
      1. Investigate psychometric properties of a structured psychiatric interview

           (DAWBA) and a symptom measure (SDQ) in clinical samples of children and

           adolescents with cognitive deficits and intellectual disabilities. We will

           investigate the instruments' reliability and convergent validity with the

           Aberrant Behavior checklist (ABC), the DBC and the Social Responsiveness

           Scale (SRS), in addition to the clinician-rated severity of children's mental

           health problems measured with the CGAS and HoNOSCA.

        2. The psychiatric instruments will be administrated at intake and after six

           months. We will investigate prevalence rates and indicators of disorder

           severity (comorbidity and persistence), including risk factors (socioeconomic

           status, parenting styles).

        3. Investigate user satisfaction with the health service, i.e., the Pediatric

      Rehabilitation Services.
