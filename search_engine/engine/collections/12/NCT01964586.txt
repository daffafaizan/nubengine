      surgery for the visibility of surgical site.And postoperative pain is very usual after the
      surgery, so an effective postoperative analgesia procedure reduces the complications and
      helps to be discharged earlier from the hospital. An alpha 2 agonist Dexmedetomidine has an
      analgesic effect and vasoconstructive effect on the periferal blood vessels. Our hypothesis
      was dexmedetomidine makes a better surgecal conditions during the surgery and reduce the
      postoperative analgesic consumption. We administered the infiltrated dexmedetomidine or
      lidocaine plus adrenaline to the both side of the nasal septum 10 minutes before the surgery.
      Bleeding scores (Fromm and Boezaart Bleeding Scores) were recorded during the surgery. And
      postoperative analgesic consumptions were recorded in first 24 hours after the surgery.
