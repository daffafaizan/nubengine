    
      This study is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized phase II study. Daily fractions of
      radiotherapy at 1.8 Gy to total of 45 Gy to tumor and draining lymph nodes and followed by a
      coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy to the tumor were delivered concurrently with chemotherapy.

      Chemotherapy starts at day 1 of radiotherapy. Capecitabine is administered orally at a dose
      of 825 mg/m2 twice daily during weekdays (Monday to Friday) every week during radiotherapy.
      Irinotecan 40 mg/m2 is given intravenously once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 & 29).

      Six Â± 2 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, curative surgery is performed.

      Post-operative chemotherapy with capecitabine will be given to all patients 3-6 weeks after
      surgery. Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 every 21 days will be administered
      for 18 weeks.
