      this research:

      Hypothesis 1: participants with self-reported functional bloating in response to either
      fibre-1 or fibre-2, but not both, will respond symptomatically to fibre-1 or fibre-2, defined
      as 'fibre-1 responders' and 'fibre-2 responders'.

      Hypothesis 2: participants with functional bloating who are 'fibre-1 responders' will be
      distinguishable from 'fibre-1 non-responders', and 'fibre-2 responders' will be
      distinguishable from 'fibre-2 non-responders', based upon faecal microbial profiles
      identified using faecal metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolites at baseline and
      following the fibre-1 and fibre-2 interventions.

      Hypothesis 3: the microbiota, clinical and nutritional profiles of participants with
      functional bloating will be interrelated and these relationships will be distinguishable
      between 'fibre-1 responders', 'fibre-1 non-responders', and 'fibre-2 responders' and 'fibre-2
      non-responders'.

      Hypothesis 4: participants with visceral hypersensitivity will have different faecal
      microbiota and will be more likely to be a 'fibre-1 responders' or 'fibre-2 responders' than
      'non-responders'.

      Participants in the trial will take three different dietary substances, each at a dose of 8
      grams per day (split into two serves of 4 gram doses) for 7-days in a double-blinded
      randomised order with a 3-week washout period in between each intervention. The products are
      provided in powdered format and will be mixed with water before drinking. The products being
      provided are glucose, and fibre-1 or fibre-2 (all extracts of commonly consumed food
      products).
