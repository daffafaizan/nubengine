      for drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). It is centered around isolating pulmonary veins
      (PVs) and its success rate in curing AF is very high (56%-85%) (1). However, despite
      isolation of this dominant source of triggers, recurrent tachyarrhythmia is the major
      complication of this procedure with peri-mitral atrial flutter (PMFL) being the most common
      macro-reentrant arrhythmia in context of AF ablation (2). These often drug-refractory
      arrhythmias are frequently associated with more severe symptoms than the original AF (3) and
      warrant the necessity for redo-ablation.

      This study aims to compare the impact of two different redo-ablation strategies on the
      procedure outcome; (1) ablation of the perimitral flutter only and (2) cardioversion and
      repeat isolation of pulmonary veins (PV) with ablation of additional triggers.

      Study method: A total number of 65 AF patients presenting for redo-ablation and PMFL will be
      randomized to perimitral flutter ablation only or cardioversion and re-isolation (PVI) plus
      ablation of additional triggers. Additional triggers will be identified with the help of
      post-ablation drug provocation with isoproterenol. Patients will enter a follow-up period of
      12 months after the ablation procedure, when they will be monitored for recurrence of
      arrhythmia detected either by in-clinic or remote device interrogation at 1, 3, 6 and 12
      month post-procedure.
