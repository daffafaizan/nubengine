      youth have specific needs, not currently covered between child and adolescent mental health
      services (CAMHS) and adult mental health services (AMHS), mainly because of existing
      barriers. Movements from one to the other must be planned to achieve optimal patient care.

      Our project aims to identify clinical dimensional characteristics contributing to the
      development of psychopathology during the transition period. Continuities, discontinuities
      and resilience factors will be explored. The final purpose is to develop a non-stigmatizing
      approach to reduce rejection from youths in psychopathological suffering and increase social
      inclusion.

      The transversal and trans-diagnostic approach consists of a dimensional evaluation: 300 youth
      at the age of 17 will be included in a cohort of in-patients, out-patients and control group.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and 2 years later. The primary outcome is based on
      Health of the Nation Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents, measuring mental health care
      need, and WHO Quality of Life assessment.

      The secondary outcomes include the assessment of dimensions representing risk or protective
      factors to develop psychopathology and evolution of mental health status during transition
      age. Baseline evaluation consists in internalizing/externalizing symptoms,
      impulsivity/compulsivity, emotion regulation, cognitive functioning, social and family
      functioning, developmental, medical and trauma history. At follow-up, mental health pathways
      and transition results will be described.
