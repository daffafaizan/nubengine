      the effects of Denosumab on bone mineral density (BMD) change at lumbar spine over 12 months
      among patients suffering from an acute anorexia nervosa (AN).

      84 patients suffering from a current anorexia nervosa with an evidence of low BMD determined
      by a Z-score value < -2 DS at least one site (lumbar spine or total proximal femur) will be
      recruit .

      Eligible patients will be randomized into two groups: denosumab versus placebo. Each patient
      will attend a total of 8 scheduled visits, which will be completed over a period of 24 months
      +/- 15days from screening visit to end of study (inclusion, 10 days, and 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, &
      24 months).
