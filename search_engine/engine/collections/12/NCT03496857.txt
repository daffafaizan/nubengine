      an increase in the number of women opting to undergo a cesarean delivery. Pharmacological and
      nonpharmacological analgesia methods are used to control labor pain. Epidural analgesia is
      the most commonly used pharmacological analgesia method. However, it may have side effects on
      the fetus and the mother. Light-emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation is an effective and
      noninvasive alternative to pharmacological methods.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effects of LED photobiomodulation on analgesia during labor.

      Methods: In total, 60 women in labor admitted to a public maternity hospital will be selected
      for a randomized controlled trial. The participants will be randomized into two groups:
      intervention group [analgesia with LED therapy (n = 30)] and control group [analgesia with
      bath therapy (n = 30)]. The perception of pain will be assessed using the visual analogue
      scale (VAS), with a score from 0 to 10 at baseline, i.e., before the intervention. In both
      the groups, the procedures will last 10 min and will be performed at three time points during
      labor: during cervical dilation of (1) 4-5 cm, (2) 6-7 cm, and (3) 8-9 cm. At all three time
      points, pain perception will be evaluated using VAS shortly after the intervention. In
      addition, the evaluation of membrane characteristics (intact or damaged), heart rate, uterine
      dynamics, and cardiotocography will be performed at all time points.

      Expected outcomes: The use of LED photobiomodulation will have an analgesic effect superior
      to that of the bath therapy.
