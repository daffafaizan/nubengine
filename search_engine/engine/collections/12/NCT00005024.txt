      preventing nausea and vomiting during the 48 hours that begins 24 hours after administration
      of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with
      malignant disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      granisetron on day 0 at 60 minutes prior to the scheduled administration of IV
      cyclophosphamide or carboplatin (or doxorubicin) chemotherapy. On days 1 and 2, patients
      receive oral granisetron at approximately the same time as on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive
      oral granisetron on day 0 as in arm I. On days 1 and 2, patients receive oral placebo at
      approximately the same time as the granisetron tablets were taken on day 0. Patients are
      followed between 5 and 11 days after the last dose of study medication.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 434 patients (217 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
