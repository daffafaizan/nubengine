      Changing the way speech is produced in adults who stutter is a particular challenge for
      speech and language therapy and there is a need for novel interventions. One such
      intervention involves the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      alongside therapies aimed at improving speech fluency. tDCS influences brain activity by
      modulating neuronal plasticity through the application of weak electrical currents across the
      brain. Pairing tDCS with speech therapy has potential for producing larger or longer lasting
      effects and reducing time spent in therapy.

      The study will evaluate the potential of tDCS combined with speech fluency training to
      improve outcomes in people who stutter (PWS). PWS will have this training while receiving
      tDCS for five days (1 milliampere [mA] for 20 mins per day) in a double-blind randomized
      controlled trial. Outcomes will be measured in terms of changes to stuttering severity.

      An additional research questions is how changes in interactions between sensory and motor
      brain regions relate to changes in speech fluency in PWS. MRI will be used to measure brain
      structure and function and the vocal tract during speech production. Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) will assess motor excitability before and after the training.
