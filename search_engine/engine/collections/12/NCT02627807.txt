    
      Patients with non-keratinizing NPC T1-4N0-3M0 (AJCC/UICC staging system 7th edition) are
      randomly assigned to receive IMRT using individualized clinical target volume (CTV) based on
      disease extension risk atlas and computer-aided delineation or IMRT using traditional CTV.
      IMRT is given as 2.13 Gray (Gy) per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks
      to a total dose of 70.29 Gy to the primary tumor. Patients with T1N0M0 NPC receive IMRT only.
      For patients with stage T2-4N0-3M0 NPC, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is required and
      induction chemotherapy (IC) before CCRT is optional.Patients who participate in another
      randomized trial (NCT01872962) at the same time receive the protocol chemotherapy. Induction
      chemotherapy regimens are as follows: gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8) plus cisplatin (80mg/m²
      d1) or docetaxel (75mg/m² d1) plus cisplatin (75mg/m², total dose average to d1-d3) every 3
      weeks for three cycles. concurrent chemotherapy include cisplatin (100mg/m² d1 or 80mg/m²,
      total dose average to d1-d3) every 3 weeks for three cycles. Our primary endpoint is
      loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) rate. Secondary end points include overall
      survival (OS) rate, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rate, constituent ratio of local
      and regional recurrence pattern, toxic effects, quality of life scores and dosimetric
      parameters of IMRT planning. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat
      population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly
      assigned treatment.
