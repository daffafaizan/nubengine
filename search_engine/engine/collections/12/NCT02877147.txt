      the demonstration in a total of 16 sites; the number of participating sites and/or the
      evaluation components differed by year. In 2011, 5 grantees with five sites participated and
      the evaluation included implementation and cost analysis, EBT analysis, and an impact study.
      In 2012, 10 grantees implemented SEBTC in 14 sites and the evaluation included the same study
      components. In 2013, four grantees with six sites participated and the study components
      included EBT analysis and an impact study (no implementation or cost data collection).
      Finally, in 2014, three grantees participated in three sites and only implementation data
      were collected. Information on human subjects was collected for the evaluation's impact
      evaluation.
