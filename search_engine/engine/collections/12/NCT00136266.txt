      childhood. It is associated with numerous adverse health effects, particularly delayed mental
      and motor development, that may be irreversible. Despite advances of iron nutrition, the
      prevalence of iron deficiency remains high among low-income infants and toddlers. Previous
      studies suggest adherence with iron containing drops is low. Adherence to iron sprinkles
      among children as tested in studies in less developed countries appears high.

      Comparison: Children randomized to ferrous sulfate drops will be compared with children
      randomized to ferrous fumarate sprinkles.
