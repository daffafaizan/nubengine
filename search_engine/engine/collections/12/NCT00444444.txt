      pancreas due to an autoimmune mechanism; autoimmunity is responsible for producing the
      pancreatic lesion. AIP is a distinctive type of chronic pancreatitis that shows reversible
      improvement of pancreatic morphology and function with oral steroid therapy, in comparison to
      other types of chronic pancreatitis which hardly respond to various treatments. AIP is
      increasingly being recognized to be a worldwide entity. The sudden increment in cases
      reported probably reflects the growing awareness of the entity, rather than a rise in the
      true incidence. In previous Japanese report, HLA DRB1*0405-DQB*0401 haplotype may be
      associated with autoimmune pancreatitis in the Japanese population. However, to date there
      was no subsequent data for supporting these results. In addition, this Japanese study had a
      limitation in methodology by using a low-resolution typing for HLA. Although this entity is
      well responsive to steroid therapy, relapse of AIP during steroid treatment is not uncommon.
      Unfortunately, there has been no laboratory or genetic predictor for responsiveness to
      steroid therapy in patients with AIP. To further clarify and confirm high-risk and protective
      genotypes for autoimmune diseases, therefore, high-resolution typing for HLA should be
      needed. Thus, to determine whether certain alleles or haplotypes of major histocompatibility
      complex gene are associated with AIP in Korean population, we undertook this study with
      high-resolution typing for HLA (sequence-based typing).
