      and air pressure by respiratory monitoring with MFR during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in
      newborns in the delivery room, decreases at least 10% surfactant need in first 72 hours of
      life.

      EVALUATION Data collection will be made prospectively. Investigators will measure the
      parameters of lung mechanics (tidal volume expiratory airflow (TVe), peak inspiratory
      pressure (PIP), pressure at the end of exhalation (PEEP), inspiratory time (iT)), in each of
      inflations administered to preterm with VPP or during the administration of continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in spontaneous breathing, in the first 10 minutes after
      birth, recording the air leakage through the mask and obstructions. Investigators also
      measure parameters of respiratory status and hemodynamic (FIO 2, oxygen saturation, end tidal
      CO2, respiratory rate, heart rate), patient monitoring during the implementation of the
      protocol, blood gases, manipulations of the airway during intervention and the onset of
      complications.

      Patients will be randomize in a Group 1, where these parameters of lung mechanics would be
      visible and other Group 2, where the parameters of TVe and respiratory flow would not be
      visible by the rescuer (the usual parameters of PIP and PEEP will be visible). Always, in
      both groups, current recommendations ventilation measures included in cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation of newborns of the Spanish Society of Neonatology, based on international
      recommendations (1-3.5) apply. In turn, the results analyzed in two subgroups between 24 and
      27 + 6 weeks gestational age and 28 to 32 + 6 weeks.
