      cholecystectomy, bariatric procedures, colorectal resections as well as hysterectomy and many
      other gynecologic procedures, are routinely performed laparoscopically.

      Laparoscopy requires psychomotor skills that may be difficult to learn and result in
      prolonged learning curves. In order to become familiar with the 2-dimensional visualization
      and to learn and improve laparoscopic skills, training is needed. As traditional training in
      the operating room is expensive and comprises an increased operating risk for the patient,
      various training alternatives outside the operating room have been developed and shown to be
      effective in translating the thereby acquired skills to the operating room. Besides training
      on live animals or cadavers, there are virtual reality simulators, augmented reality
      simulators and different box trainers. Each of these training devices has specific advantages
      and limitations. However, some types could be superior to others in terms of training
      effectiveness. For instance, with implementation of 3D visualization during laparoscopic
      interventions which facilitates spatial perception, the question arises as to whether
      training of basic laparoscopic skills using conventional 2D visualization is at least equally
      effective compared to training with 3D visualization.

      The aim of this study is to find out whether basic laparoscopic skills (FLS tasks) training
      on a standard pelvic trainer using conventional 2D visualization is at least equally
      effective in terms of skills improvement compared to practicing with 3D visualization.
      Furthermore, the progress in basic laparoscopic skills improvement for each visualization
      modality will be analyzed.
