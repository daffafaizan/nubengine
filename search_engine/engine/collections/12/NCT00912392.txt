      In this randomized, open label, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, 120 patients are
      planned to be enrolled at random into 2 arms(1:1) from 10 centers between June 2009 and June
      2011. The leader units are Shanghai Chest Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong
      University. Main eligibility criteria are histological or cytological diagnosis of ED-SCLC,
      with an age of 18-75 years. All eligible patients receive etoposide-carboplatin (EC) alone or
      with endostar® for 4-6 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle). In arm1 patients receive endostar®
      7.5mg/m2 on day 1 to day 14, etoposide 60 mg/m2 on day 1 to day 5 and carboplatin AUC 5 on
      day 1. In arm2 patients receive etoposide 60 mg/m2 on day 1 to day 5 and carboplatin AUC 5 on
      day 1.

      Primary endpoint: progress free survival (PFS).

      Secondary endpoint: progress free survival at 6 months, overall survival (OS), objective
      response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), Response duration, time to progression(TTP)
      and quality of life (QOL).
