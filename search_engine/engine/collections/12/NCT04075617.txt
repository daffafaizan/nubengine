      supervisor.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to form two groups, Intervention group: Treatment by
      using electronic habit reminder which will be constructed by taking impression for the
      thumb/finger using silicon impression material (putty consistency) and pouring it with dental
      stone. The replica of the finger is used to formulate a custom made cover for it, which
      consists of stainless steel wires with specific design and acrylic resin this is the first
      part of the reminder. The second part is in the shape of wrist watch which is connected to
      the first part by a wire. When the child puts his finger in his mouth the stainless steel
      wires touch each other and the watch produces alarming sound and counts how many times the
      alarm goes off. The child should wear the appliance most of the time except during eating and
      activities.

      Control group: Treatment by using palatal crib which will be constructed by taking impression
      for upper arch with alginate impression material, and then will be sent to the lab for
      fabrication. Cementation of the appliance and then follow up.

      Follow up will be at two weeks and 1, 3, 6 months.
