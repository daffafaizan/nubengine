      1990; 2004). Smoking is a cause of metabolic syndrome and diabetes (Eliasson, 2003; Hu et
      al., 2001; Weitzman et al., 2005). Smokers live on average 13 years less than non-smokers
      (USDHHS, 2004), and tobacco remains the number one health threat in the United States
      (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, & Gerberding, 2004). The Public Health Service (PHS) has published a
      Guideline for Tobacco Dependence Treatment (Fiore, 2000; Fiore et al., 2008).
      Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk for cardiovascular disease, and effective treatment with
      lifestyle and medications lower the risk of cardiovascular events including sudden death,
      myocardial infarction, and stroke. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has
      published clinical guidelines for its management (Brown, 2004). These include recommendations
      for therapeutic lifestyle change and medications.

      The specific aims of the proposed work are: first, to determine abstinence from tobacco at
      6-months and lower LDL-cholesterol from baseline to 6-months for patients assigned the VCRT
      in addition to the clinician compared to those just receiving clinician care; second, to test
      for increase in medication use (number of days of medication use-for tobacco dependence
      mediations and for statin medications for cholesterol) for those receiving the VCRT +
      clinician; third, to examine the self-determination process model, expanded to include
      autonomous motivation and perceived competence for medication adherence and actual adherence
      to promote maintained abstinence and lower LDL-cholesterol.
