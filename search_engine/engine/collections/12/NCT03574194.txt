      sensitize the cancer cells to radiation and increase local and regional disease control.
      However, chemotherapy is often associated with significant toxicity and many patients cannot
      tolerate it. As such, exploring alternative approaches to radiosensitization that may be more
      tolerable for patients is important. One innovative strategy that has potential to enhance
      both the safety and efficacy of SBRT is a methionine-restricted diet (MRD) as an adjunct to
      radiation therapy. While normal cells can tolerate some degree of methionine deficiency, the
      vast majority of cancer cells are methionine auxotrophs that require dietary intake of
      methionine. In the absence of methionine, cancer cells undergo cell cycle arrest and cell
      death. Preclinical data suggests that consuming a reduced quantity of methionine sensitizes
      cancer cells to radiation therapy and reduces metastasis formation and disease progression in
      mice; Phase 1 clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of the diet with and without
      concurrent chemotherapy; however, dietary restriction of methionine has not been tested in
      combination with radiation therapy in humans. This protocol will test our hypothesis that a
      MRD will be a safe addition to radiation therapy for a variety of human malignancies.
