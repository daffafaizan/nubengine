      function of the tear film. The lipid secreted by the meibomian glands has many crucial roles:
      1) to retard evaporation from the preocular surface; 2) lower the surface tension of tears;
      3) prevent spill-over of tears from the lid margin; 4) prevent the contamination of the tear
      film by sebaceous lipids; 5) prevent damage to the skin of the lid margin. In dry eye
      syndrome, blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, and meibomitis the glands are the central
      pathophysiology of disease and thus a potential target for therapy.
