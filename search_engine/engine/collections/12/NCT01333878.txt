    
      This is an open-label study of the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) Abatacept to inhibit
      progression of structural joint damage in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      receiving MTX and have inadequate disease control (defined as an ESR based DAS28 ≥ 3.2 AND ≥
      6 swollen and ≥ 6 tender joints). The study consists of a screening period (Days -21 to -7),
      a baseline visit (Days -20 to -1), and a treatment Period (open label Abatacept 125 mg SC for
      24 weeks). All the visits may occur at the indicated week +/- 2 days. The last efficacy
      assessments are to be conducted at Week 24 and subjects are to be contacted by telephone for
      a safety follow-up 2 months after the final study agent has been administered.

      The maximum length of the study is 35 weeks, which includes the 2-week screening period,
      1-week baseline period, 24-week open label treatment, and 8-week follow-up period. Eligible
      subjects are to continue their current MTX treatment regimen, a stable dose of at least
      15mg/week, during the entire length of the study (24 weeks). At Day 0, patients who meet
      inclusion criteria, will be dosed from Day 0 to Week 24 with Abatacept 125 mg SC injection.

      Subjects are to self-administer SC study agent at Weeks 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17,
      18, 19, 21, 22, and 23 and are not required to return to the study site at these weeks. All
      other visits, SC study agent is to be administered while the subject is at the study site.
