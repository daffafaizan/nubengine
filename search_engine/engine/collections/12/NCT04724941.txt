    
      The PASS-PP Study is designed to combine the latest developments in clinical and biomarker
      research to

        1. understand the distribution of risk profiles for PD in the general population,
           especially regarding non-motor symptoms

        2. identify subjects with a likelihood of developing PD

        3. follow individuals with a high likelihood/risk to develop PD in the future (compared to
           individuals with low risk and) in a prospective study

        4. understand the potential of biological markers to increase prediction of
           progression/conversion

        5. identify subtypes of PD patients, by providing a detailed clinical phenotyping with a
           main focus on non-motor symptoms cluster

        6. provide a framework of ethical handling of early risk disclosure in PD
