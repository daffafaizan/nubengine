      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), exercise capacity, as well as profound dyspnea with physical
      exertion. The objective of the present study is to assess the ability of a single inhaled
      dose of RT234 to acutely improve primary CPET measures of CRF and exercise capacity, and to
      lower the sensation of dyspnea with physical exertion compared to baseline CPET measures.
