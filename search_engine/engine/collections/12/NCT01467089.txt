      troublesome adverse events when taking antipsychotic agents. The investigators aim in this
      study to determine if the investigators can conduct examinations for EPS and TD remotely
      using live two-way video. It is potentially beneficial for patients, especially those who are
      located far away from psychiatrists if they could be seen by trained clinicians and assessed
      for EPS and TD via two-way video in the future. Participants will be asked to have a medical
      assessment which consists of simple questions and some examination of their movements via
      two-way video and in person. The investigators will compare the results of video examinations
      with the results of live examinations.
