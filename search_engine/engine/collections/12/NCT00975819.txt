      classified into vascular tumors and malformations. Complicated vascular anomalies can cause
      disfigurement, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality.
      Despite the severity of potential complications, we lack uniform guidelines for the treatment
      and response to treatment of children and young adults with these diseases. There are
      pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in vascular growth and organization, and suggest a therapeutic target
      for patients with complicated vascular anomalies. The overall goal of this trial is to
      objectively determine the effectiveness and safety of the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin* in the
      treatment of children and young adults diagnosed with complicated vascular anomalies. We
      propose a Phase 2 trial with the diagnostic, therapeutic and response criteria experimentally
      determined in this study used as a framework for future Phase 3 clinical trials.
