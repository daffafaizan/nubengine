      and urinary control and it has a pretty common occurrence. It was suggested recently that the
      event is considered a hernia that requires mesh use, which reduces return rates following
      pelvic floor repair. Mesh use is known to cause complications and unwanted side effects, such
      as chronic pain, vaginal network exposure and infection. The degree of complications is
      related directly to the mass of the mesh, and that's why the absorbable meshes were
      developed.Two months after the surgery with absorbable mesh, the mass left in the patient's
      body is half of the initial mesh mass and according to our assumption this effect will
      minimize the extent and intensity of mesh complications compared with conventional ones.

      During the study we will examine medical records of women who have had surgery with pelvic
      floor reconstructive meshes. The cases will be divided according to the mesh type being used.

      A polypropylene mesh (single strand and tunneling wide) trade name "Prolift", and similar
      mesh that contains approximately half of the network mass after being dissolves in two
      months, a trade name "Prolift +" M.

      The number of participants in each group is 120 women. The post-operative follow-up
      examination will include three points in time. After a month, six months and a year later. In
      addition to questionnaires in order to quantify the degree of urinary disturbance, pain after
      surgery and sexual function.
