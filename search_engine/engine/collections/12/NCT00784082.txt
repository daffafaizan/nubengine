      MCP-1, IL-1A, IL-1B, ET-1, IL-4, IL-10, TNFalpha, IFNgamma), hormones from the
      hypothalami-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol, ACTH), and hypothalamic peptids (arginine
      vasopressin, corticotrophin-releasing hormone) will be measured from SCD children treated or
      not with HU (20 treated children, 20 untreated children with a history of vaso-occlusive
      events, 20 asymptomatic children, and 20 healthy African controls).
