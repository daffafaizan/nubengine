      cause of cancer-related death. HCC is characterized by its propensity for portal vein
      invasion. Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) can be detected macroscopically in the portal
      vein in 44% to 62.2% of autopsy cases. The natural history of untreated HCC with PVTT is
      dismal. The median survival of such patients was reported to be 2.7 mouths.

      Non-surgical therapies, such as systemic/regional chemotherapy and transcatheter arterial
      embolization / transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TAE/TACE), are not effective in
      treating HCC with PVTT. With the improvement of surgical techniques, surgical resection has
      been reported to achieve promising results. However, the high rate of recurrence and
      metastasis constitutes one of the most important challenges in improving surgical efficacy
      for HCC with PVTT.

      There is rare report about prevention and treatment of postoperative recurrence and
      metastasis for HCC with macroscopical PVTT patients. We previously found the postoperative
      portal vein infusion chemotherapy (PVIC) and TACE benefited PVTT patients, which required
      further prospective randomized controlled studies with large case number to support our
      findings. The randomized controlled trial was design to investigate the efficacy of the
      different adjuvant chemotherapy strategies after hepatectomy and thrombectomy for HCC and
      PVTT.
