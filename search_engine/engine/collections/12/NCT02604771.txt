    
      This study is aimed to evaluate response rate of the antihypertensive treatment with Thiazide
      Diuretics, calcium antagonist, Angiotensin Converting enzyme Inhibitor, Angiotensin II
      receptor blocker, and Beta Blocker in real life practice, and to collect the following
      Egypt-specific epidemiology data on hypertensive patients: demographic data, patents
      characteristics, and patients' management/treatment.

      Approximately 300 sites will be participating (1 investigator per site; 300 investigators).
      Patients that are to be enrolled will either be newly diagnosed with hypertension, or on
      current antihypertensive treatment, compiling a total of 3000 patients (21 years, or older).
      The study will be conducted in two sequential phases; the first phase will include 150 sites
      from Cairo, Giza and Alexandria aiming to reach 1500 patients followed by a second phase
      which will include 150 sites from Delta and Upper Egypt aiming to reach 1500 patients.
      Epidemiological data collection will take place at a single visit and Laboratory
      Investigations will be requested in the first visit. Patients will be followed for 3 visits
      with the investigator. The investigator will complete a Patient Record Form (PRF) with the
      patient's data: demographics, history, current antihypertensive drug treatment/treatment
      changes, results of physical examination, blood pressure (SBP/DBP), heart rate.
