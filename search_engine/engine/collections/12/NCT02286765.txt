    
      This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial. Up to 20 subjects who
      are na√Øve to Ultherapy for treatment of hyperhidrosis will be enrolled and treated at a 2.0mm
      depth at two different treatment densities (Group A and Group B).

      Group A will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid,
      12 treatment squares, 60 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at
      0.30 J of energy.

      Group B will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid,
      12 treatment squares, 40 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at
      0.30 J of energy.

      Gravimetric sweat production measures and starch iodine tests will be completed at baseline,
      treatment visit #2, and at all follow-ups for all study groups. Digital images of the starch
      iodine test will be obtained. Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores will be
      obtained at baseline, each treatment visit, and at all follow-ups for all study groups.
