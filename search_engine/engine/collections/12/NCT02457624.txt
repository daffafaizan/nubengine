      Healthcare System Gangnam Center. This study is composed of four periods. First, the
      detection rate of gastric premalignant lesions and the correlation between endoscopic and
      serologic diagnosis of premalignant lesions will be analyzed retrospectively from March 2008
      till February 2009 and from March 2013 till February 2014, when the levels of serum
      pepsinogen were achieved from the patients. In the second period from March 2015 till April
      2015, quality assurance program will be activated. Endoscopists will be educated on the
      Kimura-Takemoto classification for chronic atrophic gastritis. After that their diagnosis
      will be tested and they will have feedback and discussion all together. In this period,
      inter-observer agreement rate will be assessed serially. Third, prospective trial will run
      from May 2015 till April 2020, in which all the endoscopists' detection rate of gastric
      premalignant lesion, the correlation between endoscopic and serologic diagnosis of
      premalignant lesions, and their inter-observer agreement will be analyzed. Finally,
      cumulative incidence and mortality rate of gastric cancer and incidence rate of gastric
      dysplasia will be investigated until December 2020.
