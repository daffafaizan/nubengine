        -  Determine the safety and side effects of arsenic trioxide administered in combination
           with thalidomide, dexamethasone, and ascorbic acid in patients with relapsed or
           refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the anticancer effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of anticancer effects in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on bone and immune function in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV continuously and oral ascorbic acid once daily
      on days 1-5 in week 1 and twice weekly in weeks 2-12 and oral thalidomide once daily in weeks
      1-14. Treatment with arsenic trioxide, ascorbic acid, and thalidomide repeats every 14 weeks
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      also receive oral dexamethasone once daily on days 1-4. Treatment with dexamethasone repeats
      every 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
