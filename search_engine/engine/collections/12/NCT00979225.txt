      Aim 1: Expand the functionality of an existing decision support system in use within a
      regional HIE network to incorporate EB pharmacotherapy guidelines and to promote medication
      adherence. Primary care clinicians will receive EB pharmacotherapy suggestions and a
      patient-specific summary of prescription claims data delivered to the point-of-care via fax.
      Care managers will receive alerts delivered via email to encourage patients to arrange
      follow-up clinic appointments because of possible medication non-adherence.

      Aim 2: Implement and evaluate the impact of the two interventions on adherence to EB
      pharmacotherapy recommendations among Medicaid patients with high priority conditions as
      designated by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in ambulatory care settings through a three-arm
      randomized controlled trial.

      Aim 3: Compare resource utilization and assess the economic attractiveness (cost-savings or
      cost-effectiveness) of the interventions to promote medication adherence and EB
      pharmacotherapy.

      Aim 4: Disseminate information regarding the development and impact of the interventions
      through Web teleconferences, professional meetings, educational lectures, and peer review
      journals.
