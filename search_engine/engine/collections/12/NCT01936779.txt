      that affects liver fat metabolism.

      Purpose and design:

      Investigators are asking the research question: "How do specific fatty acids, such as those
      found in fish ((n-3) fatty acids) influence postprandial liver fat metabolism?"

      It is known that n-3 fatty acids lower plasma triglyceride concentrations but it remains
      unclear how this happens.

      To address this research question investigators want to undertake detail physiological
      studies, in a randomised study where individuals will be studied before and after taking n-3
      fatty acids or a placebo oil.
