      adjunct in the management of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS). Retrospective studies have
      shown benefit in terms of reduction of blood loss. However, studies reported in literature
      vary widely in terms of the exact surgical procedure undertaken, in conjunction with the
      radiological intervention. The radiological intervention itself lacks standardization,
      occurring at different anatomical levels, ranging from infrarenal aortic occlusion to
      internal iliac or uterine artery. Furthermore, there have been reported cases of arterial
      thrombosis associated with arterial occlusion.

      We sought to clarify the effectiveness of a standardized approach , where perioperative
      bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion is performed followed by bilateral ureteric
      stenting and caesarean hysterectomy. The control group would undergo the exact procedure,
      excluding internal iliac artery occlusion. Patients would be randomized but neither the
      patient nor surgeon could be blinded.

      The primary outcome would be to demonstrate a three pint or greater reduction in packed cell
      transfusion. Secondary outcomes include a difference in estimated blood loss, additional
      blood product transfusion, unplanned additional surgical procedure, serious complications
      arising from internal iliac artery occlusion, total procedural time and early neonatal
      outcome.
