      Brain Training (EBT) (developed by Laurel Mellin) and "Mindful Moms," (MIND) based on the
      Mindful Motherhood Training (developed by Cassandra Vieten, PhD), Mindfulness-Based-Eating
      and Awareness Training (MB-EAT) (developed by Jean Kristeller, PhD), and other mindfulness-
      and acceptance-based interventions.

      In the first phase of this study, the investigators conducted in-depth focus groups with over
      60 overweight, low to middle-income, pregnant women to learn more about what they might be
      looking for in such an intervention. In the second phase, which began in fall 2010, 48 low-
      to middle-income overweight pregnant women were randomly assigned to one of the
      interventions. Based on the knowledge gained from Phase 2, we refined the MIND intervention
      and are conducting an efficacy trial in Phase 3.

      During Phase 3, we will enroll 220 overweight, low to middle-income, pregnant women in a
      trial of MIND to test feasibility and to examine changes in hypothesized mechanisms (stress,
      opioid tone), non-homeostatic eating, and in health outcomes (abdominal fat, insulin
      sensitivity, weight change) in the intervention group (n=110). Intervention participants will
      complete a battery of psychological and clinical measures (weight, BMI, waist/hip ratio, body
      composition) at baseline, post-intervention, 32-34 weeks gestation, and 3 and 9 months
      postpartum. Control participants (n=110) will complete the same battery of psychological
      measures at baseline and 8-10 weeks after baseline. All study participants will complete
      brief psychological, weight and waist/hip ratio measures at 6 months postpartum.
      Additionally, we will obtain prenatal and labor/delivery medical records for all study
      participants.
