    
      Patients will be included in a follow-up consultation or during a telephone contact prior to
      a consultation.

      The period of follow-up by internet and the date of the next consultation will be fixed. This
      assessment is annual according to current recommendations. In the two months prior to the
      consultation, patients will fill out a questionnaire and transcribe their blood pressure
      self-measurement results as well as their biological assessment on a dedicated, approved
      data-hosting platform (internet application named HERMES). During the consultation, these
      items will be collected again without the knowledge of the results entered by the patient on
      the data hosting site.
