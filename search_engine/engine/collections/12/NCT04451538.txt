      fracture patients aged 70 years or older, 18.8% have malnutrition and 44.6% are at risk of
      malnutrition. Increasing evidence suggest that preoperative nutritional status has a
      significant impact on clinical outcomes of elderly patients following surgery. For example,
      preoperative malnutrition or risk of malnutrition is associated with increased delirium,
      increased non-delirium complications, prolonged hospital stay, high mortality, and even worse
      long-term survival after surgery. We speculate that perioperative nutritional intervention
      may reduce postoperative delirium and improve early and long-term clinical outcomes in
      elderly hip-fracture patients. The purpose of this study is to observe the effect of
      perioperative nutritional intervention on early postoperative delirium and complications as
      well as long-term survival in the patients with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition who
      are scheduled for hip-fracture surgery.
