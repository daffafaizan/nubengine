      sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced
      disease who are chemo naive. Sorafenib has shown an increase in median survival but only
      tumor shrinkage by RECIST criteria. Since much of the morbidity and mortality of this disease
      occurs due to continued tumor growth in an already compromised liver, decreasing the size of
      the tumors might have significant impact on survival. The addition of traditional cytoxic
      agents might cause measureable tumor response and add to the survival benefit already seen
      with sorafenib. Gemcitabine and cisplatin are agents commonly used for systemic treatment of
      this disease and have demonstrated some effectiveness in disease control rate and median time
      to progression. Gemcitabine/Cisplatin have been used safely in combination with sorafenib in
      patients with lung cancer.
