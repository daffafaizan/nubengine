      neuropsychiatric disorders and substance abuse. [I-123] Beta-CIT is a recently developed
      radioligand for SPECT imaging of dopamine and serotonin transporters. [I-123]Beta-CIT SPECT
      has been used at the SPECT-Lab of the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch in over fifty subjects
      without adverse events. Due to the trace concentrations used, a pharmacological effect of
      Beta-CIT is unlikely and has not been observed. The purpose of this study is to use Beta-CIT
      and SPECT to study the expression of dopamine and serotonin transporters in vivo in normal
      controls and various patient populations to address hypothesized abnormalities of the
      transporters in different disorders and to understand the effects of genetic variations in
      the genes of these transporters on their in vivo expression.
