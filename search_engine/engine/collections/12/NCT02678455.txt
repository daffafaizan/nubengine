    
      Dengue viruses (DENV) are the leading arboviral infection globally, with over 2 billion
      people at risk of infection worldwide. The first dengue fever outbreak in Bangladesh occurred
      in 2000, and since then, dengue fever has had a continued presence throughout Bangladesh.
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant live attenuated
      tetravalent dengue virus vaccine admixture TV005 (TetraVax-DV T005) in healthy adults,
      adolescents, and children in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

      The study will enroll four cohorts of participants: adults, adolescents, children, and young
      children. Study researchers will evaluate study data for each cohort before enrolling the
      subsequent cohort.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TV005 vaccine or placebo at study
      entry (Day 0). Additional study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 180, 360, 720, and
      1080. Study visits will include blood collection, physical examinations, and clinical
      assessments. Participants will record and monitor their temperature and symptoms until Day
      14. Study staff will contact participants daily until Day 14; after Day 14, study staff will
      contact participants weekly (and after Day 180, monthly) throughout the study for follow-up
      health monitoring.
