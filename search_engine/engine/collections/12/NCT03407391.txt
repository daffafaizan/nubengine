      prospectively (n=5758-6608). Parental-completion questionnaires will be used to define 'picky
      eating' status at age 3 years, and child and parental feeding behaviours and practices
      throughout the first 2 years of the child's life. Multinomial logistic regression models with
      3 levels of picky eating status (not, somewhat and very picky) as the dependant variables
      will be used to test associations with antecedent variables, first assessing variables from
      pregnancy, and the first and second year of life, separately, then combining all significant
      variables in a final model.
