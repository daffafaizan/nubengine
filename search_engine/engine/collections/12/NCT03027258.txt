      mobile health platform that captures results for HIV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and sickle cell
      genotype obtained from participants during the Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) program;
      store data in a secure, web-based database; encrypt data on a "smart card" which is given to
      participants, and make these data available at the point-of-delivery using a cell-phone
      application to read the "smart card". Data on the web-based database can also be accessed
      directly using the cell phone application. Evidence exists that when clinician have maternal
      records available at the point of delivery, they are more likely to initiate antiretroviral
      prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants, administer the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine with 24
      hours for infants born to women who have positive hepatitis B surface antigen and screen
      infants born to mothers with sickle cell trait to allow early identification and initiation
      of penicillin prophylaxis for infants who have sickle cell disease.
