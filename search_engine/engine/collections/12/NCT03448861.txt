    
      ChroniSense Medical Ltd. is developing a wearable medical multi-parametric monitoring system,
      Polso™. Polso™ provides a number of the parameters employed in various Early Warning Scores
      (EWS), such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), utilised widely in UK hospitals.

      The EWS is a physiological track and trigger system that is generated from multi- parameter
      or aggregate of vital signs measurements for early recognition of clinical deterioration in
      acutely admitted patients. Patients who are admitted into hospital are monitored with
      routinely measurements of these parameters that are manually recorded on a clinical chart.

      The parameters of the NEWS include: 1) respiratory rate pulse rate, 2) oxygen saturations, 3)
      body temperature; 4) systolic blood pressure, 5) heart rate, and 6) level of consciousness.
      Polso™ acquires, derives, and processes a number of physiological parameters. While ECG is
      not currently employed in NEWS, other parameters which are used in NEWS are available in the
      Polso™ system. In cases where manual testing is preferred for any parameter, such as use of
      supplemental oxygen, the individual score can be entered into the system manually. Polso™, as
      a wrist-based device, could enable a degree of flexibility in patient care and management.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the suitability of Polso™ as a data acquisition and
      processing platform capable of providing EWS summaries, against the currently employed NEWS
      system at the Milton Keynes University Hospital (MKUH) Cardiology Unit. The Polso™ will be
      employed strictly as a data-gathering system, and will not be used to influence any clinical
      decisions; the standard NEWS as currently employed will fulfill all its normal clinical
      roles.
