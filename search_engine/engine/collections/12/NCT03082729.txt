      vascular inflammation, cardiometabolic biomarkers and body composition in patients with
      moderate-severe psoriasis. FDG-PET/CT will be used to assess vascular inflammation, with
      multi-volumetric product, tissue-to-background ratio and total atherosclerotic burden, and
      body composition via volumetric quantification. This is a year-long, single arm, open label
      study.
