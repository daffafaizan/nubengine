      among patients who attend Duke Outpatient Clinic (DOC). It is anticipated that, among the
      providers' patient panels, at least 100 and up to 300 with CVD risk and poor CVD medication
      adherence (<0.08 medication possession ratio) will consent to the program.

      Using procedures from the investigators previous studies, the investigators will identify
      potential patients from the EHR, and will identify a pool of potential patients using
      electronic health records, with the goal of administering the program to at least 100
      patients. Patients will be mailed letters, signed by their own provider or medical director
      of DOC, requesting their participation in the programs. The RA will contact patients via
      telephone to explain the study, screen for eligibility, and determine what mode of
      administration individuals prefer to receive the program (SMS, IVR, or email).

      The primary outcome will be that the effectiveness/impact of the proposed adherence program
      will be a 10% improvement in MPR and CVD outcomes (anticipate reducing SBP by 5 mmHg, Hgb a1c
      by 0.5%, LDL-C by 20 mg/dl).
