      Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. They are asked to fill in a bundle of questionnaires
      concerning physical complaints, depression, anxiety (disturbances), pain/disease,
      body/interoceptive awareness, trauma/abuse and personality. Endoscopy will be performed and
      up to 8 biopsies will be obtained from the duodenum. All endoscopies will be performed by an
      experienced endoscopist. Biopsies will be mounted in Ussing chambers and the mucosal
      compartment will be exposed to commercially available fluorescein-conjugated microorganisms.
      Uptake of microorganisms will be evaluated by analyzing the serosal compartment and by
      confocal microscopy of the biopsies. These experiments will also be performed in combination
      with exposure to bile acids separately and jointly, to assess if bacterial translocation can
      be exacerbated by these endogenous luminal factors individually and synergistically.
