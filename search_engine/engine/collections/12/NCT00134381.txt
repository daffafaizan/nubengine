    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if topically applied constituents of green tea
      [caffeine or (-) - epigallocatechin gallate; EGCG] have a protective effect on skin exposed
      to ultraviolet light (UV). In the double-blinded study all subjects will receive 311
      nanometer UVB light at a dose that is 0.5-1.5X their individual minimal erythema dose (MED).
      One part of the experiment will involve applying a topical natural product (caffeine or EGCG)
      and placebo to bilateral symmetric sites. The natural product and the placebo will be applied
      immediately after and at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 25
      hours, and 27 hours after exposure to a 0.5-1.5 MED dose of UV light. Another part of the
      study involves performing skin biopsies. One will be done prior to UVB exposure, 2 will be
      done at 24 hours and 2 more will be done at 48 hours.
