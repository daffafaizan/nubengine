    
      This study will combine the SWEDEHEART registries RIKS-HIA (Registry of Information and
      Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions), SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography
      and Angioplasty Registry) and SEPHIA (the registry for secondary prevention following
      coronary intensive care); and the Swedish National Population Registry (to obtain data
      regarding vital status and date of death), Swedish Cause of Death Register (to separate fatal
      from non-fatal MI), the Swedish Patient Registry (to obtain data on prior medical history)
      and the Swedish Drug Registry (to obtain prescribed medical treatment and filled
      prescriptions).

      The RIKS-HIA database covers all acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated at heart
      intensive care units in Sweden and SCAAR entails all PCI procedures performed across all
      centers in Sweden.

      In this study the investigators will include patients with first time ever of NSTE-ACS and
      STE-ACS and receiving care at cardiac intensive care units and entered in the SWEDEHEART
      registry between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2014. Baseline and in-hospital characteristics
      will be obtained, including peri-procedural anti-thrombotic treatments.

      To assess the incidence rate and fatality of reinfarctions in a contemporary unselected MI
      cohort

      To characterize patients with one and multiple reinfarctions during the observation period
      vs. those without.
