    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation of inflammation assessed by M1/M2
      macrophage polarization determined by tumor immunohistochemistry analysis and [18F] DPA-714
      PET imaging by using qualitative and image texture analysis in patients with triple negative
      breast cancer.

      Patients receive pre-therapeutic diffusion-weighted breast MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging)
      and 18FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography)
      scan within 30 days before enrollment.

      [18F] DPA-714 PET/CT scan is performed before surgery. About 3 MBq/Kg of [18F] DPA-714 are
      injected intravenously, two acquisition sequences are performed following injection and 60
      minutes after injection in order to evaluate early and late tumor uptake of [18F] DPA-714.

      Surgery is scheduled after [18F] DPA-714 PET/CT scan. Tissue samples from breast surgery are
      used to assess M1 and M2 macrophages expression and to perform tumor molecular subtyping by
      Immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor Autoradiography with the TSPO (18 kDa Translocator
      Protein) ligand [18F]DPA-714 will be also assessed on tumor tissue.

      A blood sample is performed before [18F] DPA-714 PET/CT scan in order to assess the
      genotyping of TSPO (18 kDa Translocator Protein) gene.
