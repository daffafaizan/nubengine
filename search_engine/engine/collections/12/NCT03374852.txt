    
      Primary Objective:

      1) To determine if CPI-613 increases overall survival (OS) when used in combination with
      mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary (Exploratory) Objectives:

        1. To assess the safety of CPI-613 + mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with locally
           advanced pancreatic cancer.

        2. To collect tissue specimens for future correlative studies

        3. To estimate median progression free survival (PFS) when CPI- 613 is used in combination
           with mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

        4. To estimate the percent resected when CPI-613 is used in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in
           patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
