      I. To determine if a one-year disease free survival of >= 35% can be achieved among patients
      >= 55 years old with de novo and secondary AML in first complete remission (CR1) who undergo
      nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      identical related donors.

      II. To determine if a day +200 nonrelapse related mortality of < 15% can be achieved among
      patients >= 55 years old with de novo and secondary AML in CR1 who undergo nonmyeloablative
      HSCT from HLA identical related donors.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine (CSP) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      -3 to 56 with taper to day 77. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) PO BID on
      days 0-27.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 28, 56, and 84; months
      6, 12, 18, and 24; and then yearly for 5 years.
