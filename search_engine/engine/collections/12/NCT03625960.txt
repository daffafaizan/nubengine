      papilloma virus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer. Warts can grow, obstruct labor, and
      spread. Patients presenting to the obgyn clinic with perenial warts were randomized to
      treatment with trichloroacetic acid (one of the many types of treatments) or to the treatment
      with cantharidine group. Cantharidine is a vesicant extracted from beetle bugs which
      painlessly causes a small blister to form and cures the patient from the HPV infection
      causing the wart . We compared cosmesis, scar formation, pain and number of treatments
      (visits) as well as effectiveness in both groups.

      Objectives

        1. Determine if cantharone is more effective than trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for removal of
           warts

        2. Compare pain levels (pain during application) for each method

        3. Compare patient satisfaction for each method

        4. Compare scar formation and cosmesis for each method
