      patients with polysomnographic diagnosed OSAS will be enrolled in this prospective
      observational study. All patients would get a DISE because of the before mentioned reasons
      (localisation and severity) although they wouldn't participate in this study. They will get a
      24-h-RR (blood pressure)-measurement, a transthoracic echocardiography, a peak-flow-test and
      routine lab examination including troponin and proBNP before the examination. Furthermore
      they have to fill out the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionaire.

      Before starting the DISE a standard-monitoring (Electrocardiography, pulse oximetry,
      non-invasive blood pressure, patient state index, near infrared spectroscopy, transcutaneous
      CO2 (carbon dioxide), invasive blood pressure) will be established. After applying the
      monitoring the DISE is started by target controlled infusion (Marsh Model) with a sighted
      goal-concentration of 3.0 Âµg/ml Propofol in 5 minutes. While the examination a stabile
      snoring-phase with apnoea/hypopnoea is needed. In this moment a video-endoscopy is started to
      quantify the level of obstruction. After DISE the sedation will end and the patients will be
      transported to the recovery room or postanesthesia care unit (PACU). For specific order of
      events a video recording of the DISE will be realized.
