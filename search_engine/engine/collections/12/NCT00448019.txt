      treatment with the study drugs for 3-4 days and then about 3-1/2 weeks (25 days) of no
      treatment (about 4 weeks total). Treatment with the study drugs will be given for 4 days in a
      row on the first cycle, and 3 days in a row on Cycles 2-6. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will
      receive rituximab through a needle in a vein. On Cycle 1, since it is your first exposure to
      rituximab, it must be given slowly, so it may take 6-8 hours to complete. On the cycles after
      that, it can be given more rapidly, over 3-4 hours. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will be
      given separately through a needle in a vein on Days 2-4 of Cycle 1 and Days 1-3 of Cycles
      2-6. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will each be given over 30 minutes. Bevacizumab will be
      given through a needle in a vein over 90 minutes on Day 3 of Cycle 1. If it is well
      tolerated, the next dose of Bevacizumab will be given over 60 minutes on Day 2 of Cycle 2. If
      the Cycle 2 dose is well tolerated, the next doses of Bevacizumab will be given over 30
      minutes on Day 2 of Cycles 2-6. In addition to the study drugs, you may also be given fluids
      by vein to help flush the kidneys, to help prevent possible kidney damage. You may receive up
      to 6 cycles of treatment. Treatment will be given on an outpatient basis. The injections for
      each daily treatment visit should take less than 6 hours.

      Up to 66 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.
