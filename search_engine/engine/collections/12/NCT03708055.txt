      I. Demonstrate reproducibility of forearm muscle activation and subcutaneous fat measures in
      a healthy convenience sample/population (N= 10).

      II. Demonstrate that measures of muscle activation and signal attenuation by subcutaneous fat
      mass can be conducted in a systematic and reproducible fashion in breast cancer survivors
      prior to and following weight bearing exercise training.

      III. In a cross sectional analysis, describe the level of lean muscle mass, muscle
      activation, strength, insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, and
      inter-individual variability in breast cancer survivors prior to training.

      IV. Describe the level of lean muscle mass, muscle activation, strength, insulin resistance,
      inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, CRP and others), and growth factors (such as myostatin,
      IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and others) in breast cancer survivors following weight bearing exercise
      training.

      V. Evaluate the influence of genetic variability on response to prescribed training in breast
      cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo a weight bearing exercise program in a group 2 days a week and at home 5
      days a week for 8 weeks.
