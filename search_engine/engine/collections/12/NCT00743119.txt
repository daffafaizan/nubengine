      cannabinoid system, however, these effects have et to be clearly elucidated in humans. To
      better understand the potential clinical application of cannabinoids for pain management, the
      following study is designed to determine the analgesic efficacy of smoked marijuana (3.56%
      THC) and oral THC (20 mg) in the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a laboratory model of pain which
      has predictive validity for clinical use of analgesics. Non-treatment seeking marijuana
      smokers will be recruited for a five-session study during which the analgesic, subjective,
      and physiologic effects of cannabinoids will be evaluated. Determining the efficacy of
      cannabinoids in an experimental model of pain will provide important endpoints (i.e., dose,
      route of administration, time course) or this effect to further investigate the potential
      role for clinical use of smoked marijuana and/or oral THC as analgesics.
