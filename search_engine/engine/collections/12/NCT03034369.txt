      a BHI continuum level, which includes minimal collaboration, basic collaboration at a
      distance, basic collaboration on site, close collaboration (partially integrated) and close
      collaboration (fully integrated).

      Twelve-thousand patients will be randomly selected from the 12 clinics to be invited to
      participate in the study. Patients who elect to participate will complete a survey at
      baseline to collect patient-reported outcomes and again twelve months later.

      The Oregon All Providers All Claims (APAC) database will be accessed to analyze financial
      data regarding the patients at baseline and 12 months.

      The hypothesis is that the degree of clinic BHI will predict patient outcomes.
