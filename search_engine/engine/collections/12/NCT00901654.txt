      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the live attenuated, oral
      vaccine ACE527. The study is designed to evaluate 2 doses of the ACE527 in 2 cohorts. Each
      cohort will consist of approximately 18 subjects (healthy subjects), approximately 12 of them
      receiving ACE527 and approximately 6 receiving placebo.

      Within a cohort, the second dose will only be given if safety and tolerability of the first
      dose is acceptable. This assessment will be based on evaluation of data up until Day 7 by the
      Independent Safety Committee (ISC) as per written guidance. The first dose of each cohort
      will be administered during an inpatient stay. Escalation to the next dose level will be
      dependent on an acceptable safety profile of the first dose at the previous dose level, based
      on evaluation of safety data by an Independent Safety Committee (ISC). The decision to
      administer the second dose at the higher level will also require review of the safety and
      tolerability of the second dose at the lower level.

      The second dose will be administered at the outpatient clinic and the subjects will be
      observed for at least 60 minutes after vaccination prior to discharge from unit.
