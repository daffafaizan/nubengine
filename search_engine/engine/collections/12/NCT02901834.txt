      will take part in usability testing of the PainSquad+ prototype. Recruitment will be
      conducted in a single hematology/oncology division of a metropolitan and
      university-affiliated pediatric tertiary care center in Toronto, Canada. This site hosts one
      of the largest cancer programs in North America, with approximately 350 new diagnoses each
      year. Based on our previous research at this site, 72 ± 4% (M ± SD; range = 67-75%) of
      eligible AWC agreed to participate in similar studies (unpublished data). Convenience
      sampling will be used to recruit eligible individuals. The testing procedures will commence
      after eligibility is assessed, informed consent is obtained, and demographic and baseline
      outcome data are collected. Inclusion criteria will be: (a) aged 12-18 years, (b) able to
      speak and read English, (c) actively undergoing cancer treatment on an in- or out-patient
      basis, (d) being at least 3 months from diagnosis and (d) having self-reported pain of any
      intensity in the week immediately prior to recruitment. Exclusion criteria will be: (a) one
      or more major co-morbid (medical or psychiatric) conditions that would preclude use of a
      smartphone, and (b) palliative/end-of-life patients.
