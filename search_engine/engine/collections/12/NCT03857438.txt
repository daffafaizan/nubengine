      bipolar mani/ remission/ health/ simulation and predicts treatment response earlier and
      detect neurocognitive changes during mania/ remission and difference from the healthy
      control. During hospitalization in every follow up day (0th- 3rd- 7th- 14th- 28th day) and
      after discharge on the 3rd month, presence of depressive and manic features for patients was
      evaluated using Young Mania Rating Scale(YMRS) and Montgamery- Asberg Depresyon Scale
      (MADRS). Audiovisual recording is done by a video camera in every follow up day for patients
      and for healthy controls which includes also depression and mania simulation. Cambridge
      Neurophysiological Assessment Battery (CANTAB) were administered to both groups( for patients
      both in the manic phase and in the remission) to assess neurocognitive functions.
