      Each region represents one cluster with 7 community pharmacies located around the University
      Hospital associated with that cluster. In total, 63 community pharmacies will be enrolled,
      with each pharmacy including 20 patients over a 10 month-period. Over the life-time of the
      project, a total of 1260 patients will benefit from either the intervention or from a
      controlled pharmaceutical care according to the period of time they will be enrolled.
