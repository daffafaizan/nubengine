      increasing. Over the last few decades, ureteroscopy has become the most commonly performed
      stone procedure. However the complication rate after ureteroscopy is not insignificant.
      Reducing morbidity after ureteroscopy would improve patient outcomes and reduce health care
      utilization.

      A major contributor to patient morbidity after ureteroscopy is the ureteral stent, which is
      placed at the time of surgery and left in place 1-2 weeks after surgery. The rationale for
      utilizing stents is to prevent urinary obstruction from edema or stone fragments. On the
      other hand, stents cause hematuria, pain, and lower urinary tract symptoms. Additionally,
      stent-related symptoms are often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infections leading to
      unnecessary antibiotic use.

      The clinical utility of ureteral stents after ureteroscopy has not been well studied,
      specifically a stone located in the kidney. Prior studies on stent-less ureteroscopic
      procedures have focused on treatment of ureteral stones and not stones located in the kidney,
      have had restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria, are primarily from single center
      institutions, and most being performed ~15 years ago. Surgical techniques and device
      innovations have changed the procedure since that time. To date, there have been only 2
      studies that included stone located in the kidney showing no difference in unplanned hospital
      revisits, however both combined analyses with ureteral stones and selection bias was an issue
      for both studies. In addition, there is a lack of studies assessing opiate use, impact of
      quality of life with stent placement, and loss of work related to stent placement
