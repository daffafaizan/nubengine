    
      This open-label randomized control trial conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta,
      Indonesia, aimed to determine the effect of G-CSF to improve PELD score and nutritional
      status of pediatric patients with liver cirrhosis prior to liver transplantation. A total of
      52 pediatric patients with liver cirrhosis, malnutrition and PELD score between 10-25 will be
      collected and divided into intervention group and control group. The intervention group will
      be given a subcutaneous injection of G-CSF 5μg/kg/day for 5 days consecutively, followed by a
      single dose every 3 days up to 12 times throughout the trial. Additionally, both the
      intervention and control group receive standard liver cirrhosis treatment. Randomization is
      done using block randomization.

      The patients will be clinically monitored and evaluated for anthropometric changes (body
      weight, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness),
      complete blood count, absolute neutrophil count, liver function tests, cytokines (IL-10,
      TNF-α), Procalcitonin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), CD34+ cell count and PELD score
      (albumin, bilirubin, prothrombin and international normalized ratio values).

      Data analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0.0.
