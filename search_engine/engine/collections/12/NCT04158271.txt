      of hypoxemia and the potential of a lost airway. Maintaining continuous airway access during
      the exchange by incorporating an airway exchange catheter (AEC) or similar device may
      reliably lessen exchange risk, especially in the known or suspected difficult airway patient,
      by providing a conduit to facilitate ETT passage into the trachea. We evaluated some approven
      / etablished techniques in a Simulator based study design.
