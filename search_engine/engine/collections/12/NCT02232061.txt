    
      This was a multi-national, long-term safety study. Patients enrolled in study FTY720D2406 who
      experienced a cardiovascular event within 24-hours of fingolimod treatment initiation which
      led to overnight monitoring or met serious adverse event criteria, were eligible to
      participate in this study.

      Patients who experienced a qualifying event in study CFTY720D2406 started study CFTY720D2409
      approximately 6 months after the occurrence of the CFTY720D2406 qualifying event.

      Patients underwent mandatory assessments on a 6-monthly basis including 12-lead ECG, vital
      signs. Other assessments were performed as per routine practice.

      The primary objective of the study was to estimate the long-term cardiovascular risk of
      fingolimod in patients who experienced a cardiovascular event during treatment initiation.

      The study has no stand-alone secondary objective. However data from the CFTY720D2409 and
      CFTY720D2406 studies will be pooled to supplement CFTY720DD2406 study and support its primary
      and secondary objectives of evaluating the safety profile of fingolimod.

      The pooled data will be appended to this result upon completion of FDA submission.
