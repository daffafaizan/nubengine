      commonly recognized as a determinant of obesity risk in women, there is strong evidence from
      large randomized controlled trials that estradiol (E2)-based hormone therapy (HT) reduces
      weight gain by about 40% in postmenopausal women. Importantly, there is also strong evidence
      that E2 reduces abdominal fat accumulation, a fundamental component of the Metabolic
      Syndrome. Some studies suggest risks of HT outweigh the benefits for some women. However,
      this does not negate the importance of learning the mechanisms by which E2 influences energy
      balance and fat patterning.

      This study uses gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog therapy to determine the effects
      of chronic (5-month) sex hormone suppression on resting energy expenditure (REE), altered
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and fat gain.

      It is hypothesized that REE will be reduced in response to chronic sex hormone suppression,
      promoting fat gain. It is also hypothesized that stress-induced
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis activity will be amplified during sex hormone
      suppression; altered HPA axis activity leading to cortisol excess causes abdominal fat
      accumulation. Finally, it is hypothesized that E2 add-back therapy will lessen these
      responses.

      Participants will be randomized so that half of the women in each treatment arm will
      participate in an exercise training program, consisting of progressive resistance exercise to
      prevent the decline in fat-free mass (FFM) and the increase in fat mass that has been
      observed in young women in response to GnRH analog therapy.
