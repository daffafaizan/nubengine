    
      PREPL is defective in hypotonia cystinuria syndrome and in isolated PREPL deficiency. The
      investigators have constructed a blood test to evaluate PREPL activity in patients with
      possible PREPL deficiency.

      The study will determine normal values for age (0-18) for PREPL activity in blood.

      Also, patients with a clinical phenotype that overlaps with PREPL deficiency (including
      patients with known primary PREPL deficiency and Prader-Willi syndrome) will be evaluated for
      PREPL activity in blood.

      A last part of the study will involve muscle biopsies during elective anesthesia/surgery for
      other reasons. There will be 2 groups: patients without signs of PREPL deficiency undergoing
      surgery (controls) and patients with Prader-Willi syndrome undergoing anesthesia or surgery
      (patients). The control group will be age-matched to the hypotonia group. In the muscle
      biopsies, PREPL activity and expression will be evaluated.
