      placebo. Treatment will consists of two phases (acute treatment and maintenance). In the
      acute treatment phase, participants will receive fluoxetine or placebo daily for 12 weeks.
      Participants will be followed every 2 weeks. In the Maintenance phase, participants showing
      significant improvement after 12 weeks may continue treatment for an additional 6 months. In
      this phase, participants are followed every 4 weeks.

      Participants who do not improve during the acute treatment phase may receive open fluoxetine,
      or another appropriate medication, for 3 months.
