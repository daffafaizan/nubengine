    
      This is a follow-up study to investigate the change of immunogenicity and lesion condition in
      subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 who have enrolled and completed
      GX-188E phase I study.

      Subjects will make visits at week 48 (V1) to week 228 (V8) every 6 months after the final
      administration of GX-188E.

      The endpoints are to evaluate the change of immune response, involved lesion and infection
      status compared to that of the final visit in phase I study.
