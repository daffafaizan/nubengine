      residing in rural South Carolina who will assist with improving the usability of tablet
      computers. In addition, we will implement a pilot trial of the TABLETS (Tablet-Aided
      BehavioraL intervention Effect on Self-management skills) intervention for diabetes, using
      motivational strategies, among rural African Americans. The proposed project is designed to
      address 3 important issues: recruitment for a hard-to-reach population, utility of
      technology-enabled intervention, and development of a tablet-aided intervention tailored to
      understand best practices for diabetes self-management
