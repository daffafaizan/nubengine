      at the baseline, between the MDD subjects of LDQS and DBHS; (3) after 6-week venlafaxine
      administration, between the MDD subjects of LDQS and DBHS. 50 subjects in T Group and 25 in C
      Group are recruited in the study and the main laboratory tests include High Performance
      Liquid Chromatography(HPLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrum(GCMS) and neuroimaging DTI
      technology.
