      participants of a cardiac rehabilitation programme in Norway with home Internet access and
      mobile phone, who in monthly clusters are randomized to the control or the intervention
      condition. Participants have access to a website with information regarding cardiac
      rehabilitation, an online discussion forum and an online activity calendar. Those randomized
      to the intervention condition, receive in addition tailored content based on models of health
      behaviour, through the website and mobile text messages. The objective is to assess the
      effect of the intervention on maintenance of self-management behaviours after the
      rehabilitation stay. Main outcome is the level of physical activity one month, three months
      and one year after the end of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. The randomization of
      clusters is based on a true random number online service, and participants, investigators and
      outcome assessor are blinded to the condition of the clusters.

      The study suggests a theory-based intervention that combines models of health behaviour in an
      innovative way, in order to tailor the delivered content. The users have been actively
      involved in its design, and because of the use of Open-Source software, the intervention can
      easily and at low-cost be reproduced and expanded by others. Challenges are the recruitment
      in the elderly population and the possible underrepresentation of women in the study sample
