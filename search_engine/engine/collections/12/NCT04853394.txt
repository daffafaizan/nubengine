      in Moscow, including bazaars and other work sites. In both study arms, the recruited men
      (index participants) will be required to recruit two eligible MWID peers for interviews prior
      to being interviewed themselves. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the peer
      educator intervention program or the health education intervention program. After
      peer-recruited network members are enrolled and interviewed, the index participant will
      participate in the peer educator training or the control group activities. All participants
      and recruited network members will then be followed and re-interviewed at 3-month intervals
      for one year to assess changes in risky drug, alcohol, and sexual behaviors due to
      intervention participation and through diffusion to network members. The investigators will
      also collect data from voluntary HIV and HCV testing conducted at 6 months (HCV only) and at
      12 months (HIV and HCV) post-intervention.
