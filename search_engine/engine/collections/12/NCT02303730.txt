    
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active controlled, multi-center clinical
      trial to investigate whether exenatide is superior to insulin glargine in reducing liver fat
      content in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and concomitant
      NAFLD.Patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant NAFLD from 18-70 years of age, with
      inadequate glycaemic control defined as 7% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 10% and BMI≥24kg/ m2 at the time of
      screening. Patients should be on diet and exercise but drug treatment naive, no use of any
      glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) analogues or insulin within 3 months before enrolment.Patients
      will have an screening period 2 weeks, and a 24-week open label treatment period.

      All demographic data variables collected by descriptive analysis tests are used. Qualitative
      variables use absolute frequency and percentage, and numeric variables use average, mean,
      median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, quartiles, etc. Unless specifically stated,
      statistical significance will be defined as P<0.05 in the whole analysis procedure.For the
      primary endpoint of this study, superiority test will be applied to the quantitative data of
      these two groups. For secondary and exploratory efficacy variables, difference test will be
      used to analyse repeated measurement data from two groups. For essential Safety parameters,
      difference test will be used to analyse the differences between two groups.The analysis of
      all primary and secondary endpoints of efficacy and safety must be based on the Full Analysis
      Set (FAS). As supporting evidence, the analysis of primary endpoint variables must also
      comply with the Pre-protocol (PPS) Analysis.
