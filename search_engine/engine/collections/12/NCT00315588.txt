    
      1. To reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency by islet cell transplantation, in
           patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who have a stable kidney allograft;

        2. To eliminate the incidence of hypoglycemic coma and unawareness by islet cell
           transplantation;

        3. To assess long-term function of successful islet cell transplants;

        4. To determine whether the natural history of the microvascular, macrovascular and
           neuropathic complications of Diabetes Mellitus are altered following successful
           transplantation of islet cells.

        5. To assess the effect of exenatide to improve islet graft function and survival in
           subjects that demonstrate partial graft loss and have returned to using exogenous
           insulin.

        6. To assess the ability of exenatide to improve islet survival at time of islet
           transplantation
