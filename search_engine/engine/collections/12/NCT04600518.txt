    
      The safety and effectiveness of nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay have been evaluated with
      stage II and III advanced gastric cancer patients based on the 6th of the American Joint
      Committee on Cancer (AJCC) through discovery clinical trial (418 patients) and confirmatory
      clinical trial (684 patients).

      The goal of this study, a retrospective, multi-center, single-blind, pivotal trial, is to
      assess clinical equivalence with stage II and III advanced gastric cancer based on the 6th
      and 8th of the AJCC and to evaluate prognostic equivalence between surgery only group and
      adjuvant chemotherapy group in Low risk group.

      The study will follow these procedures; Sample screening, Sample Preparation and Sample
      Criteria Evaluation, Sample enrollment, nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay (gastric cancer
      prognosis prediction), Prognostic Result Report, and Evaluation of Clinical Performance.
