      sleepiness can be a major contributor to decreased quality of life, and even mortality,
      patients frequently grow habituated to their sleepiness, ignoring it and any underlying
      disorder. One scarcely explored potential consequence that could motivate patients to address
      sleep disorders is a sleepy facial appearance. No peer-reviewed literature, to our knowledge,
      has explored whether inadequate or insufficient sleep actually causes changes facial
      appearance. No published literature has examined the extent to which treatment for sleep
      disorders might improve such facial changes, and perhaps motivate patients to treat their
      sleep disorders.

      To address these questions in a preliminary manner, therefore, the investigators propose to
      use cutting-edge photographic technology to assess subtle changes in facial appearance. The
      investigators will recruit 20 sleepy adult patients who are diagnosed with obstructive sleep
      apnea, an ideal disease model in which subjects can be tested before and after alleviation of
      severe sleepiness by home use of continuous positive airway pressure. Results of this pilot
      study could show for the first time that successful treatment of a chronic sleep disorder
      improves facial features commonly perceived as an undesirable sign of sleepiness.
