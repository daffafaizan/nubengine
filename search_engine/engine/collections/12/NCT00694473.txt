      hours with the Freestyle Navigator continuous glucose monitor. The device display will be
      disabled so that continuous glucose monitoring results will not be available to care givers,
      although low (<60 mg/dL) and high (>250 mg/dL) threshold audio alarms will be enabled. Blood
      glucose monitoring will be performed according to the usual practice for patients treated
      with intensive insulin therapy in each intensive care unit, except that additional blood
      glucose measurements will be performed in response to Freestyle Navigator threshold alarm.
      All blood glucose management decisions will be made according to intensive insulin therapy
      protocol in each unit. Freestyle Navigator data will be downloaded from the device after each
      subject has completed the monitoring period. Blood glucose values obtained in the course of
      usual care, or in response to Freestyle Navigator threshold alarms, will be compared with
      time-matched Freestyle Navigator values to assess device accuracy and alarm sensitivity and
      specificity.
