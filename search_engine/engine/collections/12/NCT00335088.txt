      study. The study will be prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, and randomized.
      Patients will be randomly allocated to prophylactic local therapy with either moxifloxacin
      and povidone iodine or povidone iodine alone before surgery. For patients treated with
      povidone iodine alone a placebo will also be given. Lacrimal sac and eye lid cultures will be
      obtained before the local therapy and just before surgery. All patients will be followed for
      6 weeks for symptoms and signs of infection. Bacterial and fungal culture results will be
      compared between the 2 groups.
