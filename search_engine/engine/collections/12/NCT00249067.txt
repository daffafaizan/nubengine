      secondary to left-to-right heart shunt lesions. The treatment group will be children who have
      received carvedilol. The control or comparison groups will be patients who have received
      either digoxin/furosemide or captopril for this indication. Charts will be reviewed of
      patients who have been treated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and as outpatients by
      Sibley Heart Center Cardiology between September 2000 and October 2005. Patients will have
      been started on carvedilol prior to April 1, 2005 and only information up to October 1, 2005
      will be used for this study. We will review approximately 50 charts for this study.

      We will evaluate the effectiveness of these medications at reducing symptoms of CHF.
