      B3 system and pressure support as well as Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) settings
      suggested by the B5 system, i.e. balancing under and over support based upon physiological
      models and simple clinical measures, are consistent with keeping patients within appropriate
      levels of support as assessed by the ratio between airwaiy pressure generated by the
      respiratory muscles (Pmus) and the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) (Pmus/MIP), the ratio
      between the inspiratory time (TI) and total respiratory time (TTOT) (TI/TTOT) and the
      Tension-Time index (TTi), these being obtained using less frequently used esophageal catheter
      measurements.
