      demonstrate non-inferiority and safety compared to drug-eluting stent alone for treatment of
      coronary artery stenosis.

      We think that inappropriate drug delivery to diseased vessel due to stent strut might affect
      the efficacy of drug-eluting balloon. Therefore, we design a clinical study with a different
      protocol, that is, drug-eluting balloon first and then bare metal stent implantation in
      comparison to drug-eluting stent.
