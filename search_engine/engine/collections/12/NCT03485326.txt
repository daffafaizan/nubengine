    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional study. The study will enroll about
      1700 Chinese patients diagnosed as NSCLC and treated with osimertinib at least one dose. The
      investigator in an observational study cannot intervene in the treatment. The prescribing
      doctor is in charge of prescribing or discontinuation of osimertinib. It is planned that all
      eligible patients who received at least one dose of osimertinib at the participating sites
      will be enrolled until 1700 patients has been recruited.

      The recruited patients will be followed up according to standard clinical practice. They will
      be tracked up to 30 days after discontinuation of osimertinib treatment, or 12 months after
      study enrolment, whichever comes earlier. For patients who accrued SAE, the SAE will be
      followed up until the outcome is defined, or the study is terminated, whichever comes
      earlier. The study would be terminated 12 months after the last patient is enrolled.

      The objective of this non-interventional study is to monitor the safety profile of
      osimertinib in Chinese NSCLC patients in real world clinical practice.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of all adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The
      second endpoints include the severity for AEs, the incidence of all AEs, AESIs, SAEs, the
      incidence of AEs for elderly population (age â‰¥ 65 years old), and AEs leading to
      osimertinib-associated interruption, dose reduction, discontinuation, and death
