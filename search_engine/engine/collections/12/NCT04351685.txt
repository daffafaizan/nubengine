    
      The trial is designed as a phase III, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, single
      administration, active-controlled, parallel-group design with two groups of newborn infants
      receiving either VPM1002 or BCG SII (1:1 allocation) to assess the efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of VPM1002 against Mtb infection.

      Healthy male or female newborn infants will be centrally randomized to receive the allocated
      vaccine, stratified by the HIV status of the mother. Single dose of VPM1002 or BCG SII will
      be administered (within 14 days of birth) strictly intradermally.
