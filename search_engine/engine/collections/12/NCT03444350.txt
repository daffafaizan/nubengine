      as a full-mouth clinical trial. The duration of the study was 1 month.

      The study was performed with two groups; The Test Group, and the Control Group. SRP plus
      gaseous ozone [1 W (100 mJ, 10 Hz), (n=20)] was applied to the Test Group.

      The Control Group, on the other hand, had SRP plus placebo (n=20). The patients were
      distributed in random order to the 2 groups (each group had 20 patients). One patient in the
      Ozone Group and 2 patients in the Control Group left the study.

      The following clinical periodontal parameters were performed immediately before SRP
      (baseline), and 1 month after treatment for each test and control groups. Plaque index, GI,
      PD and CAL were recorded. All clinical parameter measurements were used a manual periodontal
      probe (PCP- 12, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).

      The total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, nitric oxide, 8-hidroxi-deoksiguanosine,
      myeloperoxidase, glutathione, malondialdehyde and transforming growth factor-beta levels were
      determined in the saliva samples.
