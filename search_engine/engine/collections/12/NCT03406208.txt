      programs tailored for patients with neurofibromatosis on quality of life and psychosocial
      functioning. We will also examine the degree to which treatment-dependent improvements in
      quality of life are mediated by improvements in depression, anxiety, distress, mindfulness,
      gratitude, social support, empathy, optimism, coping, pain intensity and pain interference.
