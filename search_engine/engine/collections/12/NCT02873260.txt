    
      Dengue infection ranging from mild illness to life-threatening disease is widespread in most
      tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection with any of the four serotypes of
      dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) can cause dengue illness. TetraVax-DV-TV005
      (referred to as TV005) is a live attenuated recombinant tetravalent dengue virus vaccine
      developed to protect against all four dengue virus serotypes. This study will evaluate the
      ability of a single dose of TV005 to protect against infection with rDEN3Δ30, a naturally
      attenuated DENV-3, given 6 months following vaccination with TV005.

      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection. At
      Day 0 (study entry), participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the TV005
      vaccine or placebo. On Day 180, all participants will receive the rDEN3Δ30 virus. All
      participants will record their temperature 3 times a day for 16 days after each vaccination.
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 184,
      186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. Study visits will include physical
      examinations and blood collection.
