    
      All images will be collected using the Heidelberg Spectralis system (Heidelberg Engineering,
      Heidelberg, Germany) according to the prespecified imaging protocols. Blue-fundus
      autofluorescence (excitation wavelength at 488 nm and barrier filter at 500 nm) images and
      SD-OCT images will be obtained after pupil dilation.

      The OCT recording protocol will consist of a sequence of 37 horizontal sections, spaced
      120-µm apart, covering an area of 20° or 30° horizontally by 15° vertically, and a sequence
      of 24 radial sections recorded in the high-resolution (HR) mode simultaneously with infrared
      (IR) images.

      In addition, simultaneous B-FAF/OCT images will be acquired (horizontal, and vertical OCT
      sections, centered on the fovea and recorded in the HR mode).

      The same OCT/FAF protocol will be used for the study eye and for the fellow eye.

      For the study eyes that had been examined in the past, the ''Follow-up'' function will be
      used in addition to the prespecified protocol to evaluate if any changes had occurred since
      the last scan.

      Multiple other morphological characteristics will be analyzed using OCT imaging, including
      the status of the posterior cortex, the presence of operculum, the integrity/disruption of
      the external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and the central and minimal foveal
      thickness (CFT and mFT respectively). The latter will be defined as the thinnest part of the
      fovea within the foveal pit identified by examining radial scans whereas the former will be
      measured in relation to the highest point of the foveal bulge.

      All measurements will be performed using the Spectralis built-in manual caliper function at
      high magnification after adjusting the scale to 1:1 µm except for CFT, which will be
      calculated using the automated ''thickness map'' function of the Heidelberg Eye Explorer.
