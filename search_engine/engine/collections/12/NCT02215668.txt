      and pain after the examination, evaluating the impact of the intervention in a group of
      patients undergoing upper limb exercise (SLE), compared to another group women not subject
      exposure (MNE), and another group with lower limb exercise (LLE). This study is a randomized
      controlled trial, whose intervention will be a sequence of exercises body warming and muscle
      stretching, performed systematic manner and supervised by a physical educator. It is expected
      to find in this study a possible impact of physical exercise in reducing pain after
      mammography examination. The results will be checked by study association between the level
      of physical activity, body mass index, breast density and reducing the pain effect between
      groups for comparison of means and variances of values of the visual analogue scale (VAS).
