    
      Both randomised groups are treated with surgery for complete resection following guideline
      recommendations and including median laparotomy, complete adhesiolysis, hysterectomy,
      bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and (partial) resection of all affected organs
      (e.g. small or large bowel, peritoneum, spleen, pancreas, peritoneum, urinary tract etc.) as
      well as pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy if indicated. Patients with significant pleural
      effusion (>500 mL in the right chest or any pleural effusion in the left chest, assessed
      either through ultrasound or CT scan) need to undergo video assisted thoracoscopy or open
      assessment of the pleura prior or during debulking surgery to detect and if possible remove
      intrathoracic disease.

      Group 1: Primary debulking surgery Patients allocated to the primary debulking group undergo
      surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum and taxane based chemotherapy.

      Recommended systemic treatment Group 1:

      It is recommended to start systemic treatment after sufficient regeneration from surgery
      [45], which will be ideally 2 to 6 weeks (but at the latest 8 weeks) after surgery. The
      following treatments are recommended:

        1. Participation in a prospective randomized trial, as long as participation is possible in
           case of randomization in either arm of the current study

        2. Carboplatin AUC 5-6 / paclitaxel 175 mg/m² q21 / bevacizumab 15mg/KG q21, 6 cycles
           followed by bevacizumab maintenance therapy for a total of 15 months or until disease
           progression.

        3. Carboplatin AUC 5-6 / paclitaxel 175 mg/m² q21, 6 cycles. Substitution of paclitaxel by
           docetaxel (75mg/m²) in cases of contraindications to paclitaxel is possible.
           Maintenance/consolidation therapy inside prospective trials or according to national
           standard treatments is allowed. Additional treatment outside prospective studies is not
           recommended.

        4. Carboplatin AUC 5 - 6, q21 , 6 cycles in the case of contraindications of combination
           chemotherapy

      Group 2: Interval debulking surgery Patients allocated to the interval debulking surgery
      group undergo biopsy to confirm ovarian cancer and then 3 cycles of neoadjuvant preoperative
      platinum and taxane based chemotherapy. Then interval debulking surgery is performed followed
      by 3 cycles of postoperative platinum and taxane based chemotherapy

      Recommended systemic treatment Group 2:

      It is recommended to start systemic treatment as soon as possible after biopsy confirmation
      of ovarian cancer.

      The following treatments are recommended for neoadjuvant chemotherapy:

        1. Participation in a prospective randomized trial, as long as participation is possible in
           case of randomization in either arm of the current study

        2. Carboplatin AUC5-6 / paclitaxel 175 mg/m² q21, 3 cycles. Substitution of paclitaxel by
           docetaxel (75mg/m²) in cases of contraindications to paclitaxel is possible.

        3. Carboplatin AUC 5-6, q21 , 3 cycles in the case of contraindications of combination
           chemotherapy

      It is recommended to start postoperative chemotherapy after sufficient regeneration from
      interval debulking surgery, which will be ideally 2 to 6 weeks after surgery. The following
      treatments are recommended:

        1. Participation in a prospective randomized trial, as long as participation is possible in
           case of randomization in either arm of the current study

        2. Carboplatin AUC 5-6 / paclitaxel 175 mg/m² q21 / bevacizumab 15mg/KG q21, 3 cycles
           followed by bevacizumab maintenance therapy for a total of 15 months or until disease
           progression.

        3. Carboplatin AUC5-6 / paclitaxel 175 mg/m² q21, 3 cycles. Substitution of paclitaxel by
           docetaxel (75mg/m²) in cases of contraindications to paclitaxel is possible.
           Maintenance/consolidation therapy inside prospective trials or according to national
           standard treatments is allowed. Additional treatment outside prospective studies is not
           recommended.

        4. Carboplatin AUC 5-6, q21 , 3 cycles in the case of contraindications of combination
           chemotherapy
