      hole when the needle is removed after the biopsy. However, pneumothorax may occur during the
      needle insertion as the visceral pleura is punctured or during the biopsy procedure before
      needle removal. Prevent such leakage, the investigators planned to inject autologous blood
      into the extrapleural space to prevent pneumothorax during needle entry. The extrapleural
      autologous blood injection (EPABI) is expected to form a space-occupying hematoma pressing on
      visceral pleura as a sealant. The investigators planned to test the EPABI method in a
      prospective single-center randomized controlled study design.
