      Once the sixth patient has completed 21 days of treatment, withdrawn due to toxicity, or
      died, a formal review will be undertaken by the sponsor (AGMT). Enrolment will be halted
      until review is completed. If one (1) treatment related death is reported or three (3) or
      more patients experience CTC grade 4 events other than neutropenia, anemia, or
      thrombocytopenia, the study will be stopped for further recruitment. If the stopping criteria
      are not met, enrollment will be continued. A futility analysis will be conducted when the
      first 10 patients have been evaluated for response: If at least 2 patients had an objective
      response (CR or PR), the study will be continued.

      The combination treatment will be repeated for up to 3 cycles. The first response assessment
      (including PET-CT) will be performed after the first cycle of obinutuzumab-venetoclax and
      patients with at least stable disease (SD) or better will be given another 2 cycles of
      therapy and then have assessment after a total of 3 cycles. Patients with complete or partial
      remission (CR, PR) after 3 cycles of therapy will either go on to transplant or receive 9
      further cycles of the combination therapy (if transplant ineligible). Patients with
      progressive disease at any time-point or stable disease after 3 cycles will be taken off
      study.
