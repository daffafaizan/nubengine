      (Prednisolone) to prevent complications. The best treatment for hemangiomas is not known and
      there are no medications approved by the FDA for treatment of hemangiomas. Also, the best
      method to measure the response of hemangioma to treatment is not known. Patients enrolling on
      this study will be randomly assigned to receive either daily Prednisolone by mouth or weekly
      Vincristine in a vein. Response to treatment will be monitored by clinical exams every two
      weeks and by an MRI at study entry and six and twelve weeks later. Patients with evidence of
      progressive disease (larger hemangiomas) on the week 6 MRI will be switched to the other drug
      to complete a total of 12 weeks of therapy. Side effects of each medication will be monitored
      closely determined from histories, physical exams, blood tests and other studies as
      necessary. Participation in this study will last up to 12 weeks and follow up for protocol.
