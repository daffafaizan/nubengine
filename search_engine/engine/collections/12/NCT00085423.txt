      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in lymphodepleted patients with metastatic
           melanoma treated with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and high-dose interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the quality and quantity of lymphocyte recovery in these patients during and
           after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to disease progression and survival in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive lymphodepleting therapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1
      and 2 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 3-7. Patients then receive high-dose
      interleukin-2 IV every 8 hours (14 doses) on days 8-12 and 22-26. Patients also receive
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 8 and continuing until blood counts
      recover. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
