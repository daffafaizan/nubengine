      pressure therapy on Assisting Hand Assessment ("AHA") performance in Cerebral Palsy (CP). To
      perform this study, 80 CP patients aged of 5 to 10 years old will be included in a
      multicentric, double blind, prospective parallel-group randomized study. Treatment will be a
      pressure therapy using a LYCRAÂ® compressive sleeve initially used in burn therapy. Primary
      outcome is to increase of 60% of AHA performance. The secondary outcome are to increase
      Quality of Upper Extremity Skill Test (QUEST), quality of life and improve Somatosensory
      Evoked Potentials (SEP)
