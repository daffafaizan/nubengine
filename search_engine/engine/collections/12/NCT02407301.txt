      insufficiency due to reduced mobility of one true vocal fold.

      A questionnaire will be used to collect participants' information. Demographic information
      such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, weight, and a major complaint (dysphonia and/or
      dysphagia) and medical history information determining the eligibility for participation will
      be collected from the participant. Participant's medical and surgical history specifically
      related to the diagnosis and the etiology of reduced vocal fold mobility will be obtained
      from the participant's medical record.

      Videolaryngoscopy will be performed as part of standard clinical care. Vocal fold image and
      cough airflow will be recorded simultaneously during voluntary cough production with the
      flexible endoscope in nasopharynx. A second part of the study will include spirometry and
      expiratory muscle strength assessments. Video images of the vocal fold movement during vowel
      phonation and cough production will be recorded and stored on a CD for later analysis. The
      cough airflow recordings will be displayed, stored, and analyzed using LabChart software for
      Windows.
