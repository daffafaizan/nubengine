      examine the feasibility of the proposed study parameters in a total of 10 completers. In a
      crossover design, participants will be tested under 5 conditions: 0.2 mg nicotine delivered
      over 2.5 minutes (5 pulsed-nicotine deliveries), 0.2mg nicotine delivered over 10 min (20
      pulsed-nicotine deliveries), 1.0 mg nicotine delivered over 2.5 minutes (5 pulsed-nicotine
      deliveries) and 1.0 mg nicotine delivered over 10 min (20 pulsed-nicotine deliveries). The
      main outcome measures will be self-report drug effects and urges to smoke cigarettes.

      The investigators hypothesize that the abuse potential and alleviation of smoking urges are
      produced by nicotine as a function of nicotine dose and delivery rate.
