      from cyclosporine to alefacept. Patients in the study are well controlled on cyclosporine and
      desire to switch to alefacept. The study is done in three phases. In Phase 1 (12 week
      duration) the two drugs will be overlapped, with cyclosporine slowly tapering. Both drugs
      will be discontinued after 12 weeks. In Phase 2 (12 weeks duration), patients are off both
      drugs. In Phase 3 (24 weeks long), patients are on a second course of alefacept alone for 12
      weeks and then off for 12 weeks. Topical and UV light treatments are allowed throughout the
      study. Total length of study is one year.
