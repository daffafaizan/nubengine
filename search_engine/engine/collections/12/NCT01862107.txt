      and plasma. We are planning to collect a small amount of additional CSF and blood on subjects
      who are already going to have a lumbar puncture as part of their research or clinical care at
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This will allow us to study whether there is an
      association between neurological diseases and biomarkers, help identify novel pathogens
      infecting the central nervous system, and better enable us to understand the immune response
      to infections under future protocols. CSF and blood as well as clinical data associated with
      the samples will be stored securely.
