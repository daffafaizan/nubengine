      provide adequate security while minimizing complications. This study tests the hypothesis
      that use of an endotracheal tube fastener would reduce complications among critically ill
      adults undergoing endotracheal intubation. This hypothesis will be tested in a pragmatic,
      single center, randomized trial comparing the effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal
      tube fastener (Hollister) among critically ill adults requiring intubation and mechanical
      ventilation for at least 24 hours.
