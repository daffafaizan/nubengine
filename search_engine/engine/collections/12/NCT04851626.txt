      completed assessment questionnaires and were recruited from a variety of social media sites
      related to persistent pelvic pain and randomly allocated to either control or hypnotic
      intervention groups. The intervention group completed a seven week online hypnotic
      intervention. The control group received no intervention. Both groups completed assessment
      and concluding questionnaires related to demographic information and the outcomes of
      interest. This included measures for anxiety, depression, pain, coping styles, pain related
      disability, pain catastrophizing and suggestibility. The results of the intervention and
      waitlist control groups were compared using linear mixed-effects modelling. Suggestibility
      was screened for at baseline using the Short Suggestibility Scale, and included in a
      secondary set of linear effects modelling.
