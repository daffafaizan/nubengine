      standard chemotherapy in the front-line treatment of women with HER2 positive metastatic
      breast cancer, benefit appeared to accrue to those patients whose tumors expressed the HER2
      oncoprotein at the 3+ level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or those patients whose tumors
      demonstrated evidence of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      testing. Similarly, when Herceptin速 was used as a single therapy in women with metastatic
      breast cancer that had progressed following cytotoxic chemotherapy, 3+ overexpression of
      HER2, but not 2+ expression, was associated with response to treatment. These and other
      studies have led to the recommendation that Herceptin速 should be administered to patients
      with breast cancer whose tumors exhibit 3+ overexpression or gene amplification. This study
      will evaluate whether treatment of patients with tumors that would not be expected to respond
      to Herceptin速 therapy, namely those that lack HER2 gene amplification and express the
      oncoprotein at the 2+ level by IHC, may benefit from the use of the anti-HER2 monoclonal
      antibody, MGAH22. If 5 or more responses are seen in 41 evaluable patients, then further
      clinical development of margetuximab will be justified.
