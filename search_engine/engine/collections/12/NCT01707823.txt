      I. To determine whether ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) 325 mg inhibits prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
      biosynthesis in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cyclooxygenase
      (COX) catalytic activity will be determined by measuring the metabolite of PGE2,
      11alpha-hydroxy-9,12-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20 dioic acid (PGE-M) in urine pre-
      and post-ASA 325 mg as a surrogate of systemic PGE2 biosynthesis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether COX-2 protein has a slow turnover in adenocarcinoma of the lung. COX
      turnover will be determined by measuring urinary PGE-M levels daily for 7 days after
      discontinuing ASA 325 mg. COX-2 and Prostaglandin expression will also be measured in tumor
      samples of patients taken at the time of surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) for 7 days and urine is collected for 7
      days post therapy.
