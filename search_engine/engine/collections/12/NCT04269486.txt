      of 60 to 110 each site. After obtaining the informed consent from patient, blood draw and
      urine collection are conducted prior to intake of the herbal medicine, blood draw and urine
      collection are routinely done every week throughout the whole admission period. The primary
      outcomes are, 1) liver for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), RUCAM (in case of causality
      assessment when ALT≥3 upper normal limit) and new biomarker, mircoRNA-122 and 2) kidney for
      urine creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and new biomarker, Neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The secondary outcomes are, 1) liver for aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyltransferase (γ-GT), total
      bilirubin and new biomarker, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and 2) kidney for serum
      creatinine and new biomarker, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). The follow-up will be done by
      the study doctors based on their decision on the inpatient after discharge.
