      migraine with aura and a patent foramen ovale (PFO, a slit-like opening between the right and
      left upper chambers (atria) of the heart which normally closes at or soon after birth) who
      are randomized to either undergo closure of the patent foramen ovale or continue with
      standard medical management.
