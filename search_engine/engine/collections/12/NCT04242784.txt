      comprehensive review of AHA guidelines regarding treatment of acute stroke, ICH (intracranial
      hemorrhage) and SAH(sub arachnoid hemorrhage). In the second phase, the project will be doing
      national and international surveys of best practices among comprehensive stroke centers and
      then combine evidence based guidelines and recommendation as well as expert consensus and
      guidelines when high level evidence is not available from the published literature. The aim
      to improve public stroke awareness, stroke symptom recognition within the time benefit window
      for treatment and calling 9-1-1, EMS transportation, and the proportion and speed of
      reperfusion therapy (fibrinolytic and in appropriate patients- endovascular treatment) in
      eligible patients. These improvements in acute stroke care delivery are expected to result in
      lower mortality, fewer recurrent strokes, and improved long term functional outcomes that we
      will measure.
