    
      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  To assess renal function by means of eGFR (Cockcrault and Gault formula), at -Month 6
           and 12 post-transplantation

        -  To assess incidence of the individual composite endpoints including BPAR, graft loss and
           death at Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation

        -  To assess the incidence and duration of renal replacement therapy

        -  To assess the incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy (IF/TA) at Month 12

        -  To assess renal function by means of serum creatinine at Month 6 and 12
           post-transplantation

        -  To compare the overall safety and tolerability (incidence of AEs and SAEs, infections,
           discontinuations due to AEs, lab abnormalities, wound and surgical complications) at
           Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation
