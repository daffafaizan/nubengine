      double-blinded study to evaluate the effect of entinostat as compared to placebo on the
      electrical activity of the heart in patients with advanced solid tumors. Thirty patients will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either entinostat or placebo. Study treatment will be
      blinded to patients and the Investigator. ECG analysts will be blinded to the patient, visit,
      and treatment allocation. Patients will be on study up to 30 days following study drug
      administration. Total study duration is expected to be 9 months. After completing this study
      and at the discretion of the Investigator, patients may elect to enroll into a separate
      continuation study (SNDX-275-0141).
