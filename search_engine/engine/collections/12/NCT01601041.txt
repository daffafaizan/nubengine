      bacterial prostate infection with the occurrence of recurrent (>2 /year) symptomatic urinary
      tract infections in patients suffering from chronic (> 1 year) spinal cord injury (SCI) and
      neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction performing intermittent catheterization, patients
      perform self-catheterization twice (before and after urodynamic testing. After each
      catheterization, residual urine is assessed by ultrasound. Prior to urodynamic testing,
      prostate massage is performed, bacterial cultures of the fluid and the urine are initiated
      and the results of these cultures will be analysed .
