      records. Assessment of viability will be performed using a Tl-201 Rest-Redistribution
      Scintigraphy protocol within 2 weeks before LVAD implantation and 2 months after LVAD
      implant. Recovery of myocardial function will be assessed using available 2D transthoracic
      echocardiographic images and with the novel imaging modality, Speckle Tracking
      Echocardiography (STE), in order to provide a regional quantification of the myocardium, in
      the context of TL-201 results. Transthoracic echocardiograms will be performed 2 weeks prior
      to the LVAD implant and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after implantation.
