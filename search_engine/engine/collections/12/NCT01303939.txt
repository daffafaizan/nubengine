      cortex. These neurodegenerative changes decrease the patient's ability to perform the
      activities of daily living. Tensor-based morphometry analysis of magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) brain scans will reveal areas of cortical degeneration in glaucoma patients, and the
      extent of damage in these areas should correlate with patients ability to perform
      vision-dependent tasks, as measured by the Assessment of Ability Related to Vision (AARV).

      Patients with glaucoma who were outliers in two previous studies, Assessment of Ability
      Related to Vision (AARV) or Assessment of Disability related to vision (ADREV), in that they
      had poor performance-based measure scores despite having midrange visual field scores.

      Mini-Mental State Exam and T-1 weighted MRI brain scan and will be performed.
