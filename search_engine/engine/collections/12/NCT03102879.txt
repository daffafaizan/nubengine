    
      This is a controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the survival of mature permanent
      teeth with apical lesion treated with regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) based on
      encapsulated Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a biological scaffold. The REP will be compared to the
      conventional endodontic therapy. The REP is based on the use of umbilical cord-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in a plasma-derived biomaterial . The study group will
      use the disinfection protocol, indicated in the clinical considerations for regenerative
      procedures as recommended by the American Association of Endodontics, using a paste of
      calcium hydroxide prepared with double-distilled water as intracanal medication, and will be
      operated with REP using allogeneic stem cells in a scaffold, while the control group will be
      operated with conventional endodontic therapy alone. This clinical trial pretends to
      determine the dental survival of the tooth with mature apex and apical lesion, over a period
      of one year.
