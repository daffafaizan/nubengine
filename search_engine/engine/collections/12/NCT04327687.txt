      short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms to above systolic pressures
      (mmHg). This procedure induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such
      changes often result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the
      body, as well as improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. RIC has been shown to improve
      outcomes in patients with heart attacks, strokes, but is not investigated for PD. We argue
      that RIC may exert neuroprotective effect on PD due to its multiple mechanisms. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the impact of RIC on long term outcomes in patients with PD.
