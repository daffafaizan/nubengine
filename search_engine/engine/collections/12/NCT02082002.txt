      patients, including a definition of the boundaries and the overlaps between fatigue,
      somnolence, mood disorders and attention dysfunction; 2- to see how the prevalence and the
      overlaps between fatigue, somnolence, depression and attention dysfunction are influenced by
      the method of assessment. 3-To better characterize the sleep structure in MS patients with
      fatigue under both the macro- and microstructural point of view.
