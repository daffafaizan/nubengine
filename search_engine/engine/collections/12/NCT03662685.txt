    
      This is a three-arm, open-label study to examine the effect of Goeckerman therapy. Goeckerman
      therapy is known for its high efficacy and favorable safety profile in the treatment of
      psoriasis. It consists of a combination of phototherapy and topical crude coal tar). This
      study will examine how Goeckerman therapy, crude coal tar alone, and phototherapy alone
      affect the mmunologic and genetic environment within psoriatic skin lesions. Fifteen subjects
      with moderate to severe psoriasis will be enrolled. Biopsy samples will be collected and
      undergo molecular profiling to further elucidate the mechanism of action by which Goeckerman
      treatment improves psoriatic skin lesions.
