    
      Objective: To determine the effect of an ALA rich diet in reducing recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation as a further example of a cardiac arrhythmia.

      Design: Randomized parallel design efficacy study.

      Setting: Three university hospital centers in the Bordeaux region, France.

      Patients: 98 patients randomized immediately after successful atrial fibrillation electrical
      cardioversion.

      Intervention: A canola margarine and oil, versus a conventional diet (control), with a one
      year follow-up.

      Main outcome measure: Length of time to first recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

      Significance: If ALA is antiarrhythmic, this action may explain its cardioprotective effect
      in clinical trials and cohort studies.
