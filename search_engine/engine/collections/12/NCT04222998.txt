      will be conducted in two villages in each of Manggarai Timur and Trenggalek districts to
      ensure the chart design is compatible with the local context and chart information is
      understandable to caregivers. Focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews
      (KIIs), and door-to-door user testing will be conducted in each village. Results from the
      FGDs and KIIs will inform a draft growth chart design that will then be user tested in 10
      households in each village. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with each household
      approximately two weeks after chart installation to gather insights on the usability of the
      growth chart. The chart design will then be finalized for use in the second phase of the
      study.

      In the second phase, 2,160 caregiver-child dyads will be recruited and enrolled in the study
      as part of a baseline survey. Dyads will be sampled using a two-stage procedure. 180
      villages/clusters will be selected proportionate to national census population size. Villages
      will be randomly assigned into two groups: 1) Growth chart (90 villages); and 2) Control (90
      villages). At total of 12 eligible caregiver-child dyads with children between 9 and 14
      months will be selected from each village.
