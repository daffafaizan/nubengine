        -  Compare the effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without tirapazamine on
           progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with stage IV and selected
           stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Compare response rates in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to weight loss (less
      than 5% vs 5% or more), stage of disease (IIIB vs IV), and lactate dehydrogenase level
      (normal vs abnormal). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed by paclitaxel IV over 3
           hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Treatment continues
           every 21 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for one year, and then every 6 months for 2 years, or
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients (250 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 20 months.
