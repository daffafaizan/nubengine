      any exclusion criteria will be randomized to either electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) three
      times per week or ketamine infusion two times per week. Patients will answer questionnaires
      about their symptoms prior to treatments. The acute treatment phase of the study will last
      three to five weeks. Depending on response to treatment, some patients will be followed for
      an additional six months.
