    
      Ten healthy volunteer subjects and ten volunteers with a previous diagnosis of Barrett's
      Esophagus (BE) will be enrolled in the study.

      The capsule is attached to a string-like tether which allows the operator to control as well
      as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using peristalsis.

      Images of the esophagus will be acquired in real time to be analyzed later.
