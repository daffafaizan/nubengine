      effects related to ADT in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Specifically, we will use an
      exercise intervention and assess its impact on bone mass density, Body Mass Index (BMI),
      hip/waist circumference levels, biomarkers (i.e., glucose, lipids), step count, grip
      strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMISÂ®). In this 8-week two-arm randomized clinical trial,
      40 PCa patients receiving ADT will be randomly assigned to an exercise (n=20) or a stretching
      control group (n=20) with a follow-up at 8-weeks.
