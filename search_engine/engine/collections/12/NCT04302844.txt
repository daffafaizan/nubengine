    
      Imago relationship therapy (IRT; Hendrix, 2008) is an integrative approach to couples therapy
      that has been practiced and extensively disseminated for more than 30 years. IRT may be
      delivered through traditional in-office therapy with a couple, or the Imago principles and
      skills may be taught to couples through the "Getting the Love You Want" Workshop (GTLYW
      Workshop), a manualized, 2-day, psychoeducational workshop conducted by certified presenters
      to groups of couples. The present study is a RCT designed to examine the efficacy of IRT for
      couples experiencing distress in their committed romantic relationships, and to extend the
      findings of previous research. Ninety (90) couples with relationship distress will be
      recruited for the study. Couples will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Imago
      therapy alone, a Getting the Love You Want (GTLYW) Workshop followed by Imago therapy, or
      bibliotherapy, a control condition, in which couples will be given a self-help book on dyadic
      communication to read during a 12-week waiting period, followed by a GTLYW workshop.
