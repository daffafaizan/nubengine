      clinical implications are still unclear. Anecdotal evidence from patients with PHH suggest a
      high burden for these patients due to the recurrent hypoglycaemias with possibly debilitating
      consequences. It is well established, that even mild hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose of
      3.4mmol/l) in diabetic and non-diabetic significantly impairs cognitive-motor functioning. Of
      note, some of the cognitive aspects remain impaired for up to 75min, even when the
      hypoglycaemia is corrected. In addition to the hypoglycaemic blood glucose levels per se, the
      dynamics of the hypoglycaemia occurrence appears to play a role. It was shown in individuals
      with type 1 diabetes, that cognitive functions are affected more during a fast-fall than slow
      fall hypoglycaemia in the postprandial state.

      Driving is a frequent daily activity which integrates various mental function including
      visual and auditory processing, motor skills, reasoning and problem solving. Due to the
      potentially dangerous consequences, avoidance of hypoglycaemia-induced driving mishaps is of
      uttermost importance. Several studies have evaluated the impact of induced, controlled
      hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes on driving performance using driving
      simulators but data in PHH patients are currently lacking. Assessing the potential impact of
      the natural course of postprandial hypoglycaemia on driving performance in PHH patients will
      contribute to a better understanding of the consequences and relevance of this problem. The
      investigator will test the hypothesis whether driving performance during the postprandial
      glucose dynamics is impaired in patients with confirmed PHH.
