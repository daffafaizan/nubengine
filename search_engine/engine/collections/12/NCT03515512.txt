      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved enasidenib as a treatment option
      for some cancers, but not for the specific indication under study with this protocol.

      Enasidenib is currently used to treat AML with an IDH2 mutation that has come back or has not
      improved after previous AML treatment. This study is examining whether or not enasidenib may
      be beneficial and well-tolerated as an agent to prevent the relapse of IDH2-mutated AML or
      other myeloid neoplasms after participants have undergone hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). IDH2 is an enzyme that, when mutated, can overproduce metabolites and
      compounds that contribute to the growth of tumors and cancerous cells. Enasidenib may help
      block the over production of these substances.

      There is an FDA-approved test available to detect IDH2 mutations in patients with AML, but
      for the purposes of participation in this clinical trial, an investigational test may be used
      to determine the presence of an IDH2 mutation.

      In this research study, the investigators are:

        -  Looking for the maximum dose of enasidenib that individuals can take without
           experiencing severe side effects following HSCT.

        -  Looking at how often Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD) occurs in participants taking
           enasidenib. GVHD is a complication of transplant.

        -  Assessing the rates of relapse for participants taking enasidenib after HSCT.
