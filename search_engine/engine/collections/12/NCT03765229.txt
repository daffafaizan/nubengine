    
      This is an exploratory (n=10-12 evaluable patients), open-label, single-arm, phase II study
      in patients with 'non-inflamed' unresectable regional or distant metastatic melanomas
      irrespective of prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors. The primary endpoint is
      to assess the incidence of histopathologic conversion of non-inflamed melanomas from patients
      with metastatic melanoma to 'inflamed' melanoma following single-agent entinostat "priming"
      (entinostat monotherapy). More specifically, patients with metastatic melanomas that have no
      evidence of tumor-infiltrating or tumor-associated lymphocytes (TIL/TAL), based on standard
      hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of representative tumor sections (non-inflamed
      melanomas) will receive weekly entinostat for 3 weeks in cycle 1 (entinostat monotherapy; 5mg
      PO, qwk on D1, D8, D15 of cycle 1; cycle length = 21 days). Mandatory tumor tissue biopsies
      will be performed in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 21±2 days), immediately
      before treatment with concurrent entinostat (once weekly × 3) and pembrolizumab (200 mg
      q3wks) in cycles 2-9 (see section 5.2.1 drug dosing schema). Correlative studies will be
      performed at baseline and in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 21±2 days) to
      assess whether: (a) 3 weeks of entinostat monotherapy converts TIL/TAL-absent melanomas to
      TIL/TAL-present by histopathologic (H&E stain) analysis, (b) 3 weeks of single-agent
      entinostat induces changes in gene expression profiling by assessing distinct signatures as
      defined by RNA-sequencing signatures (RNA-seq; 'immune-high', innate anti-PD-1 resistance
      [IPRES], and epigenetic 1-3), (c) 3 weeks of single-agent entinostat induces changes in
      histone-accessible DNA by performing formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements
      (FAIRE)4, (d) conversion of non-inflamed to inflamed melanomas by single-agent entinostat
      and/or antitumor response to the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination is associated with a
      baseline signature that consists of distinct somatic mutation gene profile, global histone
      modification profile in melanoma tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and/or
      abundance of entinostat targets in melanoma cells (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 11). Up to 12 evaluable
      patients will be treated with entinostat plus pembrolizumab for up to 27 weeks (approximately
      6 months) based on clinical benefit. Patients who continue to have clinical benefit at 27
      weeks may continue therapy with pembrolizumab or any other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, as per
      standard of care.Secondary exploratory endpoints involve: (a) assessment of antitumor
      response of entinostat administered concurrently with pembrolizumab at week 9 (or earlier if
      patient progresses), based on response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). (b) assessment of the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 27
      weeks (approximately 6 months) of the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination. (c) determine the
      safety of the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination in patients with metastatic melanoma per
      NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). (d) assessment of other
      exploratory biomarkers in tumor tissue and peripheral blood.
