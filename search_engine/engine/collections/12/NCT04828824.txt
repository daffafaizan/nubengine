    
      Objective:

      To compare rates of etonogestrel implant discontinuation in implant initiators who are given
      advance provision of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) and a bleeding rescue regimen
      (COCR intervention) to participants given standard counseling (comparator).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine if participants initiating the contraceptive implant who are also provided COCR
      are more likely than participants receiving standard counseling to:

        1. report higher levels of satisfaction with their contraceptive implant at one year
           following initiation

        2. require less clinical follow-up and clinical resources in the year following initiation.
