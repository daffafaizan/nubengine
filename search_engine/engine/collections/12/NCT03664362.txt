    
      The central hypothesis is that the BSHAPE intervention will promote immigrant women's safety
      and health (e.g..,improved mental health, reduced physiological impact of stress and health
      inequities (especially reproductive-sexual health and HIV)), thus leading to overall
      empowerment.

      The study will:

        1. Conduct a feasibility and acceptability evaluation of the BSHAPE intervention.

        2. Test the BSHAPE intervention for large scale implementation in community-based clinics
           and programs serving immigrant women.

      The impact of BSHAPE will be evaluated in comparison to usual care in promoting safety and
      health outcomes among immigrant women with cumulative trauma experiences at post-intervention
      and at 6 and 12 months follow up.
