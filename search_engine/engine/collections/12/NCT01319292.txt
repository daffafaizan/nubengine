             1. To investigate the national children(0-14 years old)asthma prevalence;

             2. To compare the prevalence rate between that in 1990 and 2000;

             3. To analyse the asthma manifestations including the ages, seasons, causes, trigger
                and hereditary factors and their impact on the asthma patients, families and
                society;

             4. To identify the risk factors by questionnaires in case-control research.

        2. Study Design / Clinical Plan

             1. The screening stage: to distinguish suspected asthma from the children age from 0
                to 14 years old.

             2. To obtain identified asthma from the suspected asthma.

             3. To evaluate the prevalence and severe degree of 0 to 14-year-old children asthma
                and gain the main risk factors by case-control research.
