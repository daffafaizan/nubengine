    
      The MsFLASH-01 study, Efficacy of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) for
      Menopausal Symptoms in Midlife Women is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel arm clinical trial. The design includes: 3 weeks of daily recording of hot flashes
      prior to drug treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo with
      dose escalation at 4 weeks among non-responders; 1 week of drug taper for those on higher
      dose, followed by 2 weeks with no treatment; and a telephone follow-up post-treatment. This
      study is one of five clinical trials to be conducted as part of the Menopause Strategies -
      Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) study, a network of investigators
      and clinical trials designed to find new ways to alleviate the most common, bothersome
      symptoms of the menopausal transition.
