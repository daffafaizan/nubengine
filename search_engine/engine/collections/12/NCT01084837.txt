    
      60 patients, 18 years or older, diagnosed with newly symptomatic multiple myeloma (standard
      diagnosis criteria) and renal failure, previously untreated with chemotherapy, will be
      included.

      It is an multi centric, national and open study designed in order to determine efficacy of
      the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients with renal
      failure.

      The trial consists of two parts: pre-treatment and treatment. Pre- treatment phase: include
      the enrolment visit in order to determine that the patient is eligible to participate in a
      study. The patient will be given the Informed Consent Form in order to participate in the
      study, and detailed information about the treatment, its benefits and risks.

      Treatment phase: include the treatment which consist of, at the most, 12 cycles of Velcade
      and Dexamethasone (induction and extension). During these periods, patients will come to the
      centre for the study visits to be evaluated, the days they will receive VelcadeÂ® of each
      cycle.

      Once the clinical trial has finished, patients will be monitored during short and long-term
      periods where progression free survival and overall survival will be evaluated.
