    
      This is a randomized controlled trial exploring the difference in cooling rates between two
      treatments: 1) tarp-assisted cooling and 2) the standard of care for heat stroke treatment in
      the wilderness. 12 healthy participants (6 males, 6 females) will participate. Visit 1 will
      be a screening visit, consisting of informed consent followed by completion of questionnaires
      to determine study eligibility. Participants will have their resting vital signs (heart rate,
      blood pressure), height, weight, and percent body fat measured. Visits 2 and 3 will be
      experimental trials. Participants will complete a treadmill protocol consisting of brisk
      walking wearing a weighted backpack (40 lb) until core temperature reaches 40.0Â°C. Upon
      completion of exercise, participants will exit the environmental chamber and be cooled in one
      of two ways in a randomized, counterbalanced manner: 1) tarp-assisted cooling or 2) Standard
      of Care. Cooling will take place for 20 minutes.
