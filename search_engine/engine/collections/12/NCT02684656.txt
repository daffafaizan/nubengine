      hemodiafiltration (HDF) has a higher oxalate extraction rate as compared with hemodialysis
      (HD). However, it has not been evaluated whether HDF can lower predialysis oxalate levels
      below the level of supersaturation. By using an intra-individual approach with the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria listed for the study, we plan to determine plasma oxalate and
      cytokine levels in 20 patients (10 on regular duration HD, 10 patients on extended duration
      HD) before dialysis. Subsequently, patients will be switched to HDF and plasma oxalate
      concentration and cytokines will be analyzed again two weeks following HDF treatment. Plasma
      oxalate (Pox) will be measured at beginning of treatment, mid, end and 2 hrs post treatment
      (to determine rebound) in order to provide oxalate kinetics on HD/HDF treatment. Cytokines
      will only be measured pre HD/HDF treatment to assess steady state inflammation.
