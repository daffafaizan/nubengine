      observational cohort study of an elderly Korean population residing in Seoul, the
      metropolitan capital city of Korea.

      Briefly, the study population was selected from four urban districts (Guro, Yangcheon, Gwanak
      and Gangseo) located in the south-west area of Seoul. A total of 1737 apparently healthy
      individuals (between 60 and 92 years of age) eventually participated in this survey starting
      in 1999. A follow-up examination was performed in 2002, and an additional 873 subjects who
      had not participated in the first examination were newly recruited.

      After a median follow-up of 10 years, each subject's vital status or cause of death as of 31
      December 2011 was determined after linking these cohort data with death certificate data from
      the Korean National Statistical Office. Terminology and codes from the International
      Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), were used to classify the underlying
      cause of death due to cardiovascular disease (ICD-10 codes I00-I79), cancer (ICD-10 codes
      C00-C97) and others.
