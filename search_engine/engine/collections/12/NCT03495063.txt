      versus natural caffeine on hemodynamic parameters in healthy subjects. This study will
      determine the difference in hemodynamic effects of synthetic and natural caffeine consumption
      in healthy individuals through blood pressure (central and peripheral) assessment. The
      participants in this study are healthy adults who will be introduced to a risk that may be
      more than they would encounter through their normal daily activities. This study seeks to add
      to the literature by evaluating the difference in impact of synthetic compared to natural
      caffeine on central blood pressure.

      This protocol has the following aims:

        1. Investigators hypothesize there will be a (baseline adjusted [ΔBP]) difference in BP
           (peripheral and central) between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy
           volunteers post consumption.

        2. Investigators hypothesize there will be (baseline adjusted [ΔCO]) no difference in CO
           between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy volunteers post consumption.

        3. Investigators hypothesize there will be (baseline adjusted [ΔSVR]) no difference in SVR
           between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy volunteers hours post
           consumption.
