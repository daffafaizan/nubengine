      complementary action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab but also the relevance of an
      anthracycline-based regimen. Indeed, besides the cardiac toxicity that can be induced by
      these three agents, anthracycline chemotherapy may not confer benefit to all patients.

      The underlying scientific hypothesis is based on data from the NEOSPHERE neoadjuvant trial
      showing that addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab plus docetaxel improved the pCR rate (46%
      versus 29% without pertuzumab) in T2-T3 tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that for smaller
      tumors (T1c), the pCR rate should be higher, on the order of 60% in patients with the
      coamplification (with anthracycline therapy) and 55% for the group without coamplification
      (without anthracycline therapy). The sample size of 90 patients (45 per group) planned for
      the phase II study will allow 15% precision with the expected pCR rates of 60% (95%CI:
      45%-75%) for patients with coamplification and 55% (95%CI: 40%-70%) for those without
      coamplification. In addition, exploratory analyses will aim to identify predictive markers of
      pCR in order to target biologically defined subpopulations in which pCR rates might even be
      higher.
