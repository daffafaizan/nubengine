      a multi-disciplinary team with experts in physical therapy, psychology and nephrology to
      develop a comprehensive exercise program for HD patients. Aim of this pilot study is to
      assess the feasibility, tolerability and adherence to COMEX over 3 months and inform design
      of future randomized controlled trial. A secondary goal is to explore molecular mechanisms in
      muscle and blood of exercise adaptation in HD patients
