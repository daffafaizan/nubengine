      to provide access to plerixafor for patients with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease,
      or Multiple Myeloma who are to receive treatment with an autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant. Patients who have previously failed stem cell mobilization attempts or who have
      previously received an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant are not eligible to
      enroll in this program. The standard of care regimen for stem cell mobilization includes a
      growth factor, G-CSF, to increase peripheral blood stem cells. Plerixafor is given on the
      evening prior to doses of standard treatment with G-CSF. The combination of G-CSF and
      plerixafor has the potential to increase the number of circulating stem cells. The stem cells
      develop into specialized white blood cells and platelets that are necessary for immune system
      function and normal blood clotting. The stem cells are removed by a process called apheresis,
      in which blood is drawn from the patient, the stem cells are separated from the plasma, and
      the plasma is returned to the patient. The separated stem cells are frozen, similar to the
      blood banking process. The patient then receives chemotherapy according to the institutional
      standard. After chemotherapy, stem cell transplant is intended to replenish cells in the bone
      marrow that may be destroyed by chemotherapy.
