      in growing numbers and often require significant monitoring and coordination of care in the
      ambulatory setting. These complicated infants have spent all of their lives in the hospital
      setting, and are strangers in their own homes. Although the transition of the fragile child
      from intensive care specialist to the ambulatory care provider begins at hospital discharge,
      it is incomplete until the child receives appropriate outpatient follow-up with a primary
      care pediatrician. Over this prolonged time period, the child is especially vulnerable to
      errors related to breakdowns in care coordination and communication because the
      responsibility for the patient's care is often not clearly specified. Our team of
      investigators has recently completed a Health Care Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (HFMEA)
      of the transition from neonatal intensive care to the ambulatory environment. We will expand
      upon the Care Transitions Intervention developed by Coleman et al that addressed the problems
      of older adults who were discharged from hospital to home. In this model, advanced practice
      nurses, trained as coaches, taught patients and families to coordinate care for themselves,
      fostering independence. We will include the use of a personal health record, to include
      specific instructions to recognize and self-manage the most common problems in this
      population and we will use information technology (IT) to enhance communication with families
      and with community providers, in particular the primary care provider. Having identified that
      lack of knowledge and skills on the part of community providers about how to manage these
      infants as an important risk point, we will add to the Coleman intervention by providing
      "just-in-time" information to the primary care providers to enhance their knowledge and skill
      in managing the common problems of neonatal nursery graduates, provided electronically via
      the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) clinical decision support program.
