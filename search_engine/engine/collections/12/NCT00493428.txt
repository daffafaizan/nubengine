      liver cancer will be enrolled over a 2-4 year period. Subjects will receive oral Baclofen at
      the manufacturer's suggested maximal dose. Clinical, hematologic, biochemical, and radiologic
      features of liver function, tumor metastasis and recurrence will be monitored at regular time
      intervals over a 2 year treatment period. The primary study end point will be the event of
      interest (time to metastasis or recurrence). Secondary end points will include time to
      metastasis following recurrence, objective tumor responses (complete, partial and non
      response), response duration, survival and safety. It is hoped the results of this study will
      permit liver cancer patients to remain candidates for surgical resection and transplantation
      longer than would otherwise have been the case.
