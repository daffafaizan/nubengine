    
      Patients will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to either olaparib or placebo. Randomisation will be
      stratified by Hormone receptor status (ER and/or PgR positive/HER2 negative versus TNBC),
      prior neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy and prior platinum use for breast cancer.

      Randomised patients will receive study treatment for up to a maximum of 12 months. All
      patients will have safety assessments every 2 weeks during the first month, every 4 weeks for
      the following 5 months and 3 monthly for the remaining 6 months of study treatment plus 30
      days after its discontinuation. Following randomisation, all patients will be assessed
      regularly for signs, symptoms and evidence of disease recurrence by taking medical history,
      physical examination and mammogram/breast MRI. Efficacy assessments will be performed on a 3
      monthly basis during the first 2 years, followed by 6 monthly assessments for years 3, 4 and
      5 and annually thereafter. All patients (except those with bilateral mastectomy) will have
      mammogram / breast MRI annually for 10 years beginning 6 months after randomisation.

      All randomised patients will have clinical assessment visits for 10 years following their
      randomisation into the study. Once a patient completes 10 years of clinical assessment they
      will enter the survival follow up phase of the trial which will continue until 10 years after
      the last patient is randomised.
