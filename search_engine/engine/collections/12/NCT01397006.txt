      At the baseline visit, each subject will be asked if they wish to consider enrolling in Part
      II. If they agree, the details of the study will be explained and Dr Goldenberg will consent
      those who wish to enroll in Part II. The first 75 patients who consent will be enrolled in
      the study, the randomized clinical trial of pregabalin in early-onset fibromyalgia.

      After a study subject has been enrolled, they will be randomized to one of two treatment
      groups. All subjects will be randomized, 1:1 either to the pregabalin group (group A) or the
      placebo group (group B). Randomization will take place after enrollment via selection of one
      of a multitude of envelopes containing a random number. Each random number will have been
      preassigned to either Group A or group B.
