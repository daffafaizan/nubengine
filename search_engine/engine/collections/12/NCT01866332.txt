      physical therapy, which consist of a combination of manual therapy techniques, general
      exercises and specific exercises for spinal segmental stabilization (Conventional Physical
      Therapy Group) or to receive conventional physical therapy plus the addition of the Kinesio
      Taping in the lumbar spine (Conventional Physical Therapy plus Kinesio Taping), over a period
      of 5 weeks (10 sessions of treatment).

      Clinical outcomes (pain intensity, disability and global perceived effect ) will be collected
      at baseline and at 5 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization. Data will be collected by a
      blinded examiner who will be unaware about the group allocation. All statistical analysis
      will be conducted following the principles of intention to treat analysis and the
      between-group differences will be performed using Mixed Linear Models.
