    
      Eligible patients will be equally randomized (1:1) to the Conventional/control arm (bridging
      anti-coagulation)or to the Experimental arm (continued coumadin). In the Conventional arm
      there are 2 options. Patients with greater than 5 days pre-implant will discontinue oral
      anti-coagulant (coumadin) 5 days before the procedure,and start full therapeutic doses of
      subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)3 days before the procedure. Patients with
      less than 5 days to implant can be given Vitamin K at the investigator's discretion and start
      full therapeutic doses of either subcutaneous LMWH or IV unfractionated Heparin (choice is at
      investigator discretion) when the INR is below the therapeutic range for the patient (usually
      greater than or equal to 2; 2.5 for some valve patients) and surgery to proceed when INR is
      less than 1.6. Oral anti-coagulant (coumadin) will resume on the evening of the procedure.
      Full dose LMWH injections or full dose IV heparin will be started 24 hours after surgery.

      In the Experimental arm patients will continue on their oral anti-coagulant (coumadin). The
      INR on the day of surgery will be < 3.0.

      ASA will be continued in all patients. Plavix will be continued in patients with drug-eluting
      stents.

      Patients will be monitored for the development of any hematoma or bleeding event during
      admission. There will be a unblinded team responsible for device implant and follow-up and a
      blinded team responsible to monitor any bleeding events or hematoma and determine if it meets
      the primary endpoint criteria for the study. The blinded team will have no knowledge of the
      treatment arm and will be involved only if the patient develops a hematoma or bleeding event.
      All hematomas and bleeding events will be followed until resolution.
