    
      This is a longitudinal, observational, prospective, multicentre, national study, conducted in
      France, from a representative sample of physician anesthetists.

      The efficacy and safety in real life of CLOROTEKALÂ® will be assessed in patients undergoing a
      short outpatient surgery under spinal anesthesia. Data will be collected by the physician
      during two visits (pre-anesthesia and per-postoperative consultation). Additional data
      regarding the patient's perception (safety, pain and satisfaction) will be collected using a
      self-questionnaire.
