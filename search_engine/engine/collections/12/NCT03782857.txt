      studies have shown that less than 40% of stroke survivors are treated to target one year
      after stroke The investigator performed a feasibility study to test a model of treating this
      important risk factor in a hospital setting The investigator used a stepwise escalation of
      treatment of both blood pressure and blood cholesterol to individual targets according to
      patients' diagnosis of stroke, comorbidity and age
