      brain despite their discrete appearance on CT or MRI. While locally aggressive, metastasis of
      glioblastoma to extracranial organs is considered rare. Approximately 10% of patients with
      glioblastoma develop metastatic disease after radiation or craniotomy. Few patients have
      developed extracranial metastatic disease in the absence of surgical resection or radiation.
      Unlike tumors of other organs such as lung, colon and prostate, the presence of glioma cells
      in the circulation of patients undergoing surgical resection has not been established. If
      found absent, glioma cells may be unable to intravasate through the blood brain barrier. If
      present, these tumor cells presumably can intravasate but may be recognized and eliminated by
      an immunological process, or they may escape detection yet not be able to take hold in the
      new microenvironment. The information provided will add to the knowledge of the biology of
      these highly malignant tumors.
