      of cerebral palsy. Routine physical therapy aims to reduce spasticity, improve joint range of
      motion (ROM), and improve strength and mobility.

      Passive ROM and stretching of lower limb and trunk increases parasympathetic activity and
      thus improves intestinal motility in prolonged bed ridden patients.Abdominal muscle training
      improves intestinal motility by two ways: mechanically by improving fecal propulsion towards
      rectum and neurologically by inducing parasympathetic activity to improve intestinal
      motility.20 Thermotherapy of back and abdomen in chronic constipation patient improves
      intestinal blood flow and parasympathetic activity.
