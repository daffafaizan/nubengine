    
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 5 days of albaconazole dosing at
      levels that exceed both the projected therapeutic dose and the projected therapeutic
      frequency, in order to identify an upper dose for administration in a TQTc study. It also
      aims to assess the pharmacokinetics of multiple escalating doses of albaconazole, and to
      assess the effects of multiple and sustained dosing of high doses of albaconazole on ECG
      parameters.
