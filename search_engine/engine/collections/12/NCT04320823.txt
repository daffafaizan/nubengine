      three source plasma collection centers throughout the United States. The objective of the
      trial is to study the safety and effectiveness of a novel plasma collection nomogram run on
      the bi-directionally integrated Haemonetics NexSys PCS® and Haemonetics NexLynk DMS® plasma
      collection system. Subjects will be randomized into an intervention and control arm. The
      control arm will donate plasma using the current software. The intervention arm will donate
      plasma using a novel software that supports a more individualized collection approach.
