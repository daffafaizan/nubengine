      Hospital and/or Weill Greenburg York Avenue Building. Study procedures done elsewhere that
      are within the protocol timeframe will be accepted if seen fit by the investigators so that
      they are not repeated unnecessarily. Study individuals who undergo bronchoscopy with
      intravenous administration of sedatives and analgesia may be required to stay overnight.
      Bronchoscopy is normally an ambulatory procedure. The subject is observed after the
      bronchoscopy, including vital signs and level of consciousness, until they are back to
      baseline. An overnight stay would only be required if the individual was not, in the judgment
      of the attending physician, safe to be discharged as is standard practice. Follow up of all
      participants are carried out by telephone within 1 wk following the procedure.

      Rockefeller University has been added as a second site.

      Individuals undergoing bronchoscopy without intravenous administration of sedatives and
      analgesia are not required to stay overnight due to the lack of administration of
      CNS-altering drugs and the limited sampling involved (tracheal brushes only).
