        -  physical function

      Study intervention:

      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like the flip of a coin) to one of two
      groups: participant either will receive SOCIABLE (Seniors Optimizing Community Integration to
      Advance Better Living with ESRD) services now, or will receive the same services in six
      months from now. Participants have a 50:50 chance of getting into each group

      SOCIABLE services involve receiving visits with a nurse interviewer. Participants will decide
      how you want to improve your social function and social support.

      Participants will also receive:

        -  a group of services called CAPABLE which include home visits from a nurse (RN) and an
           occupational therapist (OT) and a handyman for repairs if you need them and

        -  help with improving social support

      All participants will receive 10 home visits (6 OT, 4 RN) plus minor home repairs and
      assistive devices over a 4 month period of time.
