    
      This is an open-label, 1-sequence study in subjects who are on stable oral risperidone
      treatment. The study consists of a screening visit, 1 treatment period with inpatient and
      outpatient visits, and a follow-up visit.

      Subjects who are on existing oral risperidone treatment (4 mg) will continue the oral regimen
      for 1 week to achieve steady-state concentrations of risperidone. Following the oral
      risperidone treatment, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 100 mg risperidone ISM® will be
      administered deeply into the gluteal muscle. A total of 4 IM doses will be given that will be
      separated by 4 weeks.

      Safety assessments and pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be performed on each dosing day and
      each outpatient visit. A final follow-up visit will take place to assess each subject for
      safety and to obtain PK samples.

      Approximately 58 subjects will be enrolled, with the intent to complete 41 subjects.
      Fifty-eight subjects were estimated for enrollment based on 41 completers assuming an
      approximate drop-out rate of 30%.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the steady-state comparative
      bioavailability of 100 mg risperidone ISM® injectable every 4 weeks compared to once daily 4
      mg oral risperidone in subjects with schizophrenia stabilized on oral risperidone treatment.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 100 mg
      risperidone ISM® injectable every 4 weeks compared to once daily 4 mg oral risperidone in
      subjects with schizophrenia stabilized on oral risperidone treatment.
