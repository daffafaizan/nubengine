      of and interventions for alcohol-related health problems. These constitute somatic and
      neuropsychiatric health problems, caused, precipitated, or complicated by alcohol use.

      The investigators will especially recruit patients in late adulthood (60+), as this group may
      experience more barriers with digital interventions, and will have more health problems
      potentially affected by alcohol. The investigators have developed the identification strategy
      and the interventions in close collaboration with key stakeholders: patients and health care
      professionals.

      The aim is to test the feasibility of interventions for hazardous (a quantity or pattern
      placing patients at risk for adverse health events) and harmful alcohol consumption
      (consumption resulting in adverse events), with two distinct components, namely pragmatic
      case finding and a digital self-administered intervention (called Endre) for use between
      consultations. The study will focus mainly on aspects related to acceptability, demand,
      implementation and practicality. The results from this feasibility study may give valuable
      knowledge on how this treatment approach should be adapted and implemented, and will indicate
      whether a full-scale RCT is warranted. This study is testing the feasibility of interventions
      intended to facilitate change for both patients (reduced alcohol consumption) and for
      physicians (improved addressing of alcohol and improved intervention delivery).
