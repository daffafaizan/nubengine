      branches for lobectomy in humans. All patients planned to undergo an open lobectomy at the
      CHUM - HÃ´pital Notre-Dame will be approached in an attempt to enroll them in the pilot study.
      In the investigator's institution, lobectomies are either done open (thoracotomy) or by
      minimally invasive approach, known as VATS (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery). This
      decision is based on the surgeon, tumor size, tumor localization and patient characteristics.
      Only patients already planned for an open lobectomy will be approached. Potential patients
      will be identified by going over the operation request forms. Patients booked for an open
      lobectomy will be approached either in the preoperative clinic or the day before surgery,
      when admitted. Goal is to recruit 10 patients.
