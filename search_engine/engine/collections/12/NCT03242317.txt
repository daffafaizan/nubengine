      stromal bed of the non-dominant eye, before the unilateral implantation of the corneal inlay.
      This treatment is at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (0.02%) applied for 10 to 30 seconds on the
      stromal bed as well as the stromal side of the corneal flap or pocket. In the third month
      after surgical procedure, one-drop a day of low dose steroid will be continued for the
      duration of the 24-month follow-up period to maintain corneal health.
