      identification of COVID-19 and as an aid to monitoring of respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.
      Patients with suspected COVID-19 and healthy controls will be enrolled and use their own
      smartphone device to provide daily voice samples and symptom inventories. This study seeks to
      confirm and extend findings from preliminary data from patients with asthma, COPD and cough
      that has indicated the potential of respiratory responsive vocal biomarkers (RRVB) to respond
      to respiratory diagnoses and symptom severity. The same RRVB will be examined to confirm
      whether this potential generalizes to respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19
