      6% annually over the next decade. Subsequently, healthcare reform is mandating more
      efficient, high-quality care to control spending. Thus, the long-term goal of this work is to
      develop an integrative health intervention for hand therapy that improves efficiency,
      enhances outcomes and reduce costs. Biofeedback and mindfulness training are two mind-body
      interventions that can increase patient engagement and self-efficacy. No research has
      investigated the integration of these mind-body interventions into treatment for hand therapy
      patients. This pilot research will explore the acute effects of these techniques in hand
      therapy patients. This study utilizes a repeated-measures crossover design with 20
      participants to explore the effects of mindfulness training and the dynamic biofeedback with
      sonographic imaging on acute pain, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, the study will evaluate
      hand therapy patient preferences and perceptions of mind-body techniques. This
      patient-centered, clinical translational work will provide valuable feasibility data
      regarding the direct, acute effects of mind-body interventions to inform the development and
      further study of an integrative hand rehabilitation approach. This responds to a need for
      best practices for maximizing the mind-body connection and the call to investigate innovative
      uses of mindfulness to enhance patient outcomes.
