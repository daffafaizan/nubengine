      on chronic hepatitis (AOCH) and acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) are treated with the ELAD
      system to assess the safety and efficacy of this therapy. The ELAD system incorporates cloned
      immortalized human liver cells (C3A cells). A hypothetical risk exists that, over an extended
      period of time, there may be an increased incidence of tumor in subjects treated with ELAD.

      The company is also collecting data related to whether a patient received a liver transplant
      and on survival.
