        -  To search for chemoradiosensitivity-related genes using a pre-treatment biopsy sample in
           patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with cisplatin, fluorouracil,
           and concurrent radiotherapy.

        -  To establish an algorithm for prediction of chemoradiosensitivity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of the following treatment regimens:

        -  Regimen 1: Patients receive low-dose cisplatin IV on days 1 and 29 and low-dose
           fluorouracil IV on days 1-4 and 29-32. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy on
           days 1-4 and 29-32. Patients undergo salvage surgery if needed.

        -  Regimen 2: Patients receive high-dose cisplatin IV on days 1 and 29 and high-dose
           fluorouracil IV on days 1-4 and 29-32. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy and
           salvage surgery as in regimen 1.

      Pre-operative biopsy samples are analyzed by DNA microarray chip to establish an algorithm
      for prediction of chemoradiosensitivity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 12 months.
