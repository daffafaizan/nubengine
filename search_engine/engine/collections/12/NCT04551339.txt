      multivitamin supplementation in supporting immune health in the setting of the COVID-19
      pandemic. Individuals over 50 years old or primary health care professionals over the age of
      18 who have had no evidence of prior COVID-19 infection and who have been asymptomatic for 7
      days prior to enrollment will be randomized at the individual level to take either
      PreserVision AREDS formulation soft gels or tablets with 69.6mg/day Zinc supplementation or
      to receive a multivitamin supplement with 11mg of zinc/day.
