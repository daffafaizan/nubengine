      of the society and the Westernization of lifestyle that facilitates the development of
      coronary artery disease. The prognosis of patients with CHF still remains poor, despite the
      recent advances in medical and surgical treatment. Elderly heart failure patients with
      preserved ejection and multiple comorbidity may account for significant portion among CHF
      patients in the real world clinical practice, however; most of previous prospective cohort
      studies excluded these patients. The KCHF registry, an all-comer, prospective, multicenter
      registry, was designed to investigate all patients who admitted to the hospital due to acutly
      decompensated CHF. The aim of this study was to clarify the patients characteristics ,
      selection of treatment, and prognosis of patients with acutly decompensated CHF in the
      real-world clinical practice in Japan.
