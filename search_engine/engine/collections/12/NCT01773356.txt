      Dihydrocapsiate, a capsinoid, found in the non-pungent CH-19 sweet pepper has similar
      thermogenic effects without the gastrointestinal side effects. The objective of this project
      is to test the effect of 12 weeks of daily consumption of 9 mg dihydrocapsiate on resting
      energy expenditure relative to baseline when compared to a control group consuming products
      without DCT.
