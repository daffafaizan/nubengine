      equal groups. Group A (MRF group): received 2 sessions per week with MRF for 8 weeks. Group B
      (PDL group): received 1 session per week with PDL for 8 weeks. The severity of acne scars was
      assessed before and after treatment by using the clinical evaluation scale for acne scarring
      (ECCA) scale and the self-assessment of clinical acne-related scars (SCARS) scale. Quality of
      life and the emotional impact of acne scars were evaluated by the facial acne scar quality of
      life (FASQoL) scale.
