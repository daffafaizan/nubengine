      invasive surgery and clot lysis with rt-PA to remove intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The
      procedure is to use image-based surgery (MRI or CT) to provide catheter access to ICH for the
      intervention, which is a one-time clot aspiration followed by instillation of rt-PA over 72
      hours.

      The Intraoperative stereotactic CT-guided Endoscopic Surgery (ICES) arm of the trial will
      determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of endoscopic surgery to remove ICH. This
      tests the first step of the MISTIE surgical procedure with an endoscope, not a rigid cannula.

      We propose to test if these interventions facilitate more rapid and complete recovery of
      function and decreased mortality from this condition compared to conventional medical
      management without subjecting the patient to craniotomy. The specific objective of this trial
      is to test the safety of these interventions and assess their ability to remove blood clot
      from brain tissue.
