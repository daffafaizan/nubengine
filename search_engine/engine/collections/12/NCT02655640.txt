      data collection includes demographic variables, patient-reported variables, clinical
      variables and healthcare professionals-reported variables. All SSc and SLE patients who meet
      the inclusion criteria and are monitored by the rheumatology consultation in the University
      Hospitals Leuven will be contacted to participate in the study. Patients will be informed of
      the purpose of the study and what is expected of them. If they agree to participate they will
      also be asked to sign the Informed Consent form to send together with the completed
      questionnaire by mail.

      After the patient gives his/her agreement to participate his/ her GP and rheumatologist will
      be asked to fill out the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire for Healthcare
      Professionals (IPQ-R HP). This is a questionnaire that measures the perception of the doctor
      about the disease condition of their patient.

      Data will be collected and kept by the investigator for analysis after complete coding. The
      obtained data will be analyzed using statistical methods.

      With this study the investigators want to give an answer on 4 research questions:

        1. Are there differences in perceptions between GP's and rheumatologists?

        2. What is the direction of the associations between the illness perceptions of the
           physicians and patients?

        3. What is the direction of the associations between the illness perceptions of a patient
           with SLE or SSc and psychological and physical functioning?

        4. What is the direction of the associations between the illness perceptions of the
           physician and the psychological and physical functioning of the patient?
