      developmentally- and culturally-sensitive, mobile health (mhealth) PrEP adherence
      intervention called DOT. The intervention will target culturally-diverse, young adult men,
      ages 18-35, who have sex with men (YMSM). The recent rise in HIV infection among young
      people, particularly minority YMSM, points to the value of PrEP uptake and adherence support
      for YMSM. In PrEP efficacy trials, younger age was the most consistent correlate with low
      PrEP adherence. Our DOT mhealth intervention reflects a developmental understanding of young
      adult decision-making, and is uniquely combined with principles from social cognitive theory,
      positive psychology and behavioral economics. The proposed project is based on Dr. Weitzman's
      successful Phase 1 trial of DOT, which led to significant improvements in PrEP adherence,
      PrEP treatment self-efficacy, and intention to follow PrEP treatment guidelines among the
      YMSM that used DOT for six weeks. Our proposed Phase 2 DOT mhealth intervention is directly
      responsive to Phase 1 findings by adding: 1) texts targeting motivation, patient education,
      and stress burden 2) online community for social support 3) linkage to the federal crisis
      text line 4) virtual avatar 5) cloud-based platform to view user engagement 7) calendar for
      clinic appointments and pharmacy refills 8) enhanced personalization of pill reminders and 9)
      enhanced adherence graphing. In Phase 2, we will test the effectiveness of DOT at improving
      PrEP adherence in a randomized controlled trial.
