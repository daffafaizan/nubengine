      association of a sudden and extensive purpura together with acute circulatory failure.
      Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most frequently involved
      microorganisms but other species (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes,
      Haemophilus influenzaeâ€¦) have also been reported. Despite prompt antibiotics administration
      and intensive care management, the mortality of PF has been reported to be as high as 50% in
      previous adult series. Additionally, patients surviving to the early phase of PF are exposed
      to a high risk of serious sequelae related to extensive skin necrosis and acral symmetrical
      gangrene, which typically requires limb amputations, a potential source of severe handicap in
      these previously young and healthy patients. Although the clinical features and outcomes of
      PF have been well studied in the pediatric setting, the amount of available data for adult PF
      are scarce, often outdated and mainly limited to patients with meningococcal infections. The
      current study aims at assessing the short and long-term outcomes of adult patients admitted
      in the intensive care unit for a purpura fulminans. A large multicenter retrospective cohort
      will be built in order to assess hospital outcomes (i.e., mortality and amputations).
      Long-term outcomes, including health-related quality variables, will be prospectively
      assessed among survivors and compared to septic controls (i.e., patients having septic shock
      non-related to purpura fulminans).
