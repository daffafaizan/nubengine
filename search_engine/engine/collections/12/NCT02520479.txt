      rates when radiotherapy (RT) is taken as the primary treatment, suggesting a role for
      chemotherapy (CT) added to RT for this disease. However, the appropriate mode of combined
      modality therapy (CMT) has not been fully defined.We conducted a prospective phase II study
      of "Sandwich" Pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide,vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone
      (P-CHOP) regimen in combination with radiotherapy.The "sandwich" protocols, refer to earlier
      RT after an initial 2 cycles of P-CHOP followed by further two "consolidation" cycles.
