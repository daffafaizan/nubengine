      increasingly important. Patient education is the primary means for teaching patients how to
      fulfill this role successfully. The goal of self-management health education is not merely to
      provide information but also to change patient attitudes and behavior so that patient
      outcomes are improved. These programs represent a new treatment for arthritis.

      This project will evaluate the relative effect on health status and cost-effectiveness of two
      arthritis patient education programs that use different delivery systems. The Arthritis
      Self-Management Program (ASMP) uses a small group, multi-class format. It is taught by
      trained lay leaders and has been evaluated for effectiveness and widely disseminated. The
      Self-Managed Arthritis Relief Therapy (SMART) Program is a computer-driven, individualized,
      mail-delivered intervention. Results of a pilot study suggest that it is effective in
      improving health status and reducing health care use.

      The project will also evaluate how generalizable the SMART program is and its effectiveness
      for patients with different diagnoses (OA and RA). It will also determine the attributes of
      patients who choose and do not choose to participate in patient education programs as well as
      the attributes of those who complete and do not complete the ASMP and SMART programs.

      Through use of the ARAMIS data collection system, the project allows us to describe the
      differences between people who volunteer to receive patient education and those who refuse
      patient education. This project is directed at improving patient outcomes in both RA and OA
      through wide availability of a low-cost, mail-delivered arthritis self-management program
      that is the next generation in arthritis health education.
