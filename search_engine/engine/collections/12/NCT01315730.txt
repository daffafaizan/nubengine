      University of Mississippi within the departments of Communication Sciences & Disorders,
      Exercise Science, and Computer and Electrical Engineering. The device records either sound
      waves (via a small standard microphone) or three dimensional accelerometer data from the
      throat of a stuttering subject. This data is digitally signal processed, and "fed back" to
      the user in the form of a small vibrating disk/film that can be held between the fingers or
      mounted on the skin. This feedback data does not require the subject to attend to the
      incoming signal.
