      - Patients treated by the Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) for their brain tumors unfortunately
      and commonly succumb to their disease. They and their loved ones often seek a way of adding
      meaning and utility to their death by agreeing to donate brain tumor tissue for laboratory
      research that may serve the medical community, and ultimately other patients, through better
      understanding of these rare diseases. Important new avenues of brain tumor research includes
      the molecular characterization of tumor tissue, and the development of tumor and neural stem
      cell lines. Successful growth of these cell lines requires acquisition of large volumes of
      fresh tumor and brain tissue that can best be accomplished by harvesting whole brains from
      recently deceased patients. In an effort to provide high quality end of life care, with the
      additional intent of facilitating efficient donation of brain tumor tissue at the time of
      death, we are conducting a pilot study of planned inpatient hospice care incorporating timely
      brain tumor tissue procurement at the time of expiration.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide high quality end of life inpatient hospice care for patients dying with
           untreatable brain tumors.

        -  Procure brain and tumor tissue shortly after time of death in order to derive viable
           tumor and neural stem cell lines for research purposes.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Adult patients with primary brain tumors.

      DESIGN:

      - This is a pilot study to assess feasibility of procuring viable brain and tumor tissue
      proximal to the time of death. Target accrual is 10 patients for brain harvest.
