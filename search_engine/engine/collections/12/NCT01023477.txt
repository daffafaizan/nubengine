      DCIS will reduce the capacity of DCIS to survive and invade. The study will examine the
      safety and effectiveness of neoadjuvant chloroquine administration for a one month period to
      patients with low, intermediate grade, or high grade DCIS. We will evaluate whether this
      treatment will reduce the capacity of DCIS neoplastic cells, existing within the duct, to
      survive, induce lesion regression, and kill the invasive DCIS progenitor cells.
