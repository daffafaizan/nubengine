      interfere with coping. Studies in lung cancer patients show high prevalence of distress
      during the course of the disease. However until now, very few research was done during the
      diagnostic workup. This prospective study will describe and explore distress, quality of life
      and illness perception in lung cancer patients during the diagnostic period until first
      follow-up visit 4 weeks after start of therapy. Patient reported questionnaires will be used.
