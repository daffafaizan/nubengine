      production of collagen, the quality, and quantity of the connective tissue. The etiology and
      pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis are mostly revealed, however, the mechanism of
      environmental factors such as smoking yet to be clarified. Major consequences of smoking in
      gingival tissues are suggested to be the reduction in neutrophil and fibroblast function,
      decreased immunoglobulin G production, increased periodontal pathogen bacteria prevalence,
      difficulty in eliminating pathogens with mechanical therapy, and reduction in growth factor
      production. In the present study, markers of tissue destruction, matrix metalloproteinase-8
      and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, hypoxia markers, vascular endothelial
      growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor and apoptotic markers, bax, bcl-2, and caspase-3
      were evaluated.
