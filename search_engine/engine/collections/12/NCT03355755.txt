      physical condition and are also at a higher risk of rehospitalization within 30 days of
      discharge. A program incorporating robotic exoskeleton training may provide sufficient
      physical support and challenge for patients to maintain a higher level of physical condition
      than if they did not undergo exoskeleton training. The investigators aim to demonstrate that
      EksoGT robotic exoskeleton training can be performed safely with patients who have been
      hospitalized and are at risk of experiencing a further decline in their physical condition.
