      elderly pathologically diagnosed patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer
      enrolled from 2015 to 2017 who received lobectomy or segment/wedge dissection were included
      and the study data on patient demographic/tumor biological characteristics, and clinical
      treatments were retrospectively collected to evaluate effectiveness and safety of the
      surgeries.
