      of whole blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin serum levels. This
      procedure will be done at diagnosis, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of sepsis.

      The following data will be recorded:

        -  Demographic data (age, gender and BMI) and cause of sepsis

        -  Procalcitonin and its correlation with changes in platelet indices

        -  The odds ratio (OR) for mortality in patients with normal and abnormal platelet indices.

        -  Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores.
