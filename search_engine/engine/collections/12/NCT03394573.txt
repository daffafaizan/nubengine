    
      For the study arm receiving the VA-guided treatment regimen, the following retreatment
      criteria will be applied:

        -  if visual acuity remains stable (Â± 5 ETDRS letters) treatment intervals will be extended
           by 2 weeks as compared to the previous retreatment interval.

        -  if visual acuity decreases by more than 5 ETDRS letters treatment intervals will be
           shortened by 1 week as compared to the previous retreatment interval, whereby
           retreatment intervals cannot be shorter than 28 days (4 weeks). Once treatment intervals
           have been shortened, the patient should be seen at two consecutive visits with no
           diabetic retinopathy disease activity before re-extending the treatment interval.

      For the study arm receiving the OCT-guided treatment regimen, the following retreatment
      criteria will be applied:

        -  if SD-OCT examinations show 1) no SRF in any area of the OCT scan present and 2) no IRF,
           treatment intervals will be extended by 2 weeks as compared to the previous retreatment
           interval.

        -  if SD-OCT examinations show 1) any SRF present in any area of the OCT scan and/or 2) any
           IRF present, treatment intervals will be shortened by 1 week as compared to the previous
           retreatment interval, whereby retreatment intervals cannot be shorter than 28 days (4
           weeks). Once treatment intervals have been shortened, the patient should be seen at two
           consecutive visits with no diabetic retinopathy disease activity before re-extending the
           treatment interval.
