    
      The intervention is carried out in healthy women following a randomized crossover design in
      which an "active" (functional") diet is compared with a control diet formulated in agreement
      with the Nordic Dietary Recommendations but lacking the functional ingredients of the active
      regime.

      The active diet supplies important daily amounts of dried legumes and wholegrain cereal
      products.

      Each dietary treatment is applied for 4 weeks separated by a 4-6 week washout period.
      Subjects are encouraged to maintain a stable body weight under the whole trial.
