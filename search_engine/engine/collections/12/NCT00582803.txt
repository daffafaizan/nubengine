      to maximize the likelihood of detecting the disease at an early, more curable, stage (Burke
      et al. 1997, Eisenger et al. 1998, Moller et al. 1999). Although the particular
      recommendations of different groups have varied, all suggest programs that incorporate
      clinical and radiographic screening performed more frequently than in the general population,
      beginning at a considerably younger age. Recent studies demonstrating the sensitivity of
      breast MRI have led several groups to incorporate this technology as an incremental (not
      replacement) modality, further increasing the intensity of the surveillance regimen. While
      data are beginning to accumulate regarding the effectiveness of aggressive surveillance,
      little is known about the ability and willingness of women to adhere to these rigorous
      schedules, nor about the psychosocial and economic costs of the programs. Based upon the
      Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP)model (Miller, Shoda, Hurley 1996), we
      hypothesize that the ability to adhere to a proposed screening regimen will result from a
      complex and dynamic interaction between the nature of that regimen, events that can be
      expected to occur in the course of screening (such as abnormal results and practical
      barriers) and key psychological factors such as the individual's attentional style, affective
      state, perceived risk of cancer, cancer-specific worries, and beliefs regarding the
      effectiveness of screening. To test the hypothesis, we propose to prospectively study women
      with a hereditary risk for breast cancer participating in a structured surveillance program
      of monthly breast self-examination, semi-annual clinical examination and annual mammography,
      augmented by annual interval breast MRI.
