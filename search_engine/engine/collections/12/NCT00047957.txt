      afferent input on surround inhibition in the motor cortex. Surround inhibition is a cortical
      phenomenon, the function of which may be to suppress unwanted movements in surrounding
      muscles during voluntary actions. In support of this, a recent study showed that motor output
      to the little finger was reduced during self-paced, voluntary movements of the index finger,
      despite an increase in spinal excitability. Work has also shown that in relaxed muscle,
      homotopic and heterotopic peripheral stimulation results in time dependent modulation of
      motor cortical excitability. However, no studies have examined the relationship between
      volitional movement and afferent sensory input on cortical surround inhibition. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to examine the changes in surround inhibition when electrical
      stimulation is applied to either the finger being actively moved (homotopic stimulation) or a
      separate finger not involved in the movement (heterotopic stimulation) at different time
      periods prior to the initiation of movements to assess the affect of these stimuli on
      surround inhibition and excitation in the motor cortex.
