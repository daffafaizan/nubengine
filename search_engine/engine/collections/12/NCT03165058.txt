      Increased intestinal permeability can represent compromise of the epithelium's integrity.
      Prior research has demonstrated that defects in intestinal barrier function are associated
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and increased intestinal permeability can be important
      in the maintenance of remission in IBD patients. There is currently not a convenient way to
      measure colonic epithelial barrier function in real time which could provide clinically
      relevant information .
