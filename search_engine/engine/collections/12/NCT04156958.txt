      standard second-line treatment has been established following recurrence from the first-line
      treatment. Angiogenesis plays a key role in the carcinogenesis and development of biliary
      tract adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that VEGF is expressed in more than 50% of biliary
      tract adenocarcinoma, and microvessel density is significantly associated with tumor
      progression, metastasis, and prognosis. Fruquintinib (trade name: Elunate) is a novel small
      molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for
      multiple cancers including lung cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer and showed
      strong anti-tumor activity. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      fruquintinib for patients with advanced or metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma who failed
      first-line chemotherapy.

      The trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm design study. Eligible participants with
      advanced or metastatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma who have failed first-line chemotherapy
      with gemcitabine, platinum/S-1, and albumin paclitaxel. The study will explore the efficacy
      and safety of second-line treatment with fruquintinib, and quality of life during treatment.
      Tumor assessment was performed every 8 weeks as defined by RECIST 1.1. Blood samples will be
      collected at baseline (before treatment) and 2 weeks after treatment, and cfDNA will be
      collected for gene detection analysis to evaluate the correlation between different gene
      mutations and their changes and efficacy.
