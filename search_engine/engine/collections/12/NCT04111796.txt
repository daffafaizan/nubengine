      followed by a nature-based activity of 1.5 hours, twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks. The
      investigators measure neurocognition via neurocognitive tests, emotional status via burnout
      assessment tool and well-being questionnaires, and asses stress levels via salivary cortisol
      and smartwatches.
