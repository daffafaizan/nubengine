      patients with recurrent or refractory head and neck cancer. II. Evaluate the safety of
      paclitaxel in this patient population. III. Assess the overall survival and quality of life
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter, nonrandomized study. Patients receive
      intravenous paclitaxel over 1 hour weekly. Each course consists of four weeks. Patients
      receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed.
      Patients are followed every 2 months for the first year, then every 4 months until completion
      of treatment, and then every 3 months until death. Patients complete a quality of life
      questionnaire prior to each of the first 6 courses, then every 2 courses thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
