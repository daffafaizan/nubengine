    
      Testosterone, the predominant circulating androgen in men, serves as the active hormone in
      some target tissues; however, testosterone effects in other target organs require its
      conversion to two active metabolites, estradiol 17-beta and DHT. The role of 5-alpha
      reductase in mediating testosterone's effects on muscle and sexual function remains unclear.
      This study will determine whether 5-alpha reduction of testosterone to DHT is necessary for
      mediating effects on fat-free mass, muscle size, muscle strength, and leg power in men. The
      study will also evaluate the necessity of 5-alpha reductase for maintenance of androgen
      effects on sexual function (sexual desire, overall sexual activity, nocturnal penile
      tumescence [NPT], response to visual erotic stimulus, and penile rigidity) in men.

      Participants in this study will be treated with a drug to suppress endogenous testosterone
      production. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either testosterone and
      placebo or testosterone and the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride. Testosterone will be
      administered weekly; dutasteride and placebo will both be administered daily. Diet and
      exercise will be standardized across both groups. Participants will be assessed at study
      entry and Week 20. Assessments will include measurements such as a DEXA scan, MRI scan, and
      muscle performance and sexual function tests. Participants will also have blood tests for
      safety monitoring; blood tests will include measures of hematocrit, liver enzymes (AST and
      ALT), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and cholesterol.
