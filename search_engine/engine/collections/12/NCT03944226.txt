      composition and microstructure in breast tumours at baseline and post dietary nitrate
      intervention through the applications of novel non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS) methods and diffusion and lipid profiling MR imaging methods in patients. The
      investigators hypothesise that dietary nitrate disrupts tumour progression in breast cancer.

        1. Is there a significant difference in lipid composition in the tumour measured by MRS
           between baseline and post dietary nitrate intervention?

        2. Is there a significant difference in lipid composition in the whole breast tissue
           surrounding tumour measured by MRI between baseline and post dietary nitrate
           intervention?

        3. Is there a significant difference in tissue microstructure measured by MRI between
           baseline and post dietary nitrate intervention in the breast tissue?

      To assess the effect of dietary nitrate on tumour progression, paired t-tests will be
      performed on lipid composition measured from tumour between baseline and post intervention.
      To assess the effect of dietary nitrate on tumour progression, paired t-tests will be
      performed on lipid composition in the whole breast tissue surrounding tumour between baseline
      and post intervention. To assess the effect of dietary nitrate on tissue microstructure
      paired t-tests will be performed on water displacement measured from tumour between baseline
      and post intervention.
