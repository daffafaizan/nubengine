      (NICU) for both preterm and full term newborns. TTN and RDS are the two most common diagnoses
      associated with respiratory distress. Due to their similar clinical presentations, it is
      often difficult to differentiate the two diseases clinically. Currently chest radiography is
      used to differentiate between TTN and RDS, however, radiographic findings are not always
      definitively diagnostic.

      In preliminary studies, lung ultrasonography has been shown to be a useful tool in diagnosing
      both TTN and RDS. However, no one has looked at the use of lung ultrasonography in
      differentiating TTN from RDS in the neonatal population. We propose to do so in this study.

      Patients will be enrolled from neonatal admissions to the NICU with respiratory distress.
      Lung ultrasound will be performed on all enrolled subjects, looking for specific findings
      suggestive of either TTN or RDS. Data will be collected on gestational age, physical exam
      findings and level of respiratory support. Diagnoses will be recorded based on ultrasound
      findings. Accuracy of lung ultrasound diagnosis will be compared to that using radiographic
      chest radiography findings to evaluate if lung ultrasound is equivalent, or better than chest
      radiography in order to diagnose TTN versus RDS in this patient population.
