      approximately 200 patients will be enrolled at approximately 25 sites in the United States
      (US). Following completion of either the PRO-807(NCT00630201) or PRO-808 studies, eligible
      patients will be implanted with Probuphine implants in the opposite arm for the PRO-809
      study. Safety, BPN plasma levels, and efficacy measures will be collected during the 24-week
      treatment period.
