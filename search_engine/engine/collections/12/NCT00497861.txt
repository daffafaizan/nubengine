      to manual side posture (HVL) adjustments in patients with acute low back pain.

      Primary outcomes measured include pain measurement with a VAS scale, the use of the Oswestry
      pain scale questionnaire, and the Bournemouth back pain scale questionnaire.

      An additional aim of this study is to evaluate feasibility of recruitment, data collection,
      and other procedures which can lead to additional studies with larger number of subjects
      including a control group.
