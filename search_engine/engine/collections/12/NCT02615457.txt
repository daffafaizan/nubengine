      Compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with triple
      negative breast cancer who are randomized to adjuvant Huaier Granule group vs. those
      randomized to Blank-control group.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to the following one of two treatment groups and are followed
      annually.

      Arm I: Patients taking Huaier Granule for adjuvant treatment after the triple negative breast
      cancer has been surgically removed.

      Arm II: Patients not taking Huaier Granule after the triple negative breast cancer has been
      surgically removed.
