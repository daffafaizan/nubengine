      Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Non-invasive, radiation-free
      diagnostic needs further improvement. In this study, the investigators test the hypothesis
      that their method, which measures the myocardial deformation using 3D echocardiography is
      superior to previous ultrasound technologies with regard to diagnosis of stable coronary
      artery disease. The aim is establish an improved, non-invasive method to diagnose stable
      coronary artery disease.

      Objective

      The investigators want to investigate if a 3D-speckle-tracking is superior and more accurate
      in predicting hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis than predicted by 2D
      echocardiography? The reference variable for the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery
      stenosis is invasively measured by coronary flow reserve (CFR) in consideration of collateral
      flow (CFI).

      Methods

      This is a prospective observational study. The investigators will include 100 persons who are
      scheduled for an elective coronary angiography.

      A regular 2D-stress echocardiography according to the international guidelines will be
      performed (incl. PLAX, SAX, 2CV, 4CV). The classification of regional wall motion abnormality
      is carried out according to the internationally recognized standards in 16 myocardial
      segments of the LV, with a grading of wall thickening (0 = dyskinetic, akinetic = 1, 2 =
      hypokinetic, 3 = normal). In addition, a 3D speckle tracking is performed after data
      transfer. To determine the functional relevance of any stenosis (reference method) a flow
      reserve in a maximum of two coronary arteries will be performed.

      Test accuracy of 2D stress echocardiography and the new 3D method for detecting a significant
      stenosis (CFI <2) are then compared.
