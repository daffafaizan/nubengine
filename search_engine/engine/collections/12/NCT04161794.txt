    
      In a single arm intervention study, we will provide a multimodal intervention consisting of
      dietary counselling, physical exercises plan as well as fish oil.

      The target of the dietary counselling is:

        -  30 kcal/kg/d (in patients with BMI <30) or 25 kcal/kg/d (in patients with BMI => 30)

        -  at least 1.0 g protein/kg/d

        -  three daily meals of at least 20 g of protein

        -  restrict overnight fasting to a maximum of 11 hours

      The initial dietary counselling is at the first cycle of anti-neoplastic treatment. The
      patient will be provided an individual plan to meet the dietary targets tailored to the
      individual preferences and symptoms. At every cycle of anti-neoplastic treatment, the plan
      will be adjusted if needed. At every week the patients will be prompted by telephone to
      comply with the dietary plan.

      The physical exercise consists of two exercises:

        -  strength training: a progressive sit-to-stand exercise which is a lower extremity
           exercise.

        -  cardio-vascular training: a progressive brisk walking plan. Patients are prompted to
           execute both exercises twice weekly. The individual targets are set at the first cycle
           of anti-neoplastic treatment and adjusted during the trial.

      Fish oil:

      The patients are instructed to ingest 10g of liquid fish oil (consisting of 2 g EPA/DHA) or 8
      capsules of fish oil (consisting of 2 g EPA/DHA)
