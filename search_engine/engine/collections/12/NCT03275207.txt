      surgery. It is most common in patients who undergoing breast or thoracic surgery.
      Dexmedetomidine, a adrenergic Î±2 agonists, can alleviate the postoperative pain 24 h after
      surgery. In our study, patients were randomly assigned to one of the two group to receive
      0.5mg/kg/h infusion dexmedetomidine (Group D, n=57) or normal saline (Group C, n=57). The
      pain scales were evaluated day 1, day 2, day 3, month 3, month 6 after surgery.
