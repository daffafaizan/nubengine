      the general population, initiate use at a younger age, and report more difficulty trying to
      quit. The overarching goal of the present application is to use neuroimaging,
      neuropharmacological and molecular genetic techniques to study the neurobiological basis of
      abstinence-induced deficits in response inhibition in ADHD and non-ADHD smokers. Twenty
      smokers with ADHD and 20 smokers without ADHD will undergo imaging during a Go/No-Go task
      under the following conditions: 1) smoking as usual, 2) 24 hr smoking abstinence, and 3) 24
      hr smoking abstinence + methylphenidate (MPH). We hypothesize that compared to smoking as
      usual, 24 hr smoking abstinence will result in decrements in response inhibition and
      disruption of task-related brain activation. These effects will be greater in ADHD as
      compared to non-ADHD smokers. We further hypothesize that MPH administration during
      abstinence will restore performance and brain indices of response inhibition and that the
      magnitude of the effect of MPH will be greater among smokers with ADHD. In addition to the
      above aims, we will preliminarily evaluate the moderating effects of the dopamine receptor D4
      7-repeat allele on task-related brain activation following smoking abstinence and MPH
      administration.

      During the study, 101 subjects signed consents and 38 subjects completed the study.
