      cell carcinoma. II. Describe the toxicities of this regimen in this patient population. III.
      Assess the development of peripheral neuropathy in this patient population using this
      regimen. IV. Assess a limited sampling of pharmacokinetics and correlate with toxicity in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      documented complete response receive an additional 2 courses, and may receive retreatment at
      the time of progression at the discretion of the investigator. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study over 4-15 months.
