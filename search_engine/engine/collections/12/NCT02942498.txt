      prevalence (-78%) and incidence (-64%) of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly population. It
      has recently been shown that dietary vitamin E supplementation reduces the production of free
      radicals inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity in circulating neutrophils. Another work describes
      the inhibition of glutamate release by activated microglia in cell cultures incubated with
      vitamin E, effect that can prevent excitotoxicity.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in neurodevelopmental
      disorders affected by fragile X syndrome (FXS) with lipophilic compounds antioxidants such as
      tocopherol and hydrophilic compounds antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, which regulate
      oxidative stress and improve learning and behavioral mouse model and humans.

      Our group has positive results in the use of this combination of antioxidants as a treatment
      for fragile X syndrome in adolescents. This disease has developed previous clinical trials
      with EUDRACT codes: 2009-017837-23 and 2013-004276-35.

      The use of the combination of vitamin C and E in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral
      disorder in FXS, is patented PCT-050 187 with reference number 2011070875

      This combination will be administered as a single oral dose with a total dose of 10mg / kg /
      day for each of the vitamins. This dose is maintained within the therapeutic range of both
      antioxidants.
