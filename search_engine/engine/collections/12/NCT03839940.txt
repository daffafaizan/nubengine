      I. To determine if the initiation of dexamethasone at the start of everolimus treatment
      prevents mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS)-associated pain, compared to the
      initiation of placebo.

      II. To determine if the initiation of dexamethasone at the start of everolimus treatment will
      be superior compared to the initiation of placebo in terms of the overall severity of
      mIAS-associated pain.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To utilize the same measurement method that was reported in the SWISH trial: A combination
      of a patient reported pain scale, data from a normalcy of diet questionnaire, and clinician
      grading of stomatitis to determine the incidence of > grade 2 mIAS.

      II. To determine if the initiation of dexamethasone at the start of everolimus increases time
      to development of mouth pain using daily numerical analog scale patient-reported data
      collection.

      III. To assess if quality of life is better when dexamethasone mouth rinse use starts at the
      same time as everolimus use versus at the time when mouth pain begins.

      IV. To investigate if starting dexamethasone mouth rinse concurrent with starting everolimus
      improves patients' ability to adhere to everolimus therapy.

      V. To compare dexamethasone prescription fill rates and timing between patients who received
      placebo versus study drug at the initiation of everolimus.

      Trial Design:

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) as standard of care and
      dexamethasone as mouthwash over 2 minutes 4 times per day (QID) for 8 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive everolimus PO QD as standard of care and placebo as mouthwash over
      2 minutes QID for 8 weeks.
