    
      This study is designed as a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm clinical
      investigation. Subjects will be followed up at regular intervals for one year following
      implantation to collect safety and performance information. Enrollment will be halted at
      every serious adverse device event (SADE).

      The sensor device is intended to be permanently implanted suprachoroidal in the human eye
      during non-penetrating glaucoma surgery and is used in conjunction with the hand-held
      MESOGRAPH reading device to telemetrically measure the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the
      implanted eye.

      The sample size calculation was based on the study's dual purpose of establishing safety and
      comparability of IOP measurements with the ARGOS-SC system to those made with GAT and DCT.
      IOP measurements will be made with all devices at various time points, resulting in a within
      individual control for IOP variables. Based on these calculations (performance, safety) and
      considering possible drop-outs, the exploratory investigation will enroll 24 patients. The
      minimum number of measurements required to hold the performance claim is approx. 120. With
      multiple (>8) measurements with either method (ARGOS, GAT) per patient, a sufficient number
      of paired measurements (in total >>120 measurement pairs) will be available to show
      equivalence of the methods (primary objective).
