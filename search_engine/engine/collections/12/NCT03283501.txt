      to extend current transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) indications to patients at
      low or intermediate risk. The safety of TAVI in this population was initially tested in small
      observational studies and recently reported in the randomized PARTNER 2 and Surgical
      Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Trial (SURTAVI) trials, which
      demonstrated non- inferiority of TAVI in low or intermediate risk patients as compared to
      surgery with respect to the primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke. In view of the
      changes in the TAVI population, including younger patients with longer survival, the number
      of patients that may require coronary revascularization after TAVI is expected to increase
      over the time. Of note, challenges in performing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in
      patients previously treated with TAVI have been reported in small series.

      Against this background, the purpose of this retrospective multicenter study is to evaluate
      incidence, clinical indications, and feasibility of PCI performed after TAVI.

      Objectives

        1. Evaluate the incidence of PCI after TAVI

        2. Evaluate the clinical indications for PCI after TAVI

        3. Evaluate the technical feasibility of PCI in patients with prior TAVI

        4. Evaluate in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PCI after
           TAVI
