      interventions: (1) vegan, (2) vegan with amla fruits, (3) my plate-low purine, (4) my
      plate-low purine with amla fruits. During the 3 months intervention phase, participants will
      attend group lessons and individual nutrition counseling sessions to assist adherence to the
      diet. At baseline, end of 3 months, and 1 year, participants will be measured on uric acid
      and other cardiometabolic risk factors, and some nutritional markers. Amla fruits powder, and
      some foods encouraged in each dietary arm will be provided to enhance adherence during the 3
      months intervention phase.
