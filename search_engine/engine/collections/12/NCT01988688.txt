    
      This is a single institution, open-label, phase I clinical trial to estimate the treatment
      effect size and to assess preliminary safety and tolerability of DBS in the caudate nucleus
      (area LC) in adults with a big or very big problem (tinnitus functional index TFI>50) with
      chronic tinnitus. Up to 10 subjects will be implanted. The DBS stimulation parameters are
      patient-specific and will be allowed to vary over the course of the treatment periods,
      calibrated by the TFI. During Period I, stimulation will be continuous. During Period II,
      there will be three stimulation OFF/ON epochs, where the stimulation will be turned OFF and
      then turned back ON when the tinnitus loudness returns to a certain level (based on a change
      in the TFI score). During Period III, stimulation will be "on demand," i.e. controlled by the
      subject and determined by subject preference. An important goal is to determine whether
      tinnitus can be controlled through optimization of stimulation parameters.
