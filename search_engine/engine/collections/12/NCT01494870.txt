      reperfusion therapy in the case of evolving myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation
      (STEMI). Optimal use of PCI (preferably) or thrombolysis in this situation requires a rapid
      and correct diagnosis.

      According to the ESC'2008 and ACC/AHA'2009 focused update guidelines patients admitted to the
      hospital within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain with new (or presumably new) left
      bundle-branch block (LBBB) should be treated like patients having STEMI (class I, level A).
      However, it is well-known that in patients with concomitant LBBB, the ECG manifestations of
      acute myocardial injury may be masked.

      ACS may occur in a patient with "true old" LBBB (when doctor has/has not an ability to
      compare the new ECG with the previous one) or (presumably) new LBBB.

      There is a high risk of non receiving appropriate therapy or of receiving inappropriate
      therapy (thrombolysis instead of LMWH/UFH/fondaparinux).
