      of a cognitive behavioral therapy for patients at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. The
      3-month experimental intervention consists of 12 individual sessions with regular involvement
      of carers or other patient proxies. Strategies for improving the patient's coping ability and
      for enhancing their psychological well-being are combined. The primary outcome criterion is
      functioning in the everyday context after completion of the intervention and after another 6
      months. The control condition will be treatment as usual. The study will be conducted in 5
      university outpatient units and in 5 specialist offices.
