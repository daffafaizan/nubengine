      Despite significant advances in prevention, postoperative ileus continues to be a clinical
      issue. For patients experiencing postoperative ileus after a bowel resection, current
      treatment includes bowel rest, reduction of oral diet, and possible nasogastric tube
      placement while waiting for the postoperative ileus to resolve. Postoperative ileus results
      in postoperative complications, discomfort, and increases hospital stay. Electro-acupuncture
      treatment could potentially expedite the return of bowel function, reducing length of stay
      and increasing comfort. Additionally, acupuncture has been shown to be helpful for pain and
      nausea management, and thus may reduce the need for opioid and anti-nausea medications.

      This study includes two groups. Both groups will be treated with conservative standard care
      (SOC), including bowel rest with nothing by mouth (NPO) status and placement of nasogastric
      tube if clinically necessary. Participants in both groups will continue on SOC postoperative
      recovery care with early feeding and ambulation, along with minimizing opioid use.

      Group A: Participants assigned to group A will receive the SOC treatment described above and
      will also be asked to complete questionnaires to rate their symptoms.

      Group B: Participants assigned to group B will receive the SOC described above and be given a
      daily 20-30 minute acupuncture treatment from the time of randomization until the return
