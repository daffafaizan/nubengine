      increasing effort. Especially in patients with mild to severe COPD, EFL can present
      challenges when receiving mechanical ventilation. To overcome EFLT expiratory positive airway
      pressure (EPAP) is applied; however, a single level or fixed EPAP may not overcome the
      airflow obstruction. The current study was undertaken to explore the variability of EFLT
      determined using Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) to dynamically measure lung reactance
      (∆Xrs) and to evaluate the ability of automatically adjusted EPAP (PEEPopt) to over come EFLT
      overnight and over a two week period.

      In this prospective non-randomized trial, an unreleased noninvasive ventilator set in an S/T
      mode applied continuous oscillations (5 Hz, 1 cmH2O amplitude, 2 cmH20 peak to peak).
      Response to the oscillations was analyzed to calculate ∆Xrs and EPAP was adjusted
      automatically between 4 and 20 cmH2O. A fixed pressure support of 6 cmH2O was delivered. ∆Xrs
      was measured sitting and supine. Participants with evidence of EFLT (∆Xrs > 2.8) were asked
      to undergo overnight polysomnography (PSG) and then a sub-group of patients used the
      ventilator at home for two weeks. EFLT within and between participants was analyzed. EFLT
      behavior during PSG, the response of the device to dynamically abolish EFLT, as well as the
      impact of this therapy on sleep quality was studied. Objective ventilator adherence data were
      used to determine usage after the 2-week in-home use. Additionally, experienced NIV
      participants qualitatively rated therapy comfort compared to their current treatment.
