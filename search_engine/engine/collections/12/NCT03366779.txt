      of 6mm. Other iterations of the device are made with an 8mm wide anchor. The narrower anchor
      was designed to optimize surgeon visualization during implantation, and has undergone all
      appropriate rigorous testing prior to release. Safety will be evaluated to demonstrate
      acceptable levels of device-related and procedure-related complications. This limited market
      release will allow its performance to be evaluated by examining the effects on reoperation,
      device deficiencies, patient pain scores and disability after discectomy with ACD.
