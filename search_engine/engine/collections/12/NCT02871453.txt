      stroke patients develop motor dysfunction in the early stage after stroke. Acupuncture is
      often used as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. Jiao's scalp acupuncture
      is a contemporary acupuncture technique integrating traditional Chinese needling methods with
      western medical knowledge of representative areas of the cerebral cortex. It has been widely
      applied to be a kind of effective treatment for stroke in China. But, there is meta-analysis
      suggests that with stroke rehabilitation, acupuncture has no additional effect on motor
      recovery but has a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo
      effect and varied study quality. The efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation
      remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies.

      The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether scalp acupuncture treatment
      could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke patients.

      In this 8-week, assessor-blind, randomized, controlled study of scalp acupuncture as
      additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 116 patients with ischemic
      stroke patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to scalp
      acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment (n =58) or rehabilitation treatment (n
      =58). (40 sessions, 5 sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured
      using Fugl-Meyer Scale, Modified Barthel Index and SS-QOL scale. The study will be conducted
      at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University,
      Hua Shan Hospital.
