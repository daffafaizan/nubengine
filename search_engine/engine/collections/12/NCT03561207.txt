      study for the purpose of examining the Assay's clinical use and potential to impact patient
      outcomes. This Study will establish a registry of clinical parameters, including clinical
      response, clinical outcomes, Assay performance and potential utilization across multiple
      types of advanced cancers in consenting patients who have their tumor tissue tested by the
      Assay. Physicians may have access to Assay results which which predict therapeutic response
      to cancer drugs most often prescribed to treat the specified indications. For cancers with
      standard of care (SOC) cancer drug treatments, the Assay panel tests SOC systemic agents per
      NCCN guidelines, some of which may include both FDA approved and off-label FDA approved
      therapies. The Assay currently assesses the most common cancer drugs across multiple tumor
      types. It requires freshly obtained tumor specimen that has not been previously preserved for
      traditional histologic analysis. The Registry will focus initially on tumor types and agents
      which have been analytically validated with the Assay and determined to meet strict
      laboratory qualifications and standards. The Registry will collect data on a limited number
      of cancer types to include epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), high-grade gliomas (HGG) limited
      to anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and high-grade rare tumors
      (RT).
