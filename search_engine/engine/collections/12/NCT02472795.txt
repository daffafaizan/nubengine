    
      This multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will have a staggered approach (Part
      A and B).

      In part A, eligible patients will be randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to once daily oral
      administration of cenerimod (0.5, 1, 2 mg) or placebo. After all patients have completed 4
      weeks of treatment during part A, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review
      non-blinded data in an interim analysis to evaluate the safety profile of cenerimod and
      recommend whether the study could proceed to part B.

      In part B, additional patients will be randomized (3:1) to once daily oral administration of
      cenerimod 4 mg or placebo.

      All participants will receive study medication for 12 weeks.
