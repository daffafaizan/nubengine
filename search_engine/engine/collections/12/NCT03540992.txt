      from primary clinic based on inclusion or exclusion criteria. Basic clinical information,
      compliance with antihypertensive medications, concomitant use of other medications will be
      investigated and all patients will perform 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure measurement.
      Screening for renal artery stenosis and primary aldosteronism will be conducted. Office blood
      pressure will be taken every 3-6 months. Home blood pressure measurement and 24-hr ambulatory
      blood pressure measurement will be performed every year. The primary outcome is the newly
      developed MACE during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes are newly developed target
      organ damage (LVH confirmed by echocardiography or EKG, carotid femoral PWV≥ 12m/s,
      microalbuminuria (Urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g)) and decline of renal function
      (doubling of serum creatinine, dialysis). The follow-up period is 3 years.
