      recesses, maxillary ostia, and/or sphenoid sinus ostia were performed in 175 patients.

      One-month follow-up was required for all patients. The first 50 patients enrolled also
      consented to a 1-year follow-up. Complications and sinus symptom severity were assessed at
      the 1-month visit. Symptom severity and ostial patency of the treated sinuses were evaluated
      at the 1-year visit.
