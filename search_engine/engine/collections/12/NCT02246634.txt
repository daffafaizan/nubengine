      weighted MRI, to look for cancer in the liver. Normally you will have this scan within 4
      weeks of joining the study. You will be able to start your cancer treatment while you are in
      the study so having this scan will not delay the start of your treatment. If the diffusion
      weighted MRI scan of the liver is abnormal you will asked to return for another MRI scan of
      your liver, this time with an injection of contrast during the scan, to establish whether you
      have cancer in the liver. If this scan is positive for cancer your doctors will discuss with
      you the best method of treating your colorectal cancer and the cancer in your liver, which
      may include additional chemotherapy, radiotherapy or another operation.

      We also want to find out about your quality of life; therefore we will ask you to fill out a
      short questionnaire at one year and at two years after you join the study.

      All participants will be followed up by their doctors, as per standard. There are no follow
      up visits specifically for the study although we will carefully monitor your progress for
      three years.
