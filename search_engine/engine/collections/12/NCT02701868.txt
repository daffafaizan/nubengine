      individuals to follow commercially available infant formula instructions. The investigators
      will collaborate with the LA CaTS Health Literacy Core to improve the reading and
      comprehension of the manufacturer package instruction, and will solicit the input of
      caregivers and key stakeholders to inform the development of educational intervention around
      infant feeding. Following modification of infant formula preparation instructions, the
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the
      modified instructions on infant overfeeding in comparison with the manufacturer package
      instructions. One hundred and fifty participants will be asked to complete one study visit
      during which they will be asked to measure various serving sizes of infant formula following
      either the manufacturer package instructions or the modified instructions.
