      participants who have EDS due to OSA despite using CPAP. The study will evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of a single IV dose of
      TAK-925 in participants with OSA.

      The study will enroll approximately 42 patients. The study will utilize a three-way cross
      over design with a 24 hour wash-out between each treatment.

      On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 or placebo will be administered as a single 9-hour
      IV infusion.

      The multi-center study will be conducted in United States. The patient's participation in the
      study will last for up to 43 days and include an 8-day stay in the study clinic and a safety
      follow-up phone call 7 days after the end of treatment.
