    
      This study is designed to evaluate user/physician preference as it relates to use of a 510(k)
      cleared vascular access and catheter device compared with conventional needle/catheter
      vascular access devices, in terms of first stick success rates, dwell time, device-related
      vascular complications and adverse events and overall user and patient satisfaction. As noted
      above, the study is designed to formally test the hypothesis that the AccuCathâ„¢ System will
      exhibit superiority in terms of the rate of successful first attempt peripheral IV placement,
      higher completion of therapy, fewer complications, longer dwell times and higher user
      satisfaction compared to conventional intravenous catheters.
