    
      -  Approximately 84 eligible study participants will be randomized to either CAP-1002 or
           placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

        -  The trial will include visits at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Week 4, and Months 3, 6, 9,
           and 12 with IV infusions of CAP-1002 or placebo on Day 1 and Months 3, 6, and 9.

        -  Safety evaluations will include adverse events, concomitant medications, physical exam,
           vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory testing.

        -  Efficacy will be evaluated in the Performance of the Upper Limb, pulmonary function
           testing, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (ambulatory subjects only), strength testing,
           cardiac MRI, and quality of life.

        -  If trial data suggests an appropriate risk/benefit profile of CAP-1002, Capricor, upon
           the recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), will introduce an
           open-label extension study to offer CAP-1002 to study participants who were randomized
           to placebo and completed all trial visits during the 12-month period.
