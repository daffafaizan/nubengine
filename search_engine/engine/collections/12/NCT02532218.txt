      trial. The study will compare two arms: ARI-3037MO 3 g BID vs. placebo.

      Subjects who sign informed consent will be enrolled and will undergo all Visit 1 assessments.
      Following evaluation of Visit 1 laboratory assays, eligible subjects will receive a phone
      call (Visit 2) during which they will be instructed to begin the lifestyle modification and
      enter a 4- to 6-week lead-in period (6-week wash-out period for subjects to wash out of
      non-statin lipid-lowering therapy [subjects may remain on statins during this period], 4
      weeks for subjects receiving statins only or not receiving any lipid-lowering therapy),
      followed by a qualifying fasting LDL-C measurement at Visit 3. After the lead-in period, if
      the LDL-C level at Visit 3 is not ≥ 100 mg/dL, an additional week will be allowed for another
      qualifying measurement at a subsequent visit (Visit 3.1). If performed, the LDL-C level at
      Visit 3.1 must be ≥ 100 mg/dL in order for the subject to continue participation in the
      study. Qualifying subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner at Visit 4 to one of two arms
      of the double-blind, 24-week efficacy and safety assessment phase. Randomization will be
      stratified by background statin therapy status at Visit 1 (yes/no). Baseline lipid levels
      will be defined as lipid levels at Visit 4. End-of-study lipid levels will be defined as the
      lipid levels at Visit 7 (Week 24).

      A final closeout and safety assessment visit will be held at 26 weeks post randomization
      (Visit 8).
