      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. The investigational intervention in this study is SBRT with
      proton or photon radiation (explained below). "Investigational" means that the intervention
      is being studied. SBRT and proton radiation therapy are FDA approved radiation delivery
      systems. However, using it as a treatment for stage IV NSCLC is still investigational.

      SBRT is a specialized, technologically advanced type of external beam radiation therapy that
      pinpoints high doses of radiation directly on the cancer. Because of high precision, these
      treatments spare healthy tissue and are associated with fewer side effects. SBRT is very
      different from conventional therapy where radiation is delivered in small doses given daily
      over the course of several weeks. For SBRT, the total dose of radiation is typically
      administered in 4-5 daily sessions. SBRT can be delivered with standard, so called photon
      radiation, or proton beam. Neither of these two types of radiation is generally superior over
      the other. There are technical differences between these two, and depending on tumor
      location, size, shape, and other factors, the investigators will decide which type of
      radiation to use for which treatment.

      After the screening procedures confirm you are eligible to participate in the research study:

      - Each participant will receive stereotactic treatment course (SBRT with protons or photons)
      to the area of their tumor.
