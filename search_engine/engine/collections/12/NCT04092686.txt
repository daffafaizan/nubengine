    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, fixed-dosed study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of two doses of SEP-363856 (75 and 100 mg/day) versus placebo over a
      6-week Treatment Period in acutely psychotic subjects with schizophrenia. This study is
      projected to randomize approximately 462 subjects to 3 treatment groups (SEP-363856 75
      mg/day, SEP-363856 100 mg/day, or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment assignment will be
      stratified by country. Study drug will be taken once a day and may be taken with or without
      food.

      This study is designed to test the hypotheses that treatment with SEP-363856 in adult
      subjects with schizophrenia will result in significantly greater reduction (i.e. improvement)
      in PANSS total score and CGI-S score at Week 6 from Baseline when compared to placebo. The
      overall Type I error is controlled for two hierarchical families of hypotheses. The first
      family includes hypotheses about the testing of change from Baseline in PANSS total score at
      Week 6 between each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo. The second family of
      hypotheses are about the testing of change from Baseline in CGI-S score at Week 6 between
      each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo.
