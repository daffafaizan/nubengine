      remission/disappearance of the cancer) can lead to a complete remission (CR) in a large
      percentage (60% to 80%) of younger patients with newly diagnosed AML. However, the majority
      of patients relapse (their disease returns) despite intensive consolidation chemotherapy. In
      most chemotherapy studies, only a small percentage (30% to 40%) of patients who achieve a CR
      still are disease-free 5 years later. The outcome for older adults is even less favorable.
      Approximately 75% of elderly patients who achieve CR will relapse after 2 years or less and
      the toxicities seen with treatment are significant. A number of studies have shown that
      chemotherapy given to older adults after a remission has not improved this outcome; therefore
      new treatments need to be investigated. Clofarabine is a drug that has been studied in older
      adults who have achieved a CR. The treatment was found to have fewer side effects then other
      consolidation therapies. This study will give participants the drug for a longer period of
      time to see if doing this will extend the cancer remission. Clofarabine has been approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), another form of acute
      leukemia. The study drug is considered experimental for AML because it has not been approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AML.
