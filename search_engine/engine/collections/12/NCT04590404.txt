    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare effects of MIST versus usual care (UC)
      interventions on the outcomes below.

      Objectives:

        -  Abstinence as defined by biochemically-verified self-reported 7-day point prevalence
           abstinence at 6 m (1° study outcome) and 12 m (2° outcome).

        -  Clinical practice implementation as measured by participant self-reported medication
           adherence at months 1 and 3, self-reported receipt of prescription for smoking cessation
           medication after hospital discharge, and whether the prescription was tailored to the
           NMR result.

      Exploratory Objective:

      - Longitudinal assessment of health care utilization visits (ER and hospitalization) for 12
      months following hospital discharge.
