      potentially induce the process of autophagy and thus significantly limit viral replication in
      cells.

      Camostat is approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and reflux
      esophagitis. It has been shown to effectively block viral replication in a SARS-CoV-2 animal
      model.

      Since the mechanisms of actions are different, it was hypothesized that a combination of both
      substances might have an additive or even synergistic effect in the treatment of patients
      with COVID-19.

      This study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      the treatment combination niclosamide and camostat in mild and moderately affected COVID-19
      patients.
