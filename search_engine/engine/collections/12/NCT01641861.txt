      especially in developing countries. There are many techniques used for dental caries
      treatment. The conventional method is to remove caries and prepare the cavity using dental
      burs. Disadvantages of this method; however, include the patients' repulsion of drilling, and
      possible thermal changes on tooth surface that may have an effect on the dental pulp tissues.
      In addition, the drilling technique frequently requires local anesthesia injections and
      sometimes results in the removal of sound tooth tissues. To overcome these problems and
      preserve the healthy dental tissues, the chemo-mechanical caries removal method was
      developed. The advantage by chemomechanical caries removal include less traumatic, less need
      local anesthesia, reduced chance of dental pulp exposure. And also it could be benefit to
      medical compromised patients.

      Papacarie® is a new chemo-mechanical technique for caries removal with few published research
      and case reports. A randomized controlled trial is therefore needed to determine the efficacy
      of its use in general population. The aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of a
      chemo-mechanical system (Papacarie®) for caries removal in comparison to the conventional
      drilling method.
