    
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot study comparing usual care
      + PEMF with usual care + sham.

      The investigators will recruit patients with LBP from the University of Bridgeport
      chiropractic clinic, and will enroll 80 total subjects: 40 with acute or subacute LBP, and 40
      with chronic LBP. Within each of those populations the investigators will assign 20 subjects
      to receive usual care + PEMF, and 20 to receive usual care + sham. The investigators will
      track any other treatments initiated or discontinued during the trial.

      Patients who agree to participate with be randomly given a functional PEMF device or a sham
      unit. Patients and clinicians will be blinded to the assignment. All subjects will be given
      the same instructions for daily use of the devices, and will continue to receive usual
      follow-up at the UBCC clinic as indicated. The investigators will collect patient-reported
      measures of pain and function pain at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, and will collect data
      on adverse effects at each visit and at 6 and 12 weeks.
