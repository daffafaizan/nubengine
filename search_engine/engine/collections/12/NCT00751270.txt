      resectable (Arm B) malignant glioma. Three dose levels of AdV-tk were evaluated with a fixed
      dose level of valacyclovir prodrug. AdV-tk was delivered to tumor cells by stereotactic
      injection into the tumor at the time of biopsy (Arm A) or injection into the tumor bed
      following resection (Arm B). Oral valacyclovir began 1-3 days after the AdV-tk injection and
      continued for 14 days. Standard radiation therapy began 3-7 days following the AdV-tk
      injection to maximize synergy with radiation. Standard temozolomide could be administered
      after completion of valacyclovir.
