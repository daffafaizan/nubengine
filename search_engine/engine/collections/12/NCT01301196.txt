      Diabetes (T2DM). As the health and economic costs of T2DM continue to increase, there is an
      urgent need for an effective lifestyle intervention to prevent the development of T2DM. Our
      group have previously developed successful structured education programmes: DESMOND improved
      lifestyle, depression, illness beliefs, weight and CV risk in adults with T2DM; PREPARE
      increased activity levels and reduced 2 hour glucose values in people with pre-diabetes.
      Project STAND will assess the effect of theory driven structured education, facilitated using
      automated technology, on sedentary behaviour and health outcomes in young adults at risk of
      T2DM. Participants will be randomised to a control (C) or intervention (I) group, the latter
      given structured education, based on the PREPARE and DESMOND programmes, with the aim of
      reducing sedentary behaviour. The structured education programme will incorporate movement
      technology to facilitate participant feedback and self-monitoring.This will be the first UK
      trial to address sedentary behaviour change in a population of younger adults at risk of
      T2DM. Our results will provide a platform for the development of a range of future
      multidisciplinary interventions in this rapidly expanding high-risk population.
