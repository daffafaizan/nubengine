      our local data is deficient for making better management guidelines. My study aims to provide
      a base for future research on this dimension and to decide better management plan for post
      cardiac surgical pulmonary complications. The hypothesis is Post extubation BiPAP is more
      effective than Incentive Spirometry (IS) in reducing postoperative pulmonary complications in
      cardiac surgical patients and the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Bi-level
      Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and Incentive Spirometry (IS) in cardiac surgical patients.

      This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study will be conducted at Chaudhary pervaiz elahi
      institute of cardiology ICU multan.

      A sample size of 350 patients will be taken and effect of BiPAP and Incentive spirometry will
      be studied in reducing pulmonary complications post CABG surgery. Data will be analyzed
      through SPSS. For quantitative variables, mean and standard deviation will be calculated and
      for qualitative variables, frequency and percentage will be calculated. Chi square test will
      be used to estimate association between qualitative variables. A p value < 0.05 will be
      significant.
