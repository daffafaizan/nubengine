      blood pressure, norepinephrine, and plasma renin in individuals with spinal cord injury
      compared with age-matched uninjured controls. Arterial stiffness and blood pressure will be
      collected in the laying down position. A blood sample of norepinephrine and plasma renin will
      also be collected. The participant will tilt to 30, 45 and 60 degrees for 10 minutes at each
      angel. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored at each angle. Another blood sample of
      renin and norepinephrine will be collected at the end of 10 minutes at 60 degrees.
