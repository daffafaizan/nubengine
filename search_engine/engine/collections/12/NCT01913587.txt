      increases the risk of spinal compression fracture. Nerve block is effective for the
      management of pain from inflammation or nerve root stimulation from spinal compression
      fracture. As one of alternative interventions, acupuncture is effective for controlling
      spinal compression fracture.

      This study aims to investigate that combination with acupuncture and nerve block may relieve
      spinal compression fracture-related pain versus nerve block alone.
