      "Ezra LeMarpeh" Center, at 24 Chida St., Bnei Brak. After a detailed explanation of the
      nature of the study, the participants will sign an informed consent form. The center's
      physiotherapists will test walking abilities, motor functioning and abilities in activities
      of daily living (ADL).

      Walking tests can include walking at a comfortable pace, walking while counting (dual
      tasking), walking at different speeds and more. The balance tests include standing on a small
      base, standing on one leg, standing with eyes closed, and more. During the tests participants
      will wear small, non-invasive sensors at the wrists, ankles, and lower back. These sensors
      include an accelerometers and a gyroscopes that can be used to quantify gait measures, such
      as gait velocity, step length and variability. Lower back sensors will be worn continuously
      for up to a week for everyday activity.

      At the end of the program, the participants will be asked to repeat evaluation tests.
