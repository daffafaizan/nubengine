      liver, almost all patients with metastatic prostate cancer will have bone metastasis. And
      about 90% of patients dying from breast cancer has skeletal metastasis.

      The most common site to which cancer metastasize to long bones is the proximal femur,
      especially to the intertrochanteric region and femoral neck, contributing to increasing
      incidence of impending and pathologic fractures of this site.(8) Recent advances in cancer
      treatment increased the longevity of patients, with subsequent increase in morbidity of
      metastatic disease and increased number of patients living longer with this condition .

      To date, long femoral stem is most frequently used in cases of pathological and impending
      proximal femoral fractures. Its use is believed to add more stability and prophylactically
      protect the entire femur from newly developed distal lesions. However, long stems has more
      operative time, more cardiopulmonary complications and are more technically demanding
      compared to standard femoral stems arthroplasty.(5) Recent retrospective study by Xing et al
      reported comparable outcomes between standard, medium and long stems and concluded that the
      routine use of long stems is unjustified.Another recent report by Joel et al investigated the
      use of long femoral stem in 22 limbs, they reported no hardware failure with no cases of
      intraoperative cardiopulmonary complications, however they recommended larger comparative
      trials with rigorous methods to investigate the functional outcomes and complications of long
      femoral stems in proximal femoral metastatic lesions.

      In face of the potential advantages in this patient population, the goal of this study is to
      investigate the use of standard length femoral stems and its results compared to long femoral
      stems in proximal femoral metastasis .
