      include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), guidelines medication (GDMT) and coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) were clinical proven to be effective to realize myocardial
      revascularization post CHD. Previous studies revealed that diagnosed depressed CHD patients
      have 3.6 times higher risk of major adverse events (MACE) post percutaneous coronary
      intervention than nondepressed. However, a reliable explanation of how depression impact
      clinical outcomes of CHD patients post PCI is lacking. The objective of this study is to
      observe the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart
      disease co-morbid with depression post PCI, and to explore a prognostic model of clinical
      outcomes based on physiological, interventional, socio-economic and psychological factors
      among these patients.
