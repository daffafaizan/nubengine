      particulate matter (PM) of outdoor origin will be more closely associated with acute
      asthmatic responses to particles than 24-hour average exposures in susceptible individuals;
      2) Personal exposure to PM, and estimated particle dose to the lungs, will be more closely
      associated with daily asthma severity than standard outdoor particle concentrations measured
      as 24-hour averages at governmental monitoring sites. Toxicological data for asthma
      exacerbations from particulate matter (PM) suggests that particle deposition in the lower
      respiratory tract can cause inflammatory and lung function changes suggestive of asthma
      pathology. There is now a scientific need to explain epidemiological findings of ambient PM
      effects on asthmatics at mass concentrations below what is expected (from toxicological data)
      to be harmful. One possibility is that study participants are encountering unmeasured
      short-term excursions of particle mass levels capable of inducing adverse reactions in the
      lung, but this effect is only captured somewhat by the regulatory standard of 24-hour
      averages. Our research in southern California is vital to the current controversy regarding
      regulatory standards given that a health-based scientific rationale for any specific PM
      averaging time is not established.
