      advances in HIV prevention efforts, recent data suggest that HIV prevalence is increasing
      generally, and HIV knowledge, a direct contributor to behavior, is on the decline among young
      people specifically as compared to a decade ago.

      The Internet is a promising mode of intervention delivery in resource poor-settings because
      the costs associated with scaling up are minimal; dissemination online is the same if one
      person or 100,000 people use the program. Just as important, it provides access to important
      health information in a stigma-free, anonymous atmosphere. Our recent data indicate that 45%
      of adolescents in Mbarara, Uganda have used the Internet, 78% of whom went online at least
      once in the previous week. Eighty-one percent of respondents in the same survey indicated
      they would go to an HIV prevention web site if it existed. Based upon these data, we propose
      to develop a culturally appropriate, Internet-based HIV prevention program designed
      specifically for Ugandan adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Our specific aims
      are as follows:

      Specific Aim 1: Design a 6-hour, Internet-based HIV prevention program for adolescents.
      Content will be culturally tailored to the HIV preventive information, motivation, and
      behavioral skills needs of Ugandan adolescents.

      Specific Aim 2: Test the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (n=500) among
      adolescents attending grades Secondary 1-4 (similar to US high school grades 8th - 11th) at
      day schools in Mbarara.

      This project has the potential to develop low-cost and salable interventions to HIV
      transmission risk behaviors among adolescents in Uganda.
