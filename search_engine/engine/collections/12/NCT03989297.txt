      controversial. There many reasons behind these inconsistent findings. We used the SP263
      antibody with the standard cut off value of 1% and 5%, which is frequently used for lung
      cancer and other cancer types. We also plan to include over 150 patients, which will be the
      largest study in NPC. This will help us to gain insights in NPC.
