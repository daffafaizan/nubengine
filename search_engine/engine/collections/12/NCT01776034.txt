      stroke survivors have multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Stroke survivors are at
      significant risk for de-conditioning, elevated inflammatory markers, and insulin resistance,
      which subsequently increases risk for secondary stroke and cardiovascular disease. Engaging
      in healthy behaviors, such as physical activity, good sleep hygiene, and nutrition, to
      facilitate energy balance may help reduce the risk of secondary conditions and ultimately
      improve physical function and quality of life in stroke survivors. Thus, the specific study
      aims are to engage potential participants (i.e., stroke survivors) and their families as
      co-designers to adapt the SystemCHANGEâ„¢ comprehensive lifestyle intervention, and then
      conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to provide preliminary estimates of the
      intervention's efficacy in 35 stroke survivors.
