      compare the effect of PADN on PAH patients. Based on the previous studies, the rate of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-related event was around 30% after 6-month treatment
      using target drugs. And our previous data showed that this PAH-related event at 6-month after
      PADN procedure was 15%. As a result, a total of 270 PAH patients was required, with 135
      patients/per group at a ratio of 1:1 randomization. All patients underwent an 18F-DOPA PET/CT
      scan of pulmonary arteries and the heart, performed at basement.
