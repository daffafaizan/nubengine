      in term of symptomatic improvement: reducing fatigue, pain and improving the quality of life,
      psychological and emotional state, and adherence to treatment.

      The aim of the study is to assess the effects of an APA program in pancreatic cancer
      population treated by usual chemotherapy.

      200 randomized patients are required.

      The program is organized in 16 weeks. During the trial, assessments include: aerobic
      exercises, muscular strength, six-minute walk test, body composition (bioimpedance, L3
      CT-scan), level of physical activity - International Physical Activity Questionnaire - (IPAQ
      questionnaire), fatigue - Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory - (MFI-20 questionnaire),
      quality of life - EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire C-30 - (EORTC QLQ-30 questionnaire),
      depression symptom - Hospital Anxiety and depression scale - (HADS questionnaire), pain
      (Brief Pain Inventory Short form), and nutritional evaluation (BMI, ingests EVA).

      Furthermore, relationships between insulin resistance, insulin secretion, Insulin like Growth
      Factor 1 (IGF-1) and pancreatic carcinogenesis exist. APA may improve the quality of life in
      decreasing insulin-resistance, insulin secretion and IGF-1.
