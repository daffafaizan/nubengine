    
      Approximately 16 caregivers of home-based PAD/CG dyads (person with Alzheimer's
      disease/caregiver dyads) will be recruited from the community. A series of two audiotaped
      focus groups will be conducted with these caregiver participants. The first focus group will
      explore perspectives on what constitutes a feasible and acceptable intervention to improve
      their sleep and associated symptoms. The second focus group will consist of follow up and
      confirmation of findings from the first focus group. The intervention will be developed and
      refined based upon focus group findings.
