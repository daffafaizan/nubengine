    
      Patients who progress or do not tolerate a first-line treatment with a Tyrosine Kinase
      Inhibitor will be included consecutively in the study. All patients will receive the same
      treatment regimen consisting of 800 mg / day of pazopanib in monotherapy.

      All patients will receive treatment until there is evidence of progression, evidence of
      unacceptable toxicity, not compliance, investigator clinical decision or consent withdrawal
      by the patient.

      After treatment, the patient will enter to the follow-up period. During this period the
      investigator will collect information from subsequent administered treatments and survival of
      all patients, regardless of the reason for withdrawal, every 8 weeks until the scheduled end
      of follow-up period, according to protocol. At 30 days after treatment completion, the first
      follow up visit will be scheduled to assess the possible occurrence of late toxicity. In
      those patients who complete treatment prior to objectify progression, information about the
      progression of the disease will be collected.
