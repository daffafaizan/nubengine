      monitor will be recruited to the study, while in Phase 2, patients with shunts or Cerebral
      Spinal Fluid (CSF) access devices (Ommaya, reservoir, etc.) will be eligible for the study.

      Two separate groups of patients will be recruited to each phase of the study. Each phase of
      the study will involve MR-ICPs. The MR-ICP is an extra 5-10 minute sequence at the end of a
      MRI that assesses the pressure in the head. The MRI will take scans of the brain during
      different phases of the cardiac cycle and will assess the volume changes while the patient is
      lying flat. The pressure in the head will be estimated based on these calculations. This
      estimate will be compared to the pressure in the head as determined by the ICP monitor.
