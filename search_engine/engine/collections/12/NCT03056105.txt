      telomerase levels in participants' white blood cells, as well as plasma levels of
      interlukin-6 (IL-6), to assess how the retreat experience impacts these markers of cellular
      aging and inflammation. The hypotheses are that retreat participation will increase both
      telomere length and telomerase activity, but decrease IL-6 levels. The investigators will
      also assess the impact of retreat participation on oxytocin-a hormone involved in a number of
      physiological and behavioral processes, including affiliative bonds and stress responses-the
      hypothesis being that participation in the retreat will increase plasma oxytocin levels. The
      investigators will then explore how these and other biomarkers relate to psychological
      processes and personality traits, which may also be altered by participation in the
      meditation retreat.
