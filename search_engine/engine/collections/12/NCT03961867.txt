    
      In this study, patients with gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma who received D2 dissection and
      staged II or III, aged from 18 to 75 years and with ECOG PS â‰¤2 and adequate organ function,
      are stratified randomized according to pstage and location of primary lesion.

      Group DS:

      S-1 is orally administer by BSA (<1.25m2, 80 mg; 1.25 to 1.5m2, 100 mg; >1.5m2,120 mg)
      divided into two doses a day after breakfast and dinner for 14 days every three weeks to a
      total of 16 cycles postoperatively.

      Docetaxel 40mg/m2/3w from the second to the seventh cycles.

      Group SOX:

      S-1 is orally administer by BSA (<1.25m2, 80 mg; 1.25 to 1.5m2, 100 mg; >1.5m2,120 mg)
      divided into two doses a day after breakfast and dinner for 14 days every three weeks to a
      total of 16 cycles postoperatively.

      Oxaliplatin 100mg/m2/3w from the second to the seventh cycles.

      The primary end point is disease-free survival(DFS). The overall survival (OS), safty and
      quality of life are secondary end points.
