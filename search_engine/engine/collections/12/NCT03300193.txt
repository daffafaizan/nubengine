    
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of lesion characteristics in ExAblate
      Transcranial Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) of the Vim
      thalamic nucleus. Clinical measures will be used to study patients suffering from
      medication-refractory tremor, Essential Tremor or idiopathic Parkinson's Disease.

      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, and clinical study. Assessments will
      be made before and after MRgFUS for; clinical tremor relief, quality of life (QoL)
      improvements, assessment of adverse events, and correlations of these measures with the size
      and shape of the lesion and the surrounding edema .
