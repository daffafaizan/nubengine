      participants, planning to role approximately equal numbers of participants in both sites. In
      both phases, all participants will receive the core yoga intervention (12 weeks of weekly
      manualized yoga classes), with random assignment to the 4 key intervention components.
      Participants will be patients enrolled in methadone (MMT) or buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP)
      treatment with chronic pain. Enrollment period for this phase will last approximately 2
      years.
