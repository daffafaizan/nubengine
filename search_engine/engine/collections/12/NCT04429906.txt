    
      This is a cross-sectional diagnostic study. 30~50 inpatient aged 18～85y with SaO2/ SpO2
      between 80%∽100% will be recruited from the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care of
      Peking University First Hospital. 180 group data ( 37 of SaO2/ SpO2 between 80%∽90%, 143 of
      SaO2/ SpO2 between 90%∽100%) will be measured, with an average of 4-6 groups per patient.
      Some clinical information such as demographic data, laboratory tests, comorbidity, smoking
      habit and will be collected. Patients have their pulse oximetry measured multiple times using
      a pulse oximeter/tabletop electrocardiograph with a medical device registration certificate,
      and arterial blood gas analysis will be performed if required. While monitoring the pulse
      oximetry, a Huami smart wearable device is worn on the ipsilateral wrist to determine blood
      oxygen saturation. Primary outcome is the wearable device oximetry accuracy Arms (root mean
      square value of the SwO2-RefSpO2 difference) using a medical device registration certificate
      pulse oximetry monitor/tabletop ECG monitor as a reference..

      The study protocol has been approved by the Peking University First Hospital Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) (2020-114). Any protocol modifications will be submitted for the IRB
      review and approval.
