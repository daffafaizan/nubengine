      Liraglutide on the lipid metabolism an inflammation in adipose tissue. As GLP-1 is presumed
      to improve insulin sensitivity and associated parameters the investigators hypothesize that
      this might be due to changes in lipid metabolism which might be involved in the regulation of
      insulin sensitivity. Therefore the investigators intend to investigate changes of metabolic
      pathways before and after treatment with the GLP-1 analog liraglutide that could play a
      crucial role in pathogenesis as well as regulation of insulin sensitivity and atherogenic
      dyslipidemia such as: de novo lipogenesis and reverse cholesterol transport
