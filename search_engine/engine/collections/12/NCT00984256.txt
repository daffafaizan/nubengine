      infected mosquitoes. In one group, volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of 5 arms.
      Each of these arms will receive a different dose of MalaroneÂ®, a drug known to prevent
      malaria when taken daily. Each of these doses will be lower than the maximum approved dose of
      this medicine. The other group will not be treated with any drug that could prevent symptoms
      or infection.

      After exposure, both groups will be monitored for a period of approximately 3 months to see
      if they develop symptoms of malaria. Any subjects who do so will be treated with appropriate
      medications. Subjects in both groups will have their blood checked regularly during this
      period for the presence of malaria parasites. At the completion of the study, results will be
      analyzed to determine whether any of the doses of Malarone might effectively prevent malaria
      if taken weekly rather than daily.
