      practice. Sedation scales, such as the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS) 1, have been
      developed, but are imperfect in a general population and of limited use when muscle relaxants
      are administered. Instruments have been developed to examine cerebral electrical activity
      using processed EEG in an attempt to determine state of awareness.2 The Bispectral Index
      (BIS) is a statistically derived measure of cerebral electrical activity to assess
      cortical-subcortical interaction. The BIS was determined by repeated studies on patients
      anesthetized in the operating room (OR) with the assumption that sedation is associated with
      a lack of awareness and recall.2 The Patient State Analyzer (PSA 4000) is a 4-channel
      processed EEG reading using an advanced algorithm that interprets changes in regional brain
      activity providing a numerical assessment (ranging from 0-100; 0 = no central nervous system
      [CNS] activity, 100 = awake) to assess the degree of sedation. The PSA 4000 (PSA) is an
      advancement over the BIS monitor as the BIS is a single channel whereas the PSA is a
      4-channel monitor. Additionally, the PSA monitor has new proprietary software for analysis of
      the EEG data. The PSA is relatively new and thus there is little published data to evaluate
      its use in the operating room (OR) or the intensive care unit (ICU).
