    
      Patients with chronic heart failure are encouraged to self-manage their illness, such as
      adhering to medical regimens, monitoring symptoms and adhere to lifestyle recommendations
      from the health care provider to optimise health outcomes and quality of life.

      Consented study participants meeting the eligibility criteria for the STABILISE HF study will
      be using the the "SanaCoach heart failure" during a 6-month study period. SanaCoach heart
      failure is an application on the internet that supports patients and care providers in the
      development, implementation and monitoring of patient self-management. The SanaCoach heart
      failure provides information about heart failure, treatment, and lifestyle modifications. It
      can also monitor the patient's wellbeing, symptoms, vital signs, and gives advice on whether
      review with a health care provider is advisable. Furthermore, it provides a repository for
      patient's care plan to give insight into the course and treatment of the disorder.

      Recruitment and dropout statistics will be assessed and the sociodemographic and comorbidity
      profile of consenting study participants as well as consenting non-participants (Patients who
      decide not to participate will be given an option to complete an anonymous sociodemographic
      survey.) will be analysed.
