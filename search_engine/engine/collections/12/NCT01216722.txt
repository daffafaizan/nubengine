      disease. Current Usual care only involves progressive ambulation. Resistance exercise
      targeted at the lower extremities are anticipated to increase muscle strength in the muscles
      that extend the hip, extend the knee, and plantar flex the ankle more than seen with the
      usual care ambulation. The anticipated increases in strength should improve functional
      performance of activities such as standing from a chair, walking, and climbing stairs. The
      improvement in strength and functional performance should improve an individuals quality of
      life.
