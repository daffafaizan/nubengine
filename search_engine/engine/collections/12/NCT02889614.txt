    
      Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL, OMIM # 1707730) is a genetic disorder heterozygotic
      of LDL-C metabolism (Low Density Lipoprotein - Cholesterol) whose incidence is measured from
      1: 500 to 1: 1000. These heterozygous individuals may be asymptomatic or present some
      clinical (fatty liver, diabetes) or psychiatric manifestations still unrecognized. Moreover,
      these individuals have mostly a longevity syndrome and cardiovascular protection. The FHBL is
      often due to mutations of the APOB (APOlipoprotein B), major component of LDL, VLDL (Very Low
      Density Lipoprotein) and chylomicrons, and in some cases, loss-of-function mutations of the
      serine protease PCSK9, endogenous inhibitor of the LDL receptor.

      HYPOPSY research, aims to evaluate, in a population with psychiatric disorders, the
      prevalence of hypobetalipoproteinemia, and to characterize specific related psychiatric
      disorders.
