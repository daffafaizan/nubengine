      bypass surgery, can reduce the chance of a stroke in someone who has complete blockage in one
      main artery in the neck that supplies blood to the brain (the carotid artery). The operation
      bypasses the blockage so more blood can flow to the brain. Only people with decreased blood
      flow to the brain, as demonstrated on a PET (positron emission tomographic) scan, are
      randomized into the COSS study. Among patients randomized into the COSS study, RECON will
      evaluate whether restoring the blood flow to the brain (with EC-IC bypass surgery) will also
      improve mental functioning. Participants in both the surgical and medical groups of the COSS
      study will participate in the RECON study. By comparing the mental functioning of the
      participants in both treatment groups over the course of 2 years, the investigators hope to
      determine whether the EC-IC bypass operation also helps improve or maintain mental
      functioning.
