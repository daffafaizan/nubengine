    
      This is the first-time-in-human (FTIH) phase I/IIa study of GSK1223249, a humanised
      monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A, a neurite outgrowth inhibitor hypothesised to be involved
      in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and some other
      neurodegenerative disorders. This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, sequential dose escalation, 2-part fusion protocol. Approximately 76 patients
      with ALS will be enrolled. In Part 1, single escalating intravenous (i.v.) doses of
      GSK1223249 are planned to be evaluated in 5 sequential patient cohorts (2 placebo and 6
      active in each cohort) to determine single dose safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Part 2 will
      also be of a sequential dose escalating design, but patients in each of the planned 3 cohorts
      (3 placebo, 9 active in each cohort) will receive 2 repeat i.v. doses approximately 4 weeks
      apart where, safety and PK will also be evaluated. In two cohorts in Part 1 and all cohorts
      in Part 2, blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies will be taken from patients before and
      at the end of treatment to demonstrate whether or not GSK1223249 binds to its target and
      produces any measurable pharmacodynamic effect. Patients in both parts will receive their
      first dose in a hospital-based unit where they will be monitored for at least 24 hours
      post-dose before being discharged to be followed on an out-patient basis. In each cohort in
      part 1, the first four subjects will be dosed in a staggered manner such that only one will
      receive the dose in any 24 hours. Dosing of the first four subjects in the first cohort of
      part 2 will also be staggered in a similar manner.
