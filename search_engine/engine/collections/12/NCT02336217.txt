      device-app) in reducing the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia episodes in persons with
      diabetes. Other objectives include: to determine whether the GEM system leads to improved
      glucose control (as measured by HbA1c) during participation in the pilot, to determine
      whether the GEM can be used as a cost effective solution in reducing ER and urgent care
      visits, to determine the difference in ADDQOL scores between persons with a functioning GEM
      system and those with a placebo device. The Study hypothesis is as follows: There wil be
      significant differences in number of hypoglycemic events, ER and urgent care visits, A1C, as
      well as quality of life as measured by the ADDQOL scores between persons with diabetes who
      have the functioning GEM device in their smart phones and those that do not have such a
      device installed in their smart phones.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the utility of this application to help
      improve outcomes and reduce urgent care and ER visits as well as improve A1C and quality of
      life in persons with diabetes. This approach may be a paradigm shift in the rapidly
      detecting, monitoring, intervening and managing the acute diabetic complications of
      hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Spiraling health care costs are a
      major concern to the economy of the US. New measures have been introduced in the Affordable
      Care Act to improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system. There is more emphasis
      on preventive health care services. Our study is a step in that direction since it utilizes
      existing smart phone technology and converts it into a medical device which can be of
      invaluable help to the patient.
