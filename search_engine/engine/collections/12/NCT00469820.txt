        -  Determine time to relapse and overall survival of patients with high-risk acute myeloid
           leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or multiple myeloma treated with autologous
           tumor cell vaccine with or without donor lymphocyte infusion after HLA-matched related
           sibling nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of donor lymphocyte infusions in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of tumor cells for production of the cancer cell vaccine
      and then undergo HLA-matched related sibling nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). Patients then receive cancer cell vaccine with or without donor
      lymphocyte infusion. The donor lymphocytes are obtained from the same relative who donated
      stem cells for the HSCT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
