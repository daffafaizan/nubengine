      evaluate the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of
      severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in
      patients that have either failed or are intolerant to medical management. Once eligibility is
      confirmed, patients will undergo PAE with Embosphere Microspheres. Embolization will consist
      of a minimally invasive angiogram and treatment of the prostate arteries with the Embosphere
      particles to reduce blood flow to the prostate. Following treatment, patients will return for
      follow-up visits at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post PAE.
