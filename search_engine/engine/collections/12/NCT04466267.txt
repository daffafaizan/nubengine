      receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. Many large clinical trials demonstrated that for RAS wild-type
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), especially left-sided RAS wild-type mCRC, cetuximab can
      prolong OS. But some of patients have primary resistance to cetuximab and for all patients
      received cetuximab will develop secondary resistance. Cell-free or circulating tumour DNA
      (ctDNA) including primary site and metastatic site genetic information, which can avoid tumor
      heterogeneity. The results of paired test detection of tissue and ctDNA showed there is 93%
      consistency in RAS testing. Therefore, dynamic monitoring ctDNA during anti-EGFR targeted
      treatment of RAS wild-type mCRC patients can implement prognosis of efficacy and response
      evaluation in real-time. Besides, it can monitor the variation features of resistance gene
      and find resistance gene in real-time. According the situation of gene change to find
      potential drug resistance mechanism and formulate individualization treatment plan.
