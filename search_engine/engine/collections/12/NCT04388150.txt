      ectatic vessels in the antrum in instead of erosions in the antrum by White light endoscopy
      which can mislead the diagnosis to Portal hypertension gastropathy. Targeted biopsies are
      taken and examined histopathologically in order to see if matching with VIST view. In
      addition, CD61 is used to highlight the diagnosis for more confirmation. CD61 is an
      immunohistochemistry platelets marker.
