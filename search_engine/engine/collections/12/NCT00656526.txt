      included in the study. All the patients were followed for their heart rate, arterial pressure
      , respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end tidal CO2 and postoperative VAS scores.

      All the patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly 40 minutes prior
      to surgery. The induction was made 2 mg/kg propofol, 1 ug/kg remifentanyl, 0.5mg/kg
      rocuronium. After the orotracheal intubation anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane
      (%0.5-2.0) and 0.1 mg/kg rocuronium.Just before the exposure of dorsal root, 0.5 cc %2
      lidocaine was injected on the dorsal root.The patients postoperative analgesic period, VAS
      scores and additional analgesic need was recorded. For the postoperative analgesia tramadol 1
      mg/kg tramadol was used.
