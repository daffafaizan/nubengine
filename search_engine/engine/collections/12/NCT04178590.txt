      microorganisms satisfactorily over time. The aim of present study was to investigate whether
      there are differences between initial treatment of chronic periodontitis (SRP) and SRP in
      conjunction with injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) application.

      Thirty patients with chronic periodontitis who had at least two sites with perriodontal
      pocket depth (PPD) â‰¥ 4 mm on contralateral side will be involved in the study. Using a
      split-mouth design, patients will be treated with SRP + I-PRF -(test group) or SRP
      only-(control group). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival plaque will be
      collected with paper points (DentsplyMaillefer, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA) at baseline and 1, 3
      and 6 months after the treatment. The presence and concentrations of Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and
      Tannerella forsythia(Tf) will be analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
      Periodontal parameters, including bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD) and
      the clinical attachment level (CAL), will be recorded on both sides, as well as concentration
      of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha), ALP(alkaline phosphatase) and MMP-8
      (matrix-metalloproteinase-8).
