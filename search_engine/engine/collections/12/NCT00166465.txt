      single agents in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Their different mechanisms of action
      make the combination of ALIMTA with oxaliplatin attractive as potential first-line therapies
      in terms of improving response rates and overall survival in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Current reports of the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-FU as first-line
      therapies suggest that there may be advantages in combining oxaliplatin with other
      antifolates in the treatment of colorectal cancer. ALIMTA is an attractive candidate to
      replace other drugs such as 5-FU in the combinations with oxaliplatin in the treatment of
      locally advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer. ALIMTA has potential advantages over 5-FU
      when combined with oxaliplatin because it requires a single short injection and inhibits
      multiple targets in the folate pathway. Therefore, we propose to conduct a trial reporting
      the clinical effectiveness and side effects of ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin and one of the current
      standards of care, the FOLFOX 4 regimen (Oxaliplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin).
