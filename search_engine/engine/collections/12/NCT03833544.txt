      bringing the leg up and forward during walking and for a successful recovery from a slip or
      trip. Many previous studies have focused on strengthening the lower limb muscles that support
      the body in standing and walking (the so-called anti-gravity extensor muscles) but the
      training targeting the lower limb flexors has rarely been emphasized in stroke
      rehabilitation. Therefore, it is the intent of this exploratory study to find out whether an
      exercise training program focusing on lower limb flexors can improve lower limb motor
      function late after stroke.

      Ten participants with chronic stroke will be recruited. Their lower limb muscle function and
      walking performance will be assessed at baseline (2 to 3 times within the 2 weeks prior to
      starting the training), at the end of training, and 4 weeks later.

      Each subject will perform biking exercises under supervision, 2-3 times per week for 4 weeks
      (30 minutes each). The bike pedals are moving backward at a preset speed regardless of user
      effort. With feet strapped to the pedals, the participant will be asked to activate the hip,
      knee, and ankle flexors simultaneously when the pedal is moving up and then relax. Heart rate
      (HR) will be monitored continuously using a fingertip pulse monitor to ensure the maximum
      training HR is no more than 75% of the subject's HR Reserve.
