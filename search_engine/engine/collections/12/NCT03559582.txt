    
      Aim 1. Measure pharmacokinetics to anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications in severe TB syndromes
      (including multidrug-resistant TB, pediatric TB, TB sepsis and TB meningitis) from diverse
      geographies (including Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh, and Siberia) and correlate these
      findings to TB treatment outcome (TB treatment failure: death/ default/ relapse/ further
      acquired drug resistance).

      Aim 2. Decipher mechanisms of pharmacokinetic variability to TB drugs, particularly
      malabsorption due to concurrent gastrointestinal disease.

      Aim 3. Deployment of quantitative susceptibility testing (minimum inhibitory
      concentration-MIC) and rapid MIC-informed molecular methods (e.g., TaqMan Array Card-TAC) for
      M. tuberculosis.

      In addition to the stated aims, the primary elements of capacity building requisite for this
      project include the training in and deployment of the fieldable molecular diagnostic
      platforms, onsite pharmacokinetic monitoring, and a broad strengthening of longitudinal
      cohort management for clinical research.
