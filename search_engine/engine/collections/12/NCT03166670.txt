      results from increased chloride secretion, decreased sodium absorption, or increased mucosal
      permeability . Parasitic pathogens induce Secretory diarrhea as they infect and damage the
      absorptive villus tips, leaving Secretory crypts unbalanced, to cause net secretion and
      diarrhea. Parasitic causes include Cryptosporidium parvum or hominis ,Capillaria
      philippinensis and Giardia lamblia. Cryptosporidiosis is also recognized as a cause of
      prolonged and persistent diarrhea in children and persons with impaired immunity. The disease
      is transmitted via the fecal-oral route from infected hosts. It can be also transmitted
      following animal contact, ingestion of water (mainly during swimming), or through food.
      Cryptosporidium has emerged as the most frequently recognized cause of water-associated
      outbreaks of gastroenteritis. This is because of the oocyst stage in its life cycle;
      Cryptosporidium can resist disinfection, including chlorination, and can survive for a
      prolonged period in the environment.
