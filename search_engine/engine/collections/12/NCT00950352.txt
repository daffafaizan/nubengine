      systematically evaluate the therapeutic effects of citicoline, which may both increase
      dopamine and normalize cognitive and structural deficits in the brains of methamphetamine
      dependent subjects. Methamphetamine dependent subjects will undergo baseline and repeat
      cognitive assessments after 8-9 weeks of placebo or oral citicoline as a nutritional
      supplement. We will also evaluate the chemical and structural changes in brain regions
      identified by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tension imaging (DTI) and
      cortical thickness, which in turn are expected to recover after 8-9 weeks of citicoline
      treatment. Specific brain regions of interest include the prefrontal cortices, temporal
      cortex, and the caudate/putamen all of which are known to be involved in the pathophysiology
      of methamphetamine dependence.
