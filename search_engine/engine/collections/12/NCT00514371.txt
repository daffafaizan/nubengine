    
      Phase 2/3 combination study comparing bortezomib plus one of three doses of tanespimycin in
      patients with relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma after failure of at least three prior
      anti-cancer therapy regimens. Prior therapy must include bortezomib and lenalidomide. Primary
      objective is to assess the dose-response relationship of objective response rate (ORR) using
      EBMT/IBMTR criteria of any three dose levels of tanespimycin (KOS-953) in combination with
      bortezomib after four treatment cycles.
