    
      This trial is a phase II/III, randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial to
      determine the efficacy of dietary flaxseed as a therapeutic strategy to reduce blood pressure
      in newly diagnosed hypertensive individuals. The aim of the trial is to recruit 100
      participants that have been clinically diagnosed with hypertension within 6 months and yet to
      receive any anti-hypertensive medication. The control and flax groups will be provided food
      products to consume on a daily basis for 6 months. Assessment parameters such as averaged
      automated blood pressure, anthropometrics, 24-food recall, physical activity questionnaire,
      and blood and urine analysis will be conducted at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months.
