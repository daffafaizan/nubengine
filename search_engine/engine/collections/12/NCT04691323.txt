      Americans, and about 1 in 400 African American live births, incurring annual health care
      costs of $335 million. SCD can lead to serious complications including unpredictable,
      debilitating pain episodes, cardiopulmonary disease, stroke, and long-term end organ
      damage.These complications lead to significant declines in health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), culminating in early mortality,
      particularly among AYA. Hydroxyurea, at present, is the main FDA approved medication for SCD
      that reduces morbidity and mortality, improves HRQoL and lowers healthcare
      utilization.However, adherence to HU remains suboptimal with only 35-50% of patients
      achieving high adherence (â‰¥90%), particularly among AYA with SCD. Low HU adherence has been
      associated with worse health outcomes, poor HRQOL and increased healthcare utilization. Low
      HU adherence is multifactorial, especially in AYA with other competing priorities and
      vulnerability in developmental and psychological factors contributing to adherence behavior.
      The specific aim for this study is to determine the longitudinal relationship of HU adherence
      behavior to health-related quality of life, barriers to adherence and habit formation among
      AYA with SCD.
