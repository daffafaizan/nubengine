    
      Patients will be allocated to two groups with either

        1. Guided implantation of the left ventricular lead

        2. Empirical implantation of the left ventricular lead (current clinical standard)

      For Treatment Group a) the target vessel, which is the vessel with smallest distance between
      RLC and CVS is determined in advance and provided to the implanting physician. In case, this
      vessel is not amenable for lead positioning, a second vessel which is the second closest to
      the RLC is defined.

      For Treatment Group b), the physician has to choose the vessel where to place the electrode
      without knowing the exact spatial orientation between that particular side-branch and the
      RLC.

      In all patients, standard biventricular devices and leads are to be used. Aspects that are
      evaluated are:

        1. Technical success in placing the electrode in the target vessel.

        2. Failure due to dislocation during the implantation procedure or phrenic nerve
           stimulation.

      Also, procedure duration, radiation exposure, and complications occurring during the
      procedure as well as post- operatively will be documented.
