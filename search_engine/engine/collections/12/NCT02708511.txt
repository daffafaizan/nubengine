      I. To determine the dosimetry of 64Cu-DOTA B-Fab (copper Cu 64-DOTA-B-Fab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of 64Cu-DOTA B-Fab single administration.

      II. To evaluate the ability of 64Cu-DOTA B-Fab to detect CA6-positive ovarian and breast
      cancer lesions.

      III. To compare PET results with the immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of the excised tumor
      samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64-DOTA-B-Fab intravenously (IV) followed by PET/CT 60 minutes
      post-injection and 24 hours post-injection

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 12 months.
