    
      The present study is an open, single-center, prospective, single-arm phase II study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of nilapalil combined with anrotidine in the treatment of
      platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In this study, 40 histopathologically diagnosed
      patients with high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer were
      treated with neelapalil plus anrotinib in patients who underwent first-line chemotherapy or
      above and had a recurrence of platinum-resistant chemotherapy (the time of tumor progression
      of the last platinum-containing chemotherapy < 6 months). The study will be divided into two
      phases. The first phase will include six patients on a 21-day cycle (nierapalil 200mg QD*21;
      Anrotidine 12mg qd d1-14, d15-21 suspension), all subsequent patients were enrolled if no
      more than dose-restricted toxic event occurred within a cycle, and the combination treatment
      was continued until the disease progressed or the toxicity was intolerable.
