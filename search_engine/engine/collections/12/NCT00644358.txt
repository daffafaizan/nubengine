      for 52 weeks of open label treatment. Safety measurements will include adverse events, vital
      signs, laboratory, ophthalmologic exams, Changes in Sexual Function Questionnaire (CSFQ)
      scale and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings collected over the course of the treatment period.
      Effectiveness measurements will be done at baseline and each visit until week 52 or
      end-of-treatment. A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be collected for genetic analysis
      related to response to vilazodone.
