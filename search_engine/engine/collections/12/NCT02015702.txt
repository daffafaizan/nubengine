      educational interventions in an intervention arm compared with usual training and support in
      the control arm. Improvement in performance, defined as the time between opening and closing
      a progress note, and number of notes completed after shift , were the primary outcomes.
      Physician satisfaction was a secondary outcome. Participants from one 550-bed Academic
      Independent Medical Center were invited to participate if they were full-time hospitalists or
      residents in internal medicine with no prior experience with the EPIC electronic health
      record.
