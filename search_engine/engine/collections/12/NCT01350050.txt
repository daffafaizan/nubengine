      endoscopy. TPA improves patient tolerance and the ease of endoscopy.1 Methemoglobinemia and
      anaphylactic reactions are serious complications of such topical anaesthetic agents, as
      lidocaine, tetracaine, and benzocaine. Articaine is as a unique amide local anaesthetic that
      possesses both an amide and an ester linkage and this is of clinical significance in
      minimizing the risk of overdose (toxic reaction). In routine dental procedures, articaine is
      a superior anaesthetic to lidocaine. Also, in comparison to lidocaine articaine acts faster
      and its duration of action is shorter what may be an advantage in such relatively fast
      procedures as gastroscopy. Articaine have not been previously evaluated in pharyngeal
      anesthesia for upper endoscopy. The aim of this randomised double-blind placebo controlled
      study was to compare pharyngeal anesthesia with 4% articaine to placebo (Na0,9%) during
      gastroscopy in terms of benefit on patients' and endoscopists'satisfaction.
