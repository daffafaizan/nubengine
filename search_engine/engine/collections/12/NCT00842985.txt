      Since many treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, strongly utilize episodic
      memory, marijuana use during treatment may lead to diminished treatment outcomes. In
      addition, lessened response inhibition may lead to elevated rates of drug relapse while in
      treatment. Consequently, a treatment which will improve episodic memory and response
      inhibition may lead to improved treatment outcomes in marijuana users. One such treatment is
      modafinil.This study will be a 4 session within-subjects, double-blind, crossover study
      evaluating the impact of modafinil (400 mg/day) on the cognitive, subjective, and
      physiological effects of marijuana. Across 4 sessions, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive either oral placebo, modafinil (400mg), dronabinol (15mg), or dronabinol and
      modafinil. Outcome measures will include physiological, cognitive, and subjective drug
      effects.

      Currently this study complete and has been published.
