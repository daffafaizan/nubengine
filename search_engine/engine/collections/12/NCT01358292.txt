      the patients still complain of anterior knee pain postoperative. The expected advantages of
      the semi-extended nailing technique is less anterior knee pain and less malunion of the
      fracture.

      Using the semi-extended nailing technique also might give the advantage of better position of
      the nail by a more concentric reaming of the tibia, due to less tension on the patella tendon
      during reaming process.
