    
      This is a multi-center randomised controlled study of catheter ablation compared with totally
      thoracoscopic surgical ablation.

      The study population will be patients above the age of 18 with symptomatic long-standing
      persistent atrial fibrillation (≥1≤5 years) and good left ventricular function where at least
      one anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) has failed, or where such drugs are contraindicated or not
      tolerated.

      Subjects randomised to thoracoscopic Surgical Ablation will undergo minimally invasive,
      thoracoscopically assisted, surgical ablation to isolate the pulmonary veins (PVI) using a
      radiofrequency (RF) clamp device. Posterior wall will be isolated in a box fashion with cool
      rail bipolar RF device. This will include ganglionated plexi ablation +/- LAA
      excision/exclusion.

      Catheter Ablation Group Patients will undergo pulmonary vein isolation and linear ablations
      in the left and right atrium.

      There will be a 3 month blanking period and symptomatic atrial arrhythmia may have catheter
      ablation during the period of 12 month follow up. The primary end point of the study will be
      assessed by continuous cardiac recording through an internal loop recorder that will be
      inserted at the end of the index procedure. The analysis and reporting of the recordings will
      be performed by a blinded core lab.
