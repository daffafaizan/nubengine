    
      3-dimensional shoulder kinematics (e.g., scapular angular position/displacement) at key
      events of each test will be described and compared across sides and groups. For the
      unilateral seated shot put test, the events are based on humeral motion: a) initiation of
      humeral motion, b) maximal humeral flexion, c) end of humeral motion. For the upper quarter Y
      balance test the events are the a) initiation of free hand motion on "GO", b) maximal reach
      on the medial direction, c) maximal reach on superolateral direction, and d) maximal reach on
      the inferolateral direction (kinematics measured on the stance upper extremity). The best of
      3 maximal-effort trials on each side will be used for analysis. Warm-up exercises and two
      submaximal practice trials will be performed for preparation for maximal efforts and
      familiarization with the tests. A rest period of at least one minute between trials will be
      given to guarantee good physiological conditions to maximally perform. Further resting time
      will be allowed, if necessary, upon request of the participant.
