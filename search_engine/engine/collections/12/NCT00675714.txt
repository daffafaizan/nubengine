      children by instituting and evaluating two modifications to traditional rehabilitation: (1)
      an intensive rehabilitation program including active resistance exercise; (2) long term
      administration of anabolic agents.

      Effectiveness is assessed by comparison with functional outcomes achieved in traditional
      outpatient rehabilitation programs. Results indicate improvement in strength, endurance and
      bone density with these modifications. The project also maintains a longitudinal database
      that includes measures of cardiopulmonary function, growth and maturation, bone density,
      range of motion, and psychosocial adjustment.
