      survivors will receive general information on how to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. The
      other group of breast cancer survivors will receive counseling on how to increase their level
      of physical activity.

      Participants will have three consultations with a health counselor. The first two
      consultations will take place in-person and the third consultation will take place via
      telephone. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires assessing their
      physical and mental well-being, their dietary habits, and their physical activity habits at
      four time-points: in-person during their first study visit, via mail or through an online
      survey 6 weeks later, in-person 12 weeks later, and via mail or through an online survey 24
      weeks later. Additionally, during their first study visit and 12 weeks later, their level of
      aerobic fitness will be tested by having participants walk a long hallway for six minutes.
