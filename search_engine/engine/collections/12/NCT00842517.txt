      for drug abuse and dependence on long-term abstinence outcomes. Following the tenets of basic
      behavioral research, we have outlined a model for long-term behavior maintenance that
      suggests that successful long-term behavior change does not focus on undoing old behaviors,
      but concentrates on developing new behaviors in a wide variety of new contexts, and provides
      enduring reinforcement for the new behaviors. The implication of this model is that in order
      to develop strategies for supporting long-term behavior change we need to determine the
      optimal duration of continuing treatment-arranged contingencies, better specify incompatible
      behaviors that emerge for patients who are successful in sustaining periods of continuous
      drug abstinence, and determine which incompatible behaviors are most likely to have
      naturally-occurring sustaining contingencies of reinforcement. This research will examine the
      model by randomly assigning cocaine-dependent or cocaine-abusing methadone maintenance
      patients to either a Standard (12 week) or Extended (36 week) period of contrived
      contingencies. We will be conducting a 2 year follow-up in order to investigate whether
      providing a longer duration of CM will result in a greater proportion of abstinent
      individuals during this time, how long the abstinence will last and to discover if longer
      durations of drug abstinence during the first year after treatment entry will predict better
      longer-term abstinence outcomes. We also compare outcomes on abstinence-related behaviors to
      see if provision of an extended voucher program leads to an increase in non-drug using
      natural reinforcers and activities. This study participates in the NIH-sponsored Health
      Maintenance Consortium designed to promote interchange of concepts, methods and measures
      related to the maintenance of long-term behavior change.
