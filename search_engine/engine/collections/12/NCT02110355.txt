    
      The study will be conducted in 3 parts: Part 1 - Dose Escalation, Part 2 - Dose Expansion and
      Part 3, a randomized Phase 2a.

      In both part 1 and 2, subjects will be enrolled open-label into 1 of 2 arms. For both Arm 1
      and Arm 2, the part 1 dose escalation is aimed at determining an AMG 232 maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) with a fixed dose of the combination drug(s) and evaluating safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of each combination. Part 2 dose expansion will enroll
      subjects to receive therapy with a dose and schedule of AMG 232 selected from the
      corresponding part 1 dose escalation. In part 2 subjects will be enrolled to confirm safety
      and tolerability and to assess clinical activity prior to proceeding to Part 3, Phase 2a. In
      Phase 2a, Subjects will be randomized open-label in a 1:1 ratio to receive AMG 232 in
      combination with trametinib plus dabrafenib versus trametinib plus dabrafenib alone.

      Only Part 1 of the study was enrolled and the study did not proceed into Phase 2.
