      predominantly in the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems. Clinical detection and diagnosis
      are more reliable at late stages when metastatic spread has occurred. Patients with advanced
      disease may suffer from complications of uncontrolled hormone secretion and usually succumb
      due to tumor progression.

      This trial tests the hypothesis that inhibition of serotonin production with Telotristat will
      lead to cytostatic effects on neuroendocrine tumors and will complement the anti-tumor
      activity of Lutetium 177 Dotatate. The proposed combination may result in improved treatment
      efficacy as reflected by improved 20-month progression-free survival (PFS) as compared to
      historical control.
