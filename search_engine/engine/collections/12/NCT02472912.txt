    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, 3-way parallel study in 270 healthy adult
      male and female subjects. During this study, the PK bioequivalence of BMO-2, containing 40 mg
      adalimumab, will be compared to EU licensed Humira® (EU-Humira® ) (40 mg) and US licensed
      Humira® (US-Humira® ) (40 mg).

      Randomization will be stratified by body weight (weight categories of 60.0-79.9 kg and
      80.0-95.0 kg). After randomization, subjects will receive one of the following treatments: a
      single sc injection of 40 mg BMO-2, an equivalent sc injection of EU-Humira® (40 mg), or an
      equivalent sc injection of US-Humira® (40 mg).

      Volunteers participation in the study is expected to finish with the follow-up visit,
      scheduled 70 days after the injection of study drug.
