      2019. Participants will be randomly allocated into either the intervention (N = 77) or
      control group (N = 77). The control group will receive standard usual care, while the
      intervention group will receive standard usual care plus a self-management program delivered
      by renal nurse educators. The intervention will be guided by social cognitive theory and
      include group-based educational sessions, CKD booklet and follow-up phone calls. Both groups
      will be followed for 12 weeks. Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 25. The primary
      outcomes are improving in knowledge and self-management, while the secondary outcomes are
      improving in self-confidence, quality of life and clinical outcomes of the participants.
