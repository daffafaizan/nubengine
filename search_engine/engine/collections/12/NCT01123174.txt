      attempt (SA). After checking of the criteria, information and signature of the study consent,
      the subjects will be randomized in one of the 2 groups (ALGOS versus Control). A fax of
      inclusion will be sent to the centralized research team of the Clinical Investigation Center
      (CIC) of Lille. All the subjects included will be then evaluated at the 6th month and 13th
      month after the SA, during a phone call. The final evaluation will be carried out in the
      current of the 13th month, so as to avoid a recontact at the time of the period birthday, too
      charged affectively at the majority with the patients. This phone call, personal, will be
      carried out by an trained psychologist. A mail preventing the subject of the call will be
      addressed approximately 10 days before. During the evaluations at the 6th month and 13th
      month, the number of suicidal repetitions will be reported, consumption of care since
      inclusion will be noted, the scale of suicidal ideation of Beck assessed, and a
      psychopathological evaluation carried out (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview DSM
      IV).
