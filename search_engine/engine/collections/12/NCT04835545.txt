      and development of breathing parameters of a person breathing in the simulated avalanche
      snow. The Investigator is measuring Work of Breathing in three scenarios: a) 2L air pocket,
      b) 2L air pocket with resistance compensation and c) no air pocket. The investigator
      hypothesize that the Work of Breathing during compensation of air pocket will be alike with
      no air pocket scenario, thus proving significance of the resistance reduction for survival.
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Work of Breathing on gas exchange in
      subjects breathing into the simulated avalanche snow scenarios.
