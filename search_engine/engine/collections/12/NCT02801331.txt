      for reducing withdrawal symptoms, pharmacological requirement and hospitalization, and for
      improving neurobehavioral developmental outcomes in opioid-exposed newborns.

      Candidates at-risk for NAS due opioid exposure in utero will be identified to investigators
      by medical caregiver and/or prescreened using HIPAA Waiver for recruitment
      (maternal-prenatal; infant-postnatal). Infants will be randomized into either SVS
      (complementary to standard of care) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), restricted by equipment
      (mattress) availability. Infants will be enrolled and assigned to a condition within 48 hours
      post birth and participate throughout hospitalization. Infants assigned SVS will receive
      daily intervention of continuous intervals of SVS throughout hospitalization using a
      specially constructed crib mattress that delivers gentle vibrations at preset intervals.

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the efficacy of SVS as a non-pharmacological therapy complementary
      to standard of care for reducing severity and duration of opioid withdrawal in newborns
      compared to TAU alone. Quantify clinical variables: NAS severity, treatment days, days in
      hospital, velocity of weight gain, cumulative morphine dose.

      Specific Aim 2. Compare neurobehavioral outcomes in fetal drug-exposed infants between
      infants who received SVS and those who received TAU. Longitudinal outcomes assessment at
      6-months and 1 year to test whether early intervention with SVS compared to standard care
      improves physical, social, emotional and cognitive development.
