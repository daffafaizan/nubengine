      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gefitinib and capecitabine in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine the pharmacologic profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gefitinib and capecitabine.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-14 and oral capecitabine twice daily on
      days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib and
      capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
