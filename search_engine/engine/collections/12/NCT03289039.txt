      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Neratinib as a treatment for
      breast cancer. Fulvestrant has been FDA approved for treatment of metastatic hormone receptor
      positive breast cancer.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well neratinib, by itself or together
      with Fulvestrant, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
      Neratinib is a recently discovered oral drug that may stop breast cancer cells from growing
      abnormally by inhibiting (or blocking) members of a family of proteins that include Human
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).

      Neratinib has been used in other research studies and information from those other research
      studies suggests that neratinib may help to shrink or stabilize HER2-positive breast cancer
      in this research study.
