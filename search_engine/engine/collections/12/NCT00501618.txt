    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the equivalence of generic clozapine
      tablets to FazaClo in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are already
      taking generic clozapine and are switched to FazaClo.

      In this study, patients receiving a stable twice-daily dose of generic clozapine formulation
      for the past one month will be switched to FazaClo. A trough steady-state clozapine and
      desmethylclozapine concentrations will be taken thrice while patient is on generic Clozapine.
      After the third clozapine level patients will be switched from their generic clozapine
      formulation to FazaClo, at the same dosage and treatment regimen as the generic clozapine
      formulation they had been receiving. Trough steady-state clozapine and desmethylclozapine
      concentration levels will be taken twice, 7 days and 14 days after starting Fazaclo.
