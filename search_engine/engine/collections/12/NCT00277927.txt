    
      Young children (less than or equal to 2 years of age) with mild valvar pulmonary stenosis are
      unlikely to develop worsening stenosis with age and periodic cardiac evaluation is not
      warranted.

      To describe the clinical course of children with mild valvar pulmonary stenosis diagnosed in
      early childhood. To examine the clinical practice patterns of cardiologists caring for these
      patients.

      Retrospective chart review of all children diagnosed with mild valvar pulmonary stenosis born
      between 1984 and 2003 and followed by Sibley Heart Center Cardiology. Patient variables will
      include: pulmonary valve gradient, need for catheterization, exercise intolerance and
      endocarditis. Practice variables will include: frequency of follow-up, number of
      echocardiographic studies, exercise limitations.
