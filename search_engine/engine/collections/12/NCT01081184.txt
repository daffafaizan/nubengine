      added to a standard biological analysis done for pSS follow- up.

      Salivary sicca syndrome will be evaluated with un-stimulated salivary flow rate. Saliva fluid
      will be collected from NTs levels determination (ELISA). Ocular sicca syndrome will be
      evaluated by Schirmer tests and Lissaline green test. A conjunctival cytological impression
      will be done in order to determine NTs conjunctival production by flow cytometry.
