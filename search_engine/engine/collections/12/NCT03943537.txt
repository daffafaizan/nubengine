      understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders, more effective and tolerable treatments
      are still needed. Evidence suggests that energy metabolism is altered in psychotic disorders.
      The investigators recently developed non-invasive MRI-based techniques to quantify redox
      balance and ATP generation in the brain. Targeting insulin pathways in the brain may allow
      for modulating abnormalities in energy metabolism. The investigators seek to examine whether
      intranasal insulin can modulate energy metabolism and improve cognition in patients with
      psychotic disorders. The study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology to
      measure in vivo energy metabolism processes in the brain, before and after the administration
      of intranasal insulin. Investigators will also measure changes in cognition with the
      administration of intranasal insulin.
