      are regarded as one of the risk factors for the development of breast cancer in women aged 40
      to 52 years, which necessitates closer monitoring of the mammary gland. However, this risk
      factor can be considered as modifiable. The drug Cyclodynone® (contains 4 mg of special
      extract of dried fruits of Chaste Berry (Vitex agnus-castus)) has a dopaminergic effect on
      the hypothalamus, which causes its inhibitory effect on the secretion of prolactin. At
      present, a significant positive clinical and scientific experience has been accumulated in
      the use of the Cyclodynone® for the treatment of benign breast dysplasias against a
      background of mild hyperprolactinaemia in women of reproductive age. However, the experience
      of using Cyclodynone® in women older than 40-52 years with increased density or dyshormonal
      pathology of breast cancer is limited. Demonstration of the positive effect of this drug on
      the reduction of hyperprolactinemia, mammographic density of MF, evaluation on the scale
      BI-RADS would justify its application for the modification of this risk factor in women aged
      40 to 52 years.
