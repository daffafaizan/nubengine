    
      Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is associated with increased macrovascular diseases and
      impaired endothelial function. There is no clear data about the effects of hypercortisolism
      on microcirculation.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the peripheric microvascular area in patients
      with Cushing's syndrome. The association of microvascular changes with present comorbidities
      (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and disease activation will be evaluated.

      Method:

      Cushing syndrome patients admitted to our clinic will be included in this study for the next
      six months after given informed consent.

      The following clinical laboratory parameters will be evaluated as cross-sectionally.

      Previous medical history, available laboratory parameters (fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c,
      total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, creatine, AST, ALT, complete blood count, ACTH,
      dexamethasone suppression tests (1 mg- 2mg), urine free cortisol, FSH, LH, total
      testosterone, estradiol, IGF-1, TSH, free T3, free T4, prolactin), radiologic images (Cranial
      MRI and Adrenal MRI) will be recorded from medical charts.

      Nailfold microcirculation will be evaluated with video-capillaroscopy: it is a non-invasive
      atraumatic assessment of the morphology and some functional aspects of cutaneous capillaries.
