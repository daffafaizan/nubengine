      metastatic urothelial carcinoma have been performed. Overall, the most active of these agents
      have shown response rates of approximately 10-20% . Currently, there are no FDA approved
      agents for the second-line treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

      The current study will explore the safety and activity of the novel anthracycline, amrubicin,
      as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

      The primary objective will be to evaluate the activity (as determined by objective response
      rate) of amrubicin as second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic urothelial
      carcinoma. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate progression-free survival, survival
      at 1 year, and the safety of amrubicin as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic
      urothelial carcinoma.

      Subjects will receive amrubicin IV daily x 3 days, every 21-days, with prophylactic
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor. This 21-day time period is referred to as a cycle.
      Subjects will undergo repeat computed tomography (CT) scans after every 2 cycles. In the
      absence of progressive cancer, or prohibitive side effects, subjects will receive up to 6
      cycles of treatment with amrubicin.
