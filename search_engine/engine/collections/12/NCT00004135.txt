        -  Evaluate the safety of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or
           melanoma.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of all adverse events related to this treatment
           regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in terms of tumor regression, response
           duration, progression free survival, and overall survival in these patients.

        -  Measure the resulting chimerism and immune reconstitution in these patients after this
           treatment regimen and correlate with clinical response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 through -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2. Immediately following each daily donor
      leukapheresis, patients receive allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) IV over 15
      minutes beginning on day 0 and continuing until the target cells are collected. Patients
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      If no graft versus host disease has developed within 4 weeks of allogeneic PBSC
      transplantation, patients with disease progression or recurrence who have residual donor
      hematopoiesis on chimerism analysis may receive donor T lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes.
      Patients may receive an additional course of donor T lymphocytes at the investigator's
      discretion.

      Patients are followed at days 30 and 100, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
