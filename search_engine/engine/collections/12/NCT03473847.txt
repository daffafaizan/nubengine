      measure the thickness of the cornea (the window at the front of the eye) and the layers
      within the cornea, such as the epithelium (the layer of skin on the surface of the cornea). A
      commercially available instrument, known as the Artemis, has been used in routine clinical
      practice since 2001. The ArcScan Insight 100 VHF digital ultrasound scanner is an updated
      version, which obtained CE mark in 2016.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is another method of measuring the thickness of the cornea
      and the corneal epithelium. OCT has been used for measuring corneal thickness since 1997 and
      the technology had evolved to also measure epithelial thickness since 2012. There are
      currently three OCT scanners capable of measuring epithelial thickness; Carl Zeiss Meditec
      Cirrus HD OCT 5000, Optovue RTVue OCT, CSO MS-39 OCT.

      The aim of the study is to establish the repeatability (i.e. the variability in measurements
      taken by a single examiner during a single visit) and reproducibility (i.e. the variability
      in measurements taken in the same conditions between two examiners) for each of the four
      devices for measuring corneal thickness and epithelial thickness.
