      is superior to comprehensive best medical therapy or whether some patients or symptoms
      respond better to DBS in one area of the brain or the other is currently not known. The goals
      of this project are to compare the effectiveness of DBS and comprehensive medical therapy as
      treatments for PD, and to compare bilateral DBS at 2 areas of the brain--the subthalamic
      nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus (Gpi)--to determine the most effective brain site for
      surgical intervention In this prospective, randomized, multi-center trial, 316 patients will
      be enrolled at 13 centers over four and a half years. Patients will initially be randomized
      to immediate surgery (DBS) or to 6 months of "best medical therapy." BMT patients will then
      proceed into the surgical phase of the trial. The DBS site (STN or GPi) will be assigned on a
      random basis at the time the patient enters the surgical phase of the trial. Patients will be
      followed for two years post surgery (24-30 months). Effective 08/05/05, randomization to the
      BMT arm has been discontinued since the study has sufficient information to compare the
      outcomes of DBS and BMT patients at 6 months. The findings will be critically important in
      establishing the optimal surgical treatment of the disabling symptoms of PD.
