      this trial aims to investigate the effects in terms of a reduction of the unspecific
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to Methacholine challenge test on subjects with mild
      bronchial asthma. In addition, measurements of exhaled nitric oxide level as an indicator of
      bronchial inflammation will be investigated.

      This study will focus primarily on safety and dose finding in 12 to 18 subjects with mild
      bronchial asthma.

      After a screening visit, subjects will be treated with placebo, followed by increasing doses
      of Ectoin® (low, medium and high dose). All doses of Ectoin® inhalation solution and placebo
      will be administered for 5 - 7 days.
