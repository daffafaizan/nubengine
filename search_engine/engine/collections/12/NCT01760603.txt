    
      Pelvic Organ prolapse (a feeling of bulge in the vagina) may cause some distressing symptoms
      such as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with patient's
      sex life. An ideal procedure for vaginal apical support should provide a durable suspension,
      have minimal complications, and not affect sexual or visceral function.

      Ischia spinous fascia fixation procedure is developed in China. It is a transvaginal
      procedure used for restoring the vaginal apex support with native tissue. Clinical practice
      showed that it was safe, efficient and cost-effective. Recurrent rate after 1 year follow-up
      was about 10%, and quality of life improved significantly from the baseline.

      The purpose of this multicenter, prospective study is to evaluate the effectiveness and
      safety of this procedure in the treatment of symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse.
