    
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, non-controlled study in healthy post-menarchal female
      participants who will be enrolled to receive once daily E4/DRSP 15/3 mg for six (6) 28-day
      cycles in a 24/4-day regimen (i.e. 24 days of active tablets followed by 4 days of placebo
      tablets [4-day hormone-free interval]). The study will include 6 visits:

      At screening visit (Visit 1), informed consent will be signed by the participants and their
      parent(s) or legal representative(s) and the screening procedures will be performed. The site
      will also complete an Eligibility confirmation phone call to the participant after Visit 1.
      During the enrollment visit (Visit 2, between Days 12 and 19 of the pre-treatment cycle),
      eligibility criteria will be reviewed and the participant participation will be confirmed.
      Participants will be trained in the use of an electronic diary and will receive the study
      drug. A follow-up call will be performed after Visit 2, within 7 days following the first
      investigational product intake. Afterwards, the participants will attend 3 on-treatment
      visits at the clinical site [between Days 14 and 21 of the Cycle 1(Visit 3), Cycle 3 (Visit
      4), and Cycle 6 (Visit 5)] and one visit after end of Cycle 6 (Visit 6).

      For participants who consent to participate in a pharmacokinetics sub-study, blood samples
      for this sub-study will be taken at Visit 3 and Visit 5.

      Adverse events will be followed throughout the study.
