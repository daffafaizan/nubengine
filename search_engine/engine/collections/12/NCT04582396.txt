      electrical disturbances across cardiac tissue, leading to marked arrhythmia that ultimately
      results in the heart ceasing to pump blood to the brain, lungs, and other organs. Due to
      advances in bundled post-arrest care, cardio-cerebral resuscitation, and effective cooling
      protocols, a substantial proportion of patients who receive guideline-based care (nearly 1 in
      3 for out-of-hospital and ~50% for in-hospital CA) now survive this once universally fatal
      condition. While most survivors retain their cognitive function and physical independence,
      many grapple with CA's psychological consequences in the context of learning that they were
      "clinically dead."

      In particular, many describe the CA experience as traumatic, and up to 1 in 3 CA survivors
      subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Not only is PTSD common in CA
      patients, but there is evidence that PTSD after CA may influence health behaviors and
      prognosis.

      Treatment of early PTSD and cardiac anxiety symptoms after CA requires timely intervention.
      Recent studies show that SGB is a safe and acceptable intervention for reducing PTSD symptoms
      in combat veterans. SGB treatment has never been tested to treat PTSD induced by acute
      medical events such as CA.
