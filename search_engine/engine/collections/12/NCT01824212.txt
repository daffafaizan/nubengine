      an already implanted ICD which function needs to be revised will be recruited into this
      study. Our hypothesis is that the ECG and VF is recordable in 100% of cases with a
      semi-automatic defibrillator. In sample size calculations we compared this 100% recognition
      to the present situation with 80% recognition of cardiac arrest in emergency medical
      communication centre during emergency call. According to the power calculation of 1-sided
      binomial test with risk level 0.05 and power of 95 %, 22 observations is needed to detect
      difference between expected full successes (99 %) from the previous 80 % of successes in
      recognition.
