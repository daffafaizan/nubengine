      suicide death, and more lethal attempts during the perimenstrual (around menses) window of
      the female reproductive cycle; however, no experiments have investigated the causal role of
      ovarian steroid changes across the natural perimenstrual period in risk factors for acute
      suicidality. In response, the proposed experimental work investigates a causal role of
      perimenstrual withdrawal from the hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in
      previously-documented acute perimenstrual increases in suicidality.

      Participants are 30 women between the ages of 18 and 45 with current suicidal ideation but
      minimal risk for suicide attempt. Using a placebo-controlled, crossover within-person design,
      the experiment tests the hypothesis that suicidality will be heightened during natural
      perimenstrual E2/P4 withdrawal (under placebo), but that experimental prevention of this
      perimenstrual E2/P4 withdrawal (with exogenous administration of E2/P4 hormones) will prevent
      these perimenstrual increases in suicidality and associated risk factors.
