      with the reduction of sputum volume in bronchiectasis patients. However, macrolide therapy
      could not yet be confidently used to treat bronchiectasis, given the diffuse nature of these
      findings. These studies have had a wide range of hypotheses, and have not necessarily focused
      on the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides. Furthermore, these studies are few in number,
      and not all have been placebo-controlled or double-blinded. This, combined with the small
      sample sizes used, limits the reliability of these results. This study aims to expand on
      these limited published findings by investigating a larger sample population with different
      endpoints. Sputum volume and quality of life have been selected as important variables to aid
      in assessing efficacy.

      This study aims to be independent of previous studies in a number of ways. This is the only
      study of bronchiectasis patients to formally investigate quality of life after treatment with
      a macrolide, and the potential carryover effect of azithromycin therapy. This study will also
      expand on the findings of previous studies of macrolides in bronchiectasis by incorporating a
      larger sample size into the trial.
