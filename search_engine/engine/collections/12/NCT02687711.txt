      sites in approximately 10 European countries. Patients will be treated according to usual
      medical diagnostic procedures and therapy; commercially available brivaracetam will be
      prescribed according to normal clinical practice and the current Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SmPC) in Europe for brivaracetam (BRV). The prescription of BRV is clearly
      separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or
      monitoring procedures are applied to the patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine BRV retention over a 12 month period as a
      measure of effectiveness in a real world setting. The secondary objective of this study is to
      assess seizure control with BRV treatment.
