      ventricular arrhythmias who are scheduled to undergo a catheter ablation procedure. The study
      will last up to 30 minutes in the cardiac electrophysiology lab. Cervical VNS is performed
      percutaneously through the internal jugular vein during the patient's routine ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) ablation procedure.
