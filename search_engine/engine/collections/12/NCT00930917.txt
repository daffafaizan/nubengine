      (immediately after cap and wrap removal) and again 1 hour later. Axillary temperature was
      measured using a digital thermometer (Terumo Digital Clinical Thermometer C202, Terumo
      Corporation, Tokio, Japan). The occurrence of hypothermia, defined as axillary temperature
      less then 36.4Â°C, on NICU admission was also evaluated.

      Secondary outcomes included mortality prior to hospital discharge, presence of major brain
      injury (sonographic evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation,
      parenchymal hemorrhagic infarction, or periventricular leukomalacia), tracheal intubation at
      birth, Apgar scores, delivery to admission time, blood gas analysis and serum glucose
      concentration on NICU admission.
