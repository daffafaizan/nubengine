      pre-HSCT. The conditioning therapy for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched HSCT patients
      was modified BU/CY plus ATG (thymoglobulin; Sang Stat, France) consisting of cytarabine
      (Ara-C 4 g·m-2·d-1) intravenously on days -10 to -9, busulfan (BU 3.2 mg·kg-1·d-1)
      intravenously on days -8 to -6, cyclophosphamide (CY 1.8 g·m-2·d-1), intravenously on days -5
      to -4, semustine (Me-CCNU, 250 mg·m-2), orally once on day -3, and ATG (2.5 mg·kg-1·d-1)
      intravenously on days -5 to -2. In matched sibling transplantations, patients received
      hydroxycarbamide (80 mg·kg-1) orally on day -10 and a lower dose of Ara-C (2 g·m-2·d-1) on
      day -9, but otherwise an identical regimen to the HLA-mismatched patients without ATG.

      BM samples from patients were obtained to assess leukemia status after HSCT. The time points
      that we monitored BM samples included at time of allo-HSCT; 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4.5
      months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after allo-HSCT; and every 6 months thereafter to
      the defined endpoints or for at least until 5 years after transplantation.
