      be asked to participate in this study.

      A device is used to determine autonomic arousal over night (SOMNOcheck micro). The Somnocheck
      micro records oxygen saturation as well as pulse frequency and breathing, and calculates an
      autonomic arousal index (AAI). Somnocheck measurements will take place in two nights
      (baseline and with CPAP) and parallel to a standard polysomnography (PSG). The PSG provides
      data to analyze the arousal frequency according to ASDA rules, which will then be compared to
      the AAI.

      Performance is determined twice (prior and after CPAP therapy) by the use of a steering
      simulator programme (DASS). Differences in arousal will be correlated with differences in
      performance (deviation from the road, reaction time). The subjects are also asked to fill out
      the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) twice, prior and after therapy. Aim is to compare
      Somnocheck and PSG measurements and daytime sleepiness with DASS and ESS.
