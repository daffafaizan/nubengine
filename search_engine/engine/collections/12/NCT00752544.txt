    
      This is a Phase I, double-blind (neither the physician or the volunteer knows the dose of the
      study medication), randomized (study medication assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (dose
      without the study medication present) trial to determine the safety, tolerability and plasma
      pharmacokinetics (amount of medication in the blood) of TMC435350 after single and multiple
      oral doses in healthy male Japanese volunteers. 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg doses will be given
      as an oral solution. Six (6) doses will be given with a 3 day follow-up between the first and
      second dose. Additional follow-up will be done for 3 days after the last dose and at
      approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the last dose.
