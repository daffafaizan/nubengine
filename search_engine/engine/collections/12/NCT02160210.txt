      radius and softer insert section in reducing patients' abdominal pain in colonoscopy.
      Transnasal gastroscope was selected in this study , because of its small caliber (5.9mm) and
      small turning radius . Visual analogue scale(VAS),cecum intubation time and cecum intubation
      rate were evaluated.
