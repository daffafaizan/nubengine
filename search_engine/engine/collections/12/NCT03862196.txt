      the effect of a text message-based strategy to improve retention in HIV care at the study
      clinic, compared to the standard of care. Trained counselors will deliver the text messages.
      After a block randomization, the trained counselor (a nurse) will send the first welcoming
      message to participants in the intervention arm. The nurse will send 2 tailored text messages
      per week. In addition 2 to 4 days before an appointment, the nurse will send a message
      reminder. In addition, the nurse will have bilateral communication with participants using
      text messages according to their needs. The participants of the intervention arm will
      interact with the nurse during 3 months with a semi-structured strategy, that is, with
      template text messages (predesigned) and open messages (for which the nurse will be trained).
      Three and six months after started the intervention the variables of interest will be
      assessed.
