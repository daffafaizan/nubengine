    
      Haemophilia A is a congenital coagulation disorder caused by a deficiency or abnormality of
      coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).

      The severity of the haemophilia depends on the magnitude of the FVIII deficiency and the
      clinical features depend on the site of the bleed.

      The therapeutic management of this disease involves administering the deficient factor, FVIII
      to the patient. Depending on the severity of the disease and patient background, the
      management regimens are different (long term prophylactic treatment to prevent non surgical
      bleeds, prophylactic short term treatment to prevent surgical bleeds or treatment of acute
      bleeds on demand).

      Several recombinant or plasma derived treatments are currently available. The CSL Behring
      Company has designed a new recombinant single chain B1FVIII, rFVIII (Afstyla®). This has
      increased affinity for VWF, resulting in improved stability and an improvement in its
      pharmacokinetic indices. OPERA is a non-interventional, prospective and national study which
      aim is to record real life data in haemophilia A French patients treated with Afstyla® in
      order to confirm the efficacy and safety of this proprietary product established in clinical
      development studies.
