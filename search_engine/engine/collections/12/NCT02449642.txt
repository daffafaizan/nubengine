      surge. In recent review GNRH antagonist has been found comparable to GnRH agonist in term of
      live birth rate but with reduced risk of OHSS. another advantage of using GnRH antagonist is
      the ability to use GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation which has been shown to nearly
      eliminate the risk of OHSS. The exact mechanism of this risk reduction is still unknown.

      Our aim is to do a frequent blood tests every 20 minutes for 6 hours duration in the day of
      ovum pick up or the day of embryo transfer to measure the level of LH, estradiol and
      progesterone in women triggered with GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation.
