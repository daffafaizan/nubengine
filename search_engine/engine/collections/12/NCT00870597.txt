    
      Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of 25-gauge transconjuntival
      sutureless vitrectomy (TSV) in patients with persistent vitreous floaters who underwent
      multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.

      Setting: Hospital Oftalmológico de Brasília, Brasília, DF, Brazil.

      Methods: Fourteen eyes of 11 patients with multifocal IOL implant associated with vitreous
      opacities that underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy were prospectively analyzed. Information
      collected included near and distance uncorrected visual acuity (UCDVA), best corrected
      distance visual acuity (BCDVA), and the spherical equivalent (SE) before and 3 months after
      vitrectomy. Patients were questioned about surgery satisfaction and visual improvement after
      vitrectomy.
