      has accomplished to provide a common platform for the two different research teams. All
      partners of SICA-HF recruited more than 1462 patients with chronic heart failure, 199
      patients with type 2 diabetes without heart failure, and 173 healthy control subjects. Thus,
      during the last year, a cumulative 91.4% of the target value was achieved for patients with
      chronic heart failure, 66.3% of the target value for diabetic controls, and 115.3% and thus
      over-achieving for healthy subjects. The data of all participating centers were collected and
      entered into the central database. As of this writing, 1469 of all chronic heart failure
      patients' visits, 255 of diabetic controls' visits, and 167 healthy controls' visits have
      been entered into the online database. In total, 171 patients have been reported to be
      deceased; the total number of hospitalizations is 2232.
