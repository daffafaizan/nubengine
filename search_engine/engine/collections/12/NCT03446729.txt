      be 12 weeks in duration and will consist of 7 sessions. The content of sessions will provide
      the main elements described in behavioral therapy programs for obesity, based on empirical
      literature. Participants will be provided handouts, and the handout content will be based on
      our clinic treatment manual and published behavior therapy protocols. The program will be
      administered in individual 30-60-min sessions with a behavioral coach meeting every other
      week. This program emphasizes self-monitoring of food intake. It also emphasizes gradual
      weight loss, increasing physical activity, and improving diet through permanent lifestyle
      changes. Program topics include: self-monitoring of eating behavior, physical activity,
      changing the home environment and nutrition education. All treatment sessions will be
      conducted by licensed clinical health psychologists or psychology doctoral level students
      with experience in leading weight loss interventions.
