      retrieval in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality
      disorder (BPD). In contrast, in healthy participants memory retrieval was impaired after
      hydrocortisone compared to placebo.

      The proposed studies aim to further investigate these findings and to understand the
      underlying neuronal correlates. Thus, the mechanisms of enhanced memory retrieval after
      hydrocortisone in patients with BPD and PTSD will be investigated by fMRI.

      In a placebo-controlled study, the effects of 10mg hydrocortisone on brain activity, in
      particular the hippocampus, will be investigated in patients with PTSD and BPD and will be
      compared with those in healthy control participants. During the fMRI session, a declarative
      memory task (retrieval of a previous learned word list) and an autobiographical memory test
      will be performed. Effects of hydrocortisone on resting state brain activity and the neuronal
      correlates of memory retrieval will be analysed.
