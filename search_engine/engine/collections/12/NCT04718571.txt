      providing care for a population of ca. 500'000 inhabitants. All clinical samples sent for
      microbiological analysis within HUG are treated by the Bacteriology Laboratory of Geneva
      University Hospitals. An online database is kept up-to-date and includes all samples
      processed by the laboratory. The investigators performed a comprehensive analysis of all
      clinical samples included in this database over a 5-year period (2015-2020). This report
      focuses only on positive results for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).The following items
      were recorded: age, gender, BMI whenever available, site of infection (when pulmonary:
      description of main radiological abnormalities), presence and type of immunosuppression,
      relevant pulmonary and non-pulmonary comorbidities, results of microscopy, and NTM species
      identified. The investigators also recorded whether the patient was treated for the
      identified NTM or not and if a susceptibility profile had been determined (this is not
      routinely performed and must be requested by the clinician).

      The study protocol was approved by their local ethics committee
