      currently used as standard of care to treat anterior pelvic ring injuries that require
      stabilization. The two treatment methods are subcutaneous internal fixation (INFIX) and
      external fixation (EXFIX). Patients will be given the opportunity to opt out of randomization
      and participate in one of the observational arms. The first observational arm is comprised of
      those patients who do not want to randomize and they will undergo anterior pelvic ring
      stabilization according to the treating surgeon's discretion. The second observational arm
      will be comprised of patients who consent to be in the study but whose pelvic ring fractures
      do not require any form of anterior pelvic internal fixation based on the treating surgeon's
      opinion. This type of injury requires follow up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12
      months, and 24 months. At each follow up appointment, the patient will be asked to complete
      surveys as part of the PROMIS series (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
      System) which will include surveys about physical function, pain, mobility, sex life
      satisfaction, depression, and for male patients, a survey about erectile function. In
      addition to the PROMIS questionnaire for pain, the investigators will also use a visual
      analogue pain scale and ask what the patient's satisfaction is on a scale of 0-100%. If the
      patient does not report to clinic for follow up, the research coordinator will call the
      patient to complete the study questionnaires.
