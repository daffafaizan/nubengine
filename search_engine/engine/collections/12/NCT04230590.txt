      12, 18, 24) over 24 weeks where clinical symptoms, cognition, functioning and well-being will
      be assessed. Passive digital data from smartphones and wrist wearable devices (e.g. sleep
      patterns, heart rate, location variance and entropy, phone usage frequency and duration,
      finger taps, ambient light, and physical activity) will be collected continuously during the
      24 weeks. Audio recorded follow-up phone calls will be made to participants who consented to
      the optional audio recorded component at Weeks 3, 9, 15, 21. This study will also carry out
      an administrative follow-up at Week 24/termination and Week 52 to obtain healthcare
      utilization information (e.g. scheduled or unscheduled appointments, readmission, etc) since
      study enrollment.

      Study findings will shed light on the relationship between digital biomarkers with clinical
      status and health utilization outcomes, as well as explore the feasibility and acceptability
      of digital sensors.
