      For this study, the investigators used herbal granules prepared according to the formula of
      R-S-Y-R-T. The investigators purchased the study products from a manufacturer with a Good
      Manufacturing Practice (Si Wu Tang) certification in Taiwan. This was a concentrated
      decoction made by water extraction in 1:13 ratio from single batched roots of the 14 plants
      in proportions: Radix Paeoniae alba (Bai Sau) (90 g), Radix Angelicae sinensis (Dang Guay)
      (30 g), Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chenpi) (30 g), Radix Astragali (Huangqi) (30 g),
      Cortex Cinnamomi (Rougui) (30 g), Radix Ginseng (Renshen) (30 g), Rhizoma Atractylodis
      Macrocephalae (Baizhu) (30 g), Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gancao) (30 g), Radix Rehmanniae
      praeparata (Soe Dee Huang) (20 g), Fructus Schisandrae (Wuweizi) (20 g), Poria cocos (Fuling)
      (20 g), Cortex et Radix Polygalae (Yuanzhi) (15 g), Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Jiang) (30
      g)ï¼ŒFructus Jujubae (Dazao) (10 g) as prepared according to the original pharmacopoeia. The
      plant origins in China were known to the buyer of the pharmaceutical company and the final
      product was free of E. coli, Salmonella and pesticide residues. The levels of heavy metals
      were 1.238 ppm for lead, 0.228 ppm for arsenic,0.10 ppm for cadmium, and <0.0022 ppm for
      mercury, all within regulated limits (5, 5, 0.5, and 0.5 ppm, respectively). Each pack
      weighed approximately 500 mg in aluminum packets.

      The investigators determined the dosage of 1 pack a time for 3 times a day with warm water
      for 6 months. The exact number of packs taken was recorded in clinic visits and any
      unfinished packs were brought back to the study nurse at the next clinic visit.
