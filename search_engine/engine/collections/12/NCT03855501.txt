      outcomes of apexification treatment (AT) using either mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or
      calcium hydroxide (CH) to treat permanent immature anterior teeth with necrotic pulps and
      periapical lesions in adults. Ninety immature teeth with necrotic pulps and periapical
      lesions on patients (aged 16-40y) were treated with AT using MTA (45 teeth) or CH (45 teeth)
      between 2015 and 2018. The patients were contacted for follow-up examination at 12 to 48
      months after treatment. The treatment outcome based on clinical and radiographic criteria was
      assessed by calibrated examiners and dichotomized as "healed+healing" or "not healed". The
      age, gender, stage of root development, preoperative signs and symptoms of apical
      periodontitis and size of periapical lesion were recorded. The effect of potential clinical
      variables on the treatment outcome of AT was evaluated clinically and radiographically during
      a 12-48-month follow-up. In order to assess the cumulative successes of CH and MTA after AT,
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test was used(p>0.05).
