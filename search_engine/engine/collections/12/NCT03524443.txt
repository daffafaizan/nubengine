      of imaginary life, is found in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia (BN) in
      numerous studies. Some publications show that it is a factor of resistance in several forms
      of psychotherapies and of poor prognosis for these patients who already present a high rate
      of chronification and mortality because of the complications of the undernutrition and the
      suicide risk. Art therapy is very wide-spread in the care of AN and of BN, but little
      studied. About alexithymia, if there is no psychotherapy having made the proof of its
      efficiency currently, some studies suggest the interest of art-therapy on alexithymic
      features, but none, to our knowledge, estimated the effect.

      The investigator suggest to describe the evolution at 3 months of art therapy on alexithymia,
      using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale in 20 items (TAS-20), in patients with AN or BN. The
      investigators shall also describe the evolution at 3 months with the TAS-20 as well as the
      relationship between variations of alexithymia and BMI in patients presenting AN at 1 and 3
      months globally and in each of the centers. The investigators will also evaluate the effect
      of depression and anxiety at 1 and 3 months of art therapy on alexithymia.The investigators
      shall realize an observational prospective multicenter cohort study design. Each patient will
      receive standard care: multidisciplinary and corresponding to the HAS recommendations and
      semimonthly or weeklies sessions of art therapy, using all types of art. Thus, each patient
      will be her own control before art therapy.
