      duration of at least 12 weeks. The study group received a true inhibitor Kinesio taping while
      the control group received sham taping for the first four weeks. In both groups, progressive
      stretching and strengthening exercises were given as a home program for 6 weeks. Patients
      were assessed with the numerical rating scale (NRS), Cyriax resistive muscle test evaluation,
      maximal grip strength, PRTEE (Patient- Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation), and SF-36 (Short
      Form-36) by the first assessor who was blinded to taping types.
