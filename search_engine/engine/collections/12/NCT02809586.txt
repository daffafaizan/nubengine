      media ads and conduct online screening, enrolling 975 risky drinkers (i.e., using AUDIT-C
      screener) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing three conditions: 1) Social Media
      Intervention + Incentives (n=325), 2) Social Media Intervention Only (n=325), and 3)
      Attention Control E-News condition (n=325), with post baseline follow-up assessments at 3, 6,
      and 12 months. Interventions will include access for 8 weeks to unique, secret group pages
      facilitated by e-coaches (supervised by therapists), with dynamic content emphasizing
      reducing alcohol use/misuse as well as concomitant risk behaviors (other drug use based on
      co-ingestion and common motives for use).
