      exams in elderly, 135 hypertensive elderlies were divided into 2 groups: trained and control.
      The trained group was submitted to a resistance training period. Before the 16 weeks ACE gene
      was genotyped (PCR). Before and after 16 weeks, blood pressure (ambulatory), HDL-cholesterol,
      Total cholesterol, Glycemia, Triacylglycerol (colorimetric assay) and plasminogen activator
      inhibition (PAI-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial cell
      adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), Adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), C Reactive
      Protein, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin 1-7, (ELISA assay) were
      measured.
