      a common variant of SLCO2B1 (the gene coding for OATP2B1), c.[935G>A], which results in the
      substitution of Argâ†’Glu at amino acid position 312, was associated with steady-state plasma
      concentrations of montelukast and response(1). Compared to G/G homozygotes, A/G heterozygotes
      had lower plasma concentrations at both 1 and 6 months of therapy. Additionally, scores on
      the Asthma Symptom Utility Index were higher (better asthma control) in G/G homozygotes
      compared to A/G heterozygotes at both sampling intervals, but not prior to treatment. We
      concluded that genotype at c.935 may contribute to the variability in response to
      montelukast.

      We recently completed a study of the influence of genotype at c.935 and the co-ingestion of
      citrus juice on the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg dose of montelukast in 26 adolescent
      subjects with physician-diagnosed asthma (NCT00513760). Twenty-one participants were
      genotyped as G/G homozygotes and five as A/G heterozygotes. The area under the montelukast
      plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) in A/G heterozygotes was 46% lower than the AUC in
      G/G homozygotes, replicating our earlier findings that genotype at c.935 influences the
      pharmacokinetics of montelukast.

      Assuming an additive genetic model, our data predict that the AUC of montelukast in
      individuals carrying the A/A genotype would be even lower than in heterozygotes. The
      prevalence of the homozygous mutant allele (A/A) is low among African and European Americans
      (0 - 3%; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). However the prevalence of the A/A
      genotype is 18% in both Asian Americans and Hispanics, and thus these racial / ethnic groups
      represent an ideal model to test the hypothesis that genotype at c.935 influences the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of montelukast. In this study, we will generate
      preliminary data showing that the AUC of montelukast is lowest in A/A, intermediate in A/G
      and highest in G/G and confirm the suitability of this model to replicate our earlier
      findings that genotype at c.935 is associated with response to montelukast.
