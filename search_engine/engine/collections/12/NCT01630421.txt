      bone and skin. The definition for ACC is the localized absence of (normal) skin at the time
      of birth (congenital). The skin appears thinner and the underlying structures are visible. We
      study mostly the isolated form of ACC with the lesion often being at the vertex of the skull
      (at or close to the top of the skull). The bone underlying the lesion is sometimes thinner as
      well.

      For this study we will:

        -  Send out study participation kits and consent by phone

        -  Collect a saliva sample from eligible individuals

        -  Obtain information regarding ACC

        -  Document disorder with photos and doctor's letters

        -  If patients undergo surgery for ACC we ask to obtain some tissue that would otherwise be
           discarded

        -  Isolate DNA from the saliva sample

        -  Perform genetic analyses of the DNA with the most up-to-date methods available to
           identify genetic variations

        -  Study in the laboratory why the genetic variations cause the disorder
