    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of propofol-based,
      gastroenterologist-administered sedation in severely obese patients (BMIâ‰¥35) undergoing upper
      endoscopy. We will use changes in pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters as the primary safety
      measure in this study. We will compare these results in 30 non-obese patients and in 30 obese
      patients.

      The term balanced propofol sedation refers to using a low dose of propofol in combination
      with small amounts of an opioid and midazolam.
