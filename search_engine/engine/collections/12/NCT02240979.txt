      capture an arterial waveform using the iPhone camera held over the skin. Then based on the
      captured waveform and previous laboratory experiments and models, the investigators are able
      to calculate ejection fraction, the percentage of blood that goes out of the heart into the
      circulation with each beat. Previous studies suggested that the iPhone app measurements of
      ejection fraction were similar to those obtained with traditional cardiac echocardiography.
      In the current study the iPhone app measures are being compared to ejection fraction obtained
      using cardiac MRI. The iPhone also measures other physical properties of the heart and aorta
      that the investigators call "intrinsic frequencies". Using healthy subjects they have
      established the normal pattern/range of intrinsic frequencies, and in this study, a more
      diverse population of subjects (some with heart disease) will be studied, to determine how
      intrinsic frequency measures compare to traditional clinical measures of cardiac function.
