      able to have spontaneous ventilation with maximum of 16 cm of H2O of pressure support, he
      could be included in the study. The nocturnal ventilation mode will be randomised between
      pressure controlled ventilation and pressure support ventilation with the same pressure
      support than during the day. We will follow the quality and quantity of sleep with continue
      polysomnography. Indeed, patients in ICU could sleep during the night but too during the day.
      We will compare the duration of the weaning period between the two arms.
