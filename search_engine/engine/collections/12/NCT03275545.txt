    
      Aim 1: To compare patterns of brain activity in reward circuits to typically rewarding cues
      and disorder-specific cues between weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa and
      non-eating disorder controls

      Hypothesis 1a: Activity in reward circuitry will be elevated in response to typically
      rewarding cues in the non-eating disorder control group versus weight-restored anorexia
      nervosa group.

      Hypothesis 1b: Activity in reward circuitry will be elevated in response to disorder-specific
      in the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group versus the non-eating disorder control group.

      Aim 2: To specify the relationship between brain patterns related to reward and restrictive
      eating among weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa

      Hypothesis 2a: Lower reward circuit activity in response to typically rewarding cues will
      predict lower test meal intake for weight-restored anorexia nervosa group versus the
      non-eating disorder control group.

      Hypothesis 2b: Higher reward circuit activity in response to disorder-specific cues will
      predict lower test meal intake for the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group versus the
      non-eating disorder control group.

      Aim 3: To identify the brain patterns in reward circuitry associated with the risk of relapse
      among weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa in the year following
      weight-restoration.

      Hypothesis 3a: Lower reward circuit activity in response to typically rewarding cues will
      predict relapse in the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group.

      Hypothesis 3b: Higher reward circuit activity in response to disorder-specific cues will
      predict relapse in the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group.
