      fitness of the patients with COPD allowing restoration of independence in daily functioning.

      Psychological support is required in order to reduce the negative psychological symptoms
      related to both the pulmonary disease itself and the comorbidities. In this study the
      investigators want to assess the effectiveness of the virtual reality (VR) therapy compared
      to standard psychological support (Schultz Autogenic Training).

      Thanks to using head mounted display (VR goggles 2018) and the phenomenon of total immersion
      VR therapy allows to completely separate the patient from the hospital environment, provides
      an intense visual, auditory and kinesthetic stimulation. Depending on the stage of therapy it
      can have a calming and mood-improving effect or, in another part of the therapy, it can
      motivate the patient to the rehabilitation process. The additional aim of the VR therapy is
      to help the patients regain their emotional balance, let them recognize their psychological
      resources and trigger the natural recovery mechanisms.

      The goals of the project:

        1. The evaluation of the influence of VR therapy on the depressive symptoms, the anxiety
           level and the stress level of the patients undergoing the pulmonary rehabilitation.

        2. The comparison of the influence of the VR therapy and Schultz Autogenic Training on the
           pulmonary rehabilitation process.

        3. The evaluation of the pulmonary therapy improvements in patients with and without
           depressive, anxiety or stress symptoms.
