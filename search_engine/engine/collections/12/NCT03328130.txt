      over time. Patients initially present with night blindness, and later in life experience loss
      of central vision which leads to blindness. RP is a highly variable disorder with some
      patients developing symptomatic visual loss in childhood whereas others remain asymptomatic
      until mid-adulthood. There are no treatments available.

      This study focuses on the form of RP caused by mutations (modifications) in the genetic
      information necessary to make the protein called rod cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 β subunit (or
      PDE6β). Clinical diagnosis is made by function tests of the eye and confirmed using a
      specific method called molecular testing to verify that the PDE6B gene is not correct.

      This study uses a gene therapy vector inspired from an adeno-associated virus (AAV) called
      AAV2/5-hPDE6B. This vector intends to supply to the target cells the PDE6B therapeutic gene
      that is not functioning properly in the cell. The AAV parts of the gene therapy vector work
      as a vehicle to deliver the normal human PDE6B gene into the cells of the retina.
