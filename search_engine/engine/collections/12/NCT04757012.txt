      care unit with light, sound and painful stimulations. Previously, exposure to maternal voice
      has demonstrated improvement on infants' statements: reduction of bradycardia, desaturation
      events, improvement of tolerance feeding and sleep. Unfortunatly in most of the N ICU in
      France, the mothers' presence attendance time is reduced because of the absence of
      accommodation structure. The use of a specific neonatal device able to daily record maternal
      voice and hearbeats and to restore it when mother is gone could improve the environment and
      promote the well-being of the newborn.
