    
      This is a prospective clinical trial of adult cancer patients presenting with pain and
      depression, newly referred to the Department of Supportive Oncology, and receiving preemptive
      PGx testing for genes related to supportive care prior to the first clinic visit. Genotyping
      results will be returned within approximately 4-5 business days. A PGx specialist will
      provide detailed clinical interpretations to the referring provider and upload a copy of the
      test results into the subject's medical chart. A consultation note will also be placed in
      each subject's chart detailing the PGx results. Supportive Oncology clinicians will be
      instructed to consult a pharmacist to evaluate PGx test results prior to prescribing
      supportive care therapies, especially pain and depression medications. The number of consults
      and recommendations will be documented, in addition to test results, demographic data,
      medical/medication history, ESAS symptom scores, PHQ9 depression scores, and side effects of
      supportive therapy. The number of ambulatory clinic visits and hospitalizations will be used
      to estimate health care utilization and costs. Subjects will complete a short survey at the
      end of the study period regarding their knowledge about PGx, and whether access to PGx
      information improves satisfaction with care and communication.
