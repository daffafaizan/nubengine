    
      This study (CNTO1275CRD3001 or "UNITI-1") examines ustekinumab (an antibody medication that
      inhibits the inflammatory proteins IL-12 and IL-23) versus a placebo (otherwise identical
      except without the ustekinumab antibody) given intravenously (by an IV) in adults with
      moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who previously did not respond to, lost
      response to, or could not tolerate TNF-antagonist medications (specifically, infliximab,
      adalimumab or certolizumab pegol). Ustekinumab (also known as Stelara) is approved as a
      treatment for the skin condition of moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, but this study
      will examine if ustekinumab can provide benefit in Crohn's disease and also assess for any
      risks or side effects. Both the positive and negative outcomes of IV placebo versus two
      different doses of IV ustekinumab will be tracked and compared over eight weeks, in
      approximately 703 patients. Patients enrolling in this study will be assigned to one of the 3
      treatment groups by chance (randomly, like rolling dice), and all will receive a single IV
      administration of study agent at the first study visit (after the screening period), and then
      will be asked to return for 3 additional visits through Week 8. Patients who complete this
      study through the Week 8 visit and remain eligible can enter the maintenance study
      (CNTO1275CRD3003 or "IM-UNITI'' [NCT01369355]), where they will receive additional study
      agent, including the administration of ustekinumab in patients who receive placebo in this
      study and have not had improvement in their Crohn's disease. Patients who do not enter the
      CNTO1275CRD3003 study will have a final safety follow-up visit approximately 20 weeks after
      they received study agent when they entered into this study at the Week 0 visit. .All
      patients will receive a single intravenous (IV) administration of study drug (either placebo
      or ustekinumab) at the first (week 0) visit when they enter the study.There are 3 treatment
      groups: Group 1: Placebo; Group 2: ustekinumab 130 mg, Group 3: weight-range based
      ustekinumab doses approximating ustekinumab 6 mg/kg: 260 mg (weight <= 55 kg), 390 mg (weight
      > 55 kg and <= 85 kg), and 520 mg (weight > 85 kg).
