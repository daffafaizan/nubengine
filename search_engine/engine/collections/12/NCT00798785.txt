        2. Aim 2: To increase functional beta cell mass by adding basilixumab at second
           implantation

        3. Aim 3: To assess the influence of down-tapering the tacrolimus dose during
           posttransplant years 2-5 on these data, on metabolic control, on the prevalence of
           hypoglycemia and on safety parameters.

        4. Aim 4: To investigate the potential of the peritoneum and omentum as an alternative site
           for encapsulated beta-cells.

        5. Aim 5: To investigate the potential of the brachioradial muscle as an alternative site
           for encapsulated beta-cells.
