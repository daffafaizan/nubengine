      from the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. The samples will be transferred to the lab
      for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The presence of absence of SARS-CoV-2 will be compared in tears
      versus NP swabs.

      The second part of the study is a histopathology examination series. Normal lacrimal gland
      and ocular surface tissue samples already stored at the UMN ocular pathology lab and Lion's
      Gift of Sight Eye Bank will be used for IHC staining for ACE2 and similar targets.
