      leukapheresis procedure at approximately 3 to 4 weeks prior to first EGFR-BATs infusion. The
      white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins - OKT3 and IL-2
      which activates the cells to multiply. After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated
      T cells are coated with the OKT3 and cetuximab to produce bispecific antibody armed T cells
      (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.

      Within one to two weeks prior to infusion of the study treatment, subjects will receive one
      dose of chemotherapy. The choice of chemotherapy agent(s) is at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      At approximately 4 weeks following leukapheresis procedure, twice weekly or weekly infusions
      of the BATs cells will take place (twice weekly for participants enrolled before DATE and
      weekly for participants enrolled after DATE). A total of eight twice weekly infusions or four
      weekly infusions will be given over a four week period. Please note that the weekly dose for
      both groups of participants is the same; participants that received twice weekly dosing
      received half of the weekly dose at each infusion.

      Follow-up appointment schedule will include clinic visits at 1 to 2 weeks, 4 to 5 weeks, 2
      months, 4 months and 6 months following the last infusion of BATs cells.
