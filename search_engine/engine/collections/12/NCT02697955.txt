      continuous sciatic catheters has been a great success in reducing postoperative pain
      following these operations, but despite an effective sciatic catheter patients still report
      moderate to severe pain from the anteromedial side of the ankle. According to cadaver
      dissection studies the saphenous nerve innervates the anterior and medial parts of the ankle
      and talonavicular joint, and even though a saphenous block is standard procedure in many
      departments of anesthesiology worldwide, scientific evidence regarding the effect of the
      saphenous block on postoperative pain is lacking.

      This study investigates the effect of a selective, ultrasound-guided subsartorial saphenous
      block on postoperative pain following major ankle and hind foot surgery.
