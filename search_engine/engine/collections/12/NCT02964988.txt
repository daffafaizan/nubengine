    
      68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is a radioligand targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR),
      which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness. 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/CT will
      be applied in patients with mCRPC during treatment with Radium-223. PET/CT will be performed
      before initiation of Radium therapy and after two treatment cycles. The initial
      semiquantitative uptake (standard uptake values, SUVs) of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in metastases as
      well as the change in these parameters after therapy will be correlated with overall survival
      and progression free survival.
