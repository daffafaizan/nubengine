      In case of buried bone free flaps, the follow up is even more difficult. Monitoring methods,
      such as the implantable Doppler system, laser Doppler flowmetry and microdialysis have been
      developped in the last 15 years. Ferguson et al. show a false positive rate of 31% with
      implantable doppler monitoring of buried flaps.

      The purpose of this study is to to determine the lactate/pyruvate ratio mean value in bone
      free flaps with a microdialysis catheter directly positioned in the bone tissue.
