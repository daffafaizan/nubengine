      treatments. Our broad goal is to identify genomic factors, which contribute to the
      development or exacerbation of common and critical illnesses that affect preterm and
      near-term infants. We seek to accomplish this goal in the following ways:

        -  First: to test candidate gene DNA variations and link already identified single
           nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) producing functional alterations to the risk of
           clinically important disorders.

        -  Second: to utilize a whole-genomic approach to identify SNPs not previously linked to
           the risk of development or progression of neonatal disorders.
