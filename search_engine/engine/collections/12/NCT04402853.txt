      syndrome started in China and rapidly spread all over the world and in particular in northern
      Italy. There are many reasons to justify this rapid diffusion in Italian Lombardia region as
      the high population density with more possibilities of interpersonal contact, high prevalence
      of respiratory pathologies, in particular in elderly people, due to pollution, high number of
      contacts with Chinese population for travelling and business reasons, and at last the
      non-windy temperate climate conditions, that increases the persistence of virus in the
      environment.

      At now, more than eighty thousand citizens from Lombardia Region have been officially
      affected by the disease with a high death toll, also considering that actual numbers are
      certainly much underestimated.

      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of SARS COV-2 virus in tears
      collected from COVID-19 patients by rtPCR analysis directed to target sites of viral RNA, and
      to correlate virus presence to concomitant systemic clinical conditions
