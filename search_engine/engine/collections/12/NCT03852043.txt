    
      Fifty women with low self-esteem will be randomly assigned to one of two training programs
      (MICT or HIIT) in a real-world setting. Both groups will perform three times a week for
      eight-weeks on alternate days.

      The women in each group will perform three workouts per week for a period of eight weeks. The
      moderate-intensity continuous training group will perform a training session of 40 min
      duration at an intensity between 65 and 75% of your HRmax. Women assigned to the group HIIT
      will perform a training session of 22 minutes of duration by performing intervals of high
      intensity between 90 and 95 % of the HRmax for 30 seconds in duration and with a recovery of
      one minute training at moderate intensity is between 50 and 60 % of the HRmax, doing 15 loads
      of 30 seconds at high intensity, with 60 seconds of recovery between loads at moderate
      intensity. At the beginning of each training session, both groups will complete strength
      exercises mainly including large muscle groups (hip, knees, and ankles) with TherabandÂ® (blue
      color ) for 3 sets of 15 repetitions.

      All participants will be evaluated before initiating interventions and upon completion of the
      training program, after eight weeks, self-esteem will be assessed using the Rosenberg
      self-esteem scale, determination of anthropometric variables such as weight, height, waist
      circumference, arterial pressure, body composition by bioimpedance and the basal metabolic
      rate.
