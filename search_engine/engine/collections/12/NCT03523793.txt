      therapy management of patients with spine related musculoskeletal pain will have several
      important goals: 1) improve patient pain and disability outcomes, 2) limit over utilization
      of physical therapy services, and 3) increase adherence to limit unwarranted variation in
      clinical practice. This proposed pilot study proposal will test if a multifaceted
      intervention strategy for implementation of neck and low back CPG meets these goals and
      provide necessary data for larger system wide implementation efforts.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine if physical therapy clinics that receive neck and low back pain
      (LBP) clinical practice guideline (CPG) training are associated with improved patient
      outcomes compared to those that have not received training. Neck and LBP specific disability
      and pain intensity will be assessed at intake, on a weekly basis and at discharge (Specific
      Aim 1a). Secondary patient outcomes will consist of patient satisfaction scores (Specific Aim
      1b). Statistical analyses will evaluate for temporal effects of training considering the
      stepped wedge study design.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine if multifaceted interventions for CPG implementation positively
      impacts physical therapist beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and behaviors over time. CPG
      adherence (by clinicians) will be indirectly assessed using quantitative and qualitative
      methods consisting of: 1) clinician checklists, 2) clinician questionnaires, 3) quality
      indicators, and 4) total proportion outcome measure assessments (Specific Aim 2).
