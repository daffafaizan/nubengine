      wave elastography technology using a transperineal approach in term pregnant women in two
      visits (the 1st one with only one observer and the second one with two observers)

      Follow up Prospective study including nulliparous term pregnant women with 2 visits planned,
      spaced at least by 12 hours and, for the most, 7 days.

      Primary outcome: The mean value of shear modulus measures in the external anal sphincter for
      the three considered conditions (rest, Valsalva maneuver and contraction) at each visit and
      for each observer with a calculation of Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and Variation
      Coefficient.

      Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes will be the percentage of completed procedure
      (ability to see the external sphincter and to obtain a measure of the shear modulus), the
      existence of a perineal tear according the RCOG-OMS classification and the answer to an
      acceptability question.

      Study design: Prospective monocentric study including nulliparous term pregnant women with
      two visits spaced of at least 12 hours and, for the most, 7 days.

      Interventions: Assessment of the external anal sphincter viscoelastic properties using shear
      wave elastography technology

        -  Women in lithotomy position with an empty bladder

        -  The linear probe is applied on transversal plane on the perineal with a transperineal
           approach

        -  The external anal sphincter will be identified in 2D ultrasound using a SL 18-5 linear
           probe

        -  Viscoelastic properties of the muscle will be assessed by measuring the shear modulus at
           rest, Valsalva maneuver and contraction

        -  Exactly the same investigations will be performed for the two visits planned in the
           protocol. In the first visit, it will be one single observer and for the second it will
           be 2 observers.

        -  Data about the mode of delivery and the occurrence of OASI will be collected into
           women's medical file

      Number of subjects: 40 volunteers pregnant women are planned for this research

      Statistical analysis: The number of successful procedures will be reported as effectives and
      percentages.

      Reproducibility will be reported by calculating the coefficient of variation and the
      intraclass correlation coefficient. The level of significance will be considered for p<0.05
