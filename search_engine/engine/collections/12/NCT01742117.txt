    
      TAILOR-PCI is a multi-site, open label, prospective, randomized trial testing the hypothesis
      that after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), using a genotyping strategy ticagrelor
      90 mg twice per day is superior to clopidogrel 75 mg per day in reducing a composite endpoint
      of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), i.e., non-fatal myocardial infarction,
      non-fatal stroke, severe recurrent ischemia, cardiovascular (CV) death, and stent thrombosis
      (primary endpoints) in CYP2C19 reduced function allele patients. Patients who undergo PCI
      will be randomized to a conventional therapy arm (i.e., to receive clopidogrel 75 mg once
      daily without prospective genotyping guidance) versus a prospective CYP2C19 genotype-based
      anti-platelet therapy approach (ticagrelor 90 mg bid in CYP2C19 *2 or *3 reduced function
      allele patients, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily in non-*2 or -*3 CYP2C19 patients). Buccal
      swabs will be obtained for those subjects randomized to the prospective genotyping arm. All
      subjects will have a blood sample drawn for DNA analysis but genotyping using these DNA
      samples will be performed only after completion of the duration of anti-platelet therapy
      (i.e., after one year). The primary endpoints will be assessed prospectively and will be
      compared between the conventional arm and the prospective genotyping arm among those
      identified as reduced function CYP2C19 allele carriers according to the 1-year genotype
      results.
