      popular than metal-ceramic crowns especially as the cost of metal rises and aesthetic
      requested people increases The increased demand for aesthetic treatments has led to the
      widespread use of metal-free ceramics for conservative restorations. Whilst studies for
      clinical porcelain restorations clarifies satisfactory success rates describes the reasons
      for failure is due to advance the techniques and materials used in dental restorations.
      All-ceramic restorations failures are due to several reasons, such as restoration fractures,
      discoloration in marginal area, marginal misfits and secondary decays. However, secondary
      caries is the main failure mentioned by the studies, responsible for 21% of the suddenly
      crown replacements. The etiology of secondary caries is as classified to primary caries, with
      the involvement of the same cariogenic microorganisms. The place and spread where to invade
      of primary and secondary lesions are also similar, with secondary caries developing mainly in
      the gingival tooth interface of restored teeth. Different authors have mentioned different
      instrumentation to prepare teeth appropriately.Preparation may be applied using diamond burs
      attached to sonic devices or high-speed rotating instruments with diamond or tungsten carbide
      burs. The action of conventional high-speed instruments applied for tooth preparation has
      been widely researched as well as the adhesion strengths and marginal microleakage it
      produces. Some authors insisted that dental surface morphology of prepared teeth is
      influenced by the type of bur used for preparation.
