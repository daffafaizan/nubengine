    
      1. In the operating room, all patients are monitored with an electrocardiograph,
           noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter, capnograph and Bispectral index (BIS)
           monitor. After pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen for 1 minute, intravenous anesthesia
           (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanyl is administrated and followed by rocuronium
           (0.6mg/kg). When patients are lost their consciousness, manual mask ventilation is
           proceeded with 100% oxygen for 2 minutes.

        2. Transoral endotracheal intubation is performed using Mcgrath videolaryngoscope (Group
           ML) and direct laryngoscope (Group DL) using manual in-line stabilization. At this time,
           the time required for intubation is measure by other medical personnel not engaged in
           this research.

        3. The anesthesiologist assesses Cormack Lehane laryngeal visual field,external laryngeal
           manipulation, intubation difficulty scales (IDS) and the difficulty of intubation.
