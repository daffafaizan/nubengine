      dietary advice encourages greater dietary behaviour change after 12 weeks compared with
      general population-based diet advice. Both groups will receive two prompts to remind them of
      their diet advice at weeks 4 and 8. Dietary change will be quantified from an 11-item diet
      quality score (DQS) suitable for Northern European populations that is calculated from the
      results of the eNutri food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and week 12. 98
      participants will be recruited per study arm and will be randomly allocated to an
      intervention arm using a minimisation technique integrated with the eNutri app.
