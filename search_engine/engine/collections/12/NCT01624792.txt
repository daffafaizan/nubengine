      acute net fractional muscle protein synthesis more in COPD patients as compared to healthy
      controls in response to a high quality protein supplement.

      Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that 3.5g/day EPA+DHA for 4 consecutive weeks induces
      a higher increase in net fractional muscle protein synthesis in response to a high quality
      protein supplement as compared to 2g/day EPA+DHA in COPD patients.

      Therefore, to answer the specific aims in this study only the COPD subjects will undergo a
      4-week intervention period.
