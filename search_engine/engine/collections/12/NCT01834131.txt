    
      Background: Although the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and
      antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and
      concomitant cardiovascular disease and premature death have been demonstrated in randomized
      controlled trials, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied in the general
      population, especially in low and middle income countries.

      Objectives: To test whether a comprehensive intervention program within a national public
      primary care system will improve hypertension control among uninsured hypertensive patients
      and their families in Argentina

      Design: Cluster randomized trial

      Study Participants: 1,890 study participants from 18 primary care clinics within a public
      primary care network in Argentina will be recruited. Patients with hypertension from the
      participating clinics, their spouses, and their adult hypertensive family members will be
      enrolled.

      Intervention: Nine clinics with approximately 945 participants will be randomly assigned to
      the comprehensive intervention group and 9 clinics with similar participants to the usual
      care group. The comprehensive intervention, including health care provider education, a
      home-based intervention among patients and their families (lifestyle modification and home
      blood pressure [BP] monitoring) delivered by community health workers, and a mobile health
      intervention, will last for 18 months.

      Outcomes: BP and other indicators will be measured at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18
      during follow-up using standard methods. The primary outcome is a net change in systolic
      (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to month 18 between the intervention and control
      groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of
      hypertensive patients with adequate BP control (BP<140/90 mmHg), cost-effectiveness of
      hypertension control, and net BP changes in normotensive participants.
