      10 in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase, refractory or relapsed acute
      leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Assess the possible antileukemia effect of this
      treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive dolastatin 10 intravenous (IV)
      bolus once every 3 weeks. Patients receive 2-12 courses of therapy in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the
      first cohort of 3 patients, subsequent cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of
      dolastatin 10. If DLT occurs in 2 of 3 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation
      ceases and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Patients are followed
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 25 patients within 8 months.
