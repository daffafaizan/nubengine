      and autonomic nerve responses to light this project aims to provide a new framework for
      diagnosing and monitoring treatment of light sensitivity. The patient's responses will be
      measured with videography facial muscle electrical responses Electromyogram (EMG) measured
      from surface skin electrodes and retinal electrical responses (EMG) or electroretinogram
      (ERG) recorded from a portable hand-held device). Simultaneously, patient's will have their
      heart rate and skin conductance objectively monitored using wristwatch devices (E4,
      Empatica). If successful, this will open an immediate new way to objectively assess the
      mechanisms that lead to light sensitivity, and provide an approach to effectively treat, and
      manage the symptoms of light sensitivity and headache from different causes, including
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and migraine.
