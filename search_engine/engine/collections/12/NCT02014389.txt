    
      Pupil light reflex (PLR) will be measured by a chromatic multifocal pupillometer in response
      to short and long wavelength light with small spot stimulus in 76 points of the 30 degree
      visual field.

      A computerized infrared video pupillometer will be used to record changes in pupil diameter
      in response to short- and long-wavelength stimuli (peak 485 nm and 620 nm, respectively)
      presented by 76 LEDs, 1.8mm spot size, at light intensities of 10-3000 cd/m2 and duration of
      1-3 sec at different points of the 30 degree visual field
