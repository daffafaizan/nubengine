      provide temporal resolution 83ms using mono-segmental reconstruction technique. The recent
      studies about the effect of heart rate on IQ of DSCT coronary angiography which concluded in
      adequate diagnostic IQ of dual-source CTCA without immediate pre-scanning heart rate control
      included chronic users of β-blocker focused on the influences of average heart rate, heart
      rate variability and coronary arterial calcifications on IQ. The effect of blooming artifact
      of calcification on IQ by far cannot be eliminated. Here, we investigate the effects of
      maximum heart rate, average heart rate, minimum heart rate and heart rate variability on the
      motion-related IQ of DSCT coronary angiography in patients without both pre-scanning heart
      rate control and chronic use of β-blocker agent, compared with that in chronic users of
      β-blocker agents.
