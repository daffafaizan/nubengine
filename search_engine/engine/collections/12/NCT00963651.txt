      images using a conventional x-ray tube and generator, a digital detector, and appropriate
      reconstruction software. It creates section images from a series of projection images
      acquired as the x-ray tube moves along a prescribed path. Because tomosynthesis can minimize
      the visual presence of overlying anatomy - the ribs, for example - it has the potential to
      improve the detection of lesions such as pulmonary nodules when compared with conventional
      chest radiography.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the use of VolumeRAD tomosynthesis, in
      addition to CxR, increases physician accuracy in the detection of lung nodules between 3mm
      and 20mm in diameter when compared to conventional posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral (LAT)
      chest radiography (CxR). This aim will be addressed by measuring free-response performance of
      experienced (with VolumeRAD), blinded expert readers' detection performance. Specifically, we
      will compare detection performance, as measured by the area under the alternative free
      response receiver operating characteristic (AFROC) curve, among readers viewing PA and LAT
      chest X-rays versus VolumeRAD tomosynthesis. The nodule will be the unit of analysis.
