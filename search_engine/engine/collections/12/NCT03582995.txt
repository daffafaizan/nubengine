      will be placed over the root and bone surface of the defect, covered with ADM GBR® and
      sutured using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle) with a Maxon
      5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle (Dodge et. al, 1998). The coronally positioned flap will be
      sutured separately and coronally positioned using a continuous sling suture technique
      (papilla to papilla sutures) with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle. In the test group, BX
      will be placed over the root and bone surface of the defect, covered with ADM GBR® and
      sutured together using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle) with a
      Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle. The coronally positioned tunnel will be sutured together
      and coronally positioned using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle)
      with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle.

      Post-operative instructions will be given to the patients along with prescriptions, in
      appropriate cases, for systemic doxycycline 100 mg once a day for 14 days; an
      anti-inflammatory agent (naproxen 375 mg q12h for 7 days); an analgesic
      (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325mg q6-8h prn pain); a steroid, Medrol dose pack, 21 tablets
      of 4 mg methylprednisolone; 6 tablets on day 1, 5 on day 2, decrease by 1/day until last
      tablet dose on day 6, or dexamethazone 1mg, 18 tablets, 3 tablets/day for 1st3 days, 2/day
      for the next 3 days, 1/day for the last 3 days (always taken in the morning).

      All patients will be seen at week 1 or 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24, at which time the final exam will
      be completed. Sutures will be removed between weeks 4-8, as indicated. Post-operative visits
      will consist of supragingival plaque removal and oral hygiene reinforcement. Any patient who
      develops any adverse reaction to the materials used or shows attachment loss ≥2.0 mm will be
      exited from the study and will receive the appropriate treatment.
