      in postprandial glucose metabolism and to determine how acute and chronic low-calorie
      sweetener (LCS) consumption may affect this signaling in people with obesity. The aims will
      determine the independent and combined contributions of pharmacological inhibition (Aim 1) or
      extra stimulation (Aim 2) of sweet taste signaling in the gut, mouth, or both on hormonal
      responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in two groups of subjects with obesity:
      habitual and non-habitual LCS consumers. Validated sensory evaluation techniques will also
      ascertain subjects' taste perception (Aim 3) to test the hypotheses that habitual consumption
      of LCS blunts perception of sweetness and, in turn, affects postprandial glucose regulation.
