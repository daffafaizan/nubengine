    
      Setting up a Custom Care Plan for patients with conditions requiring a transfusion followed ,
      which in its development provides a transfusion Care Custom Program .

      The establishment of an electronic transmission enables the regulation of all
      hospitalizations throughout the patient care pathway and reinforces the link city / hospital
      through the receipt of laboratory results and issuing information to the partners of the care
      network patient. The PPST will be transmitted by secure messaging.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of transfusion episodes where PPST is respected. The
      proportion of patients whose care meets the PPST for 3 successive transfusion episodes will
      also be estimated.

      The secondary endpoints are:

        -  The Patient satisfaction questionnaires (relative to the consideration of the results,
           the management procedures) in 3 successive transfusions.

        -  The Quality of life of the patient assessed by questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30 and EQ5D) at
           baseline and after 3 successive transfusion episodes.

        -  The Satisfaction surveys of the medical team at home and the service effector
           transfusion at baseline and after 3 successive transfusion episodes.

        -  The Response time for a hospitalization or consultation program on the study period.

        -  The Number of lost biological results.

        -  Evaluation of the descriptive use of hospitalization, consultation, biology.
