      pressures and stretching of the myocardium. The current literature contains limited and
      unreliable information regarding normal BNP values in pregnancy. After baseline
      echocardiogram to detect individuals with asymptomatic structural defects, the participants
      will submit to 3 blood draws during the second and third trimester and at delivery to
      determine normal pregnancy values.
