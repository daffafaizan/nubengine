      autoimmune diseases, JAK3 is an essential component of the immune signaling cascade. This
      cascade ultimately contributes to abnormal immune response that results in chronic
      inflammation and, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), irreversible damage to cartilage
      and bones. Selective inhibition of JAK3 offers a new disease modifying approach to the
      treatment of RA, and a broad range of other autoimmune diseases.
