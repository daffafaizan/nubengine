      days starting on cycle day 3. In the case of an absent response, doses were increased to 100
      and 150 mg daily in subsequent cycles. First ovulation with CC was used as the end
      point.Statistical methods Distribution of characteristics in patients is presented as the
      mean Â± SD. We used the Mann-Whitney U test for exploratory comparison of initial parameters
      between responders and nonresponders. The univariate and multivariate relation with response
      to CC was assessed using logistic regression analysis. Backward stepwise elimination was used
      for the multivariate logistic analysis of prediction of patients being CRA, and P < 0.10 was
      used as a cut-off level for elimination of non-significant predictors from the prognostic
      model. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to
      assess the discriminative ability of the logistic models. SPSS with statistical package
      version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and MedCalc Software version 12.4, (Ostend, Belgium) were
      employed for data analysis.
