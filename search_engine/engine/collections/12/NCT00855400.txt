      due to the continued loss of motoneurons that leads them to death in less than 5 years. No
      treatment has changed its natural history. Intraspinal injections of bone marrow mononuclear
      cells (MNC) have been able to ameliorate the course of ALS in murine models, acting as pumps
      of trophic factors that keep the motoneurons functional. We have designed a phase I/II
      clinical trial to check the feasibility of this approach in humans.
