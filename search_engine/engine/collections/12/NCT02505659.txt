      functional deficits which are difficult to overcome. To prevent from an unfavorable
      evolution, patients can either get a non-surgical treatment or an ACR surgery, which is very
      common. Knee functional performance level could impact on the postoperative outcome and it's
      of common knowledge that early re-education after an ACR rupture improves knee functioning.

      Patients with an ACR rupture enrolled in this study will be randomized either in an
      experimental group (with preoperative reeducation) or in a control group (without
      preoperative reeducation). Both groups will then have post-operative re-education (40
      sessions) based on HAS recommendations.

      The main aim of this study is to assess the impact of preoperative re-education on knee
      functional performance 4 month after surgical reconstruction of an ACR.

      Secondary aims are to determine the impact of the 4-week preoperative re-education on knee
      functional performance after an ACR rupture, before surgery and 7 months after surgery.

      Functional performance, muscular strength, proprioception and anterior knee laxity will be
      measured at inclusion (V0), 4-5 days before surgery (V1), 4 month (V4M) and 7 months (V7M)
      after surgery. Lysholme-Tegner scoring and IKDC2000 questionnaire will be added to the
      previous assessments.
