        -  a 12-week efficacy phase then,

        -  a 40-week safety extension phase.

      All eligible subjects received alfuzosin 0.2 mg/kg/day. The formulation and the frequency was
      assigned by Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) according to age group and ability to
      swallow tablets.

      Patients who completed the 12-week open-label treatment period were offered to continue in
      the 40-week open-label safety extension study. The treatment was the same as in the 12-week
      efficacy phase.

      All patients had a one-week follow-up period after the last dose intake.
