    
      This is a prospective, randomized clinical and radiographical evaluation of bone remodeling
      around implants with two different surfaces placed in a previously augmented crest.

      Patients requiring dental implants in previously horizontally augmented bone crest are
      recruited at the Department of PeriodonÂ¬tics, Faculty of dental medicine, Saint-Joseph
      University, Beirut, and will be treated with either T3 (contemporary hybrid collar), tapered,
      ex-hex, CP4 or Full Osseotite, tapered, ex-hex, CP4.

      A total of 30 implants will be placed (15 per group). Random allocation of implant type per
      site will be done by the sealed envelope method.

      The implants will be placed using a one-stage surgical approach. A final crown will be placed
      (screw-retained on multiunit abutment) between 3 and 4 months post-implant placement.

      The patients will be followed-up at 6 months and 1 year. Only patients meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and providing a dated and signed informed consent form will be
      enrolled in the study.
