      The device mainly distinguishes itself from commercial prostheses thanks to its new type of
      actuation providing a compact and energy efficient solution to the challenge of ankle-foot
      actuation. This new actuation method consists of using springs, a servo motor and a locking
      mechanism, coupled with a sensory network providing intelligence to the robotic device. The
      AMPfoot 4.0 design is also based on previous research conducted on the AMP-Foot 2. However,
      it is important to note that in contrast with its preceding designs, the AMP-Foot 4.0 does
      not provide active propulsion at push-off.

      During walking, the AMP-Foot 4.0 working principle is divided into two main logic sequences,
      i.e. the stance and the swing phase. These two phases are detected by analyzing gyroscope and
      acceleration measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit chip. During the stance phase,
      the ankle performs a dorsi-flexing movement while a plantar-flexing torque is applied at the
      ankle. The person's gravitational potential energy is stored into elastic potential energy by
      means of the used spring. It is this spring that provides the plantar-flexing torque required
      at the ankle as reaction to the movement of the user. Due to the use of a locking system, the
      prosthesis can adapt its so-called zero torque rest point depending on the slope or stride
      length of the user. This provides adaptability and therefore greater comfort compared to
      prostheses with a fixed zero torque rest point. During the swing phase, the locking mechanism
      unlocks to free the ankle movement. Parallel springs external to the stance system are then
      activated to reset the foot to its initial position. From that moment, the device is ready
      for a new step.
