      adolescence. Adolescents with current sub-threshold depression symptoms (not meeting criteria
      for major depression, 5 < symptoms including depressed mood, irritability or loss of
      pleasure), a personal history of a depressive episode in the past or with a family history of
      depressive disorders are at increased risk. Because most adolescents have regular contact
      with primary care physicians, the primary care clinics could provide a setting to disseminate
      evidence-based preventive approaches. We have developed a combined primary care/Web-based
      preventive intervention to reduce the risk of developing depressive disorders in adolescents
      and young adults by adapting interventions of demonstrated benefit in study settings to a
      primary care/Web-based format in collaboration with leading investigators in the field. The
      goal of this research program is to evaluate the feasibility and possible efficacy of an
      alternative delivery mechanism for evidence-based behavioral approaches to depression
      treatment and prevention that have already demonstrated benefit with face-to-face delivery in
      study settings. Each component this intervention will need to be carefully evaluated for
      acceptability, safety, feasibility and efficacy. The focus of this study is the primary care
      component.
