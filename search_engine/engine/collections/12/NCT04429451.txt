      in prostate tumor. Therefore, PSMA is a promising target for antigen-specific immunotherapy
      in patients with prostate cancer. However, it has been reported that PSMA expression is not
      restricted to prostate cancer and PSMA is often enriched in the tumor stromal environment. By
      immunostaining, we found that PSMA is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including brain
      tumor, neuroblastoma and some lymphoma tumor tissues.

      This study aims to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically
      modified to express PSMA-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR molecules enable
      the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells or tumor stromal tissues through the
      recognition of a surface antigen, PSMA. This study will evaluate the side effects and the
      best dose of anti-PSMA CAR-T cells to target PSMA positive tumors and tumor microenvironment.
