      a non-malignant hematologic disorder. We propose to use genomics, trancriptomics, proteomics
      and metabolomic analysis coupled with family linkage studies to identify causal mutations in
      individuals with undefined hematologic disorders and to characterize genetic modifiers of
      defined monogenic blood diseases.

      A detailed medical history will be obtained, including demographic information for each
      proband. For each identified biologically-related family member, a medical history
      questionnaire will be obtained. The family history and pedigree will be reviewed in
      conjunction with a geneticist/genetic counselor. The implications of genetic testing will be
      explained. If participants consent for future contact, this will take place annually for
      updates on medical and family history.

      All probands will provide peripheral blood samples, and probands who are undergoing a bone
      marrow aspirate/biopsy for clinical purposes will provide additional aspirates. Biological
      family members will provide peripheral blood samples as a source for DNA.
