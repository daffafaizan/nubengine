    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of in-hospital diagnosis and treatment of
      sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on post-discharge mortality and readmissions in-
      hospitalized patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The study is
      a randomized controlled trial in HFrEF patients who are hospitalized with acute heart failure
      syndrome (AHFS) and have an in-hospital sleep study diagnostic of SDB. Participants will be
      randomized to either the current standard of care of AHFS treatment or an intervention arm in
      which expedited treatment with adaptive servo ventilation is initiated immediately upon
      in-hospital diagnosis of SDB.
