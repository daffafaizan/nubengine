      this study is to see if incorporating mindfulness exercises prior to urodynamic studies (UDS)
      results in less pain, anxiety and discomfort.

      The participants will be guided through a mindfulness meditation exercise by a licensed
      professional. During this exercise participants will be asked to focus attention on
      breathing, physical sensations, and thoughts. This exercise will last for approximately 10
      minutes in which participants will not be asked to engage in any physical activity other than
      sitting and breathing. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment
      plans. Randomization is a process like flipping a coin and means the chance of being assigned
      to either of the plans. One treatment plan includes undergoing mindfulness exercises prior to
      your UDS evaluation. The other treatment plan includes simply undergoing the UDS evaluation.

      After the participants UDS evaluation, questions will be asked about the urodynamic
      procedure. The participants will be asked to answer questions on a UDS and anxiety
      questionnaire which pertain to emotional and physical experiences during the procedure.
