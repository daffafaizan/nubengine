      therapy for AMI. The use of sirolimus eluting stent (SES) is related to a reduction of the
      need for urgent target vessel revascularization (TVR). With current acquisition prices for
      abciximab and SES, replacing abciximab with tirofiban, administered as a single high-dose
      bolus (SHDB) regimen, is a promising strategy that would preserve financial resources. In a
      recent study the combination tirofiban and SES resulted to be associated to an overall lower
      major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) rate with respect to the abciximab plus BMS.
      However, since no conclusion can be drawn yet regarding the relative contribution of a
      specific GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor or a stent type with respect to the other, the combination of
      abciximab and SES may be associated to an even lower event rate with respect to SHDB
      tirofiban and SES, thus offsetting the higher initial cost.

      Comparison(s): four strategies (SHDB tirofiban + BMS, SHDB tirofiban + SES, abciximab + BMS,
      abciximab + SES) are compared to determine the possible gold standard treatment for
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in terms of efficacy and cost-efficacy.
