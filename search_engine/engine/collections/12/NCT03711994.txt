      world. In the United States the C/S rate in 1965 was 4.5% and increased to 30.5% in 2010.
      While the number of C/S has increased, pain management has primarily been via epidural,
      spinal, local and general anesthesia and narcotic medication for the immediate postpartum
      period (pp). This has lead to an increase in associated cost and problems with pain
      management. Limited studies have been performed to evaluate cold compresses on pain relief in
      the immediate pp and there potential to reduce cost. Cold Therapy (CT) is most often utilized
      in orthopedics, sports medicine, and in general surgery. CT has been used to improve range of
      motion (rom) and reduce pain medication utilization. We surmise CT may be useful in
      decreasing narcotic utilization after C/S, as well as improve mobility and allow for improved
      care of the newborn. This is significant as Erlanger Baroness Hospital (EBH) is becoming Baby
      Friendly (BF). This is a National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality (NICHQ) which
      desires having babies rooming in with their mothers and increasing breastfeeding rates. The
      goal of this study is to evaluate a newer sterile delivery system for decreasing pp pain via
      CT. This will be done as a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).
