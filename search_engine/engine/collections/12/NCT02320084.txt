      Orfadin treatment in patients suffering from hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. Orfadin will be
      used according to normal practice . There is an ongoing post-marketing surveillance (PMS)
      program to monitor hepatic, renal, hematological, neurological and ophthalmic status in all
      patients treated with Orfadin. The Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has
      required this program and have looked at the data for approximately 400 patients and found
      the benefit-risk ratio to be positive. The present study (PASS) will replace the ongoing PMS.
      The transition of countries will be gradual; starting in 2013.The study will include HT-1
      patients on Orfadin treatment in standard clinical care as well as newly diagnosed patients
      just starting with Orfadin treatment.
