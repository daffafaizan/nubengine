      safely be given with docetaxel and radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with
      cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. The docetaxel dose of 15 mg/m2/week,
      5-fluorouracil dose of 200 mg/m2/week, and 50.4 Gy of thoracic radiation has been found to be
      the recommended doses from our initial phase I trial (DMS D9724). The Phase I study has been
      modified in an attempt to improve the pathological complete response rate by increasing the
      5-fluorouracil exposure during thoracic radiation by replacing it with oral capecitabine.
      Capecitabine generates 5-fluorouracil selectively in tumor cells. This sequentially designed
      study of EUS staging, molecular analysis, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, concomitant chemotherapy
      and radiation, and surgical resection continues to expand our collaborative experience at
      Dartmouth Hitchcock in the treatment of cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal
      junction.
