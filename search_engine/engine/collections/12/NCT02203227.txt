      supplements (BioTurmin, BioTurmin-WD and MaQxan) will be investigated in chronic smokers
      having mild to moderate hyperlipidemia. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      the dietary supplements and placebo for 60 days. The efficacy of the supplements will be
      measured by estimating cotinine and malondialdehyde level.
