    
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of three dosage regimens of
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453) in 3 groups of 8 hypertensive patients.

      In each group, the study consisted of a 10-day multiple-dose period. Progression to the next
      dose level only occurred if the previous dose level was considered to be safe and well
      tolerated. An appropriate interval separated the investigation of doses to permit a timely
      review and evaluation of safety data prior to proceeding to a higher dose level.
