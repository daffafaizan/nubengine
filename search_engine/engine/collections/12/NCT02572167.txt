      combined with nivolumab. Patients will be treated for up to four 21-day cycles with
      brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg.

      There will be 3 parts to this study. In Part 1, the safety of combination treatment will be
      evaluated by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to expansion of enrollment to evaluate
      treatment effect in Part 2. Part 2 of the study will further characterize the safety and
      antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin combined with nivolumab by enrolling patients at
      the recommended dose schedule determined in Part 1. Part 3 of the study will evaluate the
      safety and antitumor activity of combination treatment administered at an alternate dosing
      schedule determined by cumulative safety and activity data from Parts 1 and 2.
