      analyze and improve their mobility, stability and posture through performance of movements
      and physical exercises. To verify the accuracy of this measure, the goal is to provide
      data-driven evidence regarding its accuracy in comparison to gold standard tests for
      measuring movement health. To address this challenge, the assessment scores will be
      benchmarked to a set of gold standard tests and sensor metrics for measuring movement health
      recommended by professional associations such as the American Physical Therapy Association
      (APTA) or American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) and found valid in clinical studies , .
