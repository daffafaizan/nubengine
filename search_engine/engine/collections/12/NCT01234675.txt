      defined as a feeling of light sleep, independent of duration, and as non-refreshing. As such,
      these patients wake up in the morning and complain of stiffness and overall aching of the
      body.

      It is well known that reciprocal relationship exists between sleep and pain, with sleep
      disturbances being an important contributor to morbidity in fibromyalgia. Milnacipran, a
      selective serotonin norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRI), was approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of fibromyalgia. Although milnacipran has
      extensively been studied in fibromyalgia patients, but there is no objective measure, i.e.,
      the use of overnight polysomnography, to determine its effects on sleep.

      The study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of milnacipran on PSG determined measures of
      sleep in patients with fibromyalgia. The study also evaluated the impact of milnacipran on
      subjective measures of sleep and fibromyalgia symptoms.
