      represents a number 1 public health concern. Omacor®/Lovaza® is an effective, and very safe
      mix of PO-3A, and the drug is currently approved by the Federal authorities for the drug
      management of post-infarction patients with high blood triglycerides. Despite significant
      progress in the prevention and treatment of vascular disease in the Western World in the past
      two decades, national statistics indicate that the incidence and prevalence of heart disease
      has been increasing steadily. Given the growing length of CAD progression, it is pertinent
      that many more patients will yield extra benefit from Lovaza® on top of aggressive
      antiplatelet regimens and statin due to severity of their vascular disease. Therefore, mild
      antiplatelet properties of PO-3A will be a highly desirable and attractive commodity of this
      medication.

      We believe that Omacor®/Lovaza® is ideally positioned for the chronic management of CAD as a
      safe, efficient, and "gentle" agent with no harmful interactions with statins or aspirin.
      Also considering low clinical incidence of aspirin-induced interactions with other classes of
      drugs, Lovaza® may fit nicely into a standard cocktail for diabetes, hypertension,
      depression, arrhythmias, and heart failure management of CAD patients, which will expand the
      drug utilization. However, platelet-related effects of Lovaza® on top of aspirin and statin
      in patients with stable coronary disease are not known, but may be important due to the high
      incidence of aspirin resistance and heavy burden of thrombin activation in such patients. We
      have a large pool of patients with documented CAD (300-350/annum), and we will be able to
      enroll relatively large amount of quality patients fast.
