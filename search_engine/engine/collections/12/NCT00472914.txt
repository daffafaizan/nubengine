      Qualitative surface EMG measurement during passive movement will increase the inter-rater
      reliability of clinicians for diagnosis of spasticity and dystonia in children with
      hypertonia.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Develop a handheld surface EMG device with auditory output that can be used similarly to
           a stethoscope to listen non-invasively to the activity of muscles.

        2. Provide clinicians at 5 different institutions with a device to test for 2 months in
           their own clinics.

        3. Bring all 5 clinicians to Stanford University for a single-day exercise in which each
           clinician will examine 10 children with hypertonia. Each clinician will rate the
           children without using the device, and then again with the device. Intra-class
           correlations and kappa statistics will be used to assess whether the use of the device
           leads to improved inter-rater reliability.
