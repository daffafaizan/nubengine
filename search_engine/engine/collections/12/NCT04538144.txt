      to any other age group. It is important to note that such deaths are primarily
      cardiovascular, not hyperthermia itself, in origin. Nevertheless, we know relatively little
      about the effects of aging on cardiovascular function during actual heat wave-like
      conditions. The central hypothesis of this work is that the elderly exhibit greater
      cardiovascular stress during heat wave conditions. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
      recognized impairments in thermoregulatory capacity in the elderly will culminate in
      heightened cardiovascular stress during prolonged exposure to heat wave conditions.
      Comprehensive cardiovascular and thermal responses in the elderly, relative to younger
      adults, will be evaluated during exposure to two prolonged heat wave conditions: hot and
      humid (replicating the 1995 Chicago heat wave), very hot and dry (replicating the 2018 Los
      Angeles heat wave). The expected outcome from this body of work will re-shape our
      understanding of the consequences of aging on cardiovascular function during heat waves
