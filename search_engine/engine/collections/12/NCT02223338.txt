      antibiotics used after injections when compared to the bacteria found in untreated eyes.
      However, no study published to date compares resistance rates in eyes where an iodine-based
      preparation is used, which is standard of care, to those in which an antibiotic is also given
      after the injection in a single practice setting. This is an important issue, because
      resistant bacteria can cause infections that are more damaging and difficult to treat than
      non-resistant bacteria. Moreover, previous studies have focused on the emergence of
      resistance to fourth generation fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin,
      though use of second generation fluoroquinolones is still practiced in the United States by
      some retina specialists, including at the investigators institution. Currently in the United
      States, 81% of retina specialists give antibiotics after eye injections, although the results
      of several large studies suggest that this practice does not reduce rates of endophthalmitis
      compared with use of iodine alone.
