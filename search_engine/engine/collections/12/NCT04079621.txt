      infection due to reactivation of dormant liver stages. Recurrent infections can be associated
      with a febrile illness, cumulative risk of severe anaemia, direct and indirect mortality, and
      are the most important source of onward transmission of the parasite.

      In co-endemic areas, there is a very high risk (up to 50%) of patients representing with
      P.vivax malaria following treatment of P falciparum. Hence, in co-endemic regions there is a
      strong rationale for eradicating P.vivax hypnozoites from the liver in patients presenting
      with uncomplicated P. falciparum infections.

      The recently completed multicentre IMPROV study compared the efficacy of a 7 day PQ regimen
      (1.0mg/kg/day for 7 days) with a 14 day regimen (0.5mg/kg/day for 14 days). The 7 day PQ
      regimen was non-inferior to the 14 day regimen and 5 times more efficacious at reducing
      P.vivax recurrence than the control.

      This study is designed as a multicentre randomized, open label trial to assess the safety and
      efficacy of a low dose short course PQ treatment (3.5mg/kg total dose given over 7 days) in
      G6PD normal patients with P.vivax and P falciparum to reduce the risk of subsequent P.vivax
      episodes.
