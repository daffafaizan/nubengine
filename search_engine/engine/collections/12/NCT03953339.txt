    
      On the basis of preoperative electromyography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENG), the
      investigators would like to determine the frequency of suprascapular neuropathy in ruptures
      of supra- and / or infraspinatus tendons and the risk factors for their presence.

      In a ruptured rotator cuff, the muscle is partly retracted so much that the innervating nerve
      (suprascapular nerve) is stretched and has pathological neurological findings. The
      Investigators now want to analyze how the arthroscopic reconstruction of the nasal
      suprascapular nerve affects the pre-operative neuropathy. Does the pre-existing nerve recover
      by decompression (liberation) from surrounding / entangling tissue or does decompression have
      no influence on measurable neurology? Other patients with rotator cuff ruptures have normal
      neurological findings preoperatively despite severe retraction of the muscular / tendon unit.
      In these cases, the investigators are interested in whether the mobilization and
      reconstruction of the torn muscle / tendon unit leads to a neurologically measurable
      elongation of the nerve. This nerve stretching is a possible explanation for protracted
      postoperative pain. With the postoperative electrophysiological measurements we can quantify
      this nerve change.

      The comparison between preoperative and postoperative neurology findings allows confirmation
      or refutation of our hypothesis.
