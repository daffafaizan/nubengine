      HIV-infected individuals after discharge from University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Internal
      Medicine wards which can inform development of a linkage intervention. Our central hypothesis
      is that in Sub-Saharan African settings like Zambia hospitalizations among HIV-infected
      individuals are driven by suboptimal linkage and initiation of ART following HIV diagnosis.
      Specific Aims: (a) Characterize the distribution of hospitalized 300 HIV-infected adults
      across the HIV care continuum. (b) Identify structural, psychosocial, clinic, and medical
      factors that predict suboptimal linkage to care and ART initiation after 90 days of hospital
      discharge among HIV-infected Zambians.
