    
      This is a Phase IV, post-approval, multicenter, prospective, noninterventional study of
      consecutive patients with a working diagnosis of NSTEMI (Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction) and treatment with an OAP (Oral Anti-Platelet) agent (ticagrelor, clopidogrel, or
      prasugrel) either in the ED (Emergency Department), or in any case within the timeframe that
      emergency physicians consider to be "upstream"- i.e., within the first 72 hours after ED
      arrival and at least 4 hours before diagnostic angiography. This registry is designed to
      address the data gap regarding the course of NSTEMI between ED arrival and diagnostic
      angiography in detail, by characterizing and following the ED and peri-ED use of advanced OAP
      agents.

      Demographic, ischemic vs bleeding risk stratification [calculated retrospectively by GRACE
      (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and
      PURSUIT (Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using
      Integrilin) scores, and CRUSADE (Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients
      Suppress ADverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines) Bleeding
      Score, respectively], and OAP agent data (including, when discernible, rationale for agent
      selection) will be collected for all UPSTREAM patients, regardless of OAP therapy, through
      discharge. Risk factors, angiography results, intervention/s (if any), post-catheterization
      care, discharge regimens, and in-hospital outcomes will be recorded.

      Patients who are treated upstream, in-hospital, and are discharged home on ticagrelor, will
      be further followed up, by telephone and/or chart review (if necessary elements are included
      in chart accessible to investigator), at 30 (+10) days post-discharge, during which
      evaluation data elements to be collected include patient-reported compliance with visits and
      medications, patient-reported healthcare resource utilization, and any pertinent events or
      complications.

      Patients who are treated upstream, in-hospital, or discharged home on a different OAP therapy
      (clopidogrel or prasugrel) will not be followed beyond the data collection completed at
      hospital discharge. It is expected that a relatively small number of patients will change
      therapy from ticagrelor to another OAP agent after discharge and prior to 30 days
      post-discharge, though such changes will be queried in the 30-day call/chart review.
