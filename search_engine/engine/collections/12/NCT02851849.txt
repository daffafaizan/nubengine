    
      This will be a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel group,
      multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LGD-6972 in subjects with T2DM
      inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (a stable [≥12 weeks], daily dose of ≥1000mg
      at randomization). Subjects with T2DM will be treated with one of 3 dose levels of LGD-6972
      (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo once daily (QD) for 12 weeks. Randomization will be
      stratified by HbAlc ≤8.5% or >8.5% at the Placebo Lead-in Visit.

      Qualified subjects who require adjustment or stabilization of their metformin dose will
      participate in a run-in period of up to 12 additional weeks prior to randomization. Subjects
      will have the option to participate in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and
      end of treatment for assessment of exploratory endpoints.
