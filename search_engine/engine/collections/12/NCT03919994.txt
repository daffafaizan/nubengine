    
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, multi-center observational cohort study. Patients
      at behavioral health clinics will be enrolled and evaluated by health care professionals
      (e.g., psychiatrists) according to the standard of care. All patients will be followed for
      approximately 12 months from their enrollment visit.
