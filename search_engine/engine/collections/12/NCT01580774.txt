      filled with uncertainty and potential for harm. For instance, 1 in 5 discharges results in a
      post discharge adverse event, many of which are related to medication errors. These may lead
      to serious harm and possibly require readmission to hospital. Telephone follow-up calls after
      discharge has been studied in small single-center trials and as a part of a coordinated,
      multi-layered discharge process but its direct effectiveness is not known. Understanding the
      impact of this simple intervention on patient outcomes is an important step towards improving
      patients' discharge from hospital.
