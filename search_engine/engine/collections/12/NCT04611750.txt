    
      This is a responder-enriched randomized placebo-controlled 2-period crossover study composed
      of two sequential parts. The first part of the study is a 7-day outpatient run-in period to
      identify participants who experience symptomatic improvement of SDB symptoms (i.e.
      "responders") with QHS dosing of AD036. Responders will continue in the study and
      non-responders will be discontinued.

      The second part of the study is a 2-period double-blind crossover phase. Each crossover
      period will consist of 14 days of QHS dosing of either AD036 or placebo, with a washout
      period of 7 days between each period.

      Polysomnography will be performed at screening (baseline) and on the last dosing day of each
      of the two crossover dosing period.

      The trial will enroll participants until a total of 24 responders are randomized into the
      crossover portion of the study.
