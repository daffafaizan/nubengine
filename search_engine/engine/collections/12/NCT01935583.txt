      traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors is needed. Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)
      researchers have had considerable success in the past several decades developing and
      evaluating interventions for neurobehavioral, cognitive, and vocational challenges after TBI.
      Researchers have demonstrated the utility of the curriculum-based (C-B) treatment structure
      in various settings. Additionally, the efficacy of the C-B structure, independent of
      postinjury timeframe, allows the flexibility necessary to address the unique consequences of
      TBI.

      The C-B treatment modality offers a promising strategy for the promotion of resilience
      postinjury. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a structured,
      curriculum-based intervention to promote postinjury resilience and adjustment. Objectives
      include:

        1. to evaluate the short and longer-term efficacy of a structured outpatient intervention
           program (The Resilience and Adjustment Intervention, RAI) to improve survivors'
           resilience

        2. to evaluate the impact of treatment on emotional well-being and postinjury adjustment

        3. to evaluate the impact of the intervention on abilities including problem solving,
           communication, and stress management

        4. to examine the extent to which treatment benefits are sustained in the longer-term
