      decrease protein excretion in urine. Only 30% of children with FSGS achieve complete
      remission with steroids and other 30-40% patients experience remission (partial and complete)
      with cytotoxic immunosuppressant drugs. Even with these treatments, many patients eventually
      still require dialysis. Other treatment strategy doesn't exceed beyond symptomatic treatment
      and delaying the progression. Also risk of recurrence after kidney transplantation is 20-50%.

      Cell therapy is one of the treatment strategies and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one
      modality that notice in glomerulus disease.

      We will evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of allogeneic AD-MSC
      (adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 5 refractory INS patients.They will be followed
      1, 2, 4 weeks and then monthly until a year following injection day.
