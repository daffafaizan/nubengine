      I. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of VEGF Trap in patients with temozolomide-resistant
      malignant gliomas at first recurrence as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. Determine the safety profile of VEGF Trap in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of this regimen as measured by radiographic response, PFS, time to
      progression, and overall survival.

      II. Characterize the single-dose and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of VEGF Trap in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (glioblastoma vs anaplastic glioma).

      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
