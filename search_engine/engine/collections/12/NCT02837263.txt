      ablative radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). This study
      will examine the sequential combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and
      pembrolizumab for patients for whom the goal is eradicating all known sites of disease. It is
      very likely that for many patients the SBRT therapy will be completed following other
      modalities including operative resection or ablation.
