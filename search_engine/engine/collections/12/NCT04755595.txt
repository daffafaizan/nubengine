    
      This is a single-center, prospective, rater-blinded, pilot study to evaluate patient
      satisfaction with facial aesthetic treatment using a combination of botulinum toxin and
      dermal fillers. The three types of injectables are Botox Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA),
      Juvéderm Voluma XC (hyaluronic acid gel filler), and Juvéderm Volbella XC (hyaluronic acid
      gel filler). Twenty individuals who belong to the millennial generation (i.e., born between
      January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1996)1 and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Study
      participants will receive all three injectables during a single procedure, with an optional
      touch-up treatment at 2 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change in satisfaction after
      facial aesthetic treatment, using the FACE-Q Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall
      Scale. Other outcome measures include various FACE-Q Aesthetic scales, digital skin imaging
      analysis, photographs, and rater-blinded clinical assessment using the Global Aesthetic
      Improvement Scale (GAIS).
