      have been previously infected with M. tuberculosis. Whilst they are sensitive and specific,
      they cannot be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for LTBI. New blood tests
      ("fourth generation Quantiferon tests") give a more complete measurement of the workings of
      the immune system, which may be useful to show whether treatment is working. These new tests
      have not yet been evaluated in clinical practice, so their usefulness in identifying people
      at highest risk of TB disease and monitoring treatment is unknown.

      Mass gatherings, such as the annual Hajj pilgrimage, may encourage the spread of infectious
      diseases, including respiratory infections such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,
      and possibly also tuberculosis. However, the risk of TB infection during the Hajj has not
      been reliably measured. It is important to measure this risk so that pilgrims can be given
      suitable advice about preventing infection.
