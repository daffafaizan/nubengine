      preventive interventions are needed, particularly for low-income, inner-city populations.
      This study will determine the effectiveness of a theoretically based peer outreach program in
      preventing HIV and STD transmission among adults in the Baltimore, Maryland area.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a network-oriented peer program
      emphasizing one's social identity and the goals of protecting one's family and community or
      group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The peer program will also train participants to
      provide HIV/STD education to their peers. Participants will be assessed at study entry and
      during several subsequent follow-up visits. At these study visits, participants will complete
      questionnaires about their sexual health knowledge and sexual behaviors. Participants and
      members of their peer network will have follow-up visits at Months 6, 12, and 18.
