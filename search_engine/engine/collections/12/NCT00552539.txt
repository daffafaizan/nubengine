    
      A randomized four-group intervention-control Solomon design was implemented with Group 1
      participants receiving a pre-test survey, the educational video intervention, and a post-test
      survey; Group 2 the pre-test and post-test surveys; Group 3 the video intervention and a
      post-test survey; and Group 4 the post-test survey. This design was selected to assess the
      effect of the video in increasing syphilis knowledge while controlling for the influence of
      the pre-test instrument in potentially sensitizing participants to key facts. A
      computer-generated randomization list was created and used to assign patients to groups.
