      bevacizumab alone on a patient's brain tumor. The vaccine is called heat shock protein
      peptide complex 96 (HSPPC-96). HSPPC-96 is experimental. Specifically, HSPPC-96 is a protein
      that may work to help the body have a response against remaining brain tumor cells.
      Bevacizumab has been approved by the Food and Drug administration for treating brain tumors
      that grow back. In this study, patients will either get HSPPC-96 vaccine at the same time as
      bevacizumab, HSPPC vaccine first and then bevacizumab if the tumor comes back, or bevacizumab
      alone. The use of HSPPC-96 and bevacizumab is investigational.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is an overall survival
      advantage of HSPPC-96 administered with bevacizumab, given concomitantly or at the point of
      progression, in comparison with bevacizumab alone in patients with surgically resectable
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab

        2. to evaluate the progression free survival of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab, given
           concomitantly or at the point of progression.

      Patients must undergo surgery within 28 days from pre-registration. There must be
      confirmation of adequacy of tissue for vaccine manufacture, tumor tissue submitted to Agenus,
      confirmation of â‰¥ 90% resection by central radiology review and vaccine manufacture of at
      least six vials. Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms. Please see the
      "Arms" section for more details.

      Patients will be monitored approximately 5 years post-surgery.
