      phase II, open label, exploratory study to investigate the potential efficacy of FDA approved
      dupilumab in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic hepatic pruritus.
      Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified
      subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been
      obtained, baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up
      for the next 20 weeks. A final visit will be needed for evaluation and questionnaire
      completion.
