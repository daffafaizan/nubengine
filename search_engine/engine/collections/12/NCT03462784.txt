    
      Thalassemia is the most common monogenic disorder in the world .Thalassemia major
      (beta-thalassemia) affects a significant segment of the population in certain areas of the
      world. Alterations in migration patterns have changed the geographic distribution of this
      disease and made it a worldwide health problem with a high frequency in Africa, India,
      Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean area.

      The combination of transfusion and chelation therapy has dramatically extended the life
      expectancy of these patients, thus transforming thalassemia from a rapidly fatal disease of
      childhood to a chronic illness compatible with a prolonged life. On the other hand, frequent
      blood transfusions leading to iron overload and the chronic nature of the disease have
      contributed to a whole new spectrum of complications in adolescents and young adults
      suffering from thalassemia major.

      Complications associated with beta thalassemia, aside from the aforementioned anemia, are as
      follows

        -  Extramedullary hematopoiesis

        -  Asplenia secondary to splenectomy

        -  Medical complications from long-term transfusional therapy - Iron overload and
           transfusion-associated infections (eg, hepatitis) Increased risk for infections
           resulting from asplenia (eg, encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus) or from iron
           overload (eg, Yersinia species))

        -  Cholelithiasis (eg, bilirubin stones) Study of the prevelance and risk fators
           responsible for thalassemia complication can help in adopting appropriating strategies
           for management of these complication.
