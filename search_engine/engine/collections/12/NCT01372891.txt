      intervention (PCI). CIN is responsible for approximately genic renal insufficiency and is the
      third cause of hospital-acquired renal failure and the injury of endothelial of renal tubule
      is responsible for the CIN. However markers reliably identifying CIN in the patients
      undergoing PCI are rare. Adiponectin is a 30-kDa adipocyte-derived vasoactive peptide closely
      linked to components of the metabolic syndrome. Recent study demonstrates that the
      quantification of urinary adiponectin excretion appears to be an independent indicator of
      vascular damage potentially identifying an increased risk for vascular events. Therefore, the
      investigators presume that the adiponectin excretion may predict the incidence of the CIN.
      The present study is to determine the ability of urinary total adiponectin and its isoforms
      excretion in the prediction of CIN in the patients undergoing PCI.
