      the "Oncological Network of Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta" and the Clinical Epidemiology Unit of
      CPO Piemonte between 2015 and 2020. Women with EOC, and the center where they have been
      treated for the tumor, will be identified by linking the databases of the "Oncological
      Network of Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta" with those of the "Prevenzione Serena" project.

      A few clinical information from EOC patients will be collected by clinical investigators at
      each center using an electronic case report form (e-CRF) developed at the Mario Negri
      Institute. These information will include age, date of diagnosis, histological subtype and
      grading, tumor stage according to FIGO 2014 classification2,3, previous gynecologic
      conditions and surgical operations, date of Pap Test collection, and Pap Test cytological
      reports. Participants' data will be identified by a unique patient code.
