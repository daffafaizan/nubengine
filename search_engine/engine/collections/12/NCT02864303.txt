      To minimize the circadian effects, saliva specimens were all collected between 9:00 and 11:00
      a.m. Prior to the sampling procedure, participants rinsed out their mouths three times with
      water. To induce salivary production, patients were asked to chew neutral or citric acid
      impregnated Salivette cotton swabs for exactly 60 seconds. Saliva specimens were centrifuged
      for 2 minutes at a rate of 1000 g to yield clear saliva, which was aliquoted into 500 µL
      samples in LoBind tubes and stored at -80°C before being analyzed.

      Design of the study

      Saliva sampling will be performed at V0 (M0), V1 (M12) and V2 (M24). Blood sampling will take
      place also in V1 (M12). The cases and the controls will be systematically reviewed 12 months
      after inclusion with a new saliva collection and a cognitive assessment (for cases and
      controls).

      Amyloid peptide quantification

      Levels of human endogenous Aβ40 and Aβ42 in saliva and human plasma samples are determined
      with human specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Biosource International,
      Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of saliva and
      plasma samples were added in triplicate to the microtiter wells. Detection limit of the assay
      was 6 pg/ml for Aβ40 and 1 pg/ml for Aβ42.
