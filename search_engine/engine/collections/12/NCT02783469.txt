      patients in the Tayside region. Its aim is to improve diabetes care over and above existing
      practices. Participants are invited to attend to provide blood samples for DNA/RNA analysis,
      provide baseline anthropometric, biochemical, blood pressure and heart rate measurements as
      well as completing a lifestyle questionnaire containing smoking, menopausal and physical
      activity items. Consent is also obtained to allow anonymous linkage to electronic medical
      records (EMR) through use of the Community Health Index (CHI) number, a unique patient
      identifier that is issued to everyone registered with a general practitioner in Scotland.
      GoDARTS is the first EMR linked cohort in the world and provides access to individual
      participant longitudinal data including biochemical, comorbidity and prescription records.
      These are live databases and are constantly being updated. This allows for the study of
      genetic factors influencing T2D, its comorbidities and response to therapy. Consent has also
      been obtained for re-contact by collaborators, allowing for further studies of related
      phenotypes to take place. One of these studies is DOLORisk Dundee which aims to identify
      genetic and environmental risk factors for neuropathic pain.
