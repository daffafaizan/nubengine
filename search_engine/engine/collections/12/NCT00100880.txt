      I. To estimate the MTD of oral CC-5013 administered to children with recurrent or refractory
      primary CNS tumors once daily for 21 days of a 28 day course.

      II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose-limiting toxicity of CC-5013 in
      children with recurrent or refractory primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of CC-5013 in children and adolescents. II. To
      characterize the pharmacogenetics of CC-5013 in children and adolescents.

      III. To evaluate changes in circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating endothelial
      cell precursors (CEPs) in patients treated with CC-5013, and to investigate the correlation
      between changes in CECs and CEPs, plasma, serum and urine levels of proteins associated with
      angiogenesis including thrombospondin, b-FGF, TNF-Î±, IL-12, IL-8 and VEGF, and correlate
      these changes with changes in MR perfusion and clinical outcome.

      IV. To evaluate changes in MR perfusion and diffusion during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 2-3 patients receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which an estimated 25% of
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      All patients are followed for at least 30 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. Patients
      with treatment-related toxicity are followed for up to 3 months.
