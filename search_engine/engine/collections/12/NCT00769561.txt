      treatment for temporomandibular disorders using a randomized controlled design. 100 patients
      suffering from chronic temporomandibular disorder are diagnosed using Research Diagnostic
      Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Subsequently, patients are randomly
      assigned to either a psychological intervention receiving 8 sessions of biofeedback-based
      cognitive behavioral treatment or to a dental intervention receiving interocclusal splint
      therapy.

      Assessment takes place at baseline, after treatment approximately 8 weeks later, 3 and 6
      months follow up. The effects of the interventions are evaluated in terms of reduction in
      pain intensity, pain related disability, psychological variables such as somatoform symptoms,
      depression and pain related cognitive adjustment as well as nocturnal electromyographic (EMG)
      activity.

      Additionally, the study aims at identifying variables that predict treatment outcome. Further
      analyses include initial changes in treatment motivation and illness perceptions and its
      influence on treatment success, as well as changes in psychophysiological stress reactivity
      through treatment.
