      different porridges in randomized order. Blood samples will be collected over 2 hours after
      ingestion of test meals and 2 hours after ingestion of a standard second lunch meal served 4
      hours after the test meals. The amount of porridge and the standard lunch are equivalent to
      50 g available carbohydrate. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for determination of
      subjective satiety feeling and measurements of breath hydrogen will be used as a marker for
      colon fermentation.
