      and no treatment), parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score
      of the two selected test teeth) study, in healthy participants with at least two sensitive
      teeth that meet all the criteria at the screening and the baseline pre-treatment visit.
      Participants were screened for study suitability at screening visit (Visit 1). At Visit 2
      (baseline; pre-treatment) 2 non-adjacent accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars) in
      different quadrants of the mouth and separated by at least 2 teeth (or equivalent edentulous
      space) were identified that demonstrated signs of sensitivity as measured by a qualifying
      tactile stimulus (Yeaple ≤ 20 gram [g]) and evaporative air assessment (Schiff sensitivity
      score ≥ 2) on the facial/cervical (ie, labial/buccal) tooth surface. Once the 2 test teeth
      were selected, the subjects were stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of
      the 2 selected test teeth) and randomized to treatment or no treatment. DH was assessed at
      baseline (pre-treatment), and 10mins, 2 & 4 hours post-treatment.
