      bullying is the most common form of bullying. Treating bullying during childhood could reduce
      immediate and long-term health consequences, but there are no established individual-level
      treatments for weight-related bullying despite recommendations that they could improve
      children's health. This study will develop and test a new treatment for adolescent girls
      (11-17 years old) who have experienced bullying due to weight. The treatment will address
      traumatic stress and potentially co-occurring or developing problems with unhealthy
      weight-control behaviors, disordered eating, and weight. The treatment will be conducted via
      audio/video telehealth to increase accessibility and is therefore available to anyone in the
      United States who meets eligibility criteria.
