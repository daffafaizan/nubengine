    
      The investigators will recruit 20 normal weight, active men and 80 obese, inactive men to
      compare their sperm epigenome at their baseline state.

      The investigators will randomize the 80 obese, inactive men to intervention or no
      intervention for 12 weeks:1) observation with clinic visits; 2) low fat/low caloric diet; 3)
      supervised periodized strength and endurance training; and 4) low fat/ low caloric diet plus
      exercise training. The investigators will compare changes in their sperm epigenome within
      each group before and after intervention, between groups after intervention including the
      non-obese,active men at baseline.

      The investigators will follow the 80 men in the intervention groups and re-examined their
      sperm epigenome at 12 weeks and then another 24 weeks after cessation of treatment.
