      offices. The selection of this group of physicians resides on the fact that orthopedic
      surgeons working in private offices hold more than 60% of osteoporosis prescriptions in
      Greece.

      Each physician will fill once a questionnaire regarding the parameters affecting his/her
      choice of osteoporosis treatment before entering any patient in the study. Following the
      completion of the questionnaire every physician will recruit up to 10 patients in the study
      who are eligible for osteoanabolic treatment (teriparatide) according to standard medical
      practice and the Greek osteoporosis treatment guidelines.

      Each patient will receive teriparatide up to 24 months while he/she will fill the Greek EQ5D
      questionnaire on months: 0,12,24 or at early discontinuation. Adherence to treatment will be
      evaluated at the same time points as well as on monthly telephone interviews.

      Both the adherence to treatment and the possible alteration of patients' quality of life
      (evaluated through the EQ5D questionnaire) during the study will be correlated with the
      parameters affecting the initial therapeutic decision of the physician
