      percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) in participants undergoing laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG).

      This prospective cohort study will evaluate obese participants undergoing LSG. Demographic
      data of the participants and blood glucose level, monocyte count and lipid parameters
      baseline and at 6 months after surgery will record. The MHR baseline and at 6 months after
      surgery and the %EWL at 6 months after surgery will calculate. The participants will be
      divide into two groups as participants with %EWL of <50 and patients with a %EWL of â‰¥50. The
      parameters will compare between the two groups.
