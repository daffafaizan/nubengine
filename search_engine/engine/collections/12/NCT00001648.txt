    
      Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes genital, orolabial, or cutaneous lesions, keratitis, and
      encephalitis. Recently cellular receptors for HSV were isolated. The purpose of this study is
      to identify polymorphisms in the sequence of HSV receptor, cytokines or chemokines and to
      determine whether these polymorphisms correlate with susceptibility to infection by HSV or
      with symptoms of HSV. Blood samples from individuals who are seronegative, or seropositive
      (with or without symptoms of infection) for HSV-2 will be analyzed to determine the sequences
      of the HSV receptors, cytokines, chemokines, or related proteins. If a new genetic
      polymorphism is found, additional blood samples from individuals who are seropositive for HSV
      and from random blood donors will be analyzed to determine the frequency of the polymorphisms
      in seropositives and in the general population. Knowledge gained from this study should
      provide important insights into mechanisms of infection by HSV and may lead to novel
      therapies to block infection.
