      been part of medical practice for more than 50 years. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)
      is becoming more widely available and has seen a greater than three-fold increase in use in
      men 40 years and older. Current delivery systems of TRT include transdermal gels and patches,
      intranasal gels (currently marketed as Natesto), injection therapy, and long acting
      subcutaneous pellets.

      Natesto is a short-acting formulation of testosterone delivered intranasally to men diagnosed
      with low T. This has the potential to avoid side effects related to TRT that are commonly
      seen with other delivery methods, namely polycythemia, acne, male-pattern hair loss,
      azoospermia and hyperestrogenemia.

      Testosterone Cypionate injections are the most common form of TRT in the USA. Testosterone
      Cypionate has many reported side effects, the most common being polycythemia, gynecomastia,
      hair loss, acne, decreased spermatogenesis, and testicular atrophy. In a multicenter
      retrospective study, it has been shown that the prevalence of polycythemia in men on
      testosterone replacement (injections) was 11.2%. In this study, we will compare hematocrit
      changes caused by treatment with Testosterone Cypionate and Natesto in a parallel arm,
      randomized study. To date, there have been no direct head-to-haed comparisons of these
      formulations.

      We hypothesize that the short-acting pharmacokinetics of Natesto more closely resembles the
      natural pulsatility of testosterone and therefore can avoid side effects traditionally seen
      in long-acting, exogenous testosterone formulations
