      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug combination works in
      treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      Because AMD3100 and Pembrolizumab have not been administered together to individuals before,
      there will be a Run-In phase prior to the beginning of Phase II. This Run-In Phase is
      designed to identify what dosing schedule is best for participants on this study.
      Participants will be participating in the Run-In Phase.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pembrolizumab as a treatment option
      for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved AMD3100 as a treatment option for this disease, however it has
      approved the drug for use in individuals who have recently had bone marrow transplants.

      Pembrolizumab is thought to block a receptor called PD-1. This receptor usually acts as a
      "brake" to prevent the body's immune system from attacking cancer cells. The antibody
      "removes the brake" to allow parts of the body's immune system (usually T cells) to attack
      the tumor

      AMD3100 is a drug that inhibits CXCR4, which is a biological mechanism called a chemokine.
      CXCR4 is over-expressed in cancer cells and promotes cancer cell growth, spread, and survival
      and controls immune cell trafficking. Researchers believe that inhibiting CXCR4 expels the
      immune-suppressive cells out of the tumor and attract the cancer-killing immune cells into
      the tumor environment so that the body's immune system may be able to better attack the
      cancer cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are assessing the safety and effectiveness of
      AMD3100 and pembrolizumab in participants with aggressive head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma.
