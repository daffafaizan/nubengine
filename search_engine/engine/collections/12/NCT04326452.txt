      promotes positive expiratory airway pressures with the potential to enhance respiratory
      function while preventing and reversing atelectasis and hypoxia. The purpose of this study is
      to compare the use of our bidirectional oxygenation mouthpiece with conventional oxygen
      support versus conventional oxygen support of any Person Under Investigation for infection by
      the COVID-19 virus.
