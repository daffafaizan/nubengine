      the Human genetic material, the Multiple Sclerosis associated RetroVirus (MSRV) could play a
      critical role in the causation of multiple sclerosis. GNbAC1 is an experimental medication,
      which neutralizes (i.e. inactivates) a protein of MSRV that might contribute to the
      development or deterioration of multiple sclerosis.
