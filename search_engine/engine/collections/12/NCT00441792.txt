      ventilated patients was found to have detrimental effects on patient mortality shortly after
      its introduction into clinical practice, etomidate continues to be widely used as an
      induction agent for endotracheal intubation. Recent data have called into question the safety
      of using etomidate for even a single bolus in patients at risk of adrenal insufficiency,
      emphasizing the fact that single bolus doses of etomidate cause measurable adrenal
      suppression, and consequently may cause an increase in vasopressor requirements and hospital
      length of stay. Alternative FDA-approved induction agents, such as midazolam, are claimed by
      many authors to be safer than etomidate; however, no studies have formally compared these
      agents.

      Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that in critically ill adult patients
      presenting to the emergency department with sepsis and requiring rapid sequence intubation,
      the hospital length of stay of patients given etomidate will be increased compared to
      patients given midazolam for induction.

      Specific Aims: The specific aim is to determine the difference in hospital length of stay
      between septic patients given etomidate and those given midazolam for induction during rapid
      sequence intubation in the emergency department. The investigators plan to compare the two
      groups in terms of length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and duration of intubation by
      performing a prospective, randomized, trial of critically ill patients presenting to the
      emergency department with sepsis requiring intubation. The investigators will also compare
      the mortality rates in these two groups while controlling for severity of illness and the use
      of steroids while hospitalized. Significance: If the use of etomidate to induce anesthesia
      prior to intubation is found to adversely affect the length of stay of septic patients, a
      reduction in the length of stay in such patients might be achieved by using alternative
      agents for induction. The current widespread use of an induction agent that may adversely
      affect the length of stay of septic patients has significant implications for patient
      management.
