      Treatment often necessitates several chirurgical steps. It is agreed that resection must
      extend to several tissues (osteitis zone ans macroscopically pathological soft tissue), with
      associated non-union site stabilization ans effective antibiotic therapy.

      In 1986, Pr A. C. Masquelet described a 2-step procedure called the induced membrane
      technique, to manage bone defects of varying severity. Initial results were encouraging but
      there have been few large homogeneous series specific to this technique in septic non-union.
