      functional, and patient reported outcomes in quantifying disease progression over 1 year in
      patients with mutations in the VCP gene.

      Patients will complete a remote and onsite visits at baseline, a remote visit at 6 months,
      and then a final remote and onsite visit at 12 months. All strength, functional, and patient
      reported measures will be completed at each visit to assess reliability, consistency of
      results across testing environments, and sensitivity to change over time.

      Additionally, patients may opt in to provide blood, serum, and urine samples for biobanking.
