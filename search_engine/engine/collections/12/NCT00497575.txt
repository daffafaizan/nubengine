      has been seldom reported. The purpose of this study was to explore the diagnostic criteria
      for subclinical hypothyroidism and the initial dosage of L-thyroxine through long-term follow
      up for infants with hyperthyrotropinemia，and evaluate the curative effect.All live-born
      neonates in province took part in the screening program from October, 1999 to September
      ,2006. Laboratory tests are performed as a time resolved fluoro-immunoassay (TRFIA). TSH is
      measured with a cut-off > 9 mU/L. The diagnostic standard for subclinical hypothyroidism was:
      TSH ≥ 20 mU/L, T3 and T4 normal or low-normal ,or TSH > 5.6 mU/L and < 20 mU/L on initial
      determination and on follow-up or TSH levels increase on follow-up and/or gradually declining
      T4 levels.L-Thyroxine was administered for substitution therapy. After 2 years
      therapy，allround evaluation was performed. Compare the correlation to effects with different
      level of TSH、starting time of therapy and environment. Compare the effects between
      subclinical、temporary and permanent hypothyroidism.
