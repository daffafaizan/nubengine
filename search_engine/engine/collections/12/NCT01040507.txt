      reported. However, most of them analyze medium-term outcomes. For RYGB, there are just two
      retrospective cohort studies reporting very long-term outcomes. Both studies have an open
      approach and a proximal Roux-en-Y configuration with different pouch orientation and size.
      MacLeanÂ´s series, with a better follow-up rate (83.4%), had a 67.6%EWL at a mean of 11.4
      years; Failure rates were 20 and 35% for the morbidly obese and super obese, respectively. We
      will analyze our own series with a laparoscopic approach, vertically, lesser-curve base <
      10-15ml pouch and proximal Roux limb. The main end-points for our study are 1) Morbidity
      including status of specific biochemical markers & Mortality, 2) Weight loss expressed as BMI
      or %EWL, 3) Trends in major comorbidities and 4) Assessment of Quality of Life.
