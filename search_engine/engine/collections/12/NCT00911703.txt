      is "When has treatment worked sufficiently for safe discharge, and who requires further
      treatment?" Patients with ADHF have a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Current
      guidelines for emergency department (ED) and hospital disposition of patients with ADHF are
      based on limited empirical evidence. This creates clinical uncertainty regarding disposition
      leads to prolonged hospitalizations, higher costs and increased resource consumption. The
      specific aim of the study is to develop a prediction rule from readily available clinical
      data to help physicians identify ADHF patients eligible for safe and early discharge from the
      ED and hospital after treatment is initiated.
