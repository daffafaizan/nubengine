      cardiovascular disease and consistently relates to lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      in prospective cohort studies. The estimates of health effects and potential population
      benefits of increased consumption of nuts are based mostly on observational data and there
      remains considerable uncertainty about whether higher intake of nuts will actually reduce
      cardiovascular outcomes. To address this uncertainty will require a well-conducted,
      adequately powered, large-scale, randomised control trial that tests the causal relationship
      between nut intake and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

      We hereby designed a 6-month walnut supplementation trial in a rural area of China with high
      rates of CVD, to obtain data to support and help to refine the design of a future long-term
      large RCT testing the effect of nut supplementation on CVD risk. The main objectives of the
      current trial are to assess the acceptability and adherence to two different doses of walnut
      supplementation (30 and 60 grams per day). The exploratory objectives are to determine the
      effects of walnut supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors including blood lipids,
      fasting glucose, and body weight.
