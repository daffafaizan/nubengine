      patients per year. Pain associated with these fractures may be excruciating, but before the
      advent of percutaneous vertebroplasty, treatment options were limited. Analgesic medications,
      bed rest, and bracing have been the mainstays of treatment, but each of these therapies has
      substantial limitations.

      Because of the dearth of viable treatment options for osteoporotic vertebral compression
      fractures, the practice of percutaneous vertebroplasty, which involves injection of
      polymethylmethacrylate (medical cement) into the fractured vertebra, has disseminated
      rapidly. However, evidence for the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty is currently
      limited to uncontrolled, nonblinded, small case studies. Even though high rates of success
      are reported, with up to 90% of patients achieving substantial pain relief, these case
      studies have not accounted for numerous important potential biases, including the natural
      tendency for compression fractures to heal spontaneously, regression toward the mean (wherein
      patients seek medical attention when pain is maximum), and the placebo effect. This study
      will examine the clinical efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty for treatment of painful
      osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either percutaneous
      vertebroplasty or a sham procedure (placebo control group). Participants may have up to 2
      spinal levels treated. Participants will be enrolled in the study for 1 year and will have
      study visits at entry and Months 1 and 12. There will also be phone visits at Days 1, 2, 3,
      and 14 and Months 3 and 6. After Month 1, crossover from the placebo group to the
      vertebroplasty group will be allowed.
