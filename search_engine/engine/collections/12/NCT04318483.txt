      first months of life. It is due to an inappropriate reaction of immune system against the
      human body. Its treatment is the avoidance of the cow milk proteins. Its spontaneous recovery
      occurs mostly during the first years of life with the decreasing of the specific IgE and the
      clinical tolerance to cow milk proteins.

      Two shorts cas reports (3 and 5 patients) have described a clinical form of IgE-mediated cow
      milk allergy with angio-oedema of hands and feet. This clinical form is associated with more
      increasing of specific IgE against lactoserum proteins than caseine's. However it has been
      showed that casein is a marker of cow milk allergy persistence. It might be possible that
      this atypical form of cow milk allergy progresses favorably towards a restoration of
      tolerance earlier than the clinical form without angio-oedema of the extremities
