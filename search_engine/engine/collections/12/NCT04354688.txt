    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study that will assess the the safety and
      efficacy of the implant systems with:

        -  Resistance to countertorque testing (mobility)

        -  Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ)

        -  Changes in peri-implant crestal bone levels

        -  Confirmation of clinical benefits

      A total of 60 implants, 30 per treatment group will be placed across all participating sites.
      One patient may contribute more than 1 implant. All implants/ patients will be followed for
      up to 2 years.
