      clinics and harm reduction sites/syringe access programs (SAP) with the tools to offer HIV
      prevention and HCV treatment on-site. The second strategy, the off-site referrals to
      specialized care model, connects people who are at risk for contracting HIV with patient
      navigators who help them access available HIV prevention care and, if necessary, HCV
      treatment.
