    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. This study will compare the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single oral dose of 50 mg tablet (test [Treatment B]) relative to
      single oral dose of 50 mg capsule (reference [Treatment A]) under fasted conditions. The
      study will also explore the effect of food on 50 mg tablet formulation (Treatment C:
      high-fat/high-calorie meal) on TAK-906 PK following tablet administration relative to the
      fasted state (Treatment B).

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 60 days. Participants will be followed up for up
      to 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
