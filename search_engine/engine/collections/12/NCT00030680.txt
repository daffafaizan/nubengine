        -  Determine the efficacy of moderate-dose radiotherapy, in terms of local control, in
           patients with aggressive fibromatoses.

        -  Determine the acute and late side-effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks for a total of 56 Gy in 28
      fractions.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
