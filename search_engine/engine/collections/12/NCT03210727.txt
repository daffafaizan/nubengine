      undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) into a descriptive study. The
      investigators used quantitative and qualitative measures to describe the caregivers
      self-efficacy, distress, and coping style, and solicit their opinions about how to improve
      our supportive care for caregivers.

      Informed by those data, the investigators now will study the effectiveness of the supportive
      intervention.

      The long-term goal of this research is to develop a pragmatic, replicable intervention that
      supports caregivers and promotes the health and well-being of the caregiver-HSCT patient
      dyad.
