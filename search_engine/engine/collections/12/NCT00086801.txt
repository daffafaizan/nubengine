      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with newly diagnosed stage IA, IB, IIA,
           or IIB non-bulky Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and
           gemcitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron-emission tomography scanning is useful
           in predicting clinical relapse and determining the presence of residual disease in these
           patients after treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 3-5 minutes, vinblastine IV over 3-5 minutes, and
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning and CT scan
      before treatment and after courses 2 and 6 of therapy to assess response. Patients with a
      positive PET scan after completion of study therapy may undergo biopsy. A PET scan is
      performed 3 months later if biopsy is negative or biopsy is unable to be performed.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually for 5 years.
