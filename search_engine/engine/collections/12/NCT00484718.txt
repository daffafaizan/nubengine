    
      Methodology study to evaluate the use of a cross over design and gait analysis. The study was
      terminated by mutual consent with the study site at a meeting on the 1 April 2009, because of
      slow recruitment due to a high screen fail rate. The study was not stopped for safety
      reasons.
