      â€¢ To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm volume in
      patients with ipsilateral lymphedema

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm
           interstitial fluid pressure (IFP)

        -  To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in extracellular
           fluid (ECF) volume based on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) by lymphometer

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of VEGF inhibition in this patient population

        -  To assess the clinical benefit in patients with ipsilateral lymphedema treated with
           vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition by evaluating patient responses to
           a quality of life questionnaire (FACT-B+4 lymphedema questions)

        -  To determine the impact of VEGF inhibition on circulating VEGF levels in patients with
           lymphedema
