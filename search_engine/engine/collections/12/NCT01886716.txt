      conditions. In spite of these common and significantly overlapping problems, insight into the
      mechanisms linking alcohol dependence and social anxiety symptoms is minimal, and there are
      not well established treatment guidelines for this population. In this study, the
      investigators seek to develop a computerized intervention for individuals with symptoms of
      social anxiety and alcohol dependence. The intervention attempts to reduce symptoms by
      shifting attention away from alcohol-relevant and/or socially threatening cues. The
      investigators expect that participants receiving alcohol or anxiety training will experience
      reductions in those specific symptoms compared to participants in a control condition. The
      investigators also expect that participants receiving combined alcohol and anxiety training
      will show the largest reductions in alcohol and anxiety symptoms, relative to participants in
      any other condition.
