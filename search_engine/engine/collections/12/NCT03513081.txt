      barriers to the consumption of fruits and vegetables in preschool children. Some factors like
      food preferences, gender, genetic characteristics, psychological factors and family factors
      are also crucial for the acceptance of vegetable in childhood. Some strategies used to modify
      food preferences of children are repeated exposure and the use of rewards. The aim of this
      project is to investigate the efficacy of taste exposure-plus small reward in acceptance and
      consumption of vegetables among preschool children at school. In this context, interventions
      were attended at school to capture the influence of this environment towards consumption of
      vegetables among preschool children.

      For this, the methodology applied will be a repeated exposure protocol by introducing small
      rewards to encourage children to taste an unfamiliar or dislike food. Child intake (weight or
      number of pieces) and liking (hedonic scale) will be assessed at baseline sessions and
      exposure sessions. Moreover, child's neophobia will be evaluated and additional determinants
      of child neophobia, such as child's eating behaviour. Quantitative data analysis will be
      performed by software IBM-SPSS StatisticsÂ®. In conducting this research is expected to
      achieve techniques to overcome neophobia in preschool children and promote vegetable
      consumption in school and at home. The results may contribute to improve food quality in
      childhood and consequently in adulthood.
