      killing nearly six million people a year. There are more than 1 billion smokers in the world,
      up to half will eventually die of a tobacco-related disease. Nicotine replacement treatments
      were the first pharmacological treatments approved for use in smoking cessation therapy and
      include nicotine gums, transdermal patches, tablets, nasal sprays, and inhalation systems.
      More recently, buproprion and varenicline were approved but showed limiting side effects. The
      development of safe and efficient alternatives for this indication is now called for.

      Tobacco cessation cases were observed concomitantly with the administration of a
      desensitization treatment against tobacco allergy. Based on these observations, NFL
      Biosciences developed a drug candidate for tobacco cessation. This new drug (NFL 101) was
      assessed in preclinical studies. Notably, regulatory genotoxicity (Institut Pasteur de Lille)
      and toxicity studies in rats (Ricerca, Wil Research, Lyon) showed no toxicity. The NFL 101
      composition and the low doses injected led to propose a mechanism of action based on an
      immune response. Immunogenicity studies conducted with the European Georges Pompidou Hospital
      (HEGP) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rodents have supported such hypotheses.
      Therefore, the objective of this Phase I study is to investigate the safety of two dose
      levels of NFL-101 in smokers.
