      recruited. Clinical eligibility will include a unilateral DRF treated with closed reduction
      and casting. These measures will be assessed at baseline (<6 weeks following injury), 3- 6
      months and 12 months following fracture. A second series of 80 participants (40 male: 40
      female) who suffered a DRF â‰¥10 years previously will be recruited and tested. Exclusion
      criteria for these two cohorts will include presence of neurological disorders, rheumatoid
      arthritis or co-morbid health conditions that preclude completion of study measures. Twenty
      additional healthy participants will be recruited.
