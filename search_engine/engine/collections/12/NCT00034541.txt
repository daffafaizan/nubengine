      patients. Patients will receive 3-week cycles of therapy with the exception of the initial
      cycle where the patients will receive 4 cycles of therapy. Patients will be enrolled after
      EGFr expression is confirmed and the study inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. An
      initial dose of cetuximab will be administered prior to the initiation of chemotherapy.
      Thereafter, cetuximab will be infused weekly. On the first day of each cycle, a paclitaxel
      infusion will be administered post completion of the cetuximab infusion, immediately followed
      by a carboplatin infusion. Patients will receive cetuximab in combination with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel for two cycles or until disease progression or until the patient exhibits
      intolerable toxicities. Patients will be evaluated for a tumor response at the end of every
      two cycles of therapy and evaluated for safety throughout the study.
