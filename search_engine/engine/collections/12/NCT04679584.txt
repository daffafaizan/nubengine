    
      Background:

      COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Severity of infection in the acute phase
      ranges from asymptomatic to critically ill and fatal courses of the disease. Besides the
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also thromboembolic events and acute damages of
      other organs are contributing to severe and critical courses of the disease in the acute
      phase of the infection.

      It is, however, largely unknown whether and to what extent different organs are affected in
      individuals with milder courses of the disease.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Across all severity stages in the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes longterm
           damages in various organ systems in a significant proportion of patients.

        2. Beyond the damages directly caused by the infection, also the behavioral changes
           implemented to reduce the spread of the virus might impact an individual's health status
           and quality of life.

        3. The infection itself and the pandemic in general results in increased use of health care
           resources.

      Methods:

      SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in defined geographic regions will be contacted through the
      responsible health authorities and will be informed about the study and invited to
      participate. These individuals will presumably represent all severity grades in the initial
      phase of the infection (asymptomatic, uncomplicated, complicated, critical course of disease)
      and each of them will be offered a detailed clinical examination program that Includes
      structural and functional assessment of various organ systems (lungs, cardiovascular, CNS
      including smell/tase, liver), a comprehensive medical history, as well as psychological and
      psychiatric assessments.
