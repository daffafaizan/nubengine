      administration, Visit 1. For patients already in treatment with darunavir, outside the Early
      Access Program, baseline and follow-up data will be collected retrospectively and
      prospectively. For patients switched to commercial darunavir from the Early Access Program
      and already in treatment with darunavir, Baseline Visit data will be collected from the Early
      Access Program Baseline Visit. For patients already in treatment with darunavir outside the
      Early Access Program, baseline data will be collected retrospectively starting from the first
      darunavir intake. For all patients, laboratory examination results collected within 6 months
      before darunavir treatment starts will be considered as baseline data. For patients switched
      to commercial darunavir from the Early Access Program and already in treatment with
      darunavir, Visit 2 won't be performed. For patients starting commercial darunavir or already
      in treatment with commercial darunavir outside the Early Access Program, laboratory exams
      related to follow-up visits, Visit 2 onward, can be performed within a time window of one
      month before or after the corresponding visit date. Further data collection will occur
      approximately at 1, 3, and 6 months and subsequently about every 3 months according to
      routine practice, after initiating darunavir treatment. If a patient stops treatment with
      darunavir at any time, the end of study visit should be performed as soon as possible.
