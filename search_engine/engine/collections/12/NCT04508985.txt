    
      Open-label, pragmatic, randomized, study of approximately 40 adults. The following groups of
      participants will be considered: i) within 48 hours of diagnosis of COVID-19; ii) who have
      received a diagnosis of COVID-19 from another facility and are within 48 hours of transfer to
      a study recruitment site (Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal General Hospital, and Jewish
      General Hospital [all in Montreal, Quebec, Canada]). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to
      an upfront temporary discontinuation) of RAAS inhibition for the duration of the
      hospitalization (and to consider re-initiate after day 7 of admission or on discharge) versus
      a strategy continuation of RAAS inhibition. Re-initiation of held RAAS inhibition will be
      based on treating team's clinical judgement. The RAAS-COVID-19 RCT will evaluate whether an
      upfront strategy of temporary discontinuation of RAAS inhibition compared to the continuation
      of RAAS inhibition among patients admitted with established COVID-19 infection and on chronic
      RAAS inhibition therapy impacts short term clinical outcomes and biomarkers.
