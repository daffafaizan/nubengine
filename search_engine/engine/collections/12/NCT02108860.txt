    
      Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      abatacept to achieve sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with relapsing
      non-severe GPA. Patients who enter the trial will be maintained on a stable dose of their
      maintenance immunosuppressive agent which may include methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA),
      or mycophenolate (MA) and will undergo a blinded randomization to receive abatacept or
      placebo. Patients will additionally receive prednisone 30 mg daily that will then be tapered
      to zero using a standardized tapering schedule.

      If an enrolled patient experiences a non-severe relapse or non-severe disease worsening
      though common closing, or if they have not achieved remission by month 6, they will have the
      option of entering an open-label trial period whereby they would receive abatacept in
      conjunction with their maintenance immunosuppressive and a standardized glucocorticoid taper.
      Patients with a severe disease relapse or severe disease worsening will have met criteria for
      early termination criteria and be removed from active study treatment. Patients will remain
      on study until reaching criteria for early termination or until common closing, 12 months
      after randomization of the final patient. After common closing or early termination, patients
      will be treated with best medical judgment and will undergo a post-treatment safety visit 3
      months after coming off of study treatment.
