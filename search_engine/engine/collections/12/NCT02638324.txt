      medication and biventricular pacing therapy. The inappropriate response to these therapies is
      evaluated by patient history (NYHA III-IV), echocardiography (EF < 45%), 6-minute walking
      test (<440m) and measurements of P-ProBNP. The patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria
      will undergo renal nervous denervation. The patients will be followed up with the same
      methods as they were recruited to the study (by patient history (NYHA III-IV),
      echocardiography (EF < 45%), 6-minute walking test (<440m) and measurements of P-ProBNP). The
      overall time of follow-up will be 24 months. The patients are randomised according to the
      waiting list principle in a manner to 1:1. The waiting time will be 6 months.
