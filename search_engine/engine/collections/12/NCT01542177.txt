    
      This is a single centre, single arm hypoxia study of pancreatic cancer with PET FAZA imaging.

      PET-CT imaging of tumor hypoxia with FAZA will be done prior to the start of standard
      treatment for pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy. The FAZA PET-CT imaging session will last
      approximately 2.5 hours and include an initial dynamic scan to completely characterize the
      initial rapid phase of FAZA uptake, followed by a later static scan.
