      orally ) would be effective in reducing intraoperative isoflurane requirement needed to
      maintain intraoperative hemodynamics within ± 20% of baseline measurement and/or attenuates
      hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in female patients ASA I or II schedule for
      elective abdominal hysterectomy surgery under general anaesthesia.

      The investigators aim to compare the efficacy of preoperative oral pregabalin versus placebo
      in reducing intraoperative isoflurane requirements needed to maintain intraoperative
      hemodynamic stability (Blood pressure and heart rate within ± 20% of baseline measurements)
      in female patients ASA I/II undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy surgery under general
      anaesthesia.
