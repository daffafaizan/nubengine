      mismatch for HLA-A or B in patients less than 36 years of age is associated with more
      frequent graft versus host disease (GVHD) of grades III-IV than previously observed with
      donors with one CREG mismatch. II. Determine whether the use of donors with a one CREG
      mismatch for HLA-A or B in patients 36-50 years of age is associated with more frequent GVHD
      of grades III-IV than previously observed with matched donors. III. Determine the relevance
      of HLA-A allele mismatching in bone marrow transplants from donors matched for HLA-A, B, and
      DR phenotypes.

      OUTLINE: This is a parallel, open label study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and total body
      irradiation (TBI) 3 times a day on days -4 through -1. Allogeneic bone marrow (ABM) is
      infused on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive therapy as in arm I, except TBI is administered
      twice a day on day -1 only. ABM is infused on day 0. Arm III: Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and -5 and TBI twice a day on days -3 through -1. ABM is
      infused on day 0. Males with ALL receive an additional radiation boost to the testes during
      TBI. Patients are followed at least every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients under 36 years old and 50 patients 36-50 years old
      will be accrued for this study within 5 years. Additional patients will be accrued for the
      standard therapy arm of this study.
