      between 23 and 28 weeks were included if they were admitted during the first 24 hours of life
      and stayed for at least seven weeks in two European units (Lyon, france, and Stockholm,
      Sweden). Parenteral and enteral nutrition policies were detailed and protein and energy
      intakes were collected.Growth assessment Postnatal growth was precisely evaluated and
      compared in the two groups of infants.

      Body weight, crown-heel length and head circumference were measured in both units at birth
      and until discharge. We calculated z-scores and changes in z-scores between birth and 36
      weeks post-conceptional age (delta z-score) for body weight, HC, and crown-to-heel length
      using Olsen's references. Intra-uterine growth restriction was defined as a birth weight
      below or equal to minus two standard deviations. Extra-uterine growth restriction was defined
      as a z-score loss above or equal one standard deviation between birth and 36 weeks PCA. I
