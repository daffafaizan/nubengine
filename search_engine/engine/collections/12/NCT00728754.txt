    
      This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study in which qualified patients with
      partial edentulism will receive a short-fixed bridge restoration. Each implant site is
      randomized to receive either the Osseotite Certain Lateralized (test) or the Osseotite
      Certain Non-lateralized (control). All implants will receive a temporary prosthesis after two
      months of placement. Enrollment will include up to 20 patients (approximately 60 implants per
      center) at each participating study center.
