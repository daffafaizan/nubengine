      water derived from the public network by molecular and genomic techniques in districts of
      Lima (Brena, Chorrillos, Comas, El Agustino, La Victoria, Lince, Los Olivos, Miraflores,
      Puente Piedra, Rimac, San Isidro, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Villa El
      Salvador, and Villa Maria del Triunfo) with high and low incidence of gastric carcinoma. The
      secondary objective of this study is to establish correlations between the findings in water
      and those of the stomach of patients with symptoms of dyspepsia who live in those districts.
