      tomato based products are associated with a reduction in CVD risk. The mechanism by which
      this protective effect occurs is not clearly understood but research has focused on its
      potential to modulate platelet function. This single-blind, randomized, parallel design human
      intervention trial will recruit 99 participants to consume an orange flavoured beverage
      containing different doses of a tomato pomace extract (1.0 and 2.5 g) or placebo control over
      a 5-day period. The study aims is to investigate the effects of consuming different doses of
      the tomato pomace extract on platelet aggregation. Safety and tolerability of the tomato
      pomace extracts was tested prior starting this study by undertaking a single ascending dose
      study.
