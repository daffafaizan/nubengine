    
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous
      system. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are very common in MS. Pelvic floor muscle
      training (PFMT) is one of the first-line choices for the conservative treatment of LUTS.

      According to our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of digital pelvic floor
      muscle training and lifestyle recommendations in MS having LUTS, yet.
