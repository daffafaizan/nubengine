      chest tube placement (tubeless group) or chest tube placement (control group) after
      thoracoscopic wedge resection with out without lymph adenectomy. The primary endpoints are to
      compare the post-operative hospital stay and post-operative pain sale between the two groups.
      The secondary endpoints are to compare the intercostal neuralgia and wound satisfaction one
      month after surgery between the two groups.
