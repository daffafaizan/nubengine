    
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to either letrozole plus placebo vs. letrozole plus
      continuous dosing of ribociclib vs. letrozole plus intermittent dosing
      (3-weeks-on/1-week-off) of ribociclib.

      The difference in clinical, pathologic and radiologic response as well as Pre-operative
      Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) scores across the three treatments arms will be examined.
      Subjects will also be followed for 5 years post-treatment to determine if ribociclib in
      combination with letrozole for 24 weeks results in improved 5 year Relapse Free Survival
      (RFS) compared to letrozole alone.
