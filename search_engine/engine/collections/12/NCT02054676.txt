      Patients sampling.

      inclusion criteria fulfilled patients selection for dental implant treatment.

      Size of the research. Patients referred to the dentists and dental specialists in Lithuania
      and other centers participating in the study.Total sample size is not less than 80 - 100
      edentulous jaw segments. The duration of the study is one year of sample gathering (2014).

      Material and methods. Dental notation: World Dental Association (FDI) dental notation system.
      The length measurement system is metric (millimetres with integer numbers according to the
      mathematical rules). Non linear measurements values are provided: "+" - agreement, "-" -
      disagreement. Separate stages of the study should be documented - digital pictures (under
      protocol requirements) should be taken.

      The international study is based on classification (please find the first article in the list
      of publications). The investigation unit is edentulous jaw segment in aesthetic or non
      aesthetic zone. Aesthetic zone contains incisive, canine and premolar edentulous jaw
      segments. Molar region edentulous jaw segments belong to non aesthetic zone. The proposed
      classification accuracy is evaluated after edentulous jaw segment preoperative,
      intraoperative, early postoperative and late postoperative stages corresponding parameters
      comparison in the aesthetic and non aesthetic zone (the evaluation of the corresponding
      parameters are different at separate stages). The corresponding data collection in to
      appendices (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3) should be made by the calibrated and trained
      in the field investigator.
