      Surveys (NHANES) conducted in 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004 by the National Center for
      Health Statistics. Data on frequency of eating restaurant meals were collected at that time.
      The surveys have been linked to the National Death Index and mortality status information is
      available in public-release files. The investigators aim to examine if exposure to restaurant
      meals at baseline is prospectively linked to the risk of mortality. All data are anonymized
      and available in the public domain.
