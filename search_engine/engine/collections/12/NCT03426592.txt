      cells on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV is concentrated in vivo in Th17 cells in blood and
      the gastrointestinal tract. Th17 cells are critical mediators of mucosal immunity against
      bacteria and fungi and are rapidly depleted in the gut following HIV acquisition with
      subsequent gut epithelial permeability, microbial translocation and ensuing chronic
      inflammation which is not completely reversed on ART. Such inflammation may contribute to HIV
      persistence by potentiating T cell proliferation and thereby clonal expansion of infected
      cells, by exacerbating CD8+ T cell exhaustion and potentially by promoting viral replication
      despite ART.

      Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects on the immune system including directing na√Øve CD4+ T cells
      away from the Th17 phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory regulatory T cell phenotype. It may
      also have beneficial effects on dendritic cell and CD8+ T cell immunity. Furthermore, vitamin
      D has been shown in animal models to strengthen gut epithelial integrity and in healthy
      volunteers to promote a more diverse gut microbiome.

      The investigators plan to perform a pilot randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of
      high dose vitamin D supplementation in HIV-infected participants on suppressive ART and to
      determine its effect on immune activation, Th17 cell frequency, gut barrier integrity, the
      gut microbiome and HIV persistence.
