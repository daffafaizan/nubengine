      study. Data collection will be carried out using the online survey. The online survey link
      will be shared via social media accounts and via mail. The questionnaire created through
      Google forms will be delivered to the participants via the link. The link will be active in
      the data collection process. Before the participants start the questionnaire, they will be
      asked whether they were willing to participate. The socio-demographic characteristics (age,
      gender, body mass index) and health status (presence of chronic disease, drugs used and
      history of injury) will be questioned. In addition, the information about the sector, working
      hours, time spent at work and out of work, additional working hours, break times at the
      workplace will be collected. The Standardized Scandinavian Musculoskeletal Questionnaire will
      be used to assess musculoskeletal complaints. Participants with musculoskeletal pain will be
      referred to the assessment questionnaire appropriate for the localization of the region where
      they feel the most pain. Participants with neck pain will be evaluated with the Neck
      Disability Scale. Arm-Shoulder-Hand Disability Survey-Short Form will be used for
      participants with wrist, shoulder or arm pain. Oswestry Disability Index will be used to
      determine the degree of disability in individuals with low back pain.
