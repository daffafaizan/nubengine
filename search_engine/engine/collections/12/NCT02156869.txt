      prostate cancer, using digital rectal examination and dosage of prostate specific antigen
      (PSA), did not significantly decrease prostate cancer specific mortality. Rather, screening
      for prostate cancer often led to over-diagnosis by detecting tumors that would not otherwise
      have become symptomatic or by producing false positive results. It could therefore result in
      unnecessary supplementary testing (including prostate biopsies), inadequate and/or harmful
      treatment, and negative psychological outcomes among patients.

      Although the growing number of recommendations against PSA testing for screening of prostate
      cancer, 70% of patients still request testing prior to any information because they
      overestimate the benefits and are unaware of the limitations. As a result, about 55% of
      patients between 50 and 74 years old, undergo prostate cancer screening in the USA every
      year, despite recommendations against it.

      To help patients understand the complexities about PSA testing for prostate cancer screening,
      professional organizations encourage physicians and patients to use decision aids to make
      informed decisions.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a decision aid, usable in daily practice
      by general practitioners, presenting harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening on
      patients' intent to undergo screening.
