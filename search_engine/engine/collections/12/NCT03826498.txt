      posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of
      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) may be used as restorative approach for children with CP.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair
      neurological injuries, this effect achieved due to immune regulation and angiogenesis as well
      as the neuroprotective effect.

      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for
      children with CP.

      This study is prospective, non randomized (open label) with control group.
