      I. Determine the impact of patient activation and education (PAE, N=360) alone or with
      physician activation (PAE+Phys, N=360) on skin cancer screening and health promotion
      practices at 12 months, measured by percentage of survivors who conduct skin self-exam and
      receive physician skin exam, and time to detection and diagnosis of suspicious lesions.

      II. Among primary care physicians of transplant patients, determine the impact of an
      e-learning teledermoscopy program compared with provision of print materials for identifying
      suspect lesions.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive a study packet on skin cancer. Participants also receive text
      messages once every 3 weeks for 9 months.

      GROUP II: Participants receive a study packet on skin cancer. Participants also receive text
      messages once every 3 weeks for 9 months. Participants' physician receives a letter that
      describes the educational intervention and encourages them to do a skin examination at next
      patient visit.

      GROUP III: Participants receive a study packet on skin cancer. Participants also receive text
      messages once every 3 weeks for 9 months. Participants' physician receives a letter that
      describes the educational intervention and encourages them to do a skin examination at next
      patient visit. Physicians also receive a free dermatoscope with instructions for uploading
      images of suspect lesions and attend a 30-minute online course comprising additional
      descriptions of dermoscopic images for skin cancers and "mimickers" common in hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation patients, along with clear instructions for using a dermatoscope
      and steps to integrate dermoscopy into their practice.
