      many cannot tolerate interferon, the previous standard of care. The new direct acting
      antivirals have provided these patients with a new hope. One such combination is sofosbuvir
      (SOF) 400 mg and ledipasvir (LDV) 90 mg given once daily with or without weight-based
      ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks only for HCV genotype 1 patients. The current
      recommendation for cirrhotics (genotype 1) is SOF/LDV/RBV for 24 weeks but that
      recommendation is based on the lack of data for shorter periods. In order to evaluate the
      response rate to the combination of SOF/LDV/RBV the investigators decided to treat 50 HCV
      genotype 1 cirrhotics with this combination for 12 weeks. Patients with MELD score > 20 are
      excluded. The investigators will calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks
      (SVR12).
