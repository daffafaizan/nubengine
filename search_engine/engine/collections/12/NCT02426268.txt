    
      The purpose of this research study is to collect data from a tissue oximeter device that
      measures brain oxygen saturation simultaneous with data from the same device that monitors
      skeletal muscle during cardiac surgery. This monitoring will allow for continuous,
      non-invasive, and earlier assessment of perfusion abnormalities/hypoperfusion.

      Two sensors from the FORE-SIGHT Elite monitor will be placed on the forehead above the
      eyebrows and two additional sensors will be placed on the leg muscles. Data from the
      FORE-SIGHT Elite monitor will be recorded in addition to clinical and demographic data, which
      is standard of care during the procedure, for research purposes to look at factors associated
      with desaturations.
