      given examinations of visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics, and be assigned to two
      groups: participants in group A use myopia prediction algorithm to predict myopia
      development, while in Group B, the participants do not use myopia prediction algorithm to
      predict myopia development. The visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics will be
      investigated over the one-year follow-up period, aiming at comparison of actual myopia
      development between the two groups
