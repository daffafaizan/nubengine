      Medical Center investigators is "The Efficacy of NRT to Reduce the Risk of Nicotine Exposure
      in Pregnant Minority Smokers." Prenatal smoke exposure to the fetus and environmental tobacco
      smoke exposure of infants and children causes significant harm in both the short- and
      long-term. Smoking during pregnancy is the foremost preventable cause of perinatal morbidity
      and mortality. There is strong evidence that these exposures are associated with low birth
      weight (LBW) and infant mortality, respiratory illness, ear infections, tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), developmental delay, and
      increased health care utilization and hospitalizations.

      George Washington University Medical Center investigators are submitting two concept papers
      that aim to test the efficacy of innovative intervention methods tailored to reduce fetal and
      infant exposure to nicotine secondary to maternal smoking and environmental tobacco exposure.
