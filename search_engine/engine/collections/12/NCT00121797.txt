      group will have pre and post labor urine cultures taken, and the risk factors during delivery
      will be documented, while the control group will have no cultures taken, as the common
      practice prior to the study.

      Women with positive cultures will be contacted by telephone, and antibiotic treatment
      recommended according to bacteria sensitivity. All women will be contacted by telephone 1
      month post partum and data regarding urinary tract symptoms and need for hospitalization,
      will be collected. The rehospitalization rate will be documented and compared between the two
      groups.

      The assumption is that routine urine culture to women in the peripartum period may reduce the
      UTI rate and hospitalization after delivery.
