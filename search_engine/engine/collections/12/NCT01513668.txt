      During the course of study, the safety parameters including vital signs, physical
      examination, medical history, clinical laboratory and safety tests (haematology, biochemical
      parameters) were assessed and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology & biochemical
      parameters) were performed again at the end of the study.
