      Teen drivers (ages 16 to 19) are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than
      adult drivers (ages 25 to 69). Inexperience is a fundamental factor in the high crash rate
      for novice teens. Safe and skilled driving is a complex task that involves behaviors (e.g.,
      skills and actions) that vary and become increasingly challenging with increasing speed,
      unsafe road conditions and other hazards of the driving environment. Because teens are at
      their lowest lifetime risk of crashing when accompanied by an adult, adult-supervised
      practice provides a safe way for teens to gain needed experience under a variety of driving
      conditions. Unfortunately, few teens receive sufficient quantity, quality and diversity of
      adult-supervised practice prior to licensure.

      The objective of the proposed research is to compare how the driving training process and the
      results of that training process differ between a group of young learning permit holders in
      families that have access to TDP (the intervention group) from the training process and the
      results of that process in an otherwise similar group of teens in families with no TDP access
      (the control group). The investigators hypothesize that teens given access to TDP will
      demonstrate greater competence and safety in a standardized on-road driving assessment than
      teens with no TDP access.
