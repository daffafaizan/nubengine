      Primary Care. More than 95 percent of UTIs are monomicrobial, although the microorganisms
      implied are varied, and the range of effective drugs could be extensive. The species most
      frequently isolated is Escherichia coli, with prevalence ranking between 85 and 90 percent of
      documented cases. E. coli has developed resistance to different antibiotics. Cefditoren is
      situated as a good candidate for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs due to its spectrum of
      activity against E. coli. The study has been designed in accordance with the guidelines and
      recommendations in force to assess the efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil against ciprofloxacin,
      a drug which despite the increasing rate of resistance in some countries, continues to be a
      drug of choice for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs.
