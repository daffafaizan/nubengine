      liver fat content is increased in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We
      hypothesise that fish oils will have a beneficial effect on these endpoints and other
      cardiometabolic parameters such as cholesterol and liver function in women with PCOS. This
      crossover study of 40 obese women with PCOS will therefore examine the effects of fish oils
      on the above parameters compared with placebo (olive oil). Subjects with PCOS who have
      participated in previous studies with this research group will be approached for recruitment,
      as will eligible subjects within the endocrine clinics of the chief and co-investigators.
