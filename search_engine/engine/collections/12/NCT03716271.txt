      performed in the ophthalmic trial frame, which included assessment of 3 trials: reference
      (with lens for distance correction); stenopeic (distance correction with a pinhole Ï•=1,25 mm)
      and Light Sword Lens (distance correction with a Light Sword Lens). In each trial, visual
      acuity was assessed in 7 tasks for defocus from 0.2D to 3.0D while contrast sensitivity in 2
      tasks for defocus 0.3D and 2.5D.
