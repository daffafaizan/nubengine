      hyper-responsiveness will be recruited to participate in this randomized, crossover study.
      Subjects will complete 2 methacholine challenges at least 24 hours apart. One methacholine
      challenge will entail the volumetric method using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. The second
      methacholine challenge will be performed identically except that the nebulizer will be fitted
      onto an ultrasonic nebulizer so as to measure the inspiratory duty cycle throughout the
      bronchoprovocation challenge.
