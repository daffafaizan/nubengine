      in patients with mCRC, who have progressed in first line treatment with FOLFOX/AVASTIN. For
      AVASTIN was selected the dosing schedule of the trials TREE 1 and 2 [17], where Avastin was
      combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in a three weeks schedule and with adaptation of
      the dose in the 7,5 mg/kg
