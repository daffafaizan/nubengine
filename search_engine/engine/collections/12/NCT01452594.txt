      perceived as foreign to the body. Unfortunately, this immune system often fails to eliminate
      tumors or other cancerous growths. The drug diphenylcyclopropenone, or DPCP, modifies the
      immune system and has been shown to be effective in treating certain kinds of cancer. This
      study hopes to improve our understanding of how this drug helps create an effective immune
      response. In order to reach this goal, normal volunteers will be given the DPCP drug in the
      form of a gel or a placebo gel (gel without the active chemical) on a few small areas of
      skin. Then, biopsies will be taken of the skin at the sites where the active drug was placed.
      Also, small biopsies will be taken from opposite areas of skin which received placebo gel to
      serve as controls. The biopsied skin samples will then be studied by methods such as
      immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis which will help define the immune reaction
      caused by DPCP. The rationale for the study is to better understand how the immune system can
      be activated to produce cells that may fight infections or cancers.
