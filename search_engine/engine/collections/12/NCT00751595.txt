      the HIV-1 Tat protein-based vaccine. Anti-Tat antibody negative, HIV-1 positive subjects
      treated successfully with HAART have been screened and recruited for a 48-weeks study,
      including a period of 16 or 8 weeks treatment phase and a period of 32 or 40 weeks follow-up
      phase, in arm A or Arm B, respectively. One hundred sixty-eight subjects have been randomized
      1:1:1:1 to one of the 2 arms (Arm A and Arm B) and each arm has been divided in the following
      groups:

      Arm A - Group I: 5 immunizations with Tat (7.5 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16; Arm A -
      Group II: 5 immunizations with Tat (30 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16; Arm B - Group I: 3
      immunizations with Tat (7.5 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8; Arm B - Group II: 3 immunizations with
      Tat (30 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8.

      Four vaccination regimens have been tested by intradermal administration of the Tat vaccine
      at two different doses (7.5 microg or 30 microg) in 5 or 3 immunizations.
