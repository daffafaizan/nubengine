      interventions relative to Brief Advice (BA) to reduce the risk of substance-exposed
      pregnancy) SEP in preconception women of childbearing age. Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months.

      Each of the substances targeted in this study (risk drinking, cigarette smoking, and
      marijuana use) is commonly used relative to other substances and is singly or jointly
      associated with risk for poor fetal outcomes. Thus, women who are not using effective
      contraception (i.e., use of effective birth-control methods during all vaginal intercourse)
      and have any one or more substance-risk behaviors in the 30 days before intake will be
      eligible for the study.

      Urn randomization will be used to stratify women on all three substance-risk behaviors to
      ensure a balanced number of women presenting with alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP),
      tobacco-exposed pregnancy (TEP), and marijuana-exposed pregnancy (MEP) risks across the three
      study conditions. To address risk distribution for women who present with more than one risk
      behavior the urn randomization will also be programmed to balance single risk and multiple
      risk women across the study conditions. In sum, the urn randomization will include four
      assignment criteria: AEP, TEP, MEP, and multiple risks. Finally, different numbers of women
      will be needed for each type of substance-exposed pregnancy risk in order to provide
      sufficient power for the investigator's analytic tests. For example, approximately 25% more
      women at risk of AEP are required than for TEP to attain the same power. The investigators
      will include oversampling rules and stopping rules to ensure adequate recruitment for AEP,
      TEP, and MEP.
