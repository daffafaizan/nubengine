      of mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (MBI-LCBI) and they
      believe supplemental vitamin A at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      can reduce the risk of MBI-LCBI and gastrointestinal graft versus host disease (GI GVHD). In
      addition, the investigators' preliminary data suggest that a significant number of patients
      requiring HSCT have vitamin D deficiency even prior to transplantation, and that persistent
      and newly developed deficiency post-HSCT resulted in worse outcomes.

      This study is a comparison of vitamin D supplementation comparing a single large dose of
      vitamin D "stoss therapy" with a placebo in the standard care arm with supplementation with
      single large doses of both vitamins D and A in the experimental arm. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either the standard care arm or the experimental arm.
