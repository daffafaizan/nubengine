      oral motor exercises. Each group received training for 12 weeks. Oral motor assessment was
      performed. Chewing performance level was determined with the Karaduman Chewing Performance
      Scale(KCPS). Tongue thrust severity was evaluated with the Tongue Thrust Rating Scale(TTRS).
      The Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale(DSFS) was used to evaluate drooling severity and
      frequency. The evaluations were performed before and after treatment.
