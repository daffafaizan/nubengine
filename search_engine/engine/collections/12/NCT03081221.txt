      Ultrasonography (USG). In this study, using of USG during verification will be compared with
      traditional method.

      In traditional methods, after intubation, verification of endotracheal tube placement is done
      via to monitoring of thorax movement, checking of tube fogging, auscultation of lung and
      stomach, capnography and radiography.

      In USG method, after intubation, verification of endotracheal tube placement is done via to
      using linear transducer. The probe will be placed transversely and longitudinally on the neck
      and in front of cricoid cartilage.

      So, collected all data from two method will be compared.
