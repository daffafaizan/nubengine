      inadequate stress-coping strategies render them vulnerable to high symptom burden and
      impaired quality of life. Patients are given conventional treatments to stop or slow down the
      progress of nephron destruction and prevent complications associated with uremia. However,
      previous studies observed that these therapies may be limited in alleviating fatigue,
      anxiety, and symptoms of depression, and may pose severe side effects. Therefore, in recent
      years patients have shown enhanced tendency to use complementary and integrative approaches
      including aromatherapy, acupuncture, massage, music, and relaxation to provide better control
      on their health and treatment process, feeling better physically, and emotionally, and as
      well as improve quality of life. The present study investigates the effects of Benson
      relaxation technique combined with music therapy in two-centered, 2-arm, assessor blinded
      randomized, controlled study of 61 hemodialysis patients.

      Arm 1: Benson relaxation technique combined with music therapy ; Arm 2: control. The
      investigators hypothesize that Benson relaxation technique combined with music therapy will
      decrease severity of fatigue, anxiety, and depression.
