      over 3 sequential cohorts, each comprising of 11 participants randomized to either TPI-287 or
      placebo. TPI-287 or placebo will be administered as an intravenous infusion once every 3
      weeks for 9 weeks, for a total of 4 infusions. Participants who successfully complete this
      phase will have the option of entering into the open label extension phase during which
      TPI-287 will be administered once every 3 weeks for an additional 6 weeks, for a total of 3
      extra infusions.

      Pre-medication of diphenhyramine 25 mg (Benadryl) will be given IV within 30 to 60 minutes
      prior to each study infusion in the study.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed through reporting of adverse events, physical and
      neurological testing, ECGs, as well as blood and urine analyses. Baseline and end-point
      measures of cognition and function, MRI brain scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker
      analyses will be used to determine preliminary efficacy of TPI-287 in mild-moderate AD.
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of TPI-287 will be calculated from blood
      plasma collected after the first infusion, and from CSF collected on the last visit of the
      placebo-controlled phase.
