      investigate the upper GI tract, especially the stomach. The new Navicam MACE system is
      composed of a magnetic capsule endoscope, an external controller magnet, a data recording set
      and a computing workstation, and with the aid of the appropriate software a real time follow
      up and controlling of the magnetic capsule inside the body is possible. This methodology
      could be an optimal non-invasive method of choice for gastric cancer and Barrett esophagus
      screening in high risk population in the near future.

      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the gold standard diagnostic test, however it is very
      uncomfortable for patients without sedation.

      The aim of our present study was a feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      Ankon MACE to investigate gastric and esophageal disorders in patients referred to small
      bowel capsule endoscopy investigations into our endoscopy and to develop and test a method
      with MACE for esophageal investigation and to analyse the visualisation of stomach mucose
      with automatic and manual capsule maneuvering.
