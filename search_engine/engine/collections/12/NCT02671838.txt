      General Hospital. Eligible RA subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      screened using a medication adherence measure questionnaire. Thereafter 132 patients who are
      low adherers on the questionnaire will then be recruited and randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to
      either (a) intervention arm (with musculoskeletal US program) or (b) control arm (without
      musculoskeletal US program), and followed up over a period of about 6 month.
