    
      In addition to the details above we will also explore

        -  the relationship of the post-HD-MTX MRD-levels with the dose of 6MP, TPMT-activity,
           DNA-6TGN, E-6TGN, E-MeMP, E-MTX, and presence of ASP-antibodies,

        -  the early development of anti-ASP antibodies during continuous PEG-ASP therapy.

      The study could improve the understanding of the pharmacodynamics of the 6MP/HD-MTX
      interaction in combination with PEG-ASP.
