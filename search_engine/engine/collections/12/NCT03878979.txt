      drugs, nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558) before surgery to people with newly diagnosed or
      recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). Patients with recurrent disease
      may have a limited number of sites of metastatic (spread) squamous cell carcinoma of head and
      neck. Another goal of this study is to learn how nivolumab impacts the immune system's
      ability to treat the cancer. While nivolumab is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic SCCHN with progression on
      or after platinum-based chemotherapy, the word "investigational" in this context means that
      the study drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of head and neck cancers prior
      to surgery and thus is still being tested in research studies. However, the FDA is allowing
      the use of nivolumab in this study.

      This study will have two arms. Cohort (arm) 1 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about
      4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of a newly diagnosed SCCHN. Twelve patients will
      be enrolled to this arm. Cohort 2 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks
      before surgical resection (removal) of SCCHN which has recurred and possibly spread to
      distant sites, but still can be resected with one surgery. Twelve patients will be enrolled
      to this arm.
