      Neck Pain Clinical Trial is to examine the patient-centered clinical and biomechanical
      outcomes, and believability characteristics of a manually-localized cervical distraction
      procedure for the treatment of neck- or neck-related arm pain or disability. One challenging
      issue in the study of manual therapies, including spinal manipulation (SM), is the
      development of sham and/or minimal intervention procedures suitable for use with control
      groups in clinical trials. With SM, active treatment requires substantial physical contact
      between a study clinician and the study participant, either directly or through a mechanical
      intermediary. Consequently, it is difficult to introduce differences in manual therapy
      procedures that distinguish sham and/or minimal interventions from the active treatment, but
      are not immediately obvious to the study participant. Another challenging issue is training
      clinicians to deliver a standardized SM treatment within specified force ranges. The muscles
      surrounding the neck could alter the forces transmitted to the cervical spine, and could
      alter the treatment effectiveness. The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial is
      to examine the patient-centered clinical, biomechanical, and believability outcome
      characteristics of a manually-localized cervical distraction procedure for the treatment of
      neck or neck-related arm pain or disability. We also will evaluate the ability of the doctor
      of chiropractic to deliver the MCD treatment within specified force ranges. An exploratory
      aim of this study is to evaluate EMG measurement during MCD delivery.
