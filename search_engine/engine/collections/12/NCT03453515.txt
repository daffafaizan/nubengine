      boys' and girls' motivation and skills to engage in safer sexual behavior (HEART: Health
      Education and Relationship Training). Half of participants will receive HEART and half of
      participants will receive Growing Minds, an attention-matched control website focused on
      growth mindsets of intelligence and self-regulation. The ultimate goal of this work is to
      help youth reduce their risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and to avoid
      unplanned pregnancies.

      Primary outcomes for this study include 1) acceptability of the program, 2) safer sex
      self-efficacy, and 3) safer sex intentions.
