      challenges of poverty and depression faced by women in Vietnam by integrating evidence-based
      treatment for depression management and microfinance services. With funding from NIMH, the
      investigators established initial evidence for the effectiveness of LIFE-DM in reducing
      depression and improving functioning, social support, self-efficacy, and income at six
      months. These treatment effects were maintained at twelve months, suggesting that the LIFE-DM
      program may be an effective strategy to break the cycle of depression and poverty in
      low-income women.

      For the Grand Challenges of Canada (GCC) Transition to Scale Grant, the investigators
      developed a model to scale up the program in the public health and social system across two
      provinces, Danang and Thua Thien Hue through 1) the training of local trainers from the
      psychiatric hospital to support local implementation, 2) development of a supervision model,
      and 3) use of a learning collaborative.

      To evaluate the success of the model, the investigators will conduct a mixed methods
      implementation study that will assess implementation and patient outcomes according to the
      RE-AIM framework, as well as identify barriers and facilitators to implementation.
