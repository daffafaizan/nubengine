      complications in ankle fractures through standard splint and an unna boot compressive
      dressing with a splint. Quantitative and qualitative measurements will be analyzed to compare
      edema and wound complications. Secondary goals are to evaluate the quantitative differences
      in ankle range of motion and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores. The hypothesis of this
      proposed study is that there will be less soft tissue swelling and wound complications with
      the use of an unna boot when compared to the standard splint. The investigators also
      hypothesize that there will be improved ankle range of motion and visual analogue scale (VAS)
      pain scores with the use of an unna boot when compared to a standard splint. Participants
      will be randomized to either the standard splint or an unna boot and quantitative and
      qualitative measures will be collected. This data could change the practice for preoperative
      management of soft tissue swelling following ankle fractures.
