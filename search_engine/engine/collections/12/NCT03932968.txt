      contraindication for a sleeve gastrectomy for some surgeons. However the impact of sleeve
      gastrectomy on reflux is not clear. A de novo reflux is described for 2 to 18% of patients
      and many patients have unclear epigastric symptoms. One of the cause could be clip ascent
      which could justify a second surgery. This is a single institution study. All patients, one
      year after sleeve gastrectomy will be included. All will have a CT scan looking for clip
      ascent. For patients with gastric symptoms such as retrosternal burning, regurgitations, and
      epigastric pain, a pH-metry will be performed. A second consultation is done one year after.
      The aim of the study is to correlate clip ascent, pyrosis proved by ph-metry and epigastric
      symptoms after sleeve gastrectomy. The demographic data collection, confirms the definition
      of clip ascent, define its frequency, and look for correlation with the median weight loss. A
      medical information note is given to every patient at the first consultation.
