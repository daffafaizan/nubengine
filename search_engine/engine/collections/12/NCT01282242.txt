      NINDS. This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase IIa safety study in adult acute ischemic
      stroke patients to determine if it is safe to extend intravenous thrombolytic treatment to
      subjects who are evaluated within 24 hours from last known well ("stroke onset") and eligible
      to receive thrombolytic treatment within 4.5 hours from symptom discovery with the assistance
      of an MRI-based "witness" when no human witness of stroke onset is available. The study is
      designed to investigate the safety in using standard diagnostic MRI in selecting patients for
      thrombolytic therapy when the last known well time places the patient beyond the current IV
      thrombolytic time-window.
