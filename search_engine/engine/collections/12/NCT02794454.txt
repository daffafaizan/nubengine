      adding new botanicals thus naming it HeezOn Ultra. HeezOn®has been studied on 148 subjects
      and has proven to be beneficial for subjects with mild to moderate ED. The previous study
      fell short to capture the data for subjects who were also suffering from PE and their overall
      quality of life-related to sexual health. Therefore, the trial is designed to study the
      speedy and sustained effect of the improvised formula on different aspects of sexual
      dysfunctions.
