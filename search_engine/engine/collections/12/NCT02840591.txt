      treatment followed by a separate consecutive case series of citicoline treatment, both
      running in parallel with a non-randomized, observation-only, treatment as usual arm in
      hospitalized patients with delirium.

      On the drug treatment arm, first five consecutive subjects meeting Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual (DSM)-5 criteria for delirium will be given ramelteon 8 mg daily at bedtime for 5
      days. The next five consecutive patients will be given citicoline 250 mg daily at bedtime for
      2 days, followed by 500 mg daily at bedtime for 3 days. Patients on the observation-only arm
      will be screened and followed similarly, except they will not be given any experimental
      drugs. All subjects will continue to receive standard medical care for delirium, including
      optimal medical treatment, psychotropic medications and consultations with specialty services
      as necessary.

      The study is a small pilot to see if there is good feasibility, tolerability and a signal for
      delirium improvement efficacy with the two medications. The goal is to develop the ability to
      conduct delirium research at this institution and obtain some preliminary pilot data. These
      data will be used to design and obtain funding for future, larger research studies. the data
      from each medication will be examined to look for patterns suggesting that one may be
      preferable for further research. However, given the very small sample size, meaningful
      between-group statistical analyses are not possible.
