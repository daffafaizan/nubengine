      non-inferior to annual treatments with DEC/Alb in inducing sustained clearance of Mf in LF
      infected subjects (>50 Mf/ml) at 36 months post-treatment. This study also tests the
      hypothesis that single dose of triple drug is super in sustained clearance of microfilariae
      compared to single dose of DEC/ALB.

      There will be 3 treatment arms as follows:

        1. The comparator (standard treatment) DEC 6 mg/kg + Alb 400 mg administered annually (at
           0, 12, and 24 months).

        2. DEC 6 mg/kg + Alb 400 mg given once

        3. DEC 6 mg/kg + Alb 400 mg + Iver 200 Âµg/kg administered once only at the beginning of the
           RCT (0 month).
