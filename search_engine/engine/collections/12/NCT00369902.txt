      Recent publication (Pariente J., et a., 2005) indicated that acupuncture may affect midbrain
      areas, that are associated with cognitive control of pain.

      The Pain Self Regulation Model (Levental, 1980)distinguishes between emotional response pain
      representations and cognitive pain representations. According to this model, emotional and
      cognitive pain representations leads to a new (cognitive or emotional) evaluation of the
      pain, that affects its perception and the ability to cope with it (Levental at al., 2001).

      This study will try to assess the hypothesis that acupuncture treatment is involved in this
      process.

      The study is designed as pilot study, limited to 45 patients.
