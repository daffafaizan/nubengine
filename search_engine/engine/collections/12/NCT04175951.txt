      Prospective, randomised, comparative study assessing visual and optical outcomes after
      bilateral implantation of the new Johnson & Johnson Tecnis Eyhance versus monofocal Rayner
      RayOne in patients undergoing routine cataract surgery.

      Methodology:

      Suitable patients with cataracts in both eyes will be identified from cataract assessment
      clinics. They will be invited to participate in the study by the research nurse and handed
      over the patient information sheet and a consent form. The PI will consent the patient for
      the participation. If they agree to participate, they will be give the dates for their
      surgeries on the same day. The patients can choose to have both eyes done on the same day or
      two eyes within 2 weeks based on the patients convenience. If they chose to participate in
      the study, then the patient will have additional tests performed on the day of their cataract
      assessment clinic. This will take an additional 40 minutes.

      On the day of the surgery, the patients will be randomised using a computer generated
      randomisation to receive either Tecnis Eyhance or the Rayner RayOne lens. They will have the
      same lens in both eyes. The patients will be invited for a research follow up visit at 1
      (between 30-37 days after 2nd eye surgery) and 3 months (90-100 days after 2nd eye surgery)
      were simple research tests will performed including vision assessment and a scan.

      At preoperative visit and 3 months the patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire.
