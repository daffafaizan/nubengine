      matched sibling, matched unrelated donor or umbilical cord blood. Patients will be
      conditioned with a myeloablative regimen such as, but not limited to, total body irradiation
      and cyclophosphamide. The donor stem cell grafts will come from mobilized peripheral blood of
      8/8 or 7/8 HLA-identical family members, 8/8 (HLA A, B, C, DRBeta1) allele-level matched
      unrelated donors, or dual umbilical cord blood grafts with at least 4 of 6 HLA matching at
      HLA A and B (low resolution) and DRBeta1 (at high resolution). The target CD34+ cell dose
      will be 5 X 10(6)/kg recipient ideal body weight. For HLA matched sibling or matched
      unrelated donor (MUD) transplants, all patients will receive a minimum of 2 X 10(6) CD 24+
      cells/kg. For cord blood transplants, each unit will contain a minimum total nucleated cell
      count of of 1.5 X 10(7)/kg. Post-transplant GVHD (graft versus host disease) prophylaxis will
      be given per institutional standard.
