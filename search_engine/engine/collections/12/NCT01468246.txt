      the investigators aim to identify over 1,600 women age 40 and younger with newly diagnosed
      breast cancer from academic and community health care institutions. It is anticipated that
      1,300 of these women will agree to participate in an observational study. Patient surveys,
      medical record review, and blood and tissue collection will be utilized. Women will be
      surveyed every 6 months for the first 3 years after diagnosis, then yearly thereafter for an
      additional 7 years (for a total follow-up of 10 year following diagnosis). The study will
      investigate short and long-term disease and treatment issues, and psychosocial concerns at
      baseline and in follow-up among a cohort of young women (age 40 or younger) newly diagnosed
      with breast cancer. The investigators aim to characterize the population of young women at
      diagnosis and in follow-up regarding disease and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., presentation
      and disease characteristics, treatment patterns and quality of care, short and long-term side
      effects, and psychosocial concerns including fertility, sexual functioning, and menopausal
      issues). The investigators will also collect tumor and blood specimens to characterize the
      tumors, and bank for future studies including molecular evaluations of disease
      characteristics, genetic variability and hormonal levels in blood. Ultimately, the
      investigators aim to develop predictors of outcome, and identify areas that may be amenable
      to intervention.
