      intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis subjects and compare it with placebo gel.

      Methods: Ninety subjects were categorized into three treatment groups: Placebo, aloevera
      gel(AV) and 1% Metformin (MF)after Scaling and root planning (SRP). Clinical parameters were
      recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 months; they included plaque index (PI), modified sulcus
      bleeding index (mSBI), pocket probing depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL).
      Radiologic assessment of intra-bony defect (IBD) and percentage defect depth reduction (DDR%)
      was done at baseline, 6 months and 12 months interval using computer-aided software Results:
      Mean PPD reduction and mean CAL gain was found to greater in MF group than AV and placebo
      group at all visits. The DDR% was greater in MF group as compared to AV and placebo group.

      Conclusion: There was a greater decrease in mSBI and PPD and more CAL gain at the sites
      treated with AV and MF as an adjunct to SRP in chronic periodontitis subjects with intrabony
      defects as compared to placebo. The significant IBD depth reduction effect was seen in case
      of MFgroup.
