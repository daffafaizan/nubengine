    
      The purpose of the first phase of this study (phase I) is to find the dose of a new therapy,
      the MG1 Maraba/MAGE-A3 (MG1MA3) virus that can be given alone and in combination with the
      Adenovirus/MAGE-A3 (AdMA3) virus. In the first part of the study, patients may receive the
      Maraba virus, the Adenovirus or both viruses. To identify the highest safe dose of the Maraba
      virus alone or in combination the study will start at a dose lower than the one that does not
      cause side effects in animals. Participants are given one or both of these therapies and are
      watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are
      not severe. If serious side effects are seen in patients at the first dose level, doses of
      MG1MA3 may be lowered in subsequent patients. If the side effects are not serious, then more
      potential participants are asked to join this study and are given higher doses. This will
      continue until the maximum feasible dose level is reached or one of the lower doses is found
      that causes serious but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
