      obstetric haemorrhage: those who after a normal delivery are bleeding more than 1000 ml and
      are in need of surgical intervention to control the bleeding and those in cesarean section
      with ongoing bleeding of more than 1000 ml. Patients are randomized in to two groups: the
      control group(n=30) will be treated according to a protocol based on clinical decision
      making, standard coagulation tests and massive transfusion packages of blood products(1:1:1),
      if needed. This is referred as 'Standard care' in this hospital. The intervention group(n=30)
      will be treated according to a rotational thromboelastometry guided protocol, and massive
      transfusion packages, if needed. The study is powered to detect a reduction of one unit in
      red blood cell transfusion. Blood product, fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex
      concentrate usage and total amount of blood loss will be compared, and the number of
      transfusion related side effects and thromboembolic events 30 days after the bleeding will be
      recorded.
