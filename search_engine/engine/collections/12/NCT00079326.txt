      I. Examine the response rate of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer to combination therapy
      with trastuzumab and BMS-247550 in two cohorts of women: a. women who have received no prior
      chemotherapy or trastuzumab for their metastatic breast cancer; b. women who have received
      prior trastuzumab therapy (either for metastatic disease or prior adjuvant trastuzumab if < 1
      year since completion of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy) and up to 2 prior chemotherapeutic
      regimens in the metastatic setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with
      BMS-247550.

      II. To determine the time-to-disease-progression (TTP) and time-to-treatment-failure (TTF)
      for patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with BMS-247550 in each cohort.

      III. Analyze various tissue biomarkers (e.g. HER2/phospho-HER2, EGFR/phospho-EGFR, IGRF-I,
      phospho-MAPK, phospho-P13K, bcl-2, bcl-xL, MDR-1, MRP and β-tubulin) and blood biomarkers
      (HER2-extracellular domain [ECD], circulating tumor cells) to correlate them with response to
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      trastuzumab (Herceptin®) therapy (with or without chemotherapy) for metastatic breast cancer
      (yes vs no).

      Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes and ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
