      improve the survival time by the results from some randomized controlled studies and
      meta-analyses. However, due to the different blood supply characteristics and biological
      heterogeneity in HCC nodules, the therapeutic effect of TACE is limited, and which is still
      considered as a non-radical treatment. Furthermore, vascular embolization by TACE may result
      in hypoxia in tumor tissue, which will induce increased secretion of angiogenic factors such
      as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor angiogenesis, promote proliferation of
      residual tumor cells, and enhance tumor invasive and metastasis. Accordingly, the
      effectiveness of TACE is still unsatisfying as a single treatment for HCC.

      Both anti-angiogenic targeted drugs and ginsenoside Rg3 have showed synergistic effect with
      TACE in patients with unresectable HCC. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of the combination of anti-angiogenic targeted drugs and ginsenoside Rg3 plus TACE
      comparing to TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC.
