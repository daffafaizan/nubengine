    
      Background: In a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial we found that a
      3-day-course of ceftriaxone significantly reduced the incidence of early-onset
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (EOP). Continuous aspiration of secretions accumulating in
      the subglottic space above the cuff of the endotracheal tube has also been shown to prevent
      EOP.

      Objective: To compare the effect of both preventive measures on the incidence of EOP.

      Design: Randomized, multicenter.

      Setting: Three general intensive care units at university hospitals in Spain. Patients:
      Patients without signs of infection and no concomitant systemic antibiotics were included if
      expected to require endotracheal intubation exceeding 2 days.

      Intervention: All patients were intubated with an endotracheal tube equipped with a port for
      aspiration of subglottic secretions and subsequently randomized to receive a three day course
      of 2 gram/day iv ceftriaxone without aspiration of subglottic secretions or continuous
      aspiration of subglottic secretions.

      Measurements: All ICU-acquired infections, antibiotic therapy, colonization and infection
      with 3rd-generation cephalosporin-resistant microorganisms, duration of intubation and
      ICU-stay and-mortality.
