      I. To determine the rate of treatment related toxicity reports following stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) as a determination of the
      tolerability of combined therapy in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor diameter/volume change prior to and following pazopanib treatment
      prior to SBRT.

      II. To determine the impact of pre SBRT pazopanib therapy on radiation therapy target volumes
      for evidence of tumor shrinkage.

      III. To evaluate tumor change in radiation therapy target volumes and the incidence of
      treatment related toxicity reports and sparing of non-involved nephron.

      IV. Report change in tumor control following pazopanib and SBRT as evaluated by post
      treatment repeat biopsy and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for up to 60 days. Patients then
      continue to receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily and undergo SBRT every other day over
      days 60-65.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months.
