      following anesthesia for congenital heart disease (CHD)

      Early tracheal extubation not only eliminates the potential morbidity related to an
      endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation such as atelectasis, accumulation of secretions,
      nosocomial infections, and the potential for airway trauma, it also limits the need for
      sedation and the antecedent adverse effects including respiratory and hemodynamic depression,
      tolerance, withdrawal, and delirium. Most importantly, the shift from positive pressure to
      spontaneous ventilation augments cardiovascular function and improves preload. Reversal of
      neuromuscular blockade is a fundamental aspect of emergence from general anesthesia.
      Historically, the only option to actively reverse blockade will be to administer
      anticholinesterase inhibitors, which are unable to reverse deep neuromuscular blockade. They
      are also associated with a variety of cholinergic side effects, including bradycardia,
      nausea, and increased secretions, which require concomitant administration of an
      anticholinergic agent, with its own adverse effects. Sugammadex is a newer, selective
      relaxant binding agent
