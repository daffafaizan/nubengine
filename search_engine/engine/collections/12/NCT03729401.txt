    
      The present study is a pilot/vanguard 3-arm study that seeks to compare 3 possible strategies
      for patients that are 1 year post MI and PCI. The 3 randomized groups include: i) aspirin and
      ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily, ii) monotherapy with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily and iii) a
      personalized arm (PA), where patients will get selective therapy based on demographic and
      genetic risks.

      The PA group will use a modified DAPT score based on patient demographics to decide whether
      P2Y12 treatment is warranted. For those patients where treatment is warranted, a bedside
      genetic test will be used to determine whether they are carriers of at-risk genotypes, which
      put them at risk for under-responsiveness to clopidogrel (one of the specific P2Y12
      inhibitors). Those identified as carriers will be treated with ticagrelor while non-carriers
      will be treated with clopidogrel.

      The study will act as a vanguard study to prove feasibility of enrollment and document
      overall bleeding rates. The long-term goal of the study is determine whether a personalized
      approach will decrease bleeding versus an approach of DAPT with ticagrelor and versus an
      approach with ticagrelor monotherapy.
