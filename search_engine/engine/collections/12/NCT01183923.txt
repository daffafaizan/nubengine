      BS then placebo. At randomization, baseline exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), forced expiratory
      volume at one second (FEV1), nasal epithelial gene expression, urinary OS biomarkers, serum
      inflammatory and OS biomarkers, and basophil activation will be assessed. These will be
      assessed again after 7 days on the assigned intervention at two time points: pre- and
      post-EMAC. The 1 week time period was chosen because previous studies have shown that daily
      ingestion of a broccoli sprout homogenate for three days resulted in upregulation of phase II
      enzyme gene expression in nasal epithelial cells. Following a 2-week washout period, this
      protocol will be repeated for the second intervention, phase II. The 2 week washout period
      will be sufficient as the half life of the extract of the active ingredient in broccoli
      sprouts, SFN, has been shown to be 1.8 hours.(16) Participants' diets will be assessed before
      and after each intervention with a Food Frequency Questionnaire and a questionnaire to
      capture intake of specific foods that are rich in SFN.
