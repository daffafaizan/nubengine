      chemotherapy combined with Tirelizumab and Trastuzumab in patients with resectable gastric
      cancer. Prior to surgery to resect the tumor, tirelizumab (intravenously, 200 mg on day 1 of
      every cycle) and trastuzumab (intravenously, 8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg on days 1 of
      every cycle) will be administered for four cycles and the perioperative chemotherapy contains
      docetaxel (intravenously, 50 mg/m2 on day 1 of every cycle) and S1 (orally, 400mg/m2 BID on
      day 1~14 of every cycle) and Oxaliplatin(intravenously, 100 mg /m2 on day 1 of every cycle)
      will be administered for three cycles prior to surgery.If complete resection, R0 or
      microscopic residual tumor R1 is achieved, patients will continue with three cycles of SOX
      and tirelizumab and trastuzumab and then for completion of 12 months treatment with
      tirelizumab and trastuzumab alone.
