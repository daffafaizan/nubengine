      nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), parallel group (each group of
      patients will be treated at the same time), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is
      compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial)
      multicenter study. The study consists of 4 phases: a Screening Phase (up to 3 weeks); a
      17-week flexible dose open-label Transition Phase (open-label phase means that all people
      know the identity of the intervention); a 12-week fixed dose open-label Maintenance Phase;
      and a randomized, double-blind, fixed dose, placebo-controlled relapse prevention phase
      (referred to as the Double-blind Phase). Patients who meet specific stabilization criteria
      will enter the Double-blind Phase at Week 29. Patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1
      ratio, to receive either a fixed dose of PP3M or placebo. The Double-blind Phase will be of
      variable duration; patients will remain in the study until they experience a relapse event or
      meet discontinuation criteria.
