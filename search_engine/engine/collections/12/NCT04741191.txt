      important aspect in the management of chronic heart failure patients. Also, it stated that
      physical exercise training plays an important role to modulate peripheral immune responses if
      congestive heart failure (CHF) patients show high pro-inflammatory cytokines, soluble
      cellular adhesion molecules, which further resulted in an improvement in exercise capacity in
      CHF patients.

      Heart rate recovery (HRR) improved in patients who were enrolled in the cardiac
      rehabilitation stage 2 program while similar outcomes were not noted among the control group.
      It was concluded that cardiac rehabilitation exercise program improves heart rate recovery.
      Also, HRR may be used in a cardiac rehabilitation program to recognize high risk factors and
      also useful in evaluating the outcomes.

      a systematic review about the effects of exercise training in patients with CHF was published
      who concluded that short-term physical exercise training in selected subgroups of patients
      with CHF, has physiological benefits and positive effects on quality of life.

      A meta-analysis by the Collaborative Group concluded that there is no evidence that
      supervised medical training programs for patients with CHF are dangerous and indeed there is
      clear evidence of an overall reduction in mortality. The authors did not perform a
      quantitative analysis on the outcome of cardiac performance, exercise capacity, or quality of
      life.
