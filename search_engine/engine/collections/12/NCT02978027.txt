      placing them at risk for a variety of physical, mental health, and social consequences. More
      than 50% of alcohol health consequences occur in risky, non-dependent drinkers. Increasing
      the efficacy and efficiency of brief interventions in medical setting could significantly
      reduce the public health impacts of risky drinking. Despite overall positive findings for
      brief interventions, there are high levels of variability in effects, with meta-analyses
      reporting significant unexplained heterogeneity in outcomes that is likely accounted for by
      differences in intervention components and strategies. There is intense interest in
      conducting motivational interviewing (MI) informed brief interventions for risky alcohol use
      in medical settings, but little empirical information is available regarding which MI
      behavioral and interpersonal style components drive effectiveness.

      Following promising efficacy trials from counseling applications, MI was translated into
      brief (5-15 minute) interactions and subjected to randomized controlled trial methodology.
      Lack of mixed-methods, Stage 1 treatment development is evidenced by our inability to provide
      consistent delineation of key intervention components and mechanisms of action. Variability
      in these factors is likely responsible for the wide variability in effects observed in
      meta-analyses of brief interventions. Many MI skills and behaviors require significant
      training and supervision and increased patient-provider interaction time. The field would
      benefit greatly from empirically-based Stage 1 treatment development and modeling studies to
      delineate the degree to which adding motivational interviewing components to brief
      intervention improves outcome.
