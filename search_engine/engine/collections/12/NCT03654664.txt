    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety after one primary
      dose and one additional dose (administered twice in total at an interval of 6 months) of
      inactivated hepatitis A vaccine are administered in Korean healthy children aged 12-23
      months.

      For this, a two-group comparison study will be conducted using a previously approved
      inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix Inj., manufactured by GSK) as the control vaccine to
      prove that the immunogenicity of the test vaccine treatment group is not inferior to the
      control vaccine treatment group and to statistically confirm that there is no difference in
      safety.
