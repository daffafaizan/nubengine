      which can perform noncontact, noninvasive, real time, cross-sectional imaging of the retina
      and anterior eye. OCT has displaced ophthalmoscopy and stereo-photography as the
      gold-standard for clinical assessment and documentation of retinal microanatomy including
      thickness, cystoid structures, subretinal fluid and retinal traction. Despite these benefits,
      new technologies can still benefit patients including increasing the resolution, imaging
      speed, and contrast of OCT technologies. Since 2013, Dr. Tao's group has worked to develop
      and translate new ophthalmic imaging technologies.

      The goal of this proposal is to develop novel OCT technology for improved diagnostic
      sensitivity in ophthalmology. Specifically, we will develop novel OCT imaging and
      image-processing methods to improve imaging speed and quality. Successful completion of this
      project will improve clinical diagnostics of ophthalmic diseases. Pre-clinical validation of
      system performance and ergonomics is a valuable step is clinical imaging technology
      development. The aim of this project is to performance system iterations on next-generation
      ophthalmic OCT imaging technologies over current-generation imaging systems on healthy adult
      volunteers prior to clinical translation. While system resolution, contrast, and speed can be
      (and will be) evaluated using calibration standards and phantoms, in vivo human imaging in
      healthy subjects is necessary to establish a baseline for system performance and image
      quality prior to clinical translation.
