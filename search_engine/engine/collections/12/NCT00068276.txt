        -  Determine the efficacy of cholecalciferol, in terms of hematological improvement, in
           patients with low- or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on disease symptoms, fatigue, and the overall
           health-related quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral cholecalciferol once daily. Treatment continues for 6 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
