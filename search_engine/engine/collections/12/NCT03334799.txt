      impaired load transfer across the lumbopelvic region. This can result in lower back pain as
      well as poor biomechanical adaptation during walking. Sacroiliac (SI) belts have typically
      been prescribed in order to mitigate pain and improve load transfer in individuals with SI
      joint dysfunction. It has been speculated that SI belts have the ability to instantaneously
      increase joint stability, and as a result improve load transfer and muscle activation and
      recruitment. However, this speculation is primarily based on anecdotal evidence; there is
      little biomechanical research supporting the effects of wearing an SI belt. In order to gain
      an improved understanding of the biomechanical effects of wearing an SI belt, the
      investigators propose to conduct a study with the following key objectives:

        1. Determine if there are differences with respect to neuromuscular, kinematic, or pressure
           patterns during walking and/or standing between healthy stable individuals and
           individuals with SI joint dysfunction

        2. Determine if wearing an SI belt affects neuromuscular, kinematic, or pressure patterns
           during walking and/or standing in women with sacroiliac instability

      Variables measured will include:

        1. Kinematics will be collected to quantify posture and joint angles

        2. Kinetics will be collected to quantify ground reaction forces

        3. Plantar pressure will be collected to quantify force distribution and center or pressure

        4. Joint moments (Lumbar-pelvic and Hip) will be added as variables. The investigators will
           use inverse dynamics to calculate various joint moments during walking.
