      up to 2 static skull-base to mid-thigh scans post injection of [18F] (2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine
      ([18F]F-GLN). A baseline FDG-PET/CT will also be performed, either as a routine clinical
      staging/re-staging scan or as a research scan. If performed as a research scan, the scan may
      include an optional dynamic imaging session. Some subjects, who undergo systemic therapy as
      part of their clinical treatment, may also undergo an optional second [18F]F-GLN PET/CT to
      collect pilot data on the changes in [18F]F-GLN uptake in response to therapy. Subjects who
      undergo a second [18F]F-GLN PET/CT may have a second FDG-PET/CT, again either as a
      standard-of-care restaging study or as an optional research scan. The timing of the optional
      second PET scans will vary depending on the type of treatment the subject is receiving.
