      physical therapist-led model for non-specific low back pain. Evidence exists that patients
      are eager to play an active role in decisions concerning their health. Recent evidence from
      research supports the benefit of decision aides for consumers, especially those that were
      accurate and refined to the specific problems of each patient. In our proposed randomized
      controlled trial (RCT), one group of patients in the study will have the opportunity to drive
      choices within their healthcare model; but only after receiving useful information on what
      the consequences of their selections will be. Patients will receive decision making
      information to assist in making an informed choice. The structured information will organize
      known results from the research literature to assist patients in understanding the likely
      outcome of their condition and what they need to adequately manage their own care. The
      control group of patients will receive the Physical therapist-directed care model that is
      presently used and has shown success. Patient outcomes will involve patient self report of
      improvement and whether or not the patient pursued care for the same condition over a 1 year
      period of time.
