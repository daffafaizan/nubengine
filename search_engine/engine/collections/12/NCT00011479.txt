      abacavir based on weight that are higher for children than for adults. There are insufficient
      data to determine whether the pediatric or adult dose is more appropriate for HIV-infected
      adolescent patients. This study measures pharmacokinetic data for abacavir in the adolescent
      population so that an appropriate dosage can be determined.

      Patients are evenly enrolled into 2 groups based on Tanner Stage. Group I patients are Tanner
      Stage 1 or 2 (pre-pubertal). Group II patients are Tanner Stage 3, 4, or 5 (pubertal). Each
      patient receives a single oral dose of abacavir given as the commercially available oral
      solution. Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected before dosing and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
      2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose for abacavir concentrations.
