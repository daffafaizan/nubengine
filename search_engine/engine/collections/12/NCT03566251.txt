      stability and trunk position sense in PwMS and healthy controls and investigating the
      relationship between core stability and trunk position sense with balance and functional
      mobility in PwMS.

      45 PwMS and 29 healthy volunteers with matching ages and genders were included the study.
      Balance was assessed by Biodex Biosway Portable Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems Inc.,
      Shirley, New York). Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests were used to evaluate functional mobility.
      Core endurance and core strength, which are two specific components of core stability, were
      evaluated separately. Trunk flexor, trunk extensor, right and left side bridge and prone
      bridge tests were applied to assess the endurance of the core muscles. The power of core
      muscles was evaluated with sit-ups and modified push-ups tests. Trunk position sense was
      evaluated by the trunk reposition test with Dualer IQ digital inclinometer (J-TECH medical,
      Salt Lake City, UK, USA).
