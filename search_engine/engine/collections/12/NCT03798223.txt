    
      A randomized controlled trial in which individuals scheduled for SLT are randomized to one of
      four treatment protocols, which represent the most common variants of the treatment in
      clinical use.

      Treatment is performed either at 360 degrees or 180 degrees and with a laser energy level
      either 0,1 millijoules (mJ) below the microbubble formation limit ("low" energy) or at a
      level that gives microbubbles at 50-75% of laser effects ("high" energy). This gives four
      treatment arms: 180/low, 180/high, 360/low and 360/high. Group allocation is masked for the
      patient and is coded in the records.

      The results for short and long term treatment effects are compared between the groups, as
      well as the complication rate and postoperative discomfort.
