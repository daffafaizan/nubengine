      about experiences with ovarian cancer on psychological and physical outcomes in
      English-speaking women with a history of ovarian cancer. It will also examine how certain
      individual characteristics may impact the effectiveness of the writing interventions for
      different women. After completing an initial survey, women will be asked to write about their
      experiences with ovarian cancer on 4 separate occasions of 20-25 min each in the course of 2
      weeks. A final survey will be completed one month after the last writing session. The entire
      study will be conducted online.
