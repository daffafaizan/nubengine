      the Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Wellness Program at Naval Medical Center San Diego
      (NMCSD), significantly reduces both psychological symptoms (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety,
      negative affect, lack of positive affect) and physical symptoms (e.g., pain, sleep) among
      active-duty service members. Psychological and physical symptoms will be assessed before
      beginning the surf program and at program completion. In addition, brief assessments of mood
      and symptoms will be completed before and after each individual surf therapy session.
