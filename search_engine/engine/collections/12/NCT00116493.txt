      (hemoglobin, Hb< 70 g/L) is of special concern as it poses a significant health and mortality
      risk. Pregnant women and young children (6-24 months of age) are the two groups at highest
      risk. Severe anemia in pregnant women is associated with an elevated risk of maternal and
      perinatal mortality as well as case fatality. Pakistan, the country in which this study is
      ongoing, may harbor the highest prevalence of severe anemia in South Asia, with as high as
      15% being reported among pregnant women. Comparable rates (11-12%) are also seen among 6-24
      month old children. Iron deficiency is one of the major causes of anemia in young children
      and pregnant women in South Asia. In addition to iron, deficiency of vitamins such as folic
      acid, vitamin A, vitamin C, riboflavin and vitamin E can also inhibit erythropoiesis. Apart
      from these nutritional causes, two other infectious causes of severe anemia are malaria and
      geohelminths. The current international recommendation for treatment of anemia includes iron
      and folic acid but not other vitamins.

      Comparisons: Severely anemic pregnant women and children 6-24 months are randomized to
      receive enhanced treatment of deworming and multivitamins over and above the standard of care
      of iron-folic acid using a 2x2 factorial design.
