      stimulation. Early ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs during luteal phase of
      controlled ovarian stimulation within 9 days after human chorionic gonadotropin trigger and
      reflects an acute consequence of this hormone on the ovaries.Ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome prevention is a multistage process and more important than treatment.Recently the
      administration of GnRH antagonists during the luteal phase of in vitro fertilization cycles
      offers another therapeutic modality for patients with severe early OHSS.However, preventive
      administration of GnRH antagonist for high risk OHSS patients from the day of oocyte
      retrieval is not investigated. Besides, the relevant mechanism is not clear yet. Here we
      designed a prospective randomized study to investigate whether GnRH anatagonist treatment
      after oocyte retrieval is more effective in preventing early ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome development than traditional aspirin preventive administration in women at high risk
      for OHSS.
