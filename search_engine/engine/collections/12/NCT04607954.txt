      I. To evaluate whether combination of durvalumab with topotecan can increase the 6-month
      survival in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who have progressed after
      initial combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and toxicity of durvalumab and topotecan in patients with extensive
      stage small cell lung cancer who have progressed after initial combination of chemotherapy
      and immunotherapy.

      II. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of this approach by assessing
      overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:

      I. Blood and tissue will be banked for future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and topotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients without disease progression are followed up at
      30 days, every 6 weeks until disease progression, and then every 3 months thereafter for up
      to 5 years from enrollment. After completion of study treatment, patients with disease
      progression are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years from enrollment.
