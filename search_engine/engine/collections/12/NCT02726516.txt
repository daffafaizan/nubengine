    
      Twenty young active males will be recruited and randomized to either placebo or PRJ-205.
      Subjects will take the designated treatment in an acute dosage and chronically, 4 days of
      treatment.

      They will undergo 3 exercise tasks (before the administration of the product, 1.5h after the
      acute administration of the product and after 4 days of treatment). VO2max and anaerobic
      threshold will be measured during the tests. Blood samples will be taken to measure muscle
      damage and oxidative stress.
