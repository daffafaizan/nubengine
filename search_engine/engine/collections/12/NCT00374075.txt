      with severe, intermediate, and mild phenotypes. Primary outcome measures includes laboratory
      and physical examination assessments to monitor effects on liver, hematologic, metabolic and
      nutritional status. Secondary outcomes includes measures of gross motor function;
      electrophysiologic measures of denervation; DEXA estimates of body composition, bone mineral
      density and content; measures of pulmonary function; and quantitative SMN mRNA and protein
      levels in blood cells. Subjects will need 2-3 baseline visits over a 3 -6 month period prior
      to enrollment. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months on treatment.
