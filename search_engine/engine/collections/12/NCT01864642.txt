      Approximately 2.8 million Americans have been diagnosed with glaucoma. Based on pilot studies
      and the clinical experience of the PI, a power analysis indicated that in order to lower IOP
      by 4 mm Hg 28 subjects would be needed, 14 in the experimental group and 14 in the
      control/comparator group.

      The intervention is OMT. Based on the anatomy of the eye and the dysfunctions underlying
      primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the presumed mechanisms are one or the other or a
      combination of the following. 1) Anatomic: the OMT benefit may occur by the biomechanical
      restoration of drainage through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. 2) Neurologic:
      the OMT may affect the parasympathetic innervations from the Edinger-Westphal fibers via the
      cranial nerve III as well as the sympathetic innervations arising in the T1 to T3 levels then
      via the superior cervical ganglion which then course to the eye.

      The OMT protocol takes 25-27 minutes to administer and addresses cranial, cervical, upper
      body, spinal and sacral structures designed to affect the anatomic, physiologic processes
      (e.g. lymphatic drainage from the neck and face), neurologic structures (sympathic and
      parasympathetic) affecting visual processes. A very similar OMT protocol was used in a study
      on healthy elder and resulted in improved balance and equilibrium. In that study there were
      no adverse outcomes reported.

      The control/comparator subjects will lay on the OMT table for the same 25-27 minutes in the
      same time periods in which experimental subjects were in the prone, lateral recumbent, and
      supine positions.
