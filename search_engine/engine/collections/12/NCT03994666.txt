      analysis: Descriptive statistics for the rate of patients with high grade AEs (grade 2 and
      more), related to the cell implantation will be computed in each arm, with its two-sided 95%
      CIs.

      Each dose arm will be compared to the control arm by computing the absolute difference and
      the relative risk between the active dose arm and the control arm, together with their 95%
      two-sided CIs.

      The p-values for the comparisons of the difference between the observed absolute rate to 0
      and of the relative risk to 1 will be computed, but it is not expected that the study will
      have sufficient power to detect a significant difference on either of the two statistics
      (absolute difference or relative risk).

      Primary efficacy analysis: The primary efficacy criterion (TcPO2) will be compared between
      each dose group versus the control group to test for a superiority of MSC over control.

      The tested hypotheses are:

        -  Null hypothesis: mean (MSC dose i) â‰¤ mean (Control)

        -  Alternative hypothesis: mean (MSC dose i) > mean (Control) A mixed - model for repeated
           measures will be used to model the evolution of TcPO2 over time. The significance of the
           time by treatment interaction will be used to test the two hypotheses. Model adjusted
           means (LS means) and their differences between treatment arms will be computed at each
           timepoint.

      The LS-Means for change from baseline to 180 days will be used as the primary efficacy
      endpoint.

      Other efficacy analyses: the same analysis model (mixed - model for repeated measures) will
      be used for all the other continuous efficacy endpoints.
