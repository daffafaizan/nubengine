      phlebotomy, both regarding the impact on the reduction in iron overload as well as reduction
      in patient "burden". Aspects of cost effectiveness will be included in the final analysis.
      The results of the study would allow decision-making based on Evidence Based Medicine on the
      "best" therapeutic options available for newly-diagnosed as well as existing primary
      hemochromatosis patients.
