      Check for signs of enlarged vitiligo lesions at 3-month intervals for a total period of 12

      An independent evaluator will obtain the score of vitiligo area (Vitiligo Extent Score) from
      comparing clinical photographs of before registration and after the clinical trial, and judge
      whether vitiligo is recurred. This study is a randomized controlled trial, and the
      investigators plan to compare the recurrence rates of the experimental and control groups
      using the Chi-squared test.
