      schools that will be divided into two groups. Both groups will receive the same
      exercise-based intervention. The experimental group will receive, in addition to exercise, an
      intervention based on pain neuroscience education. The intervention will consist of 1 session
      per week during 8 weeks and will be applied in small groups.

      The intervention will be performed in a blended-learning format. Five sessions will be
      face-to-face with up to 45 minutes duration, performed at school and incorporated into
      physical education classes and 3 will be performed at home, supported by v√≠deos sent by
      WhatsApp. The first two sessions will always be face-to-face. Face-to-face sessions will be
      interspersed with WhatsApp sessions.

      Participants will be assessed, by online questionnaires, for sociodemographic aspects, pain
      characterization and physical activity level, disability, sleep, catastrophizing, fear of
      movement, self-efficacy, central sensitization and knowledge on pain neurophysiology. In
      addition, 3 muscle tests will be performed for the deep neck flexor and extensor muscles and
      scapular stabilizers, and the pressure pain thresholds in the neck and at distance will be
      assessed.
