    
      AKI is characterised by upregulation of competing pro-survival and pro- inflammatory/
      apoptotic signaling pathways whereby processes associated with renal recovery; tubular
      epithelial phenotypic change and proliferation occur simultaneously with those associated
      with diminished GFR, vascular inflammation, tubular dysfunction and epithelial apoptosis.
      Protection from AKI can be achieved by altering the balance of these pathways; for example
      upregulation of the pivotal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - serine-threonine protein kinase B
      (PI3K-Akt) pro-survival pathway following the administration of erythropoietin or insulin
      like growth factor inhibits experimental AKI following renal ischaemia and reperfusion in
      rodents and swine. In our own work we have shown that post cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) AKI
      in swine can be prevented by the administration of either a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5)
      inhibitor which promotes cell survival and endothelial homeostasis via augmentation of
      endogenous nitric oxide (NO) signalling, or by the inhibition of endothelin-1 (ET-1), an
      important pro-inflammatory mediator and promoter of oxidative stress in renal injury How
      these competing pathways are regulated in patients at risk of AKI is poorly understood
      however, and it is our belief that the identification of these processes will facilitate the
      development of new and effective prevention and treatment strategies for AKI and improved
      outcomes for patients
