      or malignant cells as seen in viral and autoimmune diseases and in the rare spontaneous
      remissions of cancer. However, T cells are easily tolerized to self or tumor antigens and
      "immune surveilÂ¬lance" has manifestly failed in every cancer that is clinically apparent. It
      is the goal of this study to supply the specificities and affinities to patient T cells
      without regard for their "endogenous" T cell receptor repertoire, directed by
      antibody-defined recognition to kill malignant cells based on their expression of antigen. We
      will achieve this by preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to
      yield "designer T cells" from normal patient cells. Prior studies in model systems
      demonstrated that recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified T cells to respond to antigen
      targets with IL2 secretion, cellular proliferation, and cytotoxicity, the hallmarks of an
      effective, self-sustaining immune response. It therefore becomes of paramount interest to
      extend these studies to a human system of widespread clinical relevance to explore the
      clinical potential of this new technology. The target antigen for these studies is
      carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is prominently expressed on tumors of the stomach,
      colon and rectum, breast, pancreas and other sites.
