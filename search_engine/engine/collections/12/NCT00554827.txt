    
      This is a Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study designed to determine an
      effective and well-tolerated dose and schedule of pralatrexate when administered concurrently
      with vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation to patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL.
      The start of study treatment is defined as the initiation of pralatrexate. A patient may
      begin pralatrexate, provided he/she has methylmalonic acid (MMA) serum concentrations < 200
      nmol/L and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations < 10 Î¼mol/L at screening. If a patient has
      elevated MMA and/or Hcy concentrations, vitamin supplementation will be initiated at least 10
      days prior to pralatrexate initiation. Once the patient is on study, the dosing of vitamin
      supplementation must adhere to the schedule defined by the protocol. Vitamin supplementation
      will consist of vitamin BB12

      1 mg intramuscular (IM) every (q) 8-10 weeks, and folic acid 1 mg by mouth (PO) once a day
      (QD).
