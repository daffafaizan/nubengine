    
      The primary objective of this parallel group study is to demonstrate that the combined
      therapy of simvastatin and fenofibrate is superior compared to monotherapy with simvastatin
      based on the comparisons of change of TG levels after 12 weeks of treatment compared to
      baseline.

      Secondary objectives are to compare both treatment alternatives the combination therapy of
      simvastatin and fenofibrate to simvastatin monotherapy with respect to achievement the
      European Society of Cardiology 2011 (ESC 2011) non-HDL-C target (less than 2,6 mmol/l),
      change of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (apoB/apoA1) ratio, High-Density
      Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) and Uric Acid
      (UA) after 12 weeks and 52 weeks (1 year) of treatment compared to baseline.
