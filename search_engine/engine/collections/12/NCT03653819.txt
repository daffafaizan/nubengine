      lymph nodes, chemotherapy and radiation. Lymphedema is a consequence of impaired lymphatic
      drainage in the interstitium, which causes edema and inflammation in the subcutaneous tissue.
      The symptoms are swelling, puffiness, tightness, heaviness and pain in the affected area.

      Lymphedema can be reduced by complete decongestive therapy, which consists of skin care,
      manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging and exercise. At the end of treatment,
      patients are provided with custommade compression garments to be worn during daytime in order
      to maintain the reduction in the edema.

      Lymphedema has a negative impact on activities of daily living and health-related quality of
      life. Patients with lymphedema should be encouraged to engage in physical activity despite
      their condition in order to prevent relapse of cancer and development of other diseases.
      Likewise physical activity helps to maintain a healthy weight, which is important as obesity
      has a negative impact on lymphedema. The lymphatic system is also stimulated by physical
      activity and exercise and can reduce the symptoms from the lymphedema.

      Several studies have been published on the safety and benefits of exercise for women with
      breastcancer related lymphedema. However, only a few studies have investigated the
      feasibility of exercise to patients with lymphedema in the lower limbs. Also the role of
      compression garments during exercise have not been throughly explored.
