      educational interventions: (1) HealthyCHANGE, a behavioral approach focusing on building
      skills and increasing intrinsic motivation (based on cognitive-behavioral theory with
      motivational interviewing components); (2) SystemCHANGE, an innovative behavioral approach
      focusing on system re-design of the family environment and daily routines (based on
      social-ecological and personal process improvement theories); and (3) education-only
      (representing usual care, called Tools4CHANGE).

      In the main trial, approximately half of the children will also be in schools that take part
      in the We Run This City (WRTC)Marathon program, a school-based fitness program administered
      by the YMCA, and half will be in schools that do not take part in the WRTC program.

      This study will assess the impact of the interventions on the main trial's (1) primary
      outcome, Change in Body Mass Index (BMI). (2) secondary outcomes including diet, physical
      activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, body composition,
      fitness, and quality of life (3) mediators including : child's self-efficacy, social support,
      motivation, family problem solving ability, systems thinking, and self-regulation;(4)
      moderators including: socioeconomic status, demographic factors, environmental factors,
      personal and psychosocial characteristics of child and parent.
