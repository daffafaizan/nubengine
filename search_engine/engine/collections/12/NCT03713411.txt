      practice. Ureteral double J (DJ) stents are frequently used to relieve ureteral obstruction
      and almost as a routine part of the ureteroscopic procedures by many surgeons.

      DJ stent placement has the potential side effects such as flank pain and urinary tract
      infection (UTI) due to retrograde urine flow. As the bladder pressure increases during
      voiding, urine reflux occurs both beside and through the DJ stent. In order to overcome these
      problems, stents with antireflux mechanisms are produced, however these new stents comes with
      higher costs compared to conventional stents.

      Foley catheters are the hands and feet of all urologists and insertion of a foley catheter
      can easily keep the bladder pressures as low as required. The practice of insertion of a
      foley catheter into the urinary bladder after ureteroscopy for kidney or renal stones and DJ
      stent placement doesn't have an evidence-based background and it routinely depends on the
      choice of the surgeon.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether routine insertion of a bladder catheter
      following ureteroscopy and DJ stent placement can reduce stent-related problems due to reflux
      and urinary tract infections.
