    
      Up to 230 patients who benefited from the core study treatment (imatinib or nilotinib), at
      Investigator's discretion, were enrolled into this extension study. The patients continued
      receiving the open-label drugs that they were taken by the end of core study. Treatment arms
      in the core study were retained. No crossover between the arms was allowed.

      The extension study started from the first patient last dose date in the core study and ends
      at the time of nilotinib was commercially available in China as a first line treatment.
      Eligibility evaluations were given for each patient before the enrollment. Follow-up visits
      at a frequency of 6 months were required to report AE, SAE and pregnancy only. No efficacy
      data were collected in the extension study since full efficacy had already been analyzed in
      the core study.
