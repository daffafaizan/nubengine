      thrive during infancy, and by an insatiable appetite (hyperphagia), rapid weight gain and
      obesity in early childhood.

      Hyperphagia is one of the most prominent and debilitating features of PWS, and currently no
      pharmaceutical drug has been successful in decreasing appetite in such patients.

      tDCS is a safe, noninvasive method whereby a weak electric current is directly transmitted
      into the brain via external electrodes connected to a 9-volt radio battery. It is based on
      decades-old observations that nerve cell firing can be altered by low amplitude direct
      current (DC). The researchers in this study believe that tDCS may have a positive impact on
      hyperphagia and weight.

      In this study, the investigators intend to assess whether the effects tDCS differ between
      obese subjects, non-obese subjects, and subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome by measuring the
      amplitude and latency of eyeblink startle responses to a set of food- and non-food-related
      visual stimuli in all subjects, various hyperphagia questionnaires, and cognitive and
      behavioral assessments. It is hypothesized that as a group, subjects with Prader-Willi
      syndrome will demonstrate behavioral and psychometric evidence of abnormal food image
      processing, craving and associated behaviors relative to our control groups, and this group
      may receive potentially beneficial effects from tDCS sessions. Obese subjects are also
      predicted to have decreased hyperphagia and food cravings as a result of tDCS.
