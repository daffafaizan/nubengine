      age ( â‰¥40 vs < 40) to receive Dasatinib (100 mg/day) plus Quercetin (500 mg twice daily) on
      days 1, 2, 3, 30, 31, and 32 taken orally or Fisetin (20 mg/kg/day) alone on days 1, 2, 30
      and 31 taken orally. At the visit on day 7, we will assess blood CD3+ T lymphocyte p16^INK4A
      mRNA and other markers of inflammation and senescence to verify that senescent cells have
      been cleared by the intervention. Post-treatment follow-up will occur on day 60 (primary
      endpoints) and day 150 to assess the permanence of change after completion of the trial.
      Treatment adherence will be confirmed by the study coordinator who will administer the
      Dasatinib + Quercetin in clinic on days 1, 2, 3, 30, 31, and 32 or Fisetin alone on days 1,
      2, 30 and 31.
