    
      This registry is prospective, multi-center, observational study and will collect efficacy and
      safety data on multiple myeloma adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy
      and take REVLIMID as part of standard care associated with patients' treatment in order to
      characterize the use, efficacy and outcomes of REVLIMID treatment.

      The registry will capture data from 600 patients being prescribed REVLIMID in specified
      hospitals and all patients will be followed in the registry for two years after enrollment of
      the last patient.
