      (HPN). All commercially obtainable LEs are applicable for HPN in providing a source of energy
      and essential fatty acids. The originally used soyabean oil-based LE (Intralipid) have been
      suspected of being associated with a higher risk of pro-inflammatory lipid-mediator
      production due to their high content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The more modern
      mixes of soyabean oil, and/or olive oil, and/or fish oil LEs with beneficial responses
      compared with Intralipid are available. Given that there are no clear clinical
      recommendations for LE application in HPN, we performed this cross-over design, phase 4 study
      comparing ClinOleic, Lipoplus or SMOFlipid in chronic intestinal failure patients with
      additional escalation of fish oil using Omegaven.
