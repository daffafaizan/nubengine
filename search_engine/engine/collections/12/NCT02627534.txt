      impact on quality of life, longevity, and costs in public health. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030, 439 million people will suffer from diabetes,
      around 10% of the world adult population (WHO, 2011). Periodontal Diseases are considered the
      sixth complication of DM. This close relationship between both diseases is characterized by
      mutual influence. Thus, an appropriate control of periodontal disease may facilitate the DM
      control, improving quality of life on diabetes patients. Besides that, the presence of DM
      might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature, negative
      influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections.
      Consequently, knowledge of new dental therapies and the biology of dental treatments for
      chronic periodontitis in diabetic patients can enhance quality of life and make these
      treatments more adequate for this common profile of patients. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study is to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as
      adjunct to full-mouth debridement for the treatment of periodontitis in type 2 diabetic
      patients through a split-mouth randomized triple-blind clinical trial.
