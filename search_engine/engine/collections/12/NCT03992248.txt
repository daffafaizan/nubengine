      restricted to daytime. Interestingly, the majority of people spread their food intake over
      ~15 hours per day. This implies that most people experience a relatively short
      post-absorptive (fasting) state during night time. Normally, the body relies heavily on
      hepatic glycogen content to provide glucose and energy during the night, and glycogen stores
      will therefore decrease over night. In the morning, ingested carbohydrates will be taken up
      rapidly to replenish glycogen stores. It is hypothesized that in people with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) hepatic glycogen stores may not fully deplete overnight and that restricting
      food to a shorter period of time during the day will lead to a reduction of hepatic glycogen
      stores, and thereby improve whole-body insulin sensitivity at the beginning of the day.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if time restricted feeding (TRF) leads to
      a reduction in overnight-fasted hepatic glycogen stores and improvement in insulin
      sensitivity in adults with T2DM.
