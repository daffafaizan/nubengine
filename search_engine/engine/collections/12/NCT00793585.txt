      be a prospective, randomized study. Eligible IgAN patients will be randomized into the
      treatment group and the control group. Patients in treatment group will receive allopurinol
      and usual therapy. Patients in control group will receive usual therapy with placebo. If with
      hypertension, add the CCB and the Î²-blocker. Fasting uric acid, serum creatinine, albumin,
      routine blood test, urine microscopy and dipstick, proteinuria of 24 hours and blood pressure
      will be measured every month. After followed-up for 6 months, the curative effect of
      Allopurinol on blood pressure, proteinuria and the progression of IgA nephropathy will be
      evaluated.
