      of interest; (2) if there is an association between PSP and occupational and/or environmental
      chemical exposures functionally or structurally similar to known parkinsonian toxicants; and
      (3) if hypertension or traumatic brain injury prior to symptom-onset is associated with PSP.
      To disentangle the complex etiology of PSP, this case-control multicenter study involves 500
      PSP cases, 500 age/gender matched primary controls, and 500 secondary controls for genetic
      confirmation. Understanding the etiology of PSP may also help explain the causes of other
      related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. This multidisciplinary team of movement
      disorder specialists, epidemiologists, geneticists, biostatisticians, industrial hygienist
      and toxicologist is well suited to unravel the etiology of PSP.
