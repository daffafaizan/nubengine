      United Kingdom (UK) occurring each year. Most are in a predominantly young and working
      population. Where surgical reconstruction is required to repair the peripheral nerve injury,
      techniques employed have changed little in the last 50-60 years with many factors influencing
      the outcomes, such as age of patient, timing, level and extent of injury, method of repair
      and the surgeon's skill .

      Despite advances in microsurgical nerve repair techniques, functional recovery is often poor
      e.g. resulting impaired hand sensation, reduced motor function and frequent pain and cold
      intolerance. This can have a profound and permanent impact on the patient's recovery and
      subsequent quality of life. Nerve repair has significant health, social and cost implications
      with the treatment and rehabilitation of an employed person, estimated to be EUR 51,238.

      Peripheral nerve injury usually presents with nerve stumps that can be approximated in
      surgical repair: direct, end-to-end suture repair of the epineurium (neurorrhaphy). Excessive
      tension over the suture line leads to poor results; therefore when the nerve stumps cannot be
      approximated without tension, an alternative surgical method is required.

      Where the nerve gap exceeds more than 5 mm, there are two fundamental options, either 'nerve
      grafting' or 'tubulisation' using a bridging material. This trial will examine the
      first-in-man use of a new nerve conduit device 'Polynerve' to repair small nerve gaps in
      digital sensory nerves of the hand. Polynerve is a degradable co-polymer of Poly
      Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) and Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLA) which is shaped as a cylinder with a
      novel internal lumen consisting of a specific micro-grooved architecture.
