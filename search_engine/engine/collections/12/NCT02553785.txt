      establish the feasibility of using the BioVentrix Revivent TC System for the treatment of
      left ventricular dysfunction in appropriate cohorts of humans suffering from heart failure.

      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and functionality of a device that
      enables left ventricle (LV) volume and radius reduction through scar exclusion in appropriate
      patients suffering from systolic HF. Use of this device replicates the geometric
      reconfiguration of the ventricle achieved through surgical Left Ventricular Reconstruction
      (LVR), but on a beating heart, and creates the option of eliminating the use of
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

      The System utilizes anchors that are implanted into the scarred portion of the heart,
      rendering the ventricle smaller, and is employed in a cardiac surgical setting without the
      use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The Revivent TC anchors may be implanted through a sternotomy
      or through a mini-thoracotomy and jugular access. Eligible subjects will be limited to those
      whose ventricular dysfunction is due to ischemic cardiomyopathy caused, by a previous
      (greater than 90 days) myocardial infarction (MI) with acontractile (akinetic and/or
      dyskinetic) scar located in the antero-septal, apical (may extend laterally) region.
