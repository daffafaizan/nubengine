      tumors. Treatment with [177Lu]-DOTA-TATE consists of 4 cycles, with an infusion of 7.4 GBq
      (200mCi) every 8 weeks. An imaging protocol to study dosimetry throughout the cycles is
      essential to determine the average dose absorbed by critical organs and by tumor lesions. The
      critical organs studied in association with [177Lu]-octreotate treatment are predominantly
      kidneys and the bone marrow. In this open-label trial, 15 patients undergoing Lutathera®
      treatment could be enrolled in the study. Patients will have an abdominopelvic SPECT / CT
      recorded using a conventional Anger camera, followed by a whole-body SPECT / CT recording
      using a CZT camera. Recordings will be acquired at 24 hours, 96 hours and then at 7 days
      after the Lutathera® infusion that is administered during one of the 4 treatment cycles. The
      correlation between the dosimetry results and the appearance of possible grade 3 and 4 side
      effects will be established.
