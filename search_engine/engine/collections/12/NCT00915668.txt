      administered), single center randomized, drug-drug interaction study in healthy female
      volunteers of non-child bearing potential. A total of 32 volunteers will be enrolled. The
      study consists of a screening phase, an open label treatment period, and end of study/early
      withdrawal assessments. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences.
      The open-label treatment phase will consist of two periods. In each period, volunteers will
      receive either of the following treatment(s): Treatment A: a single dose of oral
      contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel (Ovral-L) on
      Day 1 and Treatment B: multiple daily doses of 10 mg JNJ-31001074 on Days 1 to 8 and a single
      dose of oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel
      (Ovral-L) on Day 7. A washout (no treatment break or drug holiday) period of 28 days
      separates the two occasions of single dose administration of oral contraceptives in Periods 1
      and 2. Safety and tolerability will be assessed from the time of informed consent to the
      end-of-study evaluations or early withdrawal. Volunteers will be instructed to report any
      serious adverse events that occur up to 30 days following the last dose of study drugs. For
      Treatment A, the volunteer will receive a single dose of oral contraceptive. For Treatment B,
      the volunteer will receive 10 mg tablet of JNJ-31001074 once daily orally for eight days
      (Days 1 to 8) and a single dose of oral contraceptive on Day 7.
