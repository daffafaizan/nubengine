      Conventional teaching dictates that it should be used with caution in patients with
      congestive heart failure due to its fluid and sodium retention effects. Surprisingly, despite
      the widespread prevalence of this belief within the medical community, there are few data to
      support it. In fact, several small animal studies have documented its striking diuretic
      effects due to increased renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate without changes in
      the glomerular filtration fraction. We design this study to determine whether glucocorticoids
      have a potent diuretic effect in patients with heart failure.
