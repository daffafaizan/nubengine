    
      Methods/design: A multicenter prospective randomized open-label clinical trial with blinded
      outcome evaluation (PROBE design) and blinded safety outcome assessment. The active
      comparison LAAO is tested against medical therapy in a 2:1 stratified randomization.

      Study population: Patients should have had an ICH within 6 months prior to enrollment and
      have NVAF with increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism, as indicated by a CHA2DS2VASc
      score >2. In total 750 patients will be included. Active enrollment ensues over 3 years
      followed by 5 years follow-up and a long-term follow-up at 10 years.

      Intervention and control: The intervention group will be treated by LAAO, using the Amplatzer
      Amulet device. Implantation requires a catheterization procedure using venous access and
      transseptal puncture and is guided by angiography, fluoroscopy and transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Recommended post-implant
      antithrombotic therapy includes aspirin (ASA) therapy for at least 6 months, with or without
      clopidogrel for the first 45 days after implantation. The control group will receive medical
      therapy, delivered according to national standards and guidelines at the treating physicians'
      discretion. This may include oral anticoagulation (OAC) (vitamin-K antagonists, VKA), non-VKA
      OAC, antiplatelet therapy or no antithrombotic therapy at all.

      Main study outcomes: The primary outcome is the composite endpoint of stroke (ischemic and
      hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, life-threatening or major bleeding and all-cause mortality,
      assessed over at least two years. Secondary outcome examines various early and late safety
      outcome parameters.
