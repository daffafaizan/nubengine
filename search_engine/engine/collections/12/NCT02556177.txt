      traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients using advanced applications for magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) developed by the Sponsor, GE Healthcare (GEHC), and corresponding clinical
      neuropsychological assessments. This data is intended for future use in development of
      specialized MR acquisition, reconstruction, and processing software intended to identify mTBI
      biomarkers.
