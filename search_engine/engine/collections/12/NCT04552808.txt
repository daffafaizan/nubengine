    
      A phase I, a single-center, non-randomized, open, single-dose administration study to explore
      the safety, pharmacokinetics of Yimitasvir phosphate capsules in subjects with moderate and
      severe liver function impairment and healthy subjects

      This study is divided into four cohorts, cohort A and cohort C in healthy subjects, cohort B
      for moderate liver function impairment participants, cohort D for severe liver function
      impairment, participants in cohort A and cohort B, group C and group D should be matched in
      terms of sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). A total of 32 subjects, 8 in each cohort, both
      male and female, are planned to be enrolled. If a complete PK blood sample is not collected
      due to subjects' early withdrawal from the study, new subjects will be enrolled to meet the
      pharmacokinetic parameters that can be evaluated for each cohort of 8 subjects.
