      blind, randomized controlled study. Patients will receive either 0.5g/kg of 20% intravenous
      (i.v.) mannitol infusion over 10 minutes immediately before induction of anesthesia (group M)
      or an equal volume of 0.9% normal saline instead (group C). Primary outcome measure is rSO2.
      Secondary outcome variables include extubation time, clinical assessment of consciousness
      recovery using the modified Observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale (OAA/S) and the
      mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for cognitive evaluation after recovery.
