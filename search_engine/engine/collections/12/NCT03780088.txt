      overcome the challenge of low availability of qualified providers as a barrier to treatment
      access, we have adapted TranS-C for online and mobile device delivery (referred to as
      mTranS-C), thereby leveraging the high rates of mobile phone and internet use in adolescents;
      (2) to further increase access we will disseminate mTranS-C within primary care services, a
      proven strategy for improving access to behavioral health care; and (3) we focus on
      low-income communities, where there is a higher prevalence of sleep problems and low access
      to services.
