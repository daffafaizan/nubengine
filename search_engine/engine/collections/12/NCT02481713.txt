      rehabilitation in Veterans with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Approximately 120
      individuals will be randomized to either a 2-session motivational interview (MI, experimental
      condition) or a 2-session assessment and feedback on learning styles (CI, active control),
      and will then be asked to participate in 4 months of cognitive rehabilitation. Booster MI or
      CI sessions will be administered monthly over the course of the cognitive rehabilitation.
      Primary outcome is number of cognitive rehabilitation sessions attended.
