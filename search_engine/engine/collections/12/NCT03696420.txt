      brain stimulation (DBS) in essential tremor, still remains invisible to imaging in spite of
      the development of new MR sequences. The coordinates currently used in the classical (ACPC)
      system are so imprecise that per-operative electrophysiology is mandatory to locate the exact
      position of this target. Micro-electrode recordings (MER) however improve hemorrhagic risk
      and may be poorly tolerated by patients operated on 7 to 8 hours under local anaesthesia.
      Based on litterature review, no one tried to retrieve the position of the VIM from anatomical
      landmarks coordinates in the era of MRI. The patients operated will be clinically tested to
      define those very well improved by the stimulation. Stimulation efficacy will be assessed by
      comparing the clinical evaluation (FTM scale) with and without stimulation, and the four
      contacts of each electrode will be tested clinically, with an accelerometer and an
      electromyography to determine which one is the most active on tremor. Coordinates of the
      anatomical landmarks will be calculated on the pre-operative MRI and those of the active
      plots on the fusion between post-operative CT-scan and pre-operative MRI. These coordinates
      will be analysed by machine-learning algorithms to create a model predicting the position of
      the active contacts from the coordinates of the landmarks.
