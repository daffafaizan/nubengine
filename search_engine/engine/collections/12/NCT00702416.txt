      (ENS) in terms of onset time for interscalene brachial plexus anesthesia.

      The main hypothesis is that direct visualization of neural structures under US guidance will
      grant better local anesthetic (LA) disposition around the roots of the plexus, thus improving
      onset times.

      Perineural catheters will be used to maintain regional analgesia for 48 hours after surgery.
      We hypothesize that US guidance may also help physicians place perineural catheters more
      precisely, thus improving analgesia in the following hours to days.

      Finally, we will investigate for possible differences in minor adverse events such as
      vascular puncture, pain during the anesthetic procedure.
