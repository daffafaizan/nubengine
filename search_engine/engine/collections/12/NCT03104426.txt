      (serial) IUT. The mainstay of postnatal treatment in HDN is (1) intensive phototherapy and
      exchange transfusion to treat hyperbilirubinemia and prevent kernicterus, and (2) top-up
      transfusions to treat anemia. Up to 80% of infants with HDN treated with IUT require at least
      one top-up transfusion for late anemia during the first 3 months of life.

      Several risk factors for late anemia have been reported, including serial IUT (due to bone
      marrow suppression), severity of HDN, reduced use of exchange transfusions during the
      neonatal period and reduced survival of transfused red blood cells. Finally, erythropoietin
      deficiency is also considered as a possible contributing factor to late anemia.

      EPO has been increasingly used in neonates to prevent or reduce neonatal anemia without short
      or long-term adverse effects. Several small studies and casuistic reports suggest that
      neonates with HDN may benefit from treatment with EPO to reduce the risk of delayed anemia
      and subsequent top-up transfusions. However, other authors found that EPO may be less
      effective than expected. Due to the lack of evidence, routine use of EPO is currently not
      recommended. To determine a role for EPO in this group of patients, a well-designed
      randomized controlled clinical trial of sufficient sample size is required. Potentially, EPO
      stabilizes the hemoglobin levels of these infants and thus prevents top-up transfusions and
      extra admissions, creating a more stable and natural postnatal course for patients with HDN.
