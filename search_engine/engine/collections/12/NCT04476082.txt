      the gastrointestinal tract. During chemotherapy there is a high risk of further impairment of
      nutritional status due to anorexia, nausea, emesis and other gastrointestinal conditions that
      adversely impact food assimilation or absorption. Findings on changes of nutritional status
      during chemotherapy are scarce but of paramount importance for adequate nutrition therapy.
      Therefore, this study aims to provide a detailed description of changes in nutritional status
      of patients with a malignant condition of the gastrointestinal tract during chemotherapy.
