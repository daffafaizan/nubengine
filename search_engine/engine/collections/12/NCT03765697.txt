      Treatment duration was up to 12 months. All participants applied lidocaine 5% medicated
      plaster (containing 700 mg lidocaine per plaster) topically at the site of the skin affected
      by painful PHN. Depending on the size of the affected skin area, up-to 3 plasters were
      simultaneously applied for up to 12 hours per day (with a plaster-free interval of at least
      12 hours). Study objectives of the main period were to evaluate the local and systemic safety
      profile and the analgesic efficacy of lidocaine 5% medicated plaster, and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and its metabolite 2,6-xylidine in the target population after
      multiple administrations of lidocaine 5% medicated plaster by means of population kinetics.
      The study results were planned to be evaluated descriptively.

      102 participants who were satisfied with the treatment in the main study period entered the
      open-label extension period with continued treatment. 27 sites in 12 countries participated
      in the extension period. Enrollment in the extension period coincided with last visit of the
      main period of the study. Treatment duration was up to 4.4 years in the extension period. The
      objective of the extension period was to evaluate the long-term local and systemic safety
      profile and the long-term analgesic efficacy of treatment with lidocaine 5% medicated plaster
      in the subpopulation who had completed 12 months of treatment in the open-label main study
      period.
