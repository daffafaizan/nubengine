    
      Clinical Phase: pre-CE study

      Design: A non-randomized confirmatory study on the visualization performance of the Ambu®
      aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia in 42 fully evaluable, adults subjects aimed at
      identification of known pathological findings (papillary bladder or small resectable lesion)
      detected with Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia and subsequently during a repeat
      procedure using a reusable rigid scope or resectoscope at the time of planned transurethral
      resection of bladder tumours (TURBT).

      Population: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) in the OR undergoing planned transurethral resection
      of bladder tumors TURBT

      Planned sample size: A total of 42 patients will result in a maximum (if the true proportion
      is 50 %) width of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the binary variable "Confirmed"
      to be 15%. This width is considered to be useful in the interpretations of the results from
      this investigation.

      Study duration: Screening, procedure and follow-up will take 15 days maximum

      Follow-up duration: Follow-up immediately after procedure

      Investigational Device: Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia Pre-CE, single use
      cystoscope.
