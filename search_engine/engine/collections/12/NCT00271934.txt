      production of antibodies that react with many different self-antigens. Defects in immune
      regulation underlie the breakdown in self-tolerance.(1) The clinical course of lupus is
      variable. Aggressive intervention is reserved for disease with characteristic high risk
      features including diffuse, proliferative glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage,
      cerebritis and other life-threatening manifestations of vasculitis. In patients with SLE and
      high risk features, we propose extension of current immunosuppressive therapy to the point of
      complete immune ablation and hematopoietic stem cell recovery.
