      athletes, lean and obese sedentary and type 2 diabetic individuals with the following
      objectives:

        1. assess metabolic flexibility as measured by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp

        2. measure in vivo mitochondrial function by MRS of phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery

        3. establish primary myoblast cell lines to correlate with the above in vivo measurements,
           as well as further explore dietary, pharmacological and genetic manipulations in vitro

        4. quantify intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and acetylcarnitine in vivo by MRS

      Study population:

      A total of 132 male participants (18-70 years) will participate in this study. The first
      group of 33 participants will be lean endurance-trained athletes, the second group will be
      lean sedentary control participants, the third group will be sedentary type 2 diabetic
      participants, and the last group of 33 participants will be obese, non-diabetic sedentary
      control participants. It is preferred to use male participants in order to minimize variation
      in the measurements by avoiding confounding factors such as hormones.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are differences in metabolic
      flexibility as measured by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, PCr recovery, IMCL and
      acetylcarnitines as measured by MRS and establishment of primary myoblast cell lines for
      future use.
