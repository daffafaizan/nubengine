    
      The study population includes patients 18 years of age or older with advanced HCC, Barcelona
      Clinic Liver Cancer stage B not eligible for locoregional therapy or stage C, and Child-Pugh
      A classification liver disease. Patients must not have received any prior systemic therapy
      for unresectable HCC.

      Patients in all treatment arms may continue receiving their originally assigned treatment, at
      the Investigator's discretion, until progression

      Patients in all arms with confirmed PD who, in the Investigator's opinion, continue to
      receive benefit from their assigned treatment and meet the criteria for treatment in the
      setting of PD may continue to receive their assigned treatment.

      If a patient discontinues study drug(s) due to disease progression, the patient will enter
      survival follow-up. Patients who have discontinued treatment due to toxicity or symptomatic
      deterioration or who have commenced subsequent anticancer therapy, will have tumor
      assessments until confirmed PD and will be followed for survival.
