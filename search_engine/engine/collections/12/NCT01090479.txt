      the prevention of perioperative infections. However, it's use in shoulder surgery has not
      been published up to this point. The shoulder has a unique microbial flora due to the
      prevalence of Propionibacterium acnes, a bacteria implicated in surgical site infections
      after shoulder surgery. This study is designed to examine the efficacy of using a
      preoperative Sage 2% chlorhexidine cloth in reducing bacterial load in the pre-operative area
      as well as in reducing post-operative surgical site infections after shoulder surgery. This
      study will compare the rate of post-operative infections and also the rate of positive skin
      cultures. The skin cultures will be obtained in the preoperative area from subjects who used
      the Sage 2% Chlorhexidine cloth protocol pre-operatively (n=50) versus those who used only
      soap and water (n=50).
