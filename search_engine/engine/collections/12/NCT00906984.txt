    
      This protocol provides TheraSphere treatment for patients with liver cancer who cannot be
      treated by surgery. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be evaluated for eligibility
      for this treatment with the following: physical examination, medical history, blood tests
      requiring approximately 2 tablespoons of blood, EKG, CT or MR of chest to examine lungs, CT
      or magnetic resonance (MR) of abdomen to evaluate liver, stomach and intestines, and bone
      scan to rule out spread of disease to bones. If eligible on initial screening, patients will
      proceed to a second stage of screening, including an hepatic angiogram to confirm treatment
      can be provided safely and to highlight the blood vessels supplying the liver, and a nuclear
      medicine study (Tc-99m MAA scan) to display the blood flow to the lungs, stomach and
      intestines.

      When it is determined treatment can be delivered safely, patients will receive TheraSphere
      via the hepatic artery through blood vessels supplying the liver on an outpatient basis.
