      existing restorations in DPBRN practices; (2) quantify the percentages and types of
      restorative materials of failed restorations that are being replaced in DPBRN practices; (3)
      quantify the percentages and types of restorative materials used to replace or repair failed
      restorations in DPBRN practices; and (4) test the hypothesis that DPBRN
      practitioner-investigators who reported in a previous study that they treat enamel lesions
      operatively are more likely in actual patients as in this study to replace entire
      restorations rather than do repairs and are more likely to report the clinical diagnosis of
      secondary caries as a reason for replacement.
