    
      All eligible patients with invasive squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma
      of the cervix, Stages I-B2, II-B, III-B, and IV-A, will experience clinical staging as
      permitted by FIGO staging criteria.

      Primary Objective:

      Feasibility and toxicity of administering weekly Topotecan among patients with carcinoma of
      the cervix receiving concurrent pelvic radiation and Cisplatin.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      To assess the efficacy of administering weekly Topotecan to patients with carcinoma of the
      cervix receiving concurrent pelvic radiation and Cisplatin on:

        -  progression-free survival,

        -  overall survival, and

        -  local control

      Statistic This is a feasibility study. A two phase accrual will be utilized. If none or 1 of
      the 6 patients in the first Stage of accrual finish the prescribed therapy in over 8 weeks,
      then the second Stage of accrual (an additional 6 patients) will increase the Topotecan dose
      to 3 mg//m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and once during parametrial boost (6 cycles). If 2 or 3
      of the patients in the first stage of accrual finish the prescribed therapy in over 8 weeks,
      the dose of the Topotecan will remain the same in the second Phase of accrual. If 4 or more
      of the patients in the first stage of accrual finish the prescribed therapy in over 8 weeks,
      there will be no second phase of accrual.
