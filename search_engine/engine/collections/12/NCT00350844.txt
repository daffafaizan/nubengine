      regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) on echocardiogram, is a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, both the prevalence and optimal
      treatment of pulmonary hypertension in children and young adults with SCD are unknown.

      We hypothesize that short term therapy with hydroxyurea will decrease TRJV in children and
      young adults with pulmonary hypertension found on screening. Patients eligible for treatment
      will have had evidence of pulmonary hypertension on at least 2 screening echocardiograms.
      Baseline laboratory tests will be obtained and other causes of secondary pulmonary
      hypertension will be excluded prior to initiation of treatment. Patients will be treated with
      hydroxyurea according to a standard dose escalation schedule for a total of 12 months. A
      clinic visit will be required every 2 months and standard screening for toxicity will be
      performed monthly. There will be an interim analysis of the primary outcome at 6 months
      following therapy.
