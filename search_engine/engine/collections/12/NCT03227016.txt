    
      For this study sensitive or refractory SCLC patients (refractory to prior chemotherapy
      defined as having experienced no response or a relapse within 90 days after the end of
      chemotherapy) will be eligible. In total, around 130 patients will be enrolled, around 30
      evaluable patients in phase I and 100 patients in phase II.

      The study will consist of two parts:

      A preceding Phase I part will be performed to identify the Recommended Dose of veliparib to
      be administered in the Phase II part in combination with topotecan at the dose regimen of
      1.25 mg/m2 (on days 1-5 of a 3 week cycle [d1-5q21d]). Each patient will be subjected to an
      initial cycle of topotecan monotherapy (1.25 mg/m2 on day 1-5 of a 3 week cycle); this run-in
      cycle shall prove topotecan tolerance of the candidates. Only patients who do not reveal any
      DLTs receive further treatment with combination therapy. In a dose-escalating 3+3 design the
      RD of veliparib for the subsequent Phase II part of the study will be defined during a
      maximum of 5 cycles combination therapy.

      The Phase II part will follow upon completion of Phase I.
