      developmental disorder of enamel characterized by hypo mineralization -of systemic origin -
      affecting the enamel of first permanent molars (PFM) ,frequently associated with affected
      permanent incisors.

      The prevalence of MIH varies widely, ranging from 2.4 % to 40.2% in different populations.
      This wide variation may be due to differences in diagnostic criteria and methodologies used
      by the authors. Concerning the etiology of MIH it is mostly related to pre natal, perinatal,
      and post natal illness.

      Asthma and asthmatic drugs have been proposed to be one of the etiological factors of
      MIH,Internationally, the mean prevalence of pediatric asthma is 10%.
