      Project. WATCH was a randomized trial among 587 African American members of 12 rural North
      Carolina churches that demonstrated the effectiveness of a mailed tailored print and video
      intervention consisting of four individually tailored newsletters and targeted videos to
      improve diet and physical activity behaviors: there were significant improvements in fruit
      and vegetable consumption (0.6 servings) and recreational physical activity (2.5 MET-hours
      per week), and a non-significant decrease in fat intake in the intervention churches. The
      overall goal of this application is to conduct a study (called "eWellness") to investigate
      whether the WATCH tailored print messages and videos can be effectively and efficiently
      disseminated to a different population (breast and colon cancer survivors) and using a
      different delivery channel (electronic technology via the internet and world wide web.
