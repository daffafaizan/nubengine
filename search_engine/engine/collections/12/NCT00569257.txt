      hormones are found commonly in epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers. LHRH and its
      receptors are expressed in about 80% of human ovarian and endometrial cancers. As binding
      sites are present on tumors in higher concentrations than on most normal tissues, these
      receptors represent a specific target for AEZS-108 in which doxorubicin is coupled to an LHRH
      analog.

      Patients whose tumor specimen have shown to be positive for LHRH receptor expression will be
      investigated for tumor response and tolerability.
