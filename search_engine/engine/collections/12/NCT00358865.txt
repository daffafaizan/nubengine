      Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI) comparing their performance with
      the performance of normally developing children, matched by age, gender,sector and parents'
      education. subjects' age: 6 - 12 years old. The trial shall include 15 subjects in each
      group. ABI subjects are hospitalized at Sheba Hospital's Pediatric Rehabilitation Department.

      Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The subjects in the trial
      group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during a period of a week to
      10 days, to check the practice effect. In addition, all subjects will be tested in three
      tests: "PEDI" - to evaluate the functional abilities of daily living (dressing,
      eating...),The "Melbourne Assessment" - to evaluate functional movements of upper
      extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate difference attention abilities.

      Correlations between those tests to the performance in the VR experiences will be checked
      with Pearson's statistical correlation tests. The differences between the trial group (ABI
      children) and the control group will be checked with Independent t-tests.
