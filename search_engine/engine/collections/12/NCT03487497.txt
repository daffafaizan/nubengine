      undergo a clinical exam (inspection and palpation of the foot, measurement of bilateral
      passive ankle range of motion). All participants will complete the Short Form (SF)36 and the
      Foot Function Index20 to obtain pain and functional scores (approximate duration: 30
      minutes). Participants will be able to familiarize with treadmill walking at their preferred
      walking speed. Surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally over the tibialis anterior,
      gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, soleus, and peroneus brevis. Isokinetic muscle strength
      in ankle plantarflexion/ dorsiflexion and inversion/eversion will be tested using the Biodex
      system 4 Pro (approximate duration: 45 minutes). Reflective surface markers will be placed
      bilaterally on anatomic landmarks according to the Plug In Gait model and a specific foot
      model. These markers are seen by 6 Vicon MX cameras. Participants will be asked to stand on
      the treadmill (h/p cosmos, Zebris), and data for a standing reference trial will be
      collected. Single-limb heel rise performance with each leg will be tested on the treadmill
      while kinematic, electromyography (EMG), and pressure data will be measured. Participants
      will then walk barefoot for 2 minutes at 0% slope while kinematic, EMG, and pressure data
      will be recorded. Subsequently, the treadmill incline will be increased to 15%, and data for
      2 minutes walking at this slope will be recorded followed by three heel rises (approximate
      duration: 45 minutes). The estimated total time for each participant is 120 minutes.
