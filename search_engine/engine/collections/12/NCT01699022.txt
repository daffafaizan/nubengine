      given the commercial rights to Cyclofem® by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use
      internationally. The brand names that the Concept Foundation has registered internationally
      include Cyclofem®, and Novafem® (Pharmacia Pharmaceuticals, Peapack NJ, formerly (Pharmacia
      and Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Michigan). The company launched its product under license from
      Concept Foundation with their own brand name, Lunelle™ in the US market. Lunelle™ was
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, 2000 following which
      approximately 350,000 women had used the product. However, following the acquisition of
      Pharmacia and Upjohn by Pfizer and due to several production problems, Pfizer withdrew
      Lunelle™ from the United States (US) market. Concept Foundation has licensed Sun
      Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Mumbai, India to manufacture and market Cyclofem® in India and
      other developing countries. United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approval of
      Cyclofem® is pivotal to the ultimate acceptance of such products in many countries because of
      the rigorous standards applied by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drug safety and
      efficacy. This initial pharmacokinetic (PK) study is the first step on the road to Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) approval with the ultimate goal to expand the access and range of
      methods available to women in the public sector. Approval of Cyclofem® by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) would also allow the reintroduction of CICs to the
      United States (US) market.
