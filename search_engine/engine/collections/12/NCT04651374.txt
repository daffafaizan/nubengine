      coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as
      the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly become one of the
      fastest growing and deadliest diseases to surface due to its high death rate and ability to
      replicate and spread readily from people without symptoms. Recent evidence indicates that
      critically ill patients with COVID-19 experience a high risk of blood clots. Deep leg vein
      blood clots can travel to the lungs and cause severe lung failure and death. The geko™ device
      is a simple device that increases the return of blood flow from the lower legs and
      potentially decrease the risk of lung blood clots. Investigators believe the geko™ device may
      have an important benefit in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the risk of lung clots and
      decrease the risk of respiratory failure which is often the cause of death in COVID-19
      patients. In this study, Investigators plan to study the effect of using the geko™ device in
      COVID-19 patients and measure patient outcomes such as ICU admission and death. The findings
      of this study have the potential to decrease the complications seen in COVID-19 infections.
