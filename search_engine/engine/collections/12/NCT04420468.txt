      is observed. These children present with similar symptoms and seem to have similar clinical
      time course.

      This unexpected phenomenon needs to be extensively described in order to further the
      knowledge of unusual COVID-19 presentation in children.

      The study consists an extensive retrospective data collection from April 2020 till the end of
      the main SARS-Cov-2 outbreak, from medical file of children have exhibited acute myocarditis
      and cared in 4 pediatric intensive care units of Assistance Publique-HÃ´pitaux de Paris of
      Ile-de-France region.

      The study objectives are to descript clinical, biological and echocardiographic features of
      an acute myocarditis in children in the context of COVID-19 and to identify the underlying
      mechanism : direct viral damage and/or inadequate host response risk.
