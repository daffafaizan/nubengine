      incidence of 5-20% in the middle-aged population in Europe and Northern America .
      Pathophysiologic consequences of OSA are increased sympathetic activity, hypoxia,
      hypercapnia, increased left ventricular after-load , acute arterial hypertension, increased
      diastolic and systolic pressure of the right ventricle, atrial dilation. Recent studies have
      shown that OSA is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. OSA
      has a social impact because of fragmentation of sleep leads to increased daytime sleepiness,
      decreased intellect, behavioral and personality changes, enuresis and sexual dysfunction.

      Pulmonary hypertension is present in 12%-34% of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      syndrome. When PH occurs as a consequence of OSA however symptoms may not be present because
      of obesity and alack of physical exertion or symptoms of PH may be overlapped by other
      cardiovascular abnormalities.

      Continuous positive air way pressure therapy is the main standard treatment of OSA works the
      best in the most people as positive pressure ventilation functions as a pneumatic splint for
      the collapsing upper air way. Echocardiography is the most common non invasive imaging method
      for assessment the effect of right ventricular function.
