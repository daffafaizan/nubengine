      oral ZDV prophylaxis starting from 28 weeks gestation has been proven to be highly effective
      in reducing further mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT).

      However, post exposure nevirapine resistance mutations are observed in the mother's viral
      population. These mutations detectable very early after exposure tend to disappear over time.

      Nevertheless, they may be associated with decrease in efficacy of non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) containing regimens subsequently given to the women for their
      own health.

      Therefore, there is a need for research to prevent selection of resistance in the first place
      or to overcome the resistance in subsequent treatment of the infected mother or infant.

      Nevirapine plasma levels above IC50 have been detected in women exposed to a single 200 mg
      dose of nevirapine in a significant number of women during the third week postpartum.

      We hypothesize that giving ZDV+ddI to women exposed to nevirapine for one month as soon as
      possible after exposure may prevent the selection of nevirapine resistance mutations.
