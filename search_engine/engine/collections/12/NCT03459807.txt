    
      Blood Pressure Lowering in Dialysis (BOLD) is a pilot randomized controlled trial of 50
      maintenance hemodialysis patients in San Francisco and Seattle to test whether targeting a
      home systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg (versus a pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure <140
      mmHg) is feasible and safe. The study duration is 4 months and blood pressure targets will be
      achieved through dry weight adjustment and adjustment of standard anti-hypertensive therapies
      by the study team. The primary outcomes are focused on feasibility and safety. The home blood
      pressure treatment arm will also have the opportunity to utilize a blood pressure monitor
      with Bluetooth capabilities. The rates of utilization of mobile health technology in this
      population will also be assessed as an outcome. This pilot trial will provide key data to
      design a larger trial focused on clinical outcomes.
