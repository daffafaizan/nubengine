      smokers (≥ 5 cig/day) who are also heavy drinkers according to the National Institute on
      Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines: for men, > 14 drinks per week or ≥ 5 drinks
      per occasion at least once per month over the past 12 months; for women, > 7 drinks per week
      or ≥ 4 drinks per occasion at least once per month over the past 12 months. A total of 274
      participants will be randomized, 137 to each medication group.
