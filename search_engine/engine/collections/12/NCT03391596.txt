      problems among family caregivers. The proportion of elderly family caregivers is rapidly
      increasing which emphasizes the need for new support systems. Internet-delivered
      psychological interventions are one possible approach, offering benefits as they are more
      easily to achieve for family caregivers who often are home-bound with their relatives.

      This study will examine whether an Internet-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      intervention would be effective, firstly, on reducing depressive symptoms, and, secondly, on
      improving well-being of elderly family caregivers.The family caregivers' depressive symptoms,
      perceived burden, anxiety, quality of life, psychological flexibility, personality and
      physical performance will be studied by a quasi-experimental study design comparing three
      groups of family caregivers (Group 1, experimental: Internet-based ACT intervention; Group 2,
      active comparator: Standardized institutional rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center;
      Group 3, other: Support given by voluntary family caregiver associations). Data collection
      will be performed at three time points: pre, 4 months and post (10 months).

      Secondly, we also aim to examine demographics and psychological variables that could predict
      change in depression and perceived burden over time (pre, 4 months and post (10 months). A
      further aim of the study is to examine potential mediators on the effect of the interventions
      including psychological flexibility and suppression of thoughts. Moreover, we aim to study
      user experiences and satisfaction of the Internet-based program, i.e., how the family
      caregivers experience and accept the web-based ACT intervention.
