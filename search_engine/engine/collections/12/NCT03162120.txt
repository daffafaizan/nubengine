      properties that can suppress ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias including AF. The
      antiarrhythmic actions of RN are mainly attributed to its ability to block INa, INaL, and the
      rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr).7 In experimental studies, RN
      proved very effective in suppressing late phase 3 early afterdepolarization and delayed
      afterdepolarization mediated triggered activity in pulmonary vein sleeves.8 RN was shown very
      effective in suppressing persistent, vagally mediated AF in animal models.9 Clinical evidence
      of an AF-suppressing effect of RN comes mainly from small caliber studies. Murdock et al,
      reported a high conversion rate (72%) after administration of 2,000 mg of RN (in a
      "pill-in-the-pocket" fashion) in patients with short lasting (<48 hours) new onset paroxysmal
      AF.10 Our group demonstrated both the superior efficacy and the accelerated action of the
      combined therapy of Amiodarone with RN compared to Amiodarone alone in patients with
      paroxysmal AF. Notably, the efficacy benefit of this combination was more pronounced in
      patients with dilated left atria which is also more likely to occur in cases of persistent
      AF.11, 12 In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-control phase II study,
      different doses of RN were tested in the prevention of AF recurrence after successful
      electrical cardioversion. Despite the fact that the study did not reach its primary end-point
      since none of the individual doses of RN significantly delayed the time to first AF
      recurrence as compared with placebo, an antiarrhythmic efficacy for the two higher doses of
      RN (500 and 750mg bd) was strongly suggested. The same study confirmed the safety of RN with
      no evidence for proarrhythmia.13 Notably, beta-blockers were used in less than 50% of
      patients studied in this study.

      Although the efficacy of beta-blockers in the maintenance of sinus rhythm is low, the
      addition of a beta-blocker to an antiarrhythmic agent that exerts its action by inhibiting
      inward Na+ current like RN and Flecainide may represent an interesting approach in preventing
      AF relapse. Various laboratory studies have demonstrated that inward Na+ current could be
      modulated by beta-adrenergic receptors in a variety of cell lines.14, 15 In this context, the
      beta-blocking activity of Amiodarone or Dronedarone may account for the successful
      combination with RN in suppressing AF in either experimental or clinical studies.
