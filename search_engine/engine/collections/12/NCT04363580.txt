      systems: the peripheral system and the central system. Peripheral hearing, which includes the
      outer, middle, and inner ear and the auditory nerve, can detect sound signals.

      For its part, the central system, which is composed of auditory structures from the auditory
      nerve to the brain, makes it possible to process these sound signals and to analyze them.
      Peripheral hearing damage will result in deafness while a problem in the central auditory
      system will be called auditory processing disorder. Peripheral deafness can be detected from
      birth through neonatal screening for deafness. The symptoms of an auditory processing
      disorder can easily be confused with those caused by attention deficit disorder with or
      without hyperactivity and a specific language disorder. Auditory processing disorder is often
      unknown in the medical and educational worlds, and children are referred late for
      consultation. In addition, the lack of French screening tests for auditory processing
      disorder and the long waiting lists for specialized consultations help to delay diagnosis and
      hinder early intervention. Auditory processing disorder affects about 2 to 3% of school-aged
      children.

      The objective of the study is to validate a screening tool for auditory processing disorder
      in children of 7 to 13 years old. This screening tool was created based on literature and
      combines a questionnaire and a mini-battery of tests composed of verbal and nonverbal
      assessments.
