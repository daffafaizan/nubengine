      washout, followed by a six-week double blind treatment period. Patients completing the 6-week
      treatment period may continue double-blind treatment in an optional extension period of at
      least 6 weeks' duration. Patients randomized to placebo during the initial 6-week period will
      be randomized to BL-1020 low or high dose during the extension treatment period.
      Approximately 40 study centers in four countries will participate.
