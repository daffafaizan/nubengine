      including the agent oxaliplatin will take part in the study. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to either standard care alone (education and therapeutic exercises) or standard care
      plus 10 treatments of therapeutic ultrasound to the toes and fingers.

      Participants in both groups will follow a home exercise program for a 6 week period.
      Therapeutic ultrasound will be administered daily (e.g., Monday to Friday) over the first two
      week period of the study.
