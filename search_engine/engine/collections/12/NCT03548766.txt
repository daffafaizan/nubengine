      athletes to illegally increase their hemoglobin mass and subsequently improve oxygen
      transport.

      Anti-Doping labs use flow-cytometry to detect HBT in cheating athletes, but athletes avoid
      being tested positive by matching their blood for minor blood groups before transfusion.
      Recent publications suggest that DNA typing by Capillary Electrophoresis or RT-PCR might be
      an alternative way to detect this kind of doping in athletes. Unfortunately, no data exist on
      the clearance of DNA after transfusion of one bag of blood using this methodology.

      For the detection of doping with ABT, there is no direct method available and only the
      biological passport, a longitudinal collection of hematological parameters can indicate
      doping. Recently RBC Microparticles (RBC-MPs) have been described as a potential biomarker
      for autologous transfusion. However, also for this methodology, no data on the clearance time
      of RBC-MPs are available.

      Thus, in this World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) approved and sponsored project. The
      investigators plan to perform a clinical trial in which six healthy subjects receive an ABT
      and six healthy subjects or patients a HBT. Blood samples will be collected before and at
      several time-points after transfusion. For the detection of HBT the samples will be analyzed
      by the official method (cytometry), and the two genotyping methods (STR and RT-PCR) to
      compare these different techniques and to see if DNA-typing can replace cytometry.

      For the ABT the collected samples will be analyzed for RBC-MPs on a cytometer dedicated for
      Microparticles.
