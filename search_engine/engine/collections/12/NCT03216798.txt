      used to assess their satisfaction with current clinical services, preferences for location,
      frequency and provider of HIV services, as well as expectations and concerns.

      Furthermore, staff working at the different HIV-care to community-based organizations (CBOs)
      and the health care workers providing HIV services will be invited to participate as well.
      They will also be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge and
      attitude, preferences for location, frequency and provider of HIV services, as well as
      expectation and concerns.

      All data collected, from patients, as well as from staff, will be anonymous.
