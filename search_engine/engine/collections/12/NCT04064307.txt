    
      The Myotubular and Centronuclear Myopathy (MTM & CNM) Patient Registry is managed and
      operated by the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre at Newcastle University, in
      partnership with the Myotubular Trust, and is part of the TREAT-NMD Neuromuscular Network.
      The registry has been developed in partnership with a number of leading neuromuscular
      researchers, and is jointly funded by the Myotubular Trust and Muscular Dystrophy UK.

      Participants register online and must provide consent before accessing the registry
      questionnaire. The clinical data are provided by the participants, and the genetic data are
      obtained by the Registry Curator via the genetic report.

      The MTM & CNM Registry aims to:

        -  Help identify patients for relevant clinical trials as they become available.

        -  Encourage further research into myotubular and centronuclear myopathy.

        -  Provide researchers with specific patient information to support their research.

        -  Assist doctors and other health professionals by providing them with up-to-date
           information on managing myotubular and centronuclear myopathy, to help them deliver
           better standards of care for their patients.

      The investigators welcome the registration of:

        -  All patients with a myotubular myopathy or centronuclear myopathy diagnosis, which has
           been confirmed via genetic testing or muscle biopsy.

        -  Any carrier females of x-linked myotubular myopathy, especially if they have manifested
           myotubular myopathy type symptoms.

        -  Any patient who is deceased, but who had a confirmed diagnosis.

      This is an online registry and is hosted on the RDRF (Rare Disease Registry Framework) by
      Murdoch University.
