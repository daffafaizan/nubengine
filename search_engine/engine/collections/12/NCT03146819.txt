      outcomes of these two study groups, this study will include routine office questionnaires
      such as the Knee Society Score (KSS) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score
      (KOOS).The functional testing used in this study consists of tests that physical therapists
      use daily as objective methods to assess patients' functional status. The testing is designed
      to closely mimic daily activities with which the subjects are familiar.
