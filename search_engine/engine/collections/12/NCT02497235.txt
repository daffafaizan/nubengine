    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to examine the
      degree and duration of brain CH24H enzyme occupancy/target engagement as a function of
      TAK-935 plasma concentration in order to guide dosing and schedule for future clinical trials
      with TAK-935. This study will utilize the PET ligand [18F]MNI-792 to evaluate the brain CH24H
      occupancy of TAK-935 after single dose oral administration in healthy adult participants. The
      study will evaluate up to 16 participants. The first 2 participants will take TAK-935 600 mg
      oral solution and undergo PET imaging using tracer [18F]MNI-792 up to 5 mcg (up to 370 MBq),
      injection, intravenously prior to each PET scan at Baseline, 45 minutes and 10 hours
      post-TAK-935 dose. TAK-935 dose and timing of post-dose scans for subsequent participants
      will be based on the data from the previous participants. This single-center trial will be
      conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 55
      days. Participants will make 4 visits to the clinic, including 2 confinement periods to the
      clinic for PET imaging. Participants will be contacted by phone on Day 28 for follow-up
      safety assessments.
