      may reduce the burden of the disease and permit more effective treatment. It is well
      documented that tumor growth requires specific conditions for its development from the
      occurrence of a mutation to a clinically detectable cancer. It has been shown that living
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have different ability of cytosolic enzymes
      (esterases) to convert hydrophobic substrate fluorescein diacetate (FDA) into hydrophilic
      fluorescent fluorescein. It depends on PBMC cycle stage, size, surface state, physiological
      states, such as activation and apoptosis.

      The important step of breast cancer genesis is the early change of functional activity of
      cytosolic enzymes (esterases) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such transformations in
      PBMC may be detected accurately by an existing device Flowcytometer (FACS™ MultiSET™ System,
      company "Becton Dickinson" GmbH, USA), where measurements of fluorescence polarization and
      enzymatic hydrolysis of FDA substrate are recorded. A conclusion about presentation of breast
      cancer among examined women is achieved by "CDT" (cancer detection technology) software,
      which analyzes mathematically the results of fluorescence polarization and enzymatic
      hydrolysis.

      Moreover, the combined biochemical model together with additional prognostic parameters (such
      as age, ethnic group, gynecological and obstetric anamnesis) increases the validity
      (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of the diagnostic conclusion.

      Diagnostic Solution of the CDT:

        1. Mathematical processing of specific blood analysis in device Flowcytometer.

        2. Mathematical evaluation of specific prognostic parameters
