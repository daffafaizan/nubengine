    
      This is a phase II trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a run-in phase (phase
      I), followed by a placebo controlled double-blind phase (phase 2). Patients will receive
      either R093877 4 mg or placebo o.d. for a period of 4 weeks.

      Phase 1 is a run-in period of 4 weeks duration, during which the bowel habit is documented
      and the existence of constipation determined. If the definition of constipation was not met
      during the 4 weeks of the run-in period, double-blind treatment will not be started.

      Phase 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, in which patients will be
      treated for 4 weeks with either 4 mg of R093877 or placebo given o.d. (two capsules of 2 mg
      are taken before breakfast).
