    
      A total of sixty (60) subjects scheduled to undergo salpingo-oophorectomy within 30 days of
      BR55 CEUS examination will be enrolled to obtain approximately 30 subjects with benign
      ovarian lesions and 30 with malignant ovarian lesions based on the TS.

      The first 10 subjects will receive BR55 at a dose of 0.03 mL/kg. Assuming these first 10
      subjects will show technically adequate images, subsequent subjects enrolled in the study
      will continue to receive 0.03 mL/kg dose of BR55; otherwise, subjects will be switched to a
      0.05 mL/kg dose of BR55.

      The final cancer diagnosis will be obtained for all subjects by histopathology.
