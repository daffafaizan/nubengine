      complete Study NEOD001-001, and to continue to evaluate long term safety and tolerability.
      All subjects in the current NEOD001 trials are being dosed at 24 mg/kg, which will be
      continued in this study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate long-term safety
      and tolerability of NEOD001 and the secondary objectives are to assess the immunogenicity of
      NEOD001 and to incorporate serum NEOD001 concentrations in a population pharmacokinetic (PK)
      analysis.
