      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other lymphoid/hematologic malignancies but is
      available as a treatment option to only a minority of patients. Autologous BMT, coupled with
      high dose chemotherapy, is a treatment open to more patients and is a promising strategy for
      the treatment of advanced solid malignancies. However, the development of potentially
      curative marrow transplant alternatives requires an ability to provide a nonmalignant
      hematopoietic stem cell population. In addition, the generation of hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSC), and the determination of whether or not such HSC repopulate all of the cell lineage
      subtypes following reinfusion are critical to understanding the biology and immunological
      consequences of stem cell transplantation. An increased understanding of the kinetics of HSC
      and lymphocyte repopulation post-BMT and the identification of donor cell populations that
      mediate a graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect or graft versus host (GVHD) is critical to
      therapeutic efficacy. In order to address these currently unmet objectives, normal volunteers
      and volunteers with malignancies will undergo venipuncture and bone marrow aspiration with or
      without prior [6,6-(2)H2] or [U-(13)C9]-glucose, infusion to provide cell populations which
      will then be utilized for specific pre-clinical studies aimed at developing new therapeutic
      alternatives for patients with CML and other lymphoid/hematologic malignancies. An infusion
      of [6,6-(2)H2] or [U-(13)C9]-glucose prior to bone marrow and/or leukocyte harvest, in some
      volunteers, will allow direct examination of the genesis and biology of stem cells and
      leukocyte subpopulations. [6,6-(2)H2] or [U-(13)C9]-glucose, are nonradioactive, stable
      isotopes of glucose which will label dividing cells during the time of administration and is
      chemically identical to glucose, with no adverse side effects other than those known for
      glucose.
