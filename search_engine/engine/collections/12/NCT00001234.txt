      transduction with retroviruses containing the human glucocerebrosidase gene. We continue to
      enter a small number of patients to this protocol each year. Studies with the bone marrow
      hematopoietic progenitor cells have enabled us to identify the most effective retroviral
      construct currently available in order to carry out gene therapy trials in patients with
      Gaucher's disease. The data revealed that a comparatively simple retroviral construct
      containing human glucocerebrosidase cDNA driven by the MoLV promoter is highly effective. We
      have obtained approval and initiated a Phase I safety and gene marking investigation in
      patients with Type I Gaucher's Disease.
