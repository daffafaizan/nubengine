      about half of the patients with colorectal cancer develop metastatic disease. These patients
      are often offered chemotherapy with the FOLFOX6 regimen (FOL = FOLic acid; F = Fluorouracil
      (5-FU); OX = OXaliplatin) The use of FOLFOX6 is, however, hampered by a high incidence and
      severity of adverse reactions.

      In the current trial patients will receive the antioxidant agent PledOx in one of two
      different doses, or placebo, in the first 8 cycles of FOLFOX6 treatment.
