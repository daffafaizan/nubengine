      allows a direct bone-conduction through an osseointegrated implant. A magnet allows the
      external Sound Processor to be placed in the correct position over the implanted system
      including an inner magnet.

      Device: Osia System An external Sound Processor captures and digitize the sound which is
      transferred to the internal implant where it is converted to an electrical signal. The
      electrical signal is further transferred as a vibration through an osseointegrated implant to
      the mastoid bone and eventually to the cochlea
