      an increased prevalence of myocardial infarction and metabolic syndrome, and increased
      mortality. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and other inflammatory cytokines are felt to play an
      important role not only in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but in the
      pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.

      However, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and surrogate markers of increased
      cardiovascular risk, such as lower flow-mediated dilation (FMD) during reactive hyperemia,
      measured by high-resolution brachial artery ultrasound, lower hyperemia-induced, pulse wave
      amplitudes as measured by finger plethysmograph peripheral artery tonometry, and elevated
      blood CRP levels, in children with psoriasis, are unknown.

      We will use the definition of metabolic syndrome described by de Ferranti: Participants are
      defined as having metabolic syndrome if they meet or exceed the criteria for 3 or more of the
      following 5 variables: 1) triglycerides ≥1.1 mmol/L; 2) HDL cholesterol <1.3 mmol/L; 3)
      fasting blood glucose ≥6.1 mmol/L; 4) waist circumference (cm) >75th percentile for age and
      sex; and 5) systolic or diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) >90th percentile for age, sex, and
      height.

      The following two noninvasive procedures will be used to assess additional cardiovascular
      risk: flow mediated dilation (FMD) and finger plethysmography peripheral artery tonometry
      (PAT). These procedures have been used extensively to measure adults for clinical study
      purposes for many years.

      As a control group, we will compare children with psoriasis to age-, race-,and gender-matched
      children with warts.
