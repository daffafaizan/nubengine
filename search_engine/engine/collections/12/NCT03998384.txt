      to blindness. The methods of treatment include gene therapy, stem cell therapy and visual
      prothesis, etc. But all these methods own limitations can not be conquered in a short period.
      It was proved that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium derived
      factor (PEDF) decreased in the aqueous humor of patients of RP. But the traditional exogenous
      nerve growth factors (NGFs) were immunogenic proteins and may cause inflammation. Autoserum
      contain a large amount of active factors and will not cause exclusive reaction. In this study
      we aim to assess and to evaluate the therapeutic effect and the safety of retrobulbar
      injection of autoserum in the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa.
