      that has gained increasing acceptance. Following a cholangiotomy there is, however, the risk
      of bile leakage from the incision.

      A way of avoiding leakage following cholangiotomy may be to apply fibrin sealant on the
      cholangiotomy.

      The present study is based on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the
      department of surgery, Enk√∂ping hospital, Sweden. The patients are informed about the study
      prior to the procedure. Cholangiography is performed routinely. In case common bile duct
      stones are encountered on the cholangiography, an incision is made in the common bile duct
      and the stones are extracted. After the stone extraction, a t tube is introduced into the
      cholangiotomy and the incision is closed with running Vicryl sutures.

      When the cholangiotomy has been closed, the randomisation is performed with a sealed envelope
      system. If the patient is randomised to fibrin sealant, this is applied on the cholangiotomy.
      A passive drain is introduced before the abdomen is closed.

      Postoperatively, the amount of bile in the passive drain is measured by an observer
      randomised to the allocation.

      If the amount of bile in the drain does not exceed 100 ml three days postoperatively, a
      secondary cholangiography is performed through the t tube. If the contrast passes to the
      duodenum and no contrast leakage is seen, the t tube is withdrawn.

      All postoperative complications are registered according to the Clavien-Dindo system.
