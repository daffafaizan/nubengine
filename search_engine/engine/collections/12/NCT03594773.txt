      depressed. Participants will receive brief, evidence-based psychotherapy for 8 sessions
      delivered over 8-12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy (IPT), or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Research questions focus on
      process psychotherapy measures that are associated with outcomes.
