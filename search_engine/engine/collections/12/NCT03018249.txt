    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat, in
      combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate in the pre-operative setting results in
      up-regulation of activated progesterone receptors (PR) compared to medroxyprogesterone
      acetate alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate (as measured by cellular morphology and proliferation) and
      change in activated receptor levels with the addition of entinostat at the time of
      hysterectomy.

      OUTLINE: Two arms were randomly allocated to eligible patients with equal probability.

      ARM I: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and undergo
      hysterectomy between days 21-24.

      ARM II: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate IM on day 1 and entinostat orally (PO)
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients undergo hysterectomy between days 21-24.
