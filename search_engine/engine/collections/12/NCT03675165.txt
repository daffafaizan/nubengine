      order to achieve psychological, behavioural, and even physiological changes. The present
      team's previous research has demonstrated that the BPS is effective at reducing certain
      diabetes symptoms, though the exact mechanisms by which it does so are unclear. According to
      the Stress Buffering Model of Physical Activity, psychological stress is the catalyst that
      triggers behavioural and physiological responses critical to health while positive emotions
      can improve health by helping people to cope. The Broaden and Build Theory of Positive
      Emotions, meanwhile, suggests that this is because positive emotions allow people to build
      resilience.

      In this study, the aim is to examine whether stress and resilience in particular mediate the
      relationship between intervention and diabetes symptoms. Research around stress and
      resilience has shown these factors to be important not only in the physical health of people
      with diabetes but for also decreasing illness symptomatology in non-clinical samples more
      generally.
