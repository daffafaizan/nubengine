      effective drugs, a substantial portion of patients is still suffered from relapse.
      Furthermore, the treatment-related morbidity is another factor which can make the treatment
      outcome worse in patients with lymphoma, especially elderly patients. Thus, this study is
      going to assess factors which may affect the treatment outcome and the risk of
      treatment-related morbidity.

      1.Biologic factors associated with the aggressiveness of lymphoma

        -  molecular markers in serum, cytogenetic markers 2.Factors associated with the risk of
           treatment-related morbidity

        -  comorbidity, nutrition status, performance status, quality of life at diagnosis
