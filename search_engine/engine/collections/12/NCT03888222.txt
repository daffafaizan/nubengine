      FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c-Abelson (Abl) and Src tyrosine kinases-
      in patients with DLB. Investigators have demonstrated safety and efficacy of this compound in
      pre-clinical animal models and others have shown similar benefits of Bosutinib on
      inflammation and neurotoxic protein clearance in neurodegeneration. Investigators have
      demonstrated that Bosutinib enters the brain (5% CSF:plasma ratio) and inhibits Abl at lower
      doses (5mg/kg) than the cancer dose (80mg/kg) in animals. Bosutinib also reduces the levels
      of neurotoxic proteins including alpha-synuclein, tau and beta-amyloid and improves motor and
      cognitive behavior in models of neurodegeneration. The use of Bosutinib is a novel strategy
      that promotes autophagy to clear neurotoxic protein aggregates in neurons. Bosutinib is
      FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at an oral dose of
      400-600 mg daily. Based on our preclinical evidence, investigators used allometric conversion
      to extrapolate animal to human dose and estimated a human equivalent dose daily dose of 100mg
      Bosutinib in this clinical study to determine the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics in patients with mild to moderate DLB.
