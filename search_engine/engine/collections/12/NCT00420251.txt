      arthritis. Especially those who were under additional treatment with glucocorticoids for high
      disease activity. This is the case in patients with a polyarticular and a systemic form of
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The permanent consequence is short stature at final height. Up
      to 30% of these patients will have a final height below the 3rd percentile, even after
      discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment. The hypothesis is, that treatment with growth
      hormone can, at leat in part, overcome growth hormone resistance state and increase final
      height. In a controlled study we follow patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis with and
      without growth hormone treatment until final height. From safety aspects we were interested
      in the effect of growth hormone on the disease activity. Additionally, we are interested in
      bone density development in those treated with growth hormone up to final height.
