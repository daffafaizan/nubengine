      hyperlipidemia. GH therapy in these populations and others has been limited by side effects
      which include hyperglycemia. Another strategy to increase GH secretion is to enhance
      pulsatile GH secretion by growth hormone releasing hormone. Growth hormone releasing hormone
      (GHRH) has a half life of 5 minutes due to its rapid inactivation by DPP4. An alternative
      strategy to increase endogenous GH secretion is by inhibiting degradation of GHRH by DPP4.
      DPP4 inhibitors are currently approved therapies for the treatment of hyperglycemia in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. They additionally cause blood vessel relaxation. We
      therefore propose to test the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition simultaneously enhances GH
      secretion while improving blood glucoses and vascular function in patient populations with
      low GH and increased cardiovascular risk. These preliminary aims serve primarily as a novel
      "proof of concept" study to define the effect of acute pharmacologic DPPIV inhibition on
      stimulated GH secretion.
