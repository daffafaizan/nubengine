      prior to surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer may consent and enrol to study. Patients
      will have single 8 Gy hypofractionated radiation to bladder followed by 3 cycles of
      durvalumab immunotherapy prior to radical cystectomy. This study will assess the safety and
      tolerability, pathological and radiological response, and immune biological correlatives to
      understand the effect of radiation and durvalumab.
