      Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) than those in the general population. Many
      of the negative health consequences observed in obese adults are already present in obese
      adolescents with IDD.

      This study is a 3 group randomized trial to evaluate the intervention delivery system and
      type of reduced energy diet. The investigators will randomize 123 overweight/obese
      adolescents with mild to moderate IDD to one of 3 groups for an 18 month trial (6 month
      weight loss; 12 month weight maintenance):

      group 1) Face-To-Face/CD

      group 2) Technology delivery/CD

      group 3) Technology delivery/eSLD.

      All participants will receive a progressive program of physical activity. Participants on the
      CD diet will be asked to consume a nutritionally balanced, reduced energy, high volume, lower
      fat ( fat=20-30% energy) diet. Participants on the eSLD will consume pre-packaged portion
      controlled meals with the addition of 5 fruits and vegetables per day.

      FTF will meet with a health educator and will track progress using pen and paper records for
      both physical activity and diet. TECH groups will receive the intervention using an iPad with
      the FaceTimeTM application for video meetings with a health educator and will track progress
      using the Lose it! application for both physical activity and diet.
