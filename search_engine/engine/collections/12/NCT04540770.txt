    
      This is a first-in-human, two-part, Phase 1 study that will characterize the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of HuL001 after single ascending doses in healthy
      subjects followed by multiple doses in MS subjects. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

        -  Part A will enroll 3 single ascending doses (SAD) cohorts in healthy subjects.
           (HuL001:Placebo=4:2)

        -  Part B will enroll 1 multiple-dose cohort in MS subjects. The proposed dose of HuL001
           will be selected from the single-dose range of HuL001 evaluated in the healthy subjects
           of Part A. (HuL001=6)
