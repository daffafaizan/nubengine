      vaccination of hepatitis b vaccine to get the protective antibody anti-HBs. Both the
      blood-derived hepatitis B vaccine and the recombinant hepatitis B vaccines have been proved
      to be effective and safe since the application in 1981 and 1989 respectively. Previous
      passive or active immunization testes indicated that the lowest effective level of anti-HBs
      for prevention of infection is 10mIU/ml. However there are still some recipients can't
      generate expected level of anti-HBs after the vaccinations. In adults, there are 5% to 10%
      recipients will failed to respond to routine administration of 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B
      vaccines, and those nonresponders are susceptible population even after the vaccinations. In
      this study, a recipient whose peak period (1 month after vaccination) levels of anti-HBs is
      lower than 10mIU/ml after finishing the vaccinations of 3 dose 10mcg hepatitis b vaccines is
      called nonresponders.

      Nowadays, a lot tests are conducted on nonresponders to help them generate the protective
      antibody anti-HBs, including increase the antigen dosage of vaccines, increase the injections
      of vaccines, change the route of inoculation and the use of adjuvant. Unfortunately, these
      previous studies can not get coincident and persuasive outcomes due to the small sample size
      and poor representativeness. This study is plan to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of
      60mcg/30mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in people aged 16 and older who failed to
      respond to routine administration of 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and to provide
      the scientific evidences for the revaccination strategy in China.
