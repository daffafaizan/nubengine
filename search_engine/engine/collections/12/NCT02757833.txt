      participants will be women aged 60 to 85. This study seeks to recruit 26 female participants;
      13 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of late-life depression and 13 control
      participants with no history of mental illness. This pilot study will be used to determine if
      a larger Randomized Controlled Trial is feasible.

      The role of antioxidant capacity in Late Life Depression (LLD) has thus far been inadequately
      assessed, providing the investigators with a timely opportunity to spearhead such an
      investigation. The results of this pilot study, and subsequent large-scale studies, will
      allow the investigators to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention in LLD.
