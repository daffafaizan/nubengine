      normoxia or hypoxia) AND a one hour rest session (in normoxia or hypoxia).

      Exercise training sessions will consist in a continue bicycle exercise test at 70 to 80 % of
      the maximal heart rate, while breathing (single blind) normoxia or hypoxia gaz.

      Rest conditioning consist in a one hour of rest, while breathing (single blind) normoxia or
      hypoxia gaz.

      For hypoxia sessions, the oxygen saturation target will be fo 85-90 % for the 4 first weeks
      and 80-85 % for the last 4 weeks.
