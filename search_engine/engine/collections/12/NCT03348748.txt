      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of combining single fraction stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by surgery, in thoracic malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after single
      fraction SBRT followed by surgery, in thoracic malignancies.

      II. To define any differences in quality of life/toxicity following SBRT based on tumor
      location/stage/tumor type.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in T cell mediated immunity following SBRT in thoracic malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 studies.

      STUDY 1: Patients with stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the peripheral
      lung undergo highest-dose of SBRT over a single treatment fraction on day 1. Patients then
      undergo thoracic surgery on day 28.

      STUDY 2: Patients with stage I or II NSCLC in the central lung undergo lowest-dose of SBRT
      over a single treatment fraction on day 1. Patients then undergo thoracic surgery on day 28.

      STUDY 3: Patients with stage IIIA NSCLC in the any lung location undergo lowest- or
      higher-dose of SBRT over a single treatment fraction on day 1. Patients then undergo thoracic
      surgery on day 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
