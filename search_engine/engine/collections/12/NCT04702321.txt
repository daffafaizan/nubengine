      Around 300 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer each year in Switzerland. A
      wide range of acute and chronic complications have been linked to cancer and its treatments.
      Cancer treatments, though highly curative, have a high incidence of adverse events, not only
      acutely but also chronically. Depending on the type and dose of treatments, the complications
      vary. There are important inter-individual differences in the type and severity of
      complications associated with similar cancer treatments. Genetic variation was identified to
      affect some complications and is suspected to play an important role in many of these
      differences.

      The GECCOS project on analysis of genetic risks for complications associated with childhood
      cancers fills the gap to analyze germline genetic data with clinical information on short-
      and long-term complications. This has not been done on a nationwide scale in Switzerland yet.
      The GECCOS project will improve knowledge on germline genetic risks for complications and
      further personalize care during acute treatment and follow-up of childhood cancer patients.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        1. Identify genetic variants associated with complications after childhood cancer leading
           to specific organ dysfunctions and second primary neoplasms.

        2. Evaluate the functional importance of genetic variants for complications after childhood
           cancer through in silico and in vitro studies.

      Secondary objective:

      Assess genetic variants and their impact on multiple outcomes as a result of specific
      treatment exposures.
