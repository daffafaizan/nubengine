    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival at 100 days after transplantation following decitabine and a
      bone marrow transplant using a donor that is at least partially-matched and a myeloablative
      preparative regimen with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD) prophylaxis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Patients enrolled in this study will also be followed for the following endpoints:
      neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
      chronic GVHD, incidence of infection, treatment-related mortality, time to
      relapse/progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning between days -29 and -22, patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1
      hour daily for 10 days, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2, and
      busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -2.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily (BID) on day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 3 and 4,
      tacrolimus orally (PO) BID or IV continuously on days 5-180, mycophenolate mofetil PO three
      times daily (TID) on days 5-35 and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) beginning day 5 until
      absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and 1 year.
