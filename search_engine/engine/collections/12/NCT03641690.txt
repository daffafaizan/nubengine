      addition to activating the complement, MBL can induce cytokine production and contribute to a
      deleterious inflammatory response with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. The aim was to
      determine if serum MBL levels correlate with the risk of mortality in intensive care units
      (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

      Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic and clinical data at admission and
      during the ICU stay were recorded from the medical files of each patient and collected in a
      database to evaluate variables potentially associated with in-hospital mortality. Data
      baselines were recorded at admission. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) requirements, and the use of vasopressor drugs were noted during ICU stay.
      To determine illness severity, SAPSII and SOFA scoring systems were applied to all patients
      within 24 h of ICU admission.Demographic characteristics and severity indices were recorded
      at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza diagnosis within 24-48 h
      following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL levels.
