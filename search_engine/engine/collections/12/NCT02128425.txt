      patients who receive all the three active drugs , but not with the proportion of patients who
      receive any second-line therapy. A superior efficacy in PFS,ORR and OS of FOLFOXIRI has been
      reported with acceptable toxicity. Moreover,evidence suggests that continuous dosing
      metronomic chemotherapy may be more efficacious than interval-chemotherapy.

      Therefore, a way to improve the outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer patients could be to
      administer a maintenance first-line regimen containing the three active agents.
