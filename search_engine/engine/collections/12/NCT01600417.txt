      degree, extent and quality of their low back problem. Afterwards a lateral conventional
      radiograph of the lumbar spine with the patient on a custom made positioning table will be
      taken. The table facilitates optimal flexion of the lumbar spine. Afterwards sagittal
      translation and rotation are measured on the flexion-extension radiographs and the radiograph
      taken on the custom made table. Differences between the measurements will be determined.
