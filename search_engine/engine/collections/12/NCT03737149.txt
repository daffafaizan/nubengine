    
      This is a post-market prospective, multi-center longitudinal study in subjects undergoing
      primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), or partial knee
      arthroplasty (PKA). The study objective is to determine if mobile application-guided
      education and exercise paired with accurate and sensitive activity monitoring, captured from
      consumer wearables, can provide a viable (and potentially improved) alternative to current
      standard of care patient education and physical therapy for hip and knee arthroplasty. The
      study will be conducted in phases. The first phase (N = 300) will consist of a pilot cohort
      of subjects and will primarily serve to determine site study staffing needs and time required
      for various elements of study execution. The second phase (N = 1,000, RCT) will consist of a
      randomized controlled subject cohort and will compare outcomes of mobile application-guided
      exercises and activity with standard of care (SOC) physical therapy. The third phase (N ~
      10,000 including subjects from both Phase I and the study arm from RCT/Phase II) will seek to
      collect enough data to enable the creation of decision support algorithms for outcomes of
      joint replacement. All subjects will undergo a TKA, THA, or PKA using SOC procedures and
      commercially-available devices as part of their clinical care. Subjects will then complete
      prescribed post-operative activities, such as physical therapy, according to SOC or
      performing exercises as scheduled through the mymobility app. In office assessments will be
      conducted at approximately 30 days prior to surgery, 30 days after surgery, and 3 months
      after surgery. Virtual assessments (including subject questionnaires and recording of adverse
      events) will occur at approximately 6 months and 1 year post-op.
