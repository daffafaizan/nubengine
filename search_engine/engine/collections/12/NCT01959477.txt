      I. To determine the feasibility of real-time therapeutic dose monitoring (TDM) for once daily
      intravenously (IV) busulfan administration as part of a preparative regimen for patients with
      lymphoma undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the incidence of adverse events including mucositis, liver toxicity, seizures,
      and pulmonary toxicity with TDM of once daily IV busulfan compared to historic controls.

      II. To compare the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), with TDM of once daily IV
      busulfan compared to historic controls.

      III. To determine the proportion of patients who would not have achieved desired busulfan
      level with weight-based busulfan dosing and therefore required TDM.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -9 to -6, etoposide IV
      continuously over 24-36 hours on days -5 and -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 4 hours on days
      -3 and -2. Patients then undergo autologous stem cell transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
