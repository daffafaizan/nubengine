    
      TG101348 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). This is a
      first-in-human study that will include a dose-escalation phase, to establish the maximum
      tolerated dose, and an expanded cohort, dose-confirmation phase. The safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of TG101348 in patients
      with myelofibrosis will be evaluated.
