      that risedronate 35 mg once weekly, a potent antiresorptive agent, will prevent bone loss or
      improve bone mass and decrease bone turnover in elderly, osteopenic, postmenopausal women
      (ages 55 and older) with breast cancer on aromatase inhibitor therapy. 110 subjects will be
      randomized to receive either oral risedronate 35 mg once weekly or placebo for two years. Our
      primary outcome variable will be change in PA spine bone mineral density (BMD). Secondary
      endpoints will be BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, lateral spine, forearm, and
      total body, and markers of bone turnover. We will also assess if the improvements in BMD are
      greater at sites of trabecular bone (spine) versus cortical bone (wrist). BMD will be
      measured at six month intervals. Biochemical markers of bone turnover will be measured at
      baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.
