      irreversible causes of visual disability. AMD leads to dysfunction and loss of photoreceptors
      in the central retina. Neovascular AMD affects visual function early in the disease process
      and severely compromises the highly developed functions of the macula, such as perception of
      details, central fixation, color vision, and reading ability. AMD-related visual impairment
      is associated with a loss of autonomy and quality of life. Currently, laser photocoagulation,
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin usually combined with intravitreal triamcinolone
      acetonide (IVTA) are the only proved treatments for subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation
      (CNV). Laser photocoagulation is limited to selected cases. Photodynamic therapy using
      verteporfin provides very promising data regarding improvement of visual acuity and absence
      of fluorescein leakage. PDT was recently successfully combined with an intravitreal injection
      of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide. Yet, PDT also leads to damage to surrounding
      normal choroidal vessels. A pilot trial comparing low fluence (300 mW/cm²) with standard
      fluence (600 mW/cm²) demonstrated a trend for improved outcomes using the low fluence regimen
      (VIM study). However, vascular mechanisms and choroidal damage were not examined, and the
      study group was too small to evaluate vision outcome parameters. Combined with the IVTA, the
      low fluence effects of PDT may be sufficient for CNV occlusion and the physiological choroids
      should be spared from any collateral damage. The aim of this study was to compare reduced
      fluence with standard fluence PDT using verteporfin and IVTA for CNV secondary to AMD.
