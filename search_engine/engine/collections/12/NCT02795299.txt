      demonstrated an inadequate response to treatment with MTX. Eligible patients will enter a
      6-week screening period receiving 15-25 mg MTX QWK (patients will remain on their current
      dose and route of administration of MTX through the screening period). Patients on a dose of
      MTX less than 15mg QWK will have their dose of MTX increased to 15mg QWK at the initial
      screening visit) followed by randomization in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 doses of gerilimzumab
      (5, 10, or 20 mg loading dose followed by 2 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of gerilimzumab Q8W) plus MTX,
      or placebo plus MTX for 12 weeks of treatment. Gerilimzumab and placebo will be administered
      as SC injections Q8W; MTX will continue to be administered as by same route of administration
      (tablets, SC, or IM injection) QWK.
