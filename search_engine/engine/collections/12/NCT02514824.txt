      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the
      intervention is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved MLN0128 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      MLN0128 may prevent tumor cells from dividing and growing by selectively and potently
      inhibiting a chemical, mTOR kinase, which regulates cell growth and survival.

      Patients with merkel cell carcinoma have been observed to sometimes carry genetic alterations
      in their tumor cells which may make the cancer more sensitive to inhibition by MLN0128. In
      this research study,the investigators are studying the usefulness of MLN0128 in merkel cell
      carcinoma cases.
