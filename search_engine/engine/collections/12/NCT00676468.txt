      represents a beneficial treatment on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). An important
      question is how dietary fish oil supplementation fits in with the available armamentarium
      [e.g., leukotriene (LT) modifiers] to decrease the expression of LTs, and whether fish oil
      supplementation may be additive, or used in its own right to block the EIB response. For
      example, it is possible that a combination of fish oil supplementation and a cyst LT1
      receptor antagonist (LTRA) may provide a greater antiinflammatory effect against developing
      EIB that either agent alone.
