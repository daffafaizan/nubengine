      treatment of adults with depression. In total, 157 participants were involved. Of them, 109
      were randomized into DMT group (n = 52) or control group (n = 57). The rest of the
      participants participated in non-randomized DMT groups. All participants met the criteria for
      the eligibility for rehabilitation psychotherapy, had depression diagnosed by a doctor, and
      the severity of depression threatened the ability to work/ study. All participants received
      treatment as usual during the research. DMT-intervention was facilitated by a dance movement
      therapist and included 20 x 75 mins sessions within 10 weeks. Depressive symptoms (BDI),
      physical and psychological distress (CORE-OM, SCL-90), ability to work/study, and body image
      were assessed at three measurement points: pre-measurement at the baseline, post-measurement
      10 weeks after the pre-treatment measurement, and a follow-up measurement three months after
      the post-treatment measurement.

      This research includes a larger number of participants (N = 109) than have been involved in
      previous studies utilising randomised controlled trials in research designs. The research
      generates further information about the effectiveness of dance movement therapy groups in the
      rehabilitation of depression as it was conducted in five cities across Finland. This type of
      multi-centre research can provide a realistic picture of the typical practice of a range of
      dance movement therapists working with participants in various geographic locations.
