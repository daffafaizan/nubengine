      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) for 20 minutes on five consecutive days.
      Neuropsychological tests on inhibitory control and interviews on smoking habits and craving
      will be applied before and after the first stimulation as well as after the fifth
      stimulation.

      After a follow-up period of three days, smoking behaviour will be assessed in a telephone
      interview.

      Changes in inhibitory control and smoking behaviour will be compared between an active and a
      sham stimulation group.This way the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on
      tobacco use disorder are to be clarified.
