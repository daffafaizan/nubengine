      of photoreceptor cone outer segment tips (COST) defect on 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
      macular hole surgery. The correlation between the mean length of COST defect and the BCVA was
      determined. Prognostic factors might have influenced for COST repair was also evaluated by
      multivariable analysis.
