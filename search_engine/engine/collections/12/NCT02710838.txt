      of cancer death in China.80%-90% patients were detected at middle and later stage.The
      five-year survival rate for advanced gastric cancer patients is less than 10% due to the
      shortage of effective treatment method.The five-year survival rate for early gastric cancer
      patients is beyond 90%.The reason for poor diagnosis and treatment is that current methods do
      not achieve the diagnosis of early gastric cancer.Endoscopy with biopsy is still the main
      method for confirming gastric cancer.But it is limited to identify early gastric cancer and
      it leads to the low diagnostic rate of early gastric cancer.

      Accurate diagnosis for early gastric cancer and the pretherapeutic estimation of the invasion
      depth is desired to determine suitable treatment.Presently,endoscopic submucosal dissection
      is the new effective minimally invasive treatment for early gastric cancer,which preserve the
      entire stomach and improve the patient's postoperative quality of life.But the estimation of
      invasion depth of gastric cancers should be confirmed before operation.

      Recently,some research suggest that narrow banding imaging and endoscopy ultrasonography are
      considered established means of diagnosis for early gastric cancer and depth.No formal
      quantitative review of the available evidence has been published that narrow banding imaging
      or endoscopy ultrasonography could accurately diagnose early gastric cancer and evaluate the
      invasive depth.This means still has great limitations.The sensitivity of narrow banding
      imaging diagnosis is only 60% which its high false positive rate,shorter wavelength and
      lighter penetration,and the result is influenced by histologic variety of early gastric
      cancer and inflammatory changes in the background mucosa;Although endoscopy ultrasonography
      achieves a diagnostic accuracy of over 80%,and its tomographic views facilitate objective
      assessments,it is occasionally difficult to obtain images with adequate quality, and its
      evaluation is highly dependent on operators' proficiency levels.

      Infrared endoscopic imaging is a new great potential method of diagnosis of early gastric
      cancer, since the first report in the 1990 s, people have been exploring in this field.
      Through intravenous injection of exogenous contrast medium, such as the indocyanine green, it
      makes mucosal lesions highlight,and avoids the interference of background light.If specific
      target molecular is linked to the contrast medium,the specific imaging of the lesion can be
      presented. What is more,due to the strong penetration power of infrared light,its imaging
      depth also increases significantly.Indocyanine green had also been demonstrated safe in
      clinical studies and widely used, such assessment of liver function tests.

      At present,the research in this aspect is very few, a few clinical research results show that
      infrared endoscopic imaging has a larger value for differentiating between early gastric
      cancer and gastric adenoma, and the difference between early gastric cancer and gastric
      lesions is significantly correlated with the depth of cancer invasion.

      However, there is not a system research about the infrared imaging characteristics of gastric
      cancer and different precancerous status,and there is no infrared endoscopic imaging
      assessment criteria for diagnosis of gastric cancer.

      Recently, the investigators have completed the experiments on animals about infrared imaging,
      the results prove that it has good specificity to identify tumor lesion. On this basis,the
      investigators apply for the research about near-infrared endoscopy to diagnose early gastric
      cancer,and discuss its feasibility of the infrared endoscopy to diagnose early gastric cancer
      and clinical value.
