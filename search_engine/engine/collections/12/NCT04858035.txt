      baseline phase in which perception and production abilities will be probed but not treated.
      In a multiple-baseline across-subjects design with randomization, the 10 participants will be
      randomly assigned to transition from the baseline to the treatment condition at one of 7
      possible points, ranging from 4 to 10 baseline sessions. After baseline sessions, perceptual
      training will be delivered in twelve 30-minute sessions occurring 3 times per week for 4
      weeks. The training is fully computerized and can be self-administered, but a study clinician
      will attend one session per participant per week to ensure attention to study tasks. Each
      session will feature three listening tasks of approximately equal duration. Following
      perceptual training, participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of production training
      completed over two weeks.
