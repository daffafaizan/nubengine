    
      Orvepitant is a highly potent and selective neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist currently
      in development for the treatment of depression and anxiety.

      This study is an open-label, randomised, single dose study to determine the pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability of 2 different formulations of orvepitant 60 mg and the effect of
      food in 15 Healthy Volunteers. According to a cross over design, in three different
      occasions, each subject will receive the "old" formulation of orvepitant in fasted condition
      and the "new" formulation in fasted condition and after a FDA High-Fat Breakfast. Subjects
      will be screened within 21 days of first treatment. On each dosing occasion, subjects will be
      admitted to the clinic on Day-1 and will remain until Day 2; they will be also asked to
      return to the site 48 and 72 hours after each dosing for the PK blood sample collection. The
      wash-out period between each dosing occasion will be at least 5 days and subjects will be
      asked to return to the site 7-14 days after the administration of the last dose of orvepitant
      for a follow-up visit.
