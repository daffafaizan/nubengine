      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when
           administered with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin in patients with
           advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15; oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on days 1 and 15; and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 22
      hours on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients receive treatment at the
      MTD to a maximum of 12 patients at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or start of a new anticancer
      treatment.
