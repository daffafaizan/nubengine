    
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with newly-diagnosed cHL,
      or with RRHL. The study will review the medical records of participants to describe
      participant's demographics, disease characteristics, treatments received, outcomes, health
      resources used by the participants, and adverse events that are associated with treatments,
      and resources used for treatment.

      The study will enroll approximately 50 to 100 participants in each group at each of the 13
      participating countries. Based on the diagnosis of the disease, participants will be assigned
      to one of the following groups:

      Group 1: cHL Group 2: RRHL

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina, Australia, China, Colombia, Hong
      Kong, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, and
      Turkey. The data for Group 1 and Group 2 participants will be collected from date of cHL or
      RRHL diagnosis until the death of participant or the date of data collection, whichever
      occurs first. The overall time for data collection in the study will be approximately 12
      months.
