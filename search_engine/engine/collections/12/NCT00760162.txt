      established, it is reasonable to anticipate that probiotic bacteria will be incorporated into
      a growing number of clinical regimens.

      Following exploratory testing of orally administered probiotic bacteria in rats and minipigs
      with surgically induced chronic kidney disease (CKD), a trial is now in progress to determine
      whether daily treatment with gastrointestinal (GI) probiotic bacteria will delay the onset of
      and/or improve established signs and symptoms of human CKD.

      To assess the potential benefit in devising a gut-based probiotic formulation (Kibow
      Biotics®) as a dieatary supplement - Over The Counter (OTC)product in CKD applications.

      Extensive in vitro R&D investigations in Kibow's laboratories

      Simulated Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME, Ghent University, Belgium) utilized in
      a computer-controlled in vitro system validated the concept that the chosen microbial
      formulation would metabolize and reduce concentration of nitrogenous components including
      urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Bacterial strains studied were Streptococcus thermophilus
      (KB27), Lactobacillus acidophilus (KB31) and Bifidobacterium longum (KB35).

      Oral administration of these bacterial formulations, tested in the 5/6th nephrectomized rat
      model (at Thomas Jefferson University, Phila., PA) and minipig model (at Indiana University,
      Indianapolis, IN), decreased both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr)
      levels.

      Two independent veterinarians investigated the effect of Kibow Biotics® on clinically
      manifested renal failure in uremic cats and dogs of both genders and varying body weights.
      Based on positive results, this formulation, marketed and distributed as AzodylTM, is
      currently licensed for veterinary applications to Vetoquinol USA
