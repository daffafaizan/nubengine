      among women. In recent years, the incidence rate of breast cancer has been rising by 0,3%
      annually. Screening tests are designed to diagnose breast cancer in possible early stadium of
      disease. Rapid diagnosis and efficacy of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies influence on
      immediate breast reconstructions after skin (SSM) and nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM). The
      prophylactic methods of reducing a higher wound healing complication rate after neoadjuvant
      and adjuvant therapies are crucial.

      The study aimed to assess the impact of the use of closed incision negative pressure wound
      therapy (ciNPWT) after immediate breast reconstruction on the number of surgical-site
      complications, skin surface temperature, objective elastic and viscoelastic and subjective
      scar's quality to determine risk factors that could be considered as indications for
      prophylactic ciNPWT application.

      The analysis included data from anamnesis, details of performed surgical procedure,
      measurements of skin surface temperature with Skin-Thermometer® probe, measurements of skin
      elasticity with Cutometer® probe, and scar assessments according to POSAS v2.0 questionnaire
      for patient and observer.
