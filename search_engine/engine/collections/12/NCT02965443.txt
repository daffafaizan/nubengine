      inhibitor dapagliflozin together wih the DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin to an intensified
      insulin treatment regimen. Because BOT is superior to BBIT in respect to the development of
      bodyweight, hypoglycaemia and patient satisfaction in type 2 diabetes, we hypothesize that
      the combined addition of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with the DPP-4 inhibitor
      saxagliptin is effective and safe to revert from a BBIT to a BOT treatment regimen.
