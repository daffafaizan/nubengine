      than 2.000 feet within the last month. The purpose of this study is to see if creatine
      monohydrate is effective in preventing altitude-induced depression. This study will enroll
      approximately 75 subjects.

      This study involves the use of an investigational drug called Creatine Monohydrate. This
      means that the drug has not yet been approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for
      treatment of altitude-induced depression. However, the FDA has not objected to its use to
      study its safety and effectiveness for preventing altitude-induced depression. This study
      will help find out what effects, good and/or bad, Creatine Monohydrate has on treating
      symptoms for altitude-induced depression. Creatine Monohydrate is believed to have an effect
      on improving symptoms of depression. The safety of Creatine Monohydrate in humans has been
      tested in prior research studies; however, some side effects may not yet be known.

      Creatine Monohydrate is a dietary supplement that is believed to aid in the building of
      muscle mass.

      The placebo being used in this study is Maltodextrin (a sugar). Maltodextrin is an FDA
      approved food additive made from a highly processed starch product typically made from corn.
