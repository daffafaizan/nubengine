      are inserted into ureters of patients who suffer from kidney stones, urinary tract infections
      or cancer. Usually the muscle cells of the ureter contract in a coordinated fashion
      (peristalsis) in order to provide urinary flow from the kidney into the bladder. By inserting
      a stent these contractions are disrupted, eventually resulting in a loss of peristalsis. This
      phenomena is accompanied by swelling of the kidney and pain, which are well-known negative
      side effects of stents. To avoid stent-related morbidity and improve patients care this issue
      needs to be investigated further. A first step is to analyse the impact of stents on
      peristalsis and to possibly bring these results into context with hypothesised molecular
      mechanisms involved in peristalsis.
