      Subjects with chronic ulcers or partial thickness burns (including donor sites) at 2 sites
      will be included. Each subject with a chronic ulcer will be seen once a week for a maximum of
      4 weeks or until desired treatment effect is obtained, whichever occurs earlier. Each subject
      with a partial thickness burn/donor site will be followed once a week for a maximum of 3
      weeks or until desired treatment effect is obtained, whichever occurs earlier. All dressing
      changes will be done according to clinical routine practices and will follow IFU (instruction
      for use)
