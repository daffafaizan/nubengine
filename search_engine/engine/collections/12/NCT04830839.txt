      management of psychological distress in children who have been hospitalized for a physical
      trauma. The investigators will pilot an innovative, brief e-health approach to treatment of
      PTSS designed to be delivered through the trauma system. The investigators will create
      interactive web-based psychoeducational modules that are developmentally tailored for school
      age children (8 to 17 years) for use with synchronous e-health therapy sessions with a
      trained therapist. Companion modules for parents will help parents to understand and respond
      to their child's PTSS. The investigators will perform a single-arm pilot trial of a brief
      e-health approach to treatment of PTSS (i.e., Recovery after Stress Toolkit; ReSeT). ( delete
