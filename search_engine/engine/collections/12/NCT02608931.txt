      dronabinol for the treatment of nausea in patients with FD. The pilot trial will recruit 25
      patients with FD who complain of severe nausea that affects their quality of life. The trial
      will be divided into two consecutive, but independent parts. Part 1, will address the safety
      and tolerability of dronabinol in patients with FD using an open-label dose titration phase
      followed by 4-weeks of wash-out period. Part 2 will address the efficacy of dronabinol for
      the treatment of nausea in patients with FD using a randomized, placebo controlled, double
      blind, 12-week cross over design.

      The first specific aim of this proposal is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      dronabinol in patients with FD. The second specific aim of this proposal is to determine
      whether stimulation of endocannabinoid receptors with dronabinol will improve recurrent
      nausea in patients with FD. Secondary aims are to determine whether stimulation of
      endocannabinoid receptors with dronabinol will increase weight, and decrease anxiety.
