      Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) setting, the final treatment manual will be used to
      train clinicians in BA at the CMHC through workshops and training cases.

      Upon completion of training and certification of adequate implementation of BA, a total of 80
      patients with MDD will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 9 sessions of BA or
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) at the CMHC. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of (1) percent of
      eligible patients who refuse randomization, (2) percent of patients who complete 9 sessions
      of BA treatment, (3) percent of BA homework assignments that are completed, (4) percent of
      monthly assessments obtained, and (5) patient ratings of credibility and alliance in BA
      treatment. The ability of CMHC therapists to adequately implement BA will be assessed by
      rating taped sessions on BA adherence and competence scales. In addition to
      feasibility/acceptability of BA and TAU, this study is designed to test whether theoretically
      important targets of BA change over the course of BA treatment, and whether such changes are
      associated with changes in depressive symptoms. The target measures will be assessed at
      baseline, month 1, month 2, and month 3. To support the potential role of these targets as
      the mechanisms of change in BA, change in the target variables will be examined in relation
      to change in depression symptoms. The investigators will also pilot a potential moderator of
      treatment effects (trait reward processing, as measured at baseline using the
      Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task) to include this potential moderator in a subsequent
      fully-powered study with the long-term goal of identifying the types of patients most
      responsive to BA.
