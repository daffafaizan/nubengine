    
      Medical students in their final years without any significant experience in handling an
      angled laparoscopic camera participate in the study and perform a camera guidance test in
      surgery. The participants are then randomized in two groups to receive either a simulator
      based or traditional in theatre training during three weeks. The camera test will be
      repeated, while both tests are going to be recorded. Videos of 14 camera tests carried out by
      laparoscopic experts are taped as well.
