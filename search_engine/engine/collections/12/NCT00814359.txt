    
      Sixty patients with head and neck cancer being treated with 6 or more weeks of radiotherapy,
      will be randomly assigned to receive either a combination of magic mouthwash
      (diphenhydramine, dexamethasone and nystatin) plus sucralfate or benzydamine. Patients
      randomized to receive magic mouthwash plus sucralfate will rinse first with 5ml of the magic
      mouthwash for 2 minutes then swallow, followed by rinsing with 5ml of the 1g/5ml sucralfate
      for 2 minutes before swallowing, 4 times daily. Patients randomized to receive 0.15%
      benzydamine HCl will be instructed to rinse with 15ml of the solution for 2 minutes before
      expectorating, 4 times daily. Patients will start the mouthwash regimens prior to the
      initiation of radiotherapy, and stop 2 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.
