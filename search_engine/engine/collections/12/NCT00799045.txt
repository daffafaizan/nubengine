    
      The objective is to evaluate the incidence and severity of new-onset migraine headache
      episodes following transcatheter ASD closure in patients treated with aspirin alone compared
      to those on aspirin + clopidogrel therapy as antithrombotic treatment after the procedure.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, multicenter study, including patients with
      no previous history of migraine attacks who have been diagnosed with an ASD and for whom
      transcatheter ASD closure has been clinically indicated. Patients will be randomized either
      to aspirin (80 mg/day) or aspirin (80 mg/day) + clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 3 months
      following ASD closure. The occurrence and severity of migraine headaches will be evaluated by
      a neurologist using a structured headache questionnaire at 1 month and 3 months following ASD
      closure. An additional 6 month and 1 year follow-up evaluation will be exploratory according
      to local feasibility.
