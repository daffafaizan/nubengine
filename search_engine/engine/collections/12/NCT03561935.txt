      patients without structural heart disease occasionally have benign outcomes. The initial
      therapy of symptomatic premature ventricular complex is medical treatment with beta-blocker,
      calcium channel blocker or antiarrhythmic agents. However, no large prospective study has
      been performed to identify the difference in the efficacy between drugs. The current study
      was designed to compare the efficacy between beta-blocker and class Ic antiarrhythmic agent.
      Patient with symptomatic PVC more than 6000 episode per 24 hours is included. Exclusion
      criteria are evidence of structural heart disease, coronary heart disease, significant
      bradycardia or use of a concomitant antiarrhythmic agent. Patients are randomized into
      beta-blocker group (propranolol) and Ic antiarrhythmic agent group (propafenone). Response to
      the drug is evaluated after 2 months from randomization by 24 hours Holter and questionnaire.
      The primary endpoint is more than 80% PVC reduction or PVC burden less than 300 beats per 24
      hours. The secondary endpoint is patient's symptom evaluated by questionnaire and the number
      of PVCs measured in 24 hours Holter.
