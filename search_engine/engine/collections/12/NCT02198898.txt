    
      Adhesive bowel obstruction is relatively often complication in patients after abdominal
      surgery

      Gastric cancer is the most frequent cancer in Korea.

      The incidence of adhesive bowel obstruction would be increased in patients with gastric
      cancer, especially associated radical lymphadenectomy.

      The causes of postoperative adhesive obstruction include adhesion of the wound, adhesion of
      small intestine to small intestine, adhesion of the small intestine to other abdominal
      organs, and internal hernia.

      Several studies reported efficacy of adhesive preventing agent after colorectal resection.

      Gastrectomy is associated with a high risk (incidence, 11.7%-38.5%) of bowel obstruction.

      To date, however, no randomized study has shown that GUARDIX-SGâ“‡ reduces the rate of small
      bowel obstruction after gastrectomy with radical lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.
