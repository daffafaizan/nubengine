      endothelial dysfunction, characterised by reduced bioactivity of nitric oxide (NO). Folates
      are thought to improve endothelial function,but the mechanism by which this effect occurs is
      poorly understood. We propose to study the effects of folate supplementation on endothelial
      function in patients with coronary artery disease.
