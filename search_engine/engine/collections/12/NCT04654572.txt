      Current opinion states that the hypermetabolic state resolves soon after complete wound
      closure. Clinically, we have witnessed that burned patient appear to be hypermetabolic and
      catabolic long after full healing of their wounds. Our goal in this study was to determine
      muscle mechanical properties (tone, stiffness and elasticity) after burn.
