      rhythm is significantly delayed according to the environmental demands. Hence, the symptoms
      consist of major difficulties falling asleep and problems awakening in due time and patients
      often experience work- and school related impairments (The International Classification of
      Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding manual, 2005). However, correct diagnosis is often not
      made and the treatment offered is, accordingly, often inadequate. DSPS normally develops in
      interplay between dysfunctional habits/behaviour and biological vulnerability.

      Bright light therapy and administration of exogenous melatonin comprise the most common
      interventions. Timed bright light has been shown to effectively phase advance the rhythm
      (Rosenthal et al., 1990), but no standardized guidelines regarding the duration, intensity or
      timing of light exposure have been established. Compliance to the treatment is often poor
      because it involves structuring the daily schedule, which may be hard for the relevant age
      group. Similarly, administration of melatonin in the evening has been shown to phase advance
      the rhythm (Lewy et al., 1998; Mundey, Benloucif, Harsanyi, Dubocovich, & Zee, 2005), but a
      standardized approach for dose, duration and timing is lacking.

      It is important to establish effective treatment guidelines for delayed sleep phase syndrome.
      Large scale studies on the effects of melatonin and bright light treatment in randomized
      placebo-controlled designs are needed. In a clinical trial we aim to investigate the efficacy
      of bright light and melatonin treatment using a 4 armed randomized placebo controlled design.
