      there have only been fixed diameter valve options for severe valve disease requiring
      replacement. This presents numerous obstacles for those pediatric patients who require
      replacement early in life, as the fixed diameter does not offer options for expansion for
      somatic growth, and early reoperation will be required.

      The Melody valve has been approved for transcatheter implantation into the RVOT (right
      ventricular outflow tract), and has shown competence within a range of sizes. Recent studies
      conducted at Boston Children's Hospital of off-label use of the Melody valve into
      atrioventricular valve positions have shown acceptable short-term valve performance, and that
      subsequent catheter-based expansion is feasible.
