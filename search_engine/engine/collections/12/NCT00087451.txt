    
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AP23573 when administered intravenously once daily for five days
      repeated every two weeks to patients with progressive or recurrent gliomas who have failed
      standard therapy and who are or are not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC)
      medications.

      The secondary objectives are to: characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AP23573 when
      administered daily for five days repeated every two weeks at the indicated dosage levels in
      patients receiving and not receiving EIAC; describe the progression-free survival at six
      months; describe changes in proteins affected by mTOR inhibition; describe single timepoint
      status of proteins affected by mTOR inhibition in tumor tissue surgical specimens after
      AP23573 dosing; describe the status of key proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway in archival
      tumor samples, if available; describe health-related quality of life at the start of the
      trial and prior to study drug infusion and at various timepoints throughout the trial.

      Protocol Outline:

      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, sequential dose escalation cohort trial of the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of AP23573 when administered intravenously as a 30-minute
      infusion, once daily for five days, repeated every two weeks, to patients with progressive or
      recurrent malignant glioma.
