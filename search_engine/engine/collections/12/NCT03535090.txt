      There were short- and long-term hemostatic changes analysed during IVMP therapy: comparisons
      of laboratory tests before, 24h and 48h after selected pulses, and between the beginning of
      1st, 6th and 12th IVMP pulses, respectively. Hemostatic variables that were evaluated: factor
      [F] II, FV, FVII, FVIII, fibrinogen, antithrombin, activated partial thromboplastin time,
      prothrombin time, platelets and D - dimer. Moreover, analyses were performed concerning
      clinical data (such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, duration time of GO, presence of
      hypertension, basal markers of thyroid function) between independent groups (patients with
      initially increased/reduced selected markers versus without increased/reduced selected
      markers).
