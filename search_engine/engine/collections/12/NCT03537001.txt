    
      In pre-hospital settings, the administration of analgesics is often delayed because of
      difficult patient access (incarceration), difficulty finding a venous pathway or patient
      refusal.

      An optimization of the management of pain in urgency is therefore still necessary.

      A side from nitrousoxide of which usage remains restrictive, methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) is
      the only volatile analgesic currently available for pre-hospital use.

      Methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) is a single-use inhalation non-opioid analgesic for the management
      of moderate to severe traumatic pain. This treatment has been used in New Zealand and Canada
      for over 20 years for the management of acute pain in adults and children. It was granted
      marketing authorization in Europe in 2016 and has been marketed in France since 2017.

      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To study the efficacy and safety of Penthrox, administrated at the beginning of the
           management of the traumatized adult patient.

        -  Assess the comfort of patients and caregivers

        -  To answer the question: Does the use of the inhaled route with Penthrox add value to the
           treatment of acute traumatic pain in the pre-hospital stage?
