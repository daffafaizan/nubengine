           groups, respectively (Intensive multifactorial therapy and conventional multifactorial
           therapy groups). After those therapy for one year, a 10 years of follow up study will be
           performed. During this period, we take them together intensive education, and take
           conventional multifactorial therapy for both of two groups.

        -  At the beginning (0 year),the end of intensive multifactorial therapy (1 year), 5 years
           and 10 years, we will measure the endothelium-dependent arterial dilation, endothelium
           related cytokines such as ET-1, vWF,as well as blood glucose, HbA1c for all of
           individuals.

        -  We will compare the endothelial function,endothelium related cytokines such as ET-1,
           vWF,as well as blood glucose, HbA1c between intensive therapy group and conventional
           therapy group at different time points.
