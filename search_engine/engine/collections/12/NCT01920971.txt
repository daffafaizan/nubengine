      sessions of hot pack therapy combined active or placebo monochromatic infrared energy therapy
      over the low back (wavelength = 890 nm, radiant power output = 6.24 W, power density = 34.7
      milliwatt/cm2 for 40 min, total energy 83.2 J/cm2) followed by 20-min supervised therapeutic
      exercise, for 3 times per week for a 4-week duration. Patients will be assessed at before
      treatment and follow-up assessments, including after 2 week of treatment; after 4 weeks of
      treatment; and 1 and 3 months, respectively, after treatment is terminated.

      Main Outcome Measures: Patients will be assessed periodically with pain, Multidimensional
      Fatigue Inventory, postural stability (using the postural stability evaluation system: Biodex
      Stability System), and Fear-Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire.
