      augmentation. Since intraprocedural pain is common during vertebral body endplate
      manipulation, these procedures are often carried out using conscious sedation or general
      anesthesia. Research has shown that the vertebral endplates are innervated by the
      basivertebral nerve, which has been successfully targeted via radiofrequency ablation to
      treat chronic vertebrogenic lower back pain. With this physiology in mind, the investigators
      will attempt to treated participants with vertebral compression using lidocaine-induced
      intraosseous basivertebral nerve block as the primary intraprocedural analgesia.
