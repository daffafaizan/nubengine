      clamping during complex hepatectomy. A randomized comparative trial was performed to compare
      PTC with either infrahepatic IVC clamping or low central venous pressure in complex liver
      resections. 192 consecutive patients were involved in this study and allocated equally to two
      groups. Preoperative demographic and clinical data, details of surgical procedure, pathologic
      diagnosis, postoperative course and complications were collected prospectively.
