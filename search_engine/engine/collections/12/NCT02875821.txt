      sensitivity in peripheral tissue and liver by protecting non-adipose tissues against
      excessive lipid overload and by balancing the secretion of adipocytokines.

      However, PPARγ is a key transcription factor that induces the differentiation adipocyte
      maturation and stimulates the induction of enzymes involved in lipogenesis. As a result, the
      effect of pioglitazone is generally accompanied by weight gain and an increase in amount of
      subcutaneous fat.

      Obesity would coexist with fatty liver disease and both conditions aggravate hyperglycemia in
      diabetes. According to recent study, up-regulated PPARγ expression in liver was reported in
      obesity with hepatic steatosis which implies pioglitazone might induce fatty liver disease.

      A novel oral antidiabetic drug, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor reduces
      renal glucose reabsorption and increasing renal glucose excretion thereby promoting energy
      loss. As a result, it prevents weight gain and fluid retention which might counteract the
      unfavorable effects of pioglitazone treatment.

      No study has been conducted on the additional effect on obesity and fatty liver of
      ipragliflozin in T2DM patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin.

      In this study, the investigators investigate beneficial effects of ipragliflozin, newly
      developted SGLT2 inhibitor, on reduction in visceral fat area and degree of fatty liver in
      subjects with T2DM when added to metformin and pioglitazone therapy.
