      I. Evaluate the ability of ZD1839 to improve progression free survival in patients with
      advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      II. Evaluate response rate of ZD1839 in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      III. Evaluate the effect of ZD1839 on measurable disease in patients with unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      IV. Evaluate the effect of ZD1839 on serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in patients with abnormal
      pretreatment serum levels.

      V. Evaluate toxicity of ZD1839 in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      VI. Investigate biologic markers for outcome in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma treated with ZD1839.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 3 years from study entry.
