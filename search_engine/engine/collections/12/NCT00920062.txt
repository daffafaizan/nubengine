      venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The study uses an external monitor, laptop
      computer, clamp on flowsensors and ultrasound dilution technology to measure blood flow.
      Measurements are made by injecting 0.5 - 1 ml/kg of sterile isotonic saline into the
      patient's extracorporeal circuit. The subject will be monitored throughout the measurements.
      The measurements will be coordinated with the regular care of the patient and their
      extracorporeal circuit.
