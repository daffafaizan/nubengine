      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains the gold standard treatment for patients with
      multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Despite the proposed benefits of multiple arterial
      grafts, autologous saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are still the most frequently used bypass
      conduits in CABG. Progressive SVG failure after CABG remains a key limitation to the
      long-term success of surgery.

      Study design:

      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, within-subject-controlled , trial, enrolling patients
      with multi vessel atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, scheduled to undergo SVG CABG with
      arterial grafting of IMA to LAD and two or more saphenous vein grafts. In each patient, one
      SVG bypass will be randomized to be supported by the VEST, while another will not be
      supported and serve as control. Thus, the full cohort will provide a basis for comparison
      between two sets of SVGs: A VEST supported set; and an unsupported set.
