      intraoral stent will provide a larger distance between the tongue and palate and can reduce
      side-effects. The main objective of the present study is to confirm that the use of an
      intraoral stent will result in lower dose to the palate throughout the treatment period. A
      secondary objective is to measure the reduction in acute mucositis in the palate.

      The intraoral stent used in the present study is available in two sizes, 10 and 20mm
      thickness. The intervention group and control group will consist of approximately five
      patients each. Target coverage will be measured by the minimum dose covering 98% of the
      clinical target volume (D98CTV). Dose to the organs at risk (hard and soft palate) will be
      measured by the mean dose. Data will be collected from the planning computed tomography (CT)
      and daily cone-beam CT (CBCT). Acute mucositis will be scored by Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0.
