      of 1-2 mIU/min and the dose was increased by 2 mIU/min at every 15 minutes until regular
      contractions obtained at a rate of 3-5 contractions in a 10-minute period. The maximum dose
      of oxytocin was 40 mIU/min and oxytocin was administered until delivery. In the intermittent
      group, oxytocin was discontinued when cervical dilation was 5 cm and 2 hours after
      discontinuation oxytocin was reused at a starting dose of 1-2 mIU/min and was increased as
      the same protocol used for continuation oxytocin group.
