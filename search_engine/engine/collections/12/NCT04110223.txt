      caused by genetic variations and implicated multiple key pathways that might explain
      radiation toxicity. Normal tissue toxicity is a complex trait that involves the combined
      effect of a multitude of genes and pathways, and also dynamic interactions with the evolving
      cancer genome. The effect size of any individual factor is likely small. As a consequence,
      candidate gene approach and genome-wide association studies rarely lead to the identification
      of genetic determinants of radiation toxicity. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), on
      the other hand, has become increasingly routine in the clinic and would allow simultaneous
      assessment of multiple genetic alterations.
