      compared to care as usual as a non-surgical treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).

      Patients diagnosed with CTS are recruited from the outpatient neurology clinic of VieCuri
      Medical Center in Venlo, The Netherlands. They will be randomly assigned to the intervention
      or control group. Patients in the intervention group will receive 12 treatments with
      mechanical traction during six consecutive weeks. Patients in the control group will receive
      care as usual, which can include splinting, a corticosteroid injection, carpal tunnel release
      surgery or an expectant strategy. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12
      months after inclusion.
