      I. To determine the health benefits of expressive writing compared with the control
      condition.

      II. To characterize how acculturation moderates the effects of expressive writing
      interventions.

      III. To identify mechanisms explaining the benefits of the interventions using mixed methods.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I (CONTROL): Patients write about facts regarding their cancer diagnosis and treatment
      for 3 weekly 30-minute sessions.

      ARM II (SELF-REGULATION): Patients write about stress and coping, emotional disclosure, and
      benefit finding for 3 weekly 30-minute sessions.

      ARM III (SELF-CULTIVATION): Patients write about positive thoughts and feelings regarding
      their breast cancer experience for 3 weekly 30-minute sessions.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 weeks and at 6 and 12 months.
