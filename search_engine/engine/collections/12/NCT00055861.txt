      I. Determine the response rate in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      treated with bevacizumab and docetaxel.

      II. Determine the side effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate soluble
      activated endothelial cell markers and adhesion molecules, quantitation of tumor and/or
      endothelial cell apoptosis, and quantitation of microvessel density with clinical outcome in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on
      weeks 1 and 3 and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on weeks 1, 2, and 3. Treatment repeats every
      4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      After completion of 6 courses of combined treatment, patients with an ongoing response may
      receive bevacizumab alone in the absence of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-27
      months.
