    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, longitudinal, cross-over
      evaluation of the repair of challenging abdominal wall defects using Strattice(TM) TM or
      standard surgical repair. These abdominal wall defects can be acute or chronic, and include
      midline, transverse (including flank) as well as Pfannenstiel incisions. The skin may be
      closed (fascial dehiscence or incisional hernia) or open (patient with open abdomen or acute
      fascial dehiscence) with or without evisceration. Patients randomized to the control group
      who require a re-operation to perform the planned final repair or due to failure of the
      initial repair within 12 months, will be offered repair with Stratticeâ„¢ TM (i.e. "crossed
      over") or if such repair not performed, the patient will have completed the study. An
      adaptive study design will be used to validate the initial conditional power of the study and
      a balanced randomization, based upon the three conditions (type of defect [dehiscence, hernia
      repair or open abdomen], morbidity [POSSUM score] and time since exposure of abdominal
      fascia/viscera) will be used to equally distribute subjects between groups.

      The primary endpoint of this study is hernia occurrence at 12 months post repair and
      secondary endpoints include re-operation for abdominal wall repair within 12 months,
      incidence of complications requiring intervention(medical or surgical) within the first 30
      days after repair,, length of hospitalization and resource utilization, and all cause
      mortality.

      Subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive Strattice(TM) TM reinforcement of repair
      or standard of care repair (i.e. suture alone or suture with absorbable mesh) and followed at
      set timepoints to observe incision site repair for surgical site events, including
      reoperation and hernia occurrence.
