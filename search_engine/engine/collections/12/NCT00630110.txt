      docetaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The formation of new
      blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important component of tumor growth, vascular disrupting
      agents are intended to target the differences between these tumor blood vessels and the blood
      vessels in normal tissues. There are indications of advantages in combining vascular
      disrupting agents with standard agents in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC).
