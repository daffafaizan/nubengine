      modified Salmonella typhimurium. This bacteria has been genetically modified to alter its
      pathogenicity and to attempt to increase its localization to sites of growing cancer. Cohorts
      of patients will receive increasing doses of the bacteria to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose.
