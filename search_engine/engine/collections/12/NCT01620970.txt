    
      This is an open-label, single arm, non randomised, phase II proof-of-concept study of the
      monoclonal antibody against TGF-beta receptor ALK1 (PF03446962) for patients with urothelial
      cancer relapsing/progressing after first line chemotherapy.

      The study is planned according to Simon's Optimal two-stage design. The primary endpoint is
      the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 2-months. A 2-month PFS rate of 50% is
      not promising, while a 70% rate will be promising. In stage 1, 21 evaluable patients will be
      accrued. If 12 patients at least will be progression-free at 2 months, enrollment will be
      extended to the 2nd stage for further 24 patients. If, out of the total of 45 patients, 27 at
      least will be progression-free at 2 months, treatment will be declared worthy for further
      investigations.

      Maximum overall accrual is 45 patients. Type I and type II error rates will be set both at
      the 10% level.
