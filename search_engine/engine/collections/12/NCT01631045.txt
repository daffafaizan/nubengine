      will come to the University of Washington hospital 2 times. At the first health screening
      visit, we will go over the subjects' medical history, weight and height, and eating habits.
      This visit will take an hour or so and eligible subjects will then schedule the study visit.
      For the study visit, subjects will have to fast overnight from 9:30 pm the night before and
      arrive at the hospital at 8:00am. At 8:30 am, the subject will have a 30 minute MRI scan of
      the brain done in the University of Washington Radiology Department. During the MRI scan they
      will see pictures of common objects and foods and be asked to remember the photos they saw.
      At 9 am subjects will eat a standard breakfast, and they will not eat again until after the
      second MRI. The time of their second MRI will be randomly assigned to one of seven time
      points anywhere from 15 minutes to 5 hours after the breakfast. After the MRI, subjects will
      be allowed to eat freely from food we provide. Subjects will receive $10 for the health
      screening visit, and $50-85 depending on the length of the visit.
