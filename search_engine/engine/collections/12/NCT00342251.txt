      States. Available evidence suggests that AMD is a complex disorder with a significant genetic
      component as well as potential environmental influences. In this study we propose to examine
      3,000 members, ages 50 and older, of the Old Order Amish community in the Lancaster and
      Franklin counties area in Pennsylvania. We plan to detail the epidemiology of AMD in this
      population isolate in attempt to elucidate genetic factors which may confer susceptibility
      and predispose some Amish individuals and their families to develop AMD. All study
      participants agreeing to enroll and providing informed consent will undergo a complete,
      dilated eye examination during which digital stereo images of the macula and optic disc
      regions will be acquired. Study participants will also be asked to complete a brief
      questionnaire inquiring about personal exposures related to occupation, sunlight, and
      smoking. AMD will be determined by an independent reading of the digital fundus photographs
      by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center according to the AREDS AMD
      classification scheme. We will employ standard statistical genetics methods of parametric and
      non-parametric linkage analysis, association analysis, and transmission disequilibrium tests,
      with allowances for environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors to determine if we can identify
      any candidate regions or candidate genes that predispose Amish individuals to an increased
      risk of AMD. Ultimately, we hope to follow up any regions that show suggestive evidence of
      linkage on the genome-wide scan with fine mapping in those regions, leading to eventual
      cloning and sequencing of a gene or genes.
