      intake per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). One meal was considered with inadequate protein
      intake if its content was <30 g or 0.4 g/kg.

      Functionality was assessed with two validated questionnaires. One for instrumental activities
      of daily living (Lawton) and another for activities of daily living (Barthel). We calculated
      a score according to each author's scales. This score was divided into three possible groups
      as "low", "middle", and "high" scores.

      To analyze the association between inadequate protein intake per meal and functionality, we
      used multinomial logistic regression. The outcome variable was functionality ("High" was the
      reference group, "middle" and "low" scores were considered as impaired functionality), and
      the predictive variables were inadequate protein intake at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They
      were adjusted for age, BMI categories, number of diagnosed diseases, sex, and inadequate
      protein intake per day (<1.2 g/kg/d).
