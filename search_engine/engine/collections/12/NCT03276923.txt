      their local obstetrician during the pregnancy. This is a natural-history study and will not
      include medications, laboratory testing, or procedures outside of the standard of care.

      Management of the rheumatologic disease will be directed based on patient needs by the local
      rheumatologist and obstetrician. Enrollment in the registry will not dictate specific
      therapy. The Registry will include data from each office visit during pregnancy and up to 12
      months after delivery.

      The registry will be ongoing, with periodic analysis of clinical data samples as specific
      studies are approved.

      Enrollment in the registry does not significantly increase risks for a patient.
