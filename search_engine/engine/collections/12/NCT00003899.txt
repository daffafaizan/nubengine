      with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate the overall survival and response
      rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 4 or 24 hours on day 2, followed by daily filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing through day 7 or until WBCs are greater than
      100,000 cells/mm3. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow is collected
      on days 5-7. At 30-50 days following mobilization, patients receive melphalan IV over 15-60
      minutes on days -5 and -4 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2, followed by
      autologous bone marrow transplantation or PBSC infusion on day 0. Sequential dose escalation
      of melphalan is followed by sequential dose escalation of thiotepa. Dose escalation in
      cohorts of 5 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4, 3 of 7, 4 of 11, or 5 of 15
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 60 days and at 12
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
