      and presents earlier than cardiac amyloidosis symptoms - 21-45% of ATTR patients and case
      reports in AL patients. The investigators' recent study found that 10% of older patients
      undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery were positive for amyloidosis, with 20% of that
      group presenting with cardiac involvement. 70% of the amyloid-positive group had a history of
      spinal stenosis and 40% required surgical intervention. Surgical intervention for spinal
      stenosis could provide an opportunity to screen for amyloidosis through yellow ligament
      (ligamentum flavum) biopsy.

      This study will look at the prevalence of amyloidosis in patients undergoing surgical
      intervention for non-congenital spinal stenosis and spondyloarthropathy. The investigators
      hypothesize that 10% of such patients will be positive for amyloidosis.
