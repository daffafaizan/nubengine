      developing Kaposi s sarcoma (KS), but the risk factors for KSHV infection and for KS
      following infection are not well defined. Classical KS (cKS) occurs without apparent immune
      deficiency (such as AIDS or an allograft). The proposed study will test specific hypotheses
      and generate new hypotheses on the risk of cKS among persons who have antibodies against
      KSHV, on the risk of KSHV seropositivity, and on the risk of active KSHV infection, defined
      as KSHV viremia or viral shedding in saliva. To do so, 120 incident cases of cKS from
      throughout Sicily and approximately 1800 persons (15% KSHV seropositive) of similar age, sex,
      and community size will be asked to participate by providing questionnaire data and blood and
      saliva specimens. Residual formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue from KS skin biopsies
      will be available for verification of diagnosis and molecular analyses. Primary hypotheses
      are focused on host genetic susceptibility, endogenous clinical conditions (such as asthma
      and allergy), and exogenous exposures (cigarette smoking and contact with certain plants,
      water and soil) that are postulated to affect KSHV activation, dissemination, and disease
      induction. The study will have sufficient statistical power to detect factors that increase
      the risk of KSHV seropositivity by 1.5- to 2-fold, the risk of cKS by 2- to 3-fold, and the
      risk of KSHV viremia or shedding by 3- to 4-fold.
