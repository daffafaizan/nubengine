    
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      evaluated the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of two recombinant live-attenuated RSV
      vaccines: RSV ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L and RSV 276. The vaccines were delivered as nose drops to
      RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L
      vaccine, the RSV 276 vaccine, or placebo at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants could be enrolled in the study outside of RSV season, i.e., between April 1 and
      October 14 for most sites or-for sites with local RSV seasons that start earlier-as specified
      on a site-by-site basis in the manual of procedures. Participants remained on study until
      they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year
      following enrollment. Participants' total study duration was between 6 and 13 months,
      depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants attended several study visits
      throughout the study, which included physical examinations, blood collection, nasal washes,
      and/or nasal adsorption (nasosorption) specimen collection. Participants' parents or
      guardians were contacted by study staff at various times during the study to monitor
      participants' health.
