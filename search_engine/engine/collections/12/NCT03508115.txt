      cognition, quality of life and psychopathology. At the same time, investigators intend to
      study the association between cognitive changes and some clinical variables.

      The sample consists of 80 subjects (40 HCV patients and 40 HCV patients coinfected with the
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV). Exclusion criteria: Cirrhosis, presence of minimal
      hepatic encephalopathy or active drug consumption.

      A neuropsychological assessment is made before the treatment with direct antiviral agents to
      evaluate memory, executive functions, processing speed, anxiety, depression and quality of
      life. Additionally, the following clinical variables are collected: Viral charge,
      immunosuppression (measured with T Cells CD4 (CD4), CD4 nadir and T Cells CD8 (CD8)) and
      fibrosis level, HCV genotype and plasma biomarkers: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),
      Interleukine 6 (IL6), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-a),Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
      Soluble CD14 (SCD14), Neuro-specific enolase (NSE).

      The second neuropsychological assessment and clinical data collection is carried out after
      treatment, concretely 6 months after HCV is undetectable in plasma.
