      human being. The sensory organs are the main recipients of the information, thanks to them we
      are able to interact with the environment and register the influence of the stimuli inside
      the organism. The brain receives information from the environment through its senses.

      At the tactile level the brain receives afferent information thanks to the activation of
      mechanoreceptors of the skin during interaction with the environment. The receivers encode
      the stimulus information and send it to the specific CNS structures. In these structures, the
      sensations received are combined and the stimulus is transformed into a perfectly elaborated
      response, both in a conscious and innate way.

      Dr. Vojta showed in 1974 the locomotion reflects the result of the study of motor
      ontogenesis. This discovery was the demonstration of the existence of innate and
      preprogrammed motor patterns in Humans.

      Most of the studies related to VT have showed the improvements obtained by the patients,
      validating it as a method of treatment and evidencing objective changes after its
      application. This research aim to go further and verify that cortical areas are activated
      during the application of an external and proprioceptive stimuli that are performed during
      the first phase of VT turning and which areas are responsible for producing and organizing
      the efferent response.
