      500 (PV500) to detect changes in both global and regional ventilation and perfusion. As this
      is a non-invasive, observational trial, neither a positive nor a negative impact on the
      actual study participants is expected. The results will, however, improve the knowledge about
      the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technology and thus aid the use of this technology
      for the benefit of future patients.
