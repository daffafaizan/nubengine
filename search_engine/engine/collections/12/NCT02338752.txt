      enrolled and randomly assigned into two arms at an 1:1 ratio. In the control arm patients
      will be receiving standard therapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
      guide line (control group) and in experimental arm, patients will be receiving simultaneous
      standard therapy and injection of mix vaccine (MV). MV will be injected weekly till disease
      progression.

      Blood sample will be obtained at baseline and every week before MV injection for the
      assessment of clinical hematology, biochemistry measurements and immunology index (including
      immunoglobin, interleukin and interferon). Patients will be evaluated for toxicity throughout
      the study. Side effect, progression free survival, immunology index and general status will
      be recorded.
