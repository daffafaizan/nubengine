           GFR, daily urine volume (Uvol), and anuria-free survival. GFR and Uvol were evaluated
           within 1 week before CAPD initiation (the baseline), and then at month 1, 6, 12, 18 and
           24. At the same time, body weight, blood pressure, daily net ultrafiltration, dialysis
           adequacy, peritoneal solute transport rate, and biochemical parameters etc. were
           assessed. Once an episode of peritonitis or other serious reversible intercurrent
           illness occurred, all the assessments were delayed one month after being cured. Anuria
           was termed by daily Uvol permanently less than 100 ml.

        2. The secondary end points included technique survival, patient survival and peritonitis.
           Technique failure was defined as switching to maintenance hemodialysis.
