    
      To evaluate the changes in the microcirculation of the liver, kidney and spleen during acute
      infection in patients with malaria (cohorts 1 and 3) and other infectious diseases such as
      acute pyelonephritis at day 0 (within 8 hours of the treatment start), day 2 to 4 and day
      28-32, using functional US with continuous infusion of a contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco,
      Italy).

      Three cohortes will be studied: cohorte 1 infection at Plasmodium falciparum (24 patients),
      cohorte 3 infection at Plasmodium vivax, ovale or malariae (5 patients) and cohorte 2 other
      infectious diseases such as acute pyelonephritis (24 patients).

      Study hypothesis: malaria patients should exhibit a different pattern of enhancement,
      particularly when quantitative measurements of the SU signals is performed with destruction
      reperfusion kinetics.
