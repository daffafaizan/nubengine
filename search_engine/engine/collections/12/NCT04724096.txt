      within cancer tissues. Preliminary clinical data demonstrates the feasibility of using this
      methodology to study patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The
      investigators wish to investigate using this methodology to identify hypoxic subvolumes
      within HNSCC that may have greater resistance to standard radiotherapy treatment and
      investigate the association of such hypoxic regions with treatment outcomes.
