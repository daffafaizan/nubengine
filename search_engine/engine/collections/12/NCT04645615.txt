      cardiac tissue for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In the United States, the
      Cardioblate bipolar is approved for soft tissue ablation, while the Cardioblate Pen is
      approved for cardiac tissue ablation. The purpose of the clinical study is to obtain a
      labeling claim for the US market that the Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System can be used
      for ablation of cardiac tissue in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial
      fibrillation among permanent and persistent AF patients.
