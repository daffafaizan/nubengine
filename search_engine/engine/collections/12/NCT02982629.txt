      feasibility and effectiveness of a telephone-based intervention to improve rates of follow-up
      exams in patients with glaucoma. The prospective, randomized, controlled trial entitled
      "Improving Access to Eye Care in Patients with Glaucoma" will utilize cohort data from 2013
      electronic medical record information to reduce the gap between recommended and actual
      follow-up utilization of eye care services in glaucoma patients. Patients with glaucoma will
      be recruited from the Wills Eye Glaucoma clinic who were seen between 3/1/13 and 10/31/13. A
      recall list will be generated for patients who have scheduled follow-up appointments from
      9/1/13 to 11/30/13. These patients will be randomly assigned to the "Usual Care" group or
      "Intervention" group. The primary outcome will be successful attendance at a follow-up
      appointment within an appropriate time frame. This intervention is based on a CDC funded
      project at Wills to improve access to eye care in patients with diabetes. Thus, this pilot
      study will test the efficacy of a telephone-based intervention to improve follow-up adherence
      in patients with glaucoma by improving access to eye care.
