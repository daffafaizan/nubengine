      incidence rates, prevalence data and the clinical presentation of dengue across different age
      groups.

      The study will be conducted in at least three cities: Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Manaus.
      This study will also prepare potential sites for future clinical trials, by setting up the
      logistics and training staff on site to enroll a cohort of subjects perform dengue
      surveillance and other study procedures.

      Households will be randomly selected from communities where a registry system is implemented.
      All individuals in the household will be eligible for participating in the study. This study
      will be sponsored by GSK and co-funded by GSK and Fiocruz. As study sponsor, GSK will
      delegate some activities to Fiocruz, according to the provisions in their Cooperative
      Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).
