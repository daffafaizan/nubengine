      clinic visits as prescribed by the investigator, and were to be seen at a minimum of every 6
      months. At each clinic visit, participants were queried about any adverse events (AEs) or
      hyperammonemic crises (HACs) that occurred since the last visit. Physical and neurological
      examinations were performed, and blood samples were collected for the analysis of ammonia,
      amino acid panels, and routine clinical laboratory safety tests. Participants underwent
      neuropsychological testing at baseline, every 12 months thereafter, and at the final study
      visit.
