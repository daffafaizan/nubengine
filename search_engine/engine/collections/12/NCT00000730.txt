      with PCP who is not improving while receiving the standard therapies (SMX/TMP or PEN). New
      drug treatments are available, including steroid therapy and TMTX, but there is no
      information proving that these new treatments work better than the standard therapies.

      Hospitalized patients who have failed to respond to at least 4 full days but no greater than
      14 full days of therapy with SMX/TMP or PEN are randomly placed into one of three study
      groups. Patients are stratified for (1) mechanical ventilation at enrollment, (2) prior
      zidovudine therapy of at least 4 weeks duration, and (3) first versus subsequent episode of
      PCP. One group of patients receives TMTX by intravenous infusion for 21 days and LCV for 24
      days. The second and third group of patients receive either PEN or SMX/TMP depending on which
      therapy they have already received and not improved on. The difference between the second and
      third group is that the second group receives the conventional therapy (PEN or SMX/TMP) and a
      placebo (inactive medication) and the third group receives the conventional therapy and
      prednisolone. Neither investigators nor patients know whether patients receive
      methylprednisolone. Patients continue study treatment until a study end point is reached or
      for a minimum of 21 days (unless there is toxicity).
