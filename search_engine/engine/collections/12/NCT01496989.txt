    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety and
      tolerability of HIV-MAG with or without co-administered GENEVAX® IL-12 given intramuscularly
      by in vivo electroporation (IM/EP) using the Ichor Medical Systems TriGrid Delivery System
      (TDS-IM) followed by Ad35-GRIN/ENV in each of four different regimens. An additional group
      will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ad35-GRIN/ENV followed by HIV-MAG with
      co-administered GENEVAX® IL-12 given intramuscularly by in vivo electroporation (IM/EP) using
      the Ichor Medical Systems TriGrid Delivery System (TDS-IM).

      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before the 1st vaccination and will be followed for
      12 months after the first vaccine administration. It is anticipated that it will take
      approximately 3 months to enrol the study. Approximately 75 volunteers (60 vaccine/15 placebo
      recipients) will be included in the study.
