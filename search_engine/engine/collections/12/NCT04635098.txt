      sleep, or poor sleep quality and shortened sleep time. The prevalence of insomnia is about
      10-20% of population worldwide; Of which about approximately 50% are chronic. Insomnia is a
      risk factor for cognitive impairment and mental disorder development, and other diseases.
      Non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. physio-therapy, are often ineffective.
      Benzodiazepines and their derivatives are commonly prescribed for those patients but their
      side effects and long-time residual sleepy actions are very risky.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative, analgesic
      and anti-anxiety effects together with remarkable cytoprotective effects. It is widely used
      as a sedative. Dexmedetomidine was reported promote sleep. It can also modulate "clock"
      protein expression and hence afford a regulatory effects on the circadian rhythm. This
      randomised, double-blinded and controlled trial was designed to investigate whether
      dexmedetomidine can treat chronic insomnia patients. Its effects on sleep quality and
      improvement, EEG and circadian rhythm, brain connectivity, cognition and biomarker changes
      are determined. All participants are randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (a
      0.5μg/kg bolus injection for 10 minutes followed by 0.1µg/kg/hr) or placebo (normal saline
      infusion with an identical protocol as Dex) for 8 hrs from 10pm to 6 am.
