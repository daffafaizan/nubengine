      activity and safety of DTG containing regimen in HIV-1 infected ART-experienced adults with
      historical or current evidence of resistance to RAL or ELV. Initially, a minimum of 100
      subjects will be enrolled to receive DTG 50mg twice daily with the current failing regimen
      for 7 days but with OBR from Day 8. Subjects must also have documented genotypic and/or
      phenotypic resistance to at least one compound in two or more of the other approved classes
      of ART but must also be able to include at least one fully active drug in the OBR to be
      started Day 8. The first data cut will take place after the (approximate) 100th subject
      enrolled completes the Week 24 visit. Enrollment will continue until a further 50 to 100
      subjects have been recruited. All subjects who successfully complete 24 weeks of treatment
      will continue to have access to DTG until it is locally available as long as they continue to
      derive clinical benefit.
