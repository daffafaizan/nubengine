        -  To correlate indocyanine green and lidocaine metabolism with vinorelbine ditartrate
           pharmacokinetics in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors and varying degrees
           of liver dysfunction.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine ditartrate in these patients.

        -  To test a plan of dose adjustment for vinorelbine ditartrate administration in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to extent of clinical liver dysfunction (normal vs
      mild vs moderate vs severe).

      Patients receive dose-adjusted vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 10 minutes once weekly in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving an objective
      complete response receive 2 additional courses of study therapy.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic correlative studies. Blood is also collected after patients receive lidocaine
      IV push and indocyanine green (ICG) IV push. Samples are analyzed for whole blood and plasma
      concentrations of vinorelbine ditartrate and its metabolites by high performance liquid
      chromatography (15) or by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay. Samples are
      also analyzed for ICG clearance and lidocaine hydrochloride metabolic capacity by fluorescent
      polarization immunoassay.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
