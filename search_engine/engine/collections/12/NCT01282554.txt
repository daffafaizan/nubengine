      and after the 3 month program between the stimulated and the non stimulated group.

      The secondary outcomes will be evaluated by maximum strength developed during the ergometry,
      limited by symptoms; maximal charge during muscular test; quadricipital diameter; time for
      the " Timed up and go " test; quality of life scores. All those scores will be evaluated in
      the control and stimulated groups before and after the 3 month period.

      This is an open randomized controlled study. Tests will be done by an investigator unaware of
      the stimulation group. The study is designed to detect a difference of 61 m (+/- 80 m) (6MWT)
      before and after stimulation in the stimulated group and 0 in the control group. This
      difference has been based on a pilot study with ergocycle in the same population and on
      literature in other populations (chronic respiratory failure or post cardiac surgery). We
      estimated that 70 patients would need to be enrolled in each group to provide 90% statistical
      power with a bilateral test.
