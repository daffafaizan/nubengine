      prophylaxis, the incidence of adverse reactions to this medication is high. In a pilot study
      in which patients were initiated with SMX/TMP prophylaxis by gradually increasing the dose
      over 2 weeks, no significant adverse reactions have occurred.

      Patients are randomized to receive either gradually increasing doses of SMX/TMP suspension or
      routine daily initiation of SMX/TMP double strength (DS) tablets for 2 weeks. All patients
      will then be switched over to receive open-label SMX/TMP DS tablets daily for 10 weeks.
