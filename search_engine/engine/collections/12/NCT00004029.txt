      I. Assess the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus
      expressing prostate-specific antigen (rV-PSA) in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of
      the prostate.

      II. Determine the optimal dose of rV-PSA given at monthly intervals based on cellular and
      hormonal immunity.

      III. Determine whether vaccination with rV-PSA is associated with anti-tumor activity.

      IV. Determine whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has an effect
      on cellular and humoral immunity different from rV-PSA, and whether the addition of GM-CSF
      has enhanced antitumor effect compared to rV-PSA alone.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study.

      Patients in cohorts of 3-6 receive 3 vaccinations with rV-PSA at 4-week intervals (days 1,
      29, 57, and 85) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response
      assessment is performed at eight weeks. Patients who discontinue therapy prior to eight weeks
      are considered unevaluable for response. If dose limiting toxicity is observed in 2 of 6
      patients entered at a dose level, no further patients are entered at that level and the MTD
      is defined as the preceding dose level. Ten additional patients are treated at the MTD and
      receive granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administered subcutaneously
      on day -1 through day 2 of each cycle. Patients who are HLA-A2 positive, have received all 3
      rV-PSA vaccinations without unacceptable toxicity, and have been off study for at least 30
      days due to disease progression may continue treatment with rV-PSA at the highest dose level
      and the addition of GM-CSF.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.
