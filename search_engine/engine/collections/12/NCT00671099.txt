      events.For instance, nearly one-third of injured patients appear to develop trauma-related
      psychiatric illness and the major diagnoses are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
      depressive disorder.Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (Omega-3 PUFA) has some evidence of
      efficacy of treatment in patients with anxiety and mood disorders, but no evidence of
      preventing anxiety and mood disorders that occur subsequent to accidental injuries.We
      evaluate efficacy and safety of Omega-3 PUFA for the secondary prevention of Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) and related psychiatric illness in patients with accidental injury
