      Department of Pathology. ALK positive status will be detected by Ventana immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. and Roche Diagnostics International, Inc). When ALK
      positive patients are detected, crizotinib will be administrated by various solutions based
      on physician's desecration and patients' willingness.

      The secondary objectives include: 1.To obtain the epidemiologic data of ALK positive in
      unselected Chinese patients with NSCLC.2.To describe demographic, socioeconomic [such as age,
      gender, race/ethnicity, geographic location (including rural/urban area), pathologic
      parameters, education, family income, National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) or Provincial
      Reimbursement List (PRDL)], and clinical characteristics of NSCLC patients with ALK positive.

      The exploratory objective is to describe prognosis patterns associated with crizotinib
      treated patients when efficacy data are available non-interventionally.
