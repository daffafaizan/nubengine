    
      This study is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial of 20
      subjects with hepatopulmonary syndrome designed to assess the effect of letrozole 2.5 mg
      orally daily or placebo for 6 months on the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaPO2).

      Subjects at each site will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested
      qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent
      has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin letrozole with
      follow-up clinic visits and testing at 3 months, and 6 months.
