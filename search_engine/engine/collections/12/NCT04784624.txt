      digital behavior change program designed to help clients achieve healthy weight reduction,
      thereby improving cardiometabolic risk. The target population is overweight or obese
      individuals at risk for or living with health conditions such as pre-diabetes, diabetes,
      hypertension and high cholesterol. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the program
      following a mixed methods quasi-experimental approach using focus groups, questionnaires, and
      data collected over the 16 week duration of the program. Participants will be asked to fill
      in a set of questionnaires to measure physical activity, diet, sleep and stress at the start
      and end of the program. Other outcomes include changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI),
      blood pressure, clinical chemistry, and medication intake over the 16 week program. At the
      end of the program, adherence will be measured though attendance and platform usage and
      acceptability will be measured by an exit questionnaire and virtual focus groups. This study
      will investigate the impact of COVID-19 on participants lifestyles and access to lifestyle
      programs and support. The impact of COVID-19 will be assessed through a Covid-19
      questionnaire and virtual focus groups.
