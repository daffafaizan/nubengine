    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate if an early positive positron emission tomography (PET) scan after 2 courses
           of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and
           prednisone can be used to identify a group of patients having a poor prognosis.

      Secondary

        -  To compare modified PET/CT scan response criteria with revised standard response
           criteria.

        -  To evaluate, in a prospective manner, whether a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL)
           expression is a prognostic factor in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV, cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and
      vincristine IV on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 14 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rituximab IV
      alone is continued for an additional 2 courses after completion of the initial 6 courses.

      Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scan prior to and after completion of
      study therapy. Patients also undergo PET scan after course 2, and those with a positive PET
      result undergo an additional PET scan after course 4.

      Previously collected tumor samples are analyzed for a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL)
      expression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
