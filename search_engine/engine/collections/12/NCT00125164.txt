      term that has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular defects in GH action. In
      this protocol, primary IGFD is defined as short stature (height standard deviation
      score[SDS]<-2 below the mean for age and gender), low serum IGF-1 (IGF-1 SDS <-2 below the
      mean for age and gender), and levels of growth hormone (GH) that are normal (â‰¥7ng/mL) after a
      GH stimulation test. Primary IGFD is believed to result from a lower than normal ability to
      produce IGF-1 when exposed to normal levels of GH, i.e., a type of GH insensitivity or GH
      resistance.

      This trial is one year, randomized, open label, observation-controlled, parallel-dose
      comparison efficacy and safety study conducted in approximately 40 centers across the United
      States.
