      reported to the treatment in Consulting Room of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunctions at the
      Jagiellonian University in Cracow, between 2014-2016, due to the pain and clicking of
      temporomandibular joints with comorbid hypertension of masticatory muscles. Subjects were
      examined according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders protocol and
      after inclusion with painful disc displacement with reduction and masticatory muscle
      contracture assigned randomly to the study or control group (56 patients in each). In the
      study group was used the anterior repositioning splint on the lower arch for 20 hour usage
      per 4 months. In the control group a non-invasive therapy was applied using biostimulation
      laser in the form of 12 session, performed every second day, on the area of the
      temporomandibular joints with opened mouth and performing muscles self-exercises with a
      dominant protrusive position of the mandible. Pain intensity was evaluated using verbal
      numerical rating scale (VNRS) immediately before the treatment and then after 4 and 16 weeks.
      The obtained data were analyzed using U Mann-Whitney test (p â‰¤ 0,005).
