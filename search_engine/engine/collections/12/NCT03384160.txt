      third molar surgeries semi-included and / or included. I will select 16 patients who require
      surgical treatment for extraction of third molars, aged between 16 and 40 years at the SÃ£o
      Paulo State University. These will participate simultaneously in the two groups: Group 1
      mepivacaine (MEP) and Group 2 articaine (ART), and the division will be performed by
      randomization, so that each patient will have each side (right or left) allocated in
      different groups. The primary evaluation variable will be to compare the pain index in the
      immediate postoperative period, using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and will also analyze
      Hemodynamic Parameters, such as Patient and Operator satisfaction. The results will be
      submitted to qualitative and quantitative statistical analysis. The descriptive data will be
      compared using the statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test with a
      significance level of 5%.
