    
      Twenty patients (40 eyes) diagnosed with cataracts and cataract surgery indication will be
      selected to participate in this study. The surgery will be performed by the same surgeon with
      2 week interval between surgery the first and second eye. After approval of the research
      project by the Research Ethics Committee all patients should understand and sign the Informed
      Consent and Informed (IC) before surgery.

      All patients will be operated by conventional phacoemulsification with implantation of
      intraocular lens provided by the manufacturer.

      Patients will have five study visits, including the preoperative visit, operative visit four
      postoperative visits.

      All patients will be submitted to the following routine assessments preoperatively and
      demographic patient information will be recorded and a detailed medical history will be
      obtained.

        -  VFQ-25 Questionnaire

        -  Identification of the dominant eye;

        -  Visual acuity

        -  Refraction

        -  Slit lamp examination

        -  Tonometry

        -  Self-keratometry;

        -  Corneal topography;

        -  Microscopy speculate

        -  Fundus examination.

      In addition, all routine preoperative measures will be performed. lens power calculations
      should be performed on both eyes to ensure qualification (lens power within the diopter range
      (D) available) and prepare for surgery (getting the lens). The emmetropia (Â± 0.5 D) should be
      the target of patients.
