      self-disclosure to increase reporting of EM at point-of-care in the Emergency Department (ED)
      setting. Prior to conducting a feasibility study, focus groups will be conducted to inform
      the process and to develop a tool to evaluate the use of VOICES.

      busy ED.

      Exploratory Aim: To perform a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of VOICES as a screening
      tool in correctly classifying EM cases that were referred to Adult Protective Services (APS).
