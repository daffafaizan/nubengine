      publications, home hospital care delivered cost-effective, high-quality, excellent experience
      care with similar quality and safety as traditional hospital care. Most home hospital models
      require a licensed independent practitioner to see their patients physically in their home.

      To further improve the efficiency and scalability of home hospital care, the investigators
      propose to test remote care, where the physician would provide care via a video interaction,
      instead of in-home/in-person care. The investigators propose a non-inferiority evaluation of
      this intervention.
