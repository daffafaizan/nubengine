      least one year (n=20) and their matched controls for age, sex, tobacco, and saliva secretion
      (n=20). Their oral sensory abilities of participants will be assessed including taste
      (electrogustometric thresholds, chemical taste identification ability) and trigeminal
      quantitative sensory testing. Food preferences and selectivity (Maitre et al., 2014) and
      taste appetence (Deglaire et al., 2012) will also be assessed.
