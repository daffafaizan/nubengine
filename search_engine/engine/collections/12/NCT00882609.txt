    
      The trial will accrue four hundred-eighty eight (488) evaluable patients with breast cancer,
      prostate cancer or lung cancer (approximately 163 of each cancer type) referred for routine
      bone scanning by their respective physicians. The specific stages of cancer required for
      eligibility are described in the eligibility criteria.

      Approximately eleven to fifteen qualified clinical centers will participate in the trial,
      with target enrollment for each site set at roughly 40-50 patients per site.

      The images of the patients will be transmitted to ACR Image Metrix, an imaging contract
      research organization (iCRO), for quality assurance and archival. iCRO will conduct blinded
      core lab interpretations by 3 radiologists who have not been involved in the design of the
      trial nor the clinical image interpretation. The data from the core lab readings will be
      compared with the deliberations of a multidisciplinary panel of oncology experts who will be
      blinded to the initial scan results and will determine the standard of evidence (truth) for
      each patient. The analysis will be based on this comparison.
