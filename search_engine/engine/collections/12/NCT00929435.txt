      residents will be monitored every month with nasal swabs.We would like to elucidate factors
      responsible for MRSA colonization in healthcare workers.We would like to see if health care
      workers who are colonized spontaneously cleared MRSA and if there was any factors involved.

      Nasal swabs will be plated on the spot by trained individuals and the plates then incubated
      for 48 hours. Plates will be read by microbiologist after incubation.
