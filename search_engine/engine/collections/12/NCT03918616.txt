      psycho-physical abilities using specific test such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),
      Cognitive Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale,
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Blood samples were collected from an
      antecubital vein to assess serum and plasma aliquots for blood routine analysis and RNA and
      protein extraction from circulating lymphomonocytes.

      To explore a putative epigenetic regulation of such complex scenario some circulating miRNAs
      likely involved in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and neuro-inflammation will be
      measured.

      Expression and functional activity of P2X7R-inflammasome complex will be measured by PCR and
      WB. Acute phase cytokines inflammasome-related levels will be determined by ELISA.
      Biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, lipid profile, serum creatinine, uric acid) will be
      measured by standard methods in the biochemistry laboratory of the University Hospital in
      Pisa. The same determinations will be repeated after one year from the first visit.
