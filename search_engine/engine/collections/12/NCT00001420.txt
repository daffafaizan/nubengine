      Center. Studies will include characterization of the clinical and laboratory features of the
      disease, research studies of the natural history and pathogenesis, genetic studies, and
      determination of the patient's eligibility to enter experimental therapeutic protocols.
      Patients may be asked to contribute blood, skin or synovial membrane samples for immunologic
      and genetic research studies.
