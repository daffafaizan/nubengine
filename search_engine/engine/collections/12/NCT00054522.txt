        -  Determine whether calcitriol and dexamethasone can slow the rise in prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) levels in patients with early, recurrent prostate cancer after prior
           radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the utility of serum PSA in monitoring the therapeutic effect of calcitriol in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (radical prostatectomy vs
      radiotherapy).

      Patients receive oral calcitriol once daily on days 1-3 alone on week 1. Beginning on week 3,
      patients receive calcitriol as in week 1 and oral dexamethasone on days 0-4. Courses repeat
      every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients (28 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
