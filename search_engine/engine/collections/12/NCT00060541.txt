    
      Objective: This protocol is designed to allow evaluation of participants neurosurgical
      disorders that receive care within the Surgical Neurology Branch. The participants will
      receive standard-of-clinical-care evaluation and treatment. The clinical data and samples
      generated during standard of care treatment will be collected as a part of this study.

      Study Population: Participants 4 years of age and older with neurosurgical-related conditions
      seeking care from, or referred to the Surgical Neurology Branch for evaluation are eligible
      for this protocol.

      Study Design: This is an observational study. Participants will receive standard-of-
      clinical-care evaluation and treatment for their neurosurgical condition. Clinical evaluation
      may include laboratory and radiological studies designed to aid in diagnosis or differential
      diagnosis of the participant s condition or to facilitate treatment. The evaluations may take
      place in the outpatient clinic areas or in the inpatient units. Some participants will
      receive standard-of-care medical or surgical treatment for their disorder. Clinical data,
      tissue samples or body fluids obtained during standard of care treatment, may be used for
      research. Additional genetic testing may be performed on subjects and their blood relatives
      if a genetic mechanism underlying the neurological disorder is suspected.

      Outcome Measures: No additional research outcome measures will be tracked in this study, as
      this study is collecting data for potential future use. All outcomes will be those of
      standard clinical evaluation and treatment. A clinical and research database will be kept of
      patient s diagnosis, progression, and treatment. Clinical database information may be
      reported or be used in other studies.
