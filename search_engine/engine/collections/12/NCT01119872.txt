      Pressure (PEEP) avoids atelectrauma, improves gas exchange and induces alveolar
      recruitment.Although it has side effects as inducing alveolar overdistension and circulatory
      depression.

      There are several methods to determine the level of PEEP to be applied. We conducted a study
      to test the hypothesis that an individualized level of PEEP, set et the best compliance, when
      compared with a fixed level according to the fraction of inspired oxygen applied, improves
      oxygenation and reduces mortality rate at 28 days.
