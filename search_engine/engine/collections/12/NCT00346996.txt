      incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetic patients prone to
      hypoglycaemia.Secondary endpoints are effect on incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic
      documented hypoglycaemia.

      Study Design: An open, randomised, controlled, cross-over multi-centre study. Each treatment
      period lasts for one year. Patients will be randomised to treatment with basal bolus therapy
      with insulin detemir / aspart and insulatard / actrapid in random order. Endpoints will be
      assessed during the last 9 months of each treatment arm.

      Patient population: 250 type 1 diabetic patients with a history of two or more episodes of
      severe hypoglycaemia during the preceding year.

      Interventions: Basal bolus therapy with insulin detemir / aspart and insulatard / human
      actrapid in random order. Each treatment period lasts 12 months.

      Methods: Patients will record all events of severe hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic and
      asymptomatic hypoglycaemia in a diary and report all events of severe hypoglycaemia by
      telephone within 24 hours. All patients will be instructed to do and record home blood
      glucose monitoring (SMBG) i.e. 7 point profiles twice per week and nocturnal measurements
      once every month.

      Outcomes: Severe hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia
      Efficacy: Number of reported episodes of severe, documented symptomatic and asymptomatic
      hypoglycaemia during the last 9 months of treatment - during daytime and night time.

      Safety: Adverse reactions
