      are packaged in self-evaluation form. The evaluation of pulmonary function at rest
      (spirometry, body plethysmography and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide) will be
      rescued from patient charts. When carried out for over six months, will be repeated by the
      researchers. Patients will conduct incremental CPET of 5-10W / min limited by symptoms (FEV1
      <1L - 5W or FEV1> 1L - 10W) (Visit 1). After a period of 2-7 days the CPET will be performed
      submaximal with 75% of the peak load reached in the incremental CPET (visits 2 and 3). The
      application of EPAP (10cmH2O) via face mask (Vital RHDSON SignsÂ®, New Jersey, USA) will be
      randomized with the help of opaque envelopes to be given in one visit. During the visit
      without EPAP will be maintained using the facial mask applied without resistance. IC serial
      measurements will be carried out before, during and immediately after the exercise.
      Participants will be instructed to maintain the use of long-acting bronchodilator as
      prescribed by the medical assistant usually before the methodological stages of the study.
