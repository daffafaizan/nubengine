      neonatal exposure. Management consists of a strict and restrictive hypoproteic diet and the
      intake of amino acid substitutes and dietary supplements free of phenylalanine. If the
      benefits of treatment are indisputable in children in terms of cognitive prognosis, this
      benefit is discussed once brain development is complete, especially as many adult patients
      are no longer treated. However, cognitive, neurological and reversible white matter disorders
      undergoing treatment are increasingly reported in adult phenylketonurics. As a result, recent
      European recommendations advocate the maintenance of life-long treatment. One of the major
      difficulties, which is the source of many treatment failures, is the inappetence of the amino
      acid supplements required during a strict hypoproteic diet. New formulations,
      Glycomacropeptides (GMP), have recently appeared and are considered more palatable than
      conventional mixtures.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Demonstrate a better metabolic balance under GMP treatment than a conventional amino acid
      mixture in adult phenylketonuric patients when resuming treatment.
