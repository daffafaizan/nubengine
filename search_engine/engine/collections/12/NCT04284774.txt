      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with tipifarnib with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating
      genetic alterations in HRAS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with tipifarnib
      with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that
      harbor activating genetic alterations in HRAS.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of tipifarnib in children and adolescents
      with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to tipifarnib and specifically,
      whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or variant allele frequency will
      demonstrate differential response to tipifarnib treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) or via nasogastric or gastric tube twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles (2 years) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically
      thereafter.
