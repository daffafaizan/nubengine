      this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy
      of HER2-CAR-T cell infusion for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.The CAR consists of a
      HER-2 targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta
      and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus
      vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning
      treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse
      reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
