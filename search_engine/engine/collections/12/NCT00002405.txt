      in the body. Despite these data, however, the drug has yet to receive regulatory approval. At
      the same time, there is an urgent need to grant pre-approval access to specific groups of
      patients eager to benefit from the anti-HIV potential inherent in APV. This study examines
      the relative effects APV has in patients with prior treatment failure or intolerance to
      previous protease inhibitor therapy.

      Patients are seen in the clinic at pre-entry, baseline (Day 1), and every 4 weeks thereafter.
      Data on current antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 associated conditions and adverse events are
      collected at every scheduled visit. Laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry,
      plasma HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ cell count) are collected and assessed at pre-entry and
      Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. Optimal therapeutic effectiveness dictates the combined use of 2 or
      more antiretroviral agents in patients failing current antiretroviral therapy. APV,
      therefore, must be initiated as a component of a treatment regimen that also includes at
      least one other antiretroviral drug that the patient has not previously received.
