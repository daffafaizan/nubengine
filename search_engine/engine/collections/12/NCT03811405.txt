      well selected essential tremor (ET) patients. However, as many as 1/5 of patients may
      initially improve, but then steadily worsen following the operation. The investigators
      developed a technique to study a variety of alternative stimulation methods without the use
      of an invasive repeat surgical intervention.

      The electrophysiological effects of non-conventional DBS differ from traditional DBS, however
      the physiological differences in the setting of human tremor remain largely unknown. This
      study plans to explore gaps in knowledge of neuromodulation and will collect and contribute
      essential information to the underlying mechanism of action of DBS. The hypothesis of this
      project centers around active biphasic stimulation providing a wider therapeutic window and a
      lower adverse event profile as compared to conventional DBS.
