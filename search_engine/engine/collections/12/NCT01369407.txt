      patients with chronic, advanced, systolic heart failure that will provide a greater
      understanding of their clinical trajectory (rates of hospitalizations, transplantation, MCSD
      use and death), and of how baseline clinical risk measures are related to prognosis. Within
      the broader goal of 1) improving prognostic assessment in chronic, ambulatory, advanced
      systolic heart failure, additional targeted goals are to 2) better inform the selection of
      appropriate candidates for a future study of a strategy of early LVAD therapy vs. optimal
      medical management in this population, and 3) determine the feasibility of identifying
      candidates for such a trial. Therefore, the target population will have known high-risk
      features for increased mortality and hospitalization (e.g., frequent hospitalization, reduced
      exercise capacity, elevated BNP or N-terminal proBNP, increased Seattle Heart Failure Model
      risk score, reduced Heart Failure Survival Score).

      The REVIVE-IT Registry (i.e., REVIVAL) is a prospective cohort study to be conducted in up to
      twenty five (25) participating Clinical Sites in the USA. The study will continue until up to
      400 eligible heart failure heart failure subjects have been enrolled (estimated length of
      accrual is 12 months).
