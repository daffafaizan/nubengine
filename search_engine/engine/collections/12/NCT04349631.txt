      to Provide Immune Support Against Coronavirus Disease. 75 patients will be enrolled. All
      patients have previously banked their own mesenchymal stem cells at Hope Biosciences.
      Eligible participants are either over 50 years of age, have preexisting conditions, or are at
      high exposure risk of contracting COVID-19. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide
      immune support against COVID-19, measured by the percentage of participants in each category
      of a 7-point ordinal scale and the presence or absence of adverse events and serious adverse
      events related to the study drug. In addition, participants will be monitored for overall
      clinical status by standard clinical laboratories and inflammatory markers. Participants will
      complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires.
