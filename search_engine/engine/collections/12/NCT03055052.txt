      development is interrupted. There is less time to accrue adequate nutrient stores and foetal
      tissue. The nutritional goal for the preterm infant is to have satisfactory functional
      development and catch up on growth to match the rate of a full term infant. To achieve this,
      it is recommended for the infant to have adequate protein intake and suitable fat blend.
