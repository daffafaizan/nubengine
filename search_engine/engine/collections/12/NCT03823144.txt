    
      Primary objective(s): To determine the feasibility and clinical utility of performing HIVM in
      patients with solid tumors during standard course of treatment (surgical resection).

      Secondary objective(s):

        1. Compare the microscopic observation of the tumor-associated vessels with normal tissue
           (e.g. peritoneal surface) in each individual subject.

        2. Correlate the microscopic observations of the tumor-associated vessels with pathologic
           grade of tumor.

        3. To correlate the microscopic observation of the microvasculature with tumor-specific and
           overall survival.
