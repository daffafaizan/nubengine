    
      The overall goal of this project is to test an interactive, multi-media decision aid in the
      form of an electronic clinical decision dashboard designed to improve the quality of clinical
      decision making for initial treatment of patients with newly diagnosed, low or intermediate
      risk prostate cancer.

      Specifically, we propose to conduct a clinical trial to compare the effects of a prostate
      decision dashboard versus usual care on:

        1. patient knowledge regarding the treatment options available for low or intermediate risk
           prostate cancer,

        2. measures of the decision making process including decisional conflict and the extent to
           which decisions were made via a shared decision making process,

        3. the treatments selected, and

        4. 3-6 and 9-12 month outcome assessments of clinical status, decision regret,
           cancer-related quality of life including worry, functional status, and treatment side
           effects.
