      Internal Medicine Wards C of Assaf Harofe Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel:

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Adult (<18 years) Male and female T1 & T2DM patients who can sign an informed consent.

        -  Insulin treatment (at least one injection a day) prior to hospitalization for at least
           half a year.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Diabetic ketoacidosis.

        -  Hyperosmolar state due to hyperglycemia.

        -  Pregnancy

        -  Fertile women who do not use oral contraception or IUD

      Concurrent medications:

      Â· The hospital staff will determine the initiation or continuation of oral and intravenous
      medications as indicated by the patient's medical status.

      Admission Blood tests:

        -  Routine: CBC, Creatinine, Urea, Na, K, GOT, GPT, Alp, Albumin, Glu

        -  HbA1C & Fructosamine.

      Initiation and Titration of Insulin dosage:

        -  Glargine insulin will be initiated as a function of the first fasting glucose level and
           the patients body weight (0.3 - 0.8 U/kg). Up- or down titration will occur every
           morning by 10 - 20% according to capillary am fasting glucose (goal 130 mg%). The dosage
           of premeal insulin analogues will be based according to a sliding scale and calculated
           as a percentage of the amount of am glargine.

        -  Capillary blood glucose levels were measured seven times a day: before and two hours
           after breakfast, lunch and dinner and at bedtime. Additional measurements were performed
           according to clinical needs such as suspected hypoglycemia or unexplained deterioration
           of clinical condition
