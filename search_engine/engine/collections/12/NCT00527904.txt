      arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis or other medical conditions expected to require daily
      NSAID therapy for at least 12 months in patients at risk for developing NSAID-associated
      gastric ulcers. This study is designed to provide long-term safety data for PN400 in order to
      gain regulatory approval to make PN400 available for clinical use in this subject population.
