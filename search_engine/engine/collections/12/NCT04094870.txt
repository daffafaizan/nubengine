      psychotherapy or both. Little data exist on the best method for treating perinatal depression
      (PND) in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is a mixed method study including a pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of antidepressant medication (ADM) versus interpersonal psychotherapy
      (IPT) and qualitative semi-structured interviews (SSIs). The study will enroll 100 pregnant
      HIV infected women over the age of 18 seeking postnatal care and continuing antiretroviral
      therapy in pregnancy. An additional 20 women enrolled in the RCT will be invited to
      participate in SSIs. Each participant will be followed for 24 weeks.
