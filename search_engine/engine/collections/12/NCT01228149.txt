      Long-term preoperative treatment with local antiglaucoma agents containing preservatives has
      an increased risk of post-operative scarring of the filtration bleb. Therefore many surgeons
      prepare their patients for planned trabeculectomy by discontinuing local antiglaucoma drugs,
      controlling IOP with oral acetazolamide, and treating the eye with local steroids.

      Preservative-free COSOPT-S® eye drops b.i.d now provide a possibility to reduce IOP
      preoperatively with the aim of avoiding postoperative excessive scarring and the known
      adverse effects of oral acetazolamide while achieving comparable IOP reduction and long-term
      outcomes.

      This study will investigate comparability (non-inferiority) of medical benefits of two
      different IOP lowering pharmaceutical interventions prior to trabeculectomy comparing
      COSOPT-S® bid to oral acetazolamide plus dexamethasone.
