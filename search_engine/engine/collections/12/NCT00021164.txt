        -  Determine whether an immunologic response can be obtained in HLA*0201-expressing
           patients with metastatic cancer treated with telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine
           emulsified in Montanide ISA-51.

        -  Determine which vaccine strategy (frequency, schedule, and dosing) is best for future
           studies in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine whether prior immunization with telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine results in
           increased clinical response to interleukin-2 in patients with melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease (metastatic
      cutaneous melanoma vs other tumor types). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide
           ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and 7-10. Patients also undergo
           leukapheresis over 3 hours at baseline and after each course of treatment.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide
           ISA-51 SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients also undergo leukapheresis over 3
           hours at baseline, after the vaccine on week 4, and after each course of treatment.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide
           ISA-51 SC on days 1-4 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients undergo leukapheresis as in arm
           II.

      Treatment in all arms repeats every 13 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 1
      additional course of treatment after achieving CR.

      Eligible melanoma patients with progressive disease on vaccine alone on any of the 3 arms may
      receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) combined with vaccine as in arm II. Beginning the day after each
      immunization, IL-2 is administered IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours over 4 days on weeks 1,
      4, 7, and 10 for a maximum of 12 doses. Patients continuing to experience disease progression
      on combined vaccine and IL-2 therapy go off study after 2 courses of combined therapy.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90-162 patients (30-54 per treatment arm; 45-81 per stratum)
      will be accrued for this study within less than 2 years.
