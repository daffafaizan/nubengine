      To examine the effectiveness of the Halliwick concept intervention in water approach for
      people with motor deficiency and, more specifically, for children with diagnosed cerebral
      palsy.

      In a second phase, to compare the contribution of water intervention to the child's motor
      development against just Bobath physiotherapeutic intervention, in terms of the milestones of
      gross motor skills of the children over time.

      The aim of the research is to determine the contribution of the Halliwick Concept-
      Hydrotherapeutic Intervention approach in the psychomotor development in children with
      cerebral palsy and to explore its contribution to a comprehensive therapeutic approach for
      these children. It is a fact that, in recent years, parallel therapeutic approaches have
      gained ground, which, in combination with the physiotherapeutic treatment, contributes to the
      enhancement of therapeutic effects in early and follow-up intervention for children with
      cerebral palsy.

      The study resulted from the fact that there is not such a large-scale study in Greece. Also,
      there are few published studies in the world, trying to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of
      the Halliwick Concept as an hydro-therapeutic approach.
