      lesions. The proposed study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PROMUS Element for
      the treatment of de novo atherosclerotic lesions in native coronary arteries. The study
      design is consistent with the draft guidance for industry titled, "Coronary Drug-Eluting
      Stents - Nonclinical and Clinical Studies" (March 2008).

      During the trial, thienopyridines must be administered according to the 2007 American College
      of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography
      and Interventions (SCAI) guidelines, which recommended that clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or
      ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) be prescribed after stent implantation for at least 6 months
      in all patients, and for at least 12 months in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding.
      For sites in the United States, the use of prasugrel is not allowed as part of the PLATINUM
      Clinical Trial. For sites in other countries, prasugrel may be prescribed according to its
      approved dosing in countries in which it is available. For patients taking aspirin daily a
      loading dose is recommended; for patients who have not been taking aspirin daily, aspirin
      must be administered as a loading dose. Patients continue to take aspirin indefinitely to
      reduce the risk of thrombosis.

      This PLATINUM Pharmacokinetics (PK) study is a sub-trial associated with the PLATINUM
      Workhorse Randomized Controlled Trial, which is registered under NCT00823212. PLATINUM PK was
      designed to evaluate the elution of everolimus from the PROMUS Element everolimus-eluting
      stent.
