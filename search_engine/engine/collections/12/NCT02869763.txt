      needs to consider the numerous reports showing the effect of ethanol ingestion on the steroid
      profile. A steroid profile would only be useful for longitudinal monitoring and statistical
      evaluation if it has not been altered by any uncontrolled circumstance, very particularly
      alcohol consumption.

      There is an urgent need to study the perpetuation that alcohol ingestion causes to the
      individual steroid profile and if possible establish cut-off values for markers of ethanol
      ingestion granting that the steroid profile determined has not been affected by such
      ingestion.

      Subjects will be genotyped for genetic deletion polymorphism in the uridine
      diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B17 gene (UGT2B17) related to testosterone
      glucuronidation regulation.

      The objective of the clinical trial is to study the intra-individual variation of steroid
      profile parameters as a result of the ingestion of different doses of ethanol in Caucasian
      women (complementing previous studies performed in men).
