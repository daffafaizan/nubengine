           prostatectomy among prostate cancer patients.

        -  The prevalence of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence was reported at 87%.

        -  The pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) using Kegel exercise was first methods to prevent
           PPI after prostatectomy.

        -  However, there was no standardized protocol of the PFMT and it was necessary of
           biofeedback to PFMT.

        -  Therefore, we hypothesis the efficacy of personalized device of PFMT with biofeedback
           among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy

        -  In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of postoperative pelvic floor muscle training
           using personalized extracorporeal biofeedback device among patients with
           post-prostatectomy incontinence.
