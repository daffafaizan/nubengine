    
      This study is a 56-week, open-label, one-arm extension study in participants who have
      completed the CRTH258A2303 study (TALON). Participants who consent and meet all the inclusion
      and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into this extension study and receive
      brolucizumab 6 mg in a TtC regimen, irrespective of the treatment received in the core study.

      It is estimated that 622 participants from the core study will enter the extension study (10%
      dropout rate expected). The maximum study duration for one participant is 56 weeks, including
      post-treatment follow-up.

      There will be two periods in this study:

        -  Treat-to-Control treatment period: from Baseline (Day 1) to Week 52

        -  Post-treatment follow-up period: from Week 52 to Week 56.

      All participants will be treated with brolucizumab regardless of their treatment in the TALON
      study (brolucizumab or aflibercept).

      Treatment intervals can then be extended by 4 weeks at a time based on the investigator's
      judgment of visual and/or anatomic outcomes. The treatment intervals should be by 4 weeks at
      a time if disease activity recurs.
