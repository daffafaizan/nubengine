    
      To conduct a prospective, observational study to evaluate the non-interventional feasibility
      of using heart sounds measurements recorded by the LifeVest® Wearable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator (WCD) for monitoring clinical evidence of heart failure decompensation.

      Participants will be adult (age ≥ 18 years) heart failure patients with an ejection fraction
      (EF) ≤ 35% and eligible to wear the WCD for at least 3 months.

      An FDA-approved WCD will be prescribed for at least 3 months of use after hospital discharge.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational study.

      The study will enroll a total of 300 subjects, anticipating that at least 250 subjects will
      complete the study. A maximum of 50 sites will enroll patients into the study.
