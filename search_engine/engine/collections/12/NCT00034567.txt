      that are specifically designed for use in AD primary prevention trials. The new or improved
      measures that have been developed will then be evaluated in 650 nondemented subjects enrolled
      in a simulated Alzheimer's disease prevention trial. Once enrolled, subjects will be followed
      for four years with annual clinical evaluations and interim six-month phone calls.
