      HIV-infected males followed regularly in the ID Primary Care Clinic at the VA Long Beach
      Healthcare System. All consenting patients will be given the HPV vaccine (Gardasil) in three
      intramuscular injections. Baseline antibody titers to HPV strains 16 and 18 will be obtained
      at day 0 and repeat levels will be obtained approximately 8 weeks after the completion of the
      vaccination series to determine whether patients without antibodies at baseline have now
      produced antibodies, or to determine the change in antibody levels in those patients who have
      evidence of antibodies prior to the first injection of the vaccine. Patients will undergo
      routine anal PAP smear with HPV DNA testing at baseline and another PAP smear/HPV test
      approximately 8 weeks after completion of the series. Patients will report any side effects
      of the vaccine to the PI. Patients will have blood work to monitor HIV-1 viral load and CD4
      lymphocytes counts at various points during the study.
