      transplantation (HSCT). Gut is the most vulnerable target organ of acute GVHD. Patients who
      have a gastrointestinal acute GVHD received a first-line standard treatment of
      corticosteroids. For patients who do not respond or progress after an initial response have a
      high mortality. Therefore, the investigation of effective second line therapy for these
      patients are in need. The study evaluates safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of refractory GVHD of the gut. FMT might be a
      beneficial treatment in this clinical situation with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic
      options.
