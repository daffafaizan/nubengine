      during periods of increased susceptibility, are crucial for neurodevelopment. Inadequate
      levels of iodine in the diet may lead to a strong and decisive cognitive impairment which
      poses a major public health challenge. The World Health Organization prioritized the intake
      of iodine and recommends the universal enrichment of salt with iodine, so it may reach the
      general population. In 2013 the Portuguese Department of Education (DGE) issued, as a result
      of the collaboration with the Portuguese Department of Health (DGS) under the National
      Program to Promote Healthy Eating a directive introducing the use of iodized salt in school
      canteens. To ensure the effectiveness and the impact of these policies in Portugal, this
      project aims to (1) evaluate urinary iodine status in school children (6-12 y), (2) monitor
      the use of iodized salt in schools, (3) explore potential associations between these
      parameters. The results of this project will be used to educate food service professionals
      regarding the use of iodized salt and inform the community about the impact of iodine in
      health, based on the Norwegian model.

      In this study a total of 4800 school aged children will be recruited from approximately 160
      schools in the north of Portugal. Parents will be asked to complete the CBCL 6-18, Child
      Behaviour Checklist and a comprehensive questionnaire which will collect data regarding the
      child lifestyle and diet. A urine sample will be collected from each participant in school
      and the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices will be applied to evaluate children cognitive
      performance. Anthropometry measurements will be also collected.
