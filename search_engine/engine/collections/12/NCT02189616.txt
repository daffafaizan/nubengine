      participants have their case records which contain their baseline data and receive the same
      standard asthma education(including basic knowledge about asthma, how to use their medicine,
      what to do when an asthma attack happens and when to come back for their disease review and
      so on). Each patient is given a paper asthma diary and a peak expiratory flow(PEF) measurer
      for free. In addition, they are told what intervention they will receive and revised
      face-to-face one month after the beginning of intervention. After the 3-month study period,
      when they return to the hospitals, they will return the asthma diaries, be asked to fill in
      the questionnaires and take pulmonary function tests.
