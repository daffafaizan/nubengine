      Otitis media with effusion (OME, "glue ear") is very common in children and characterized by
      fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Fluid in the middle
      ear causes conducting hearing loss. OME has a large impact on health care costs and recurrent
      or persistent OME can effect the proper development of children. Frequently OME resolves
      itself, therefore guidelines strongly recommend watchful waiting for 3 months after which
      treatment options are tympanostomy tubes and/or adenoidectomy. However OME often reoccurs
      after these procedures. Furthermore there are various short and longterm side-effects of
      tympanostomy tubes.In Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET) a ballon catheter is used to dilate
      the cartilage part of the eustachian tube and is inserted through the nose to reach the
      opening of the tube, located in the nasopharynx. BET has recently been applied in children
      for therapy-resistant recurrent OME and inflammatory ear diseases with promising results.
      Risk and complications rates are very low.

      Methods:

      Goal of this study will be the evaluation of Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET) in children
      as a primary treatment of OME. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 years with OME and
      tympanometry type B on both ears, will prospectively be recruited and assigned for
      adenoidectomy and myringotomy. Parents then will be asked for participation in this trial and
      fully informed about purpose, technique and possible side effects. If consent is given,
      adenoidectomy, in case of large adenoids, and myringotomy will be performed on both sides. If
      necessary (very thick fluid) tympanostomy tubes are placed. One Eustachian tube of each
      patient is randomly assigned for BET.
