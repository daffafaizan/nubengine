      chemotherapy before surgery to try to shrink the tumor before it is removed. This study will
      evaluate whether giving azacitidine before each cycle of chemotherapy to increase the
      shrinkage of the tumor prior to surgery is safe.

      Azacitidine is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Azacitidine is not approved by the FDA for use in this study
      and is therefore considered investigational. Because azacitidine has not been given before in
      combination with epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine, we will also evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of azacitidine and find out what dose of azacitidine is safe to give with
      this chemotherapy.
