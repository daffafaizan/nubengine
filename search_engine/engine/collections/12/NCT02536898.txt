      regarding reduced risk of recurrent fracture and fracture related mortality are scarce. The
      investigators therefore aim to assess the risk of subsequent fractures and mortality after a
      clinical fracture in patients who present to hospitals with a standardized intervention
      program. Seven Norwegian hospitals will be Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized to a standardized
      intervention program with startup date between May 2015 and Jan 2016. The intervention will
      last throughout 2018 with follow-up throughout 2019. Outcomes before and after the
      intervention will be compared and each hospital will act as its own control. The effect of
      the intervention will be measured by using national patient registries on fractures and
      mortality.
