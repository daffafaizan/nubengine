      for adverse events using a safety monitoring uniform report form. We will also use cardiac
      31-Phosphorus-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the
      Phosphocreatine(PCr)/Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- Î³ ratio before and after treatment with
      MIB-626. In addition, if time permits we will use proton (1H)-MRS to measure skeletal muscle
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) before and after treatment.
