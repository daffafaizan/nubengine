      who underwent coronary angiography at the same time and was definitely diagnosed as coronary
      heart disease but not diabetes. The study group was coronary heart disease complicated with
      diabetes, which was divided into group A (≤5 years), group B (5-10 years) and group C (10-20
      years) according to the course of diabetes. (1) Review the electronic medical records and
      record the general information of the selected patients: age, sex, history of hypertension,
      history of myocardial infarction, family history of coronary heart disease, smoking history,
      chronic kidney disease; ② laboratory findings: HbA1C (glycosylated hemoglobin), SBP (systolic
      blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride,
      BMI, creatinine and glomerular passing rate (EGFR); ③ Drug use: oral hypoglycemic agents,
      insulin, aspirin, statins, hypertension drugs, ACEI or ARB, β-blockers, CCB and diuretics.
      (ii) Taking coronary angiography as the gold standard, the grading index of severity of
      coronary heart disease was made, and the severity of coronary heart disease was evaluated by
      Gensini score.
