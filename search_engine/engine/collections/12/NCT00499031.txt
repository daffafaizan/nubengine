      I. To assess the activity of cetuximab for patients with persistent or recurrent carcinoma of
      the cervix.

      II. To determine the frequency of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      after initiating therapy or have objective tumor response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the distribution of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To determine the effect of cetuximab on the duration of objective response in persistent
      or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

      III. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of cetuximab as assessed by CTCAE v3.0 in
      this cohort of patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat once weekly in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed (with physical exams and histories)
      every three months for the first two years and then every six months for the next three
      years.
