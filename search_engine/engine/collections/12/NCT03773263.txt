      sequential oocyte IVM system with traditional oocyte IVM system for high OHSS risk PCOS
      patients (AMH>5.6ng/ml). The inclusion criteria will be infertile patients diagnosed by the
      Chinese PCOS criteria, aged below 35 years, and without other known factors interfere
      reproductive or metabolic functions. 300 PCOS patients will be included and randomized into
      either of two groups: group A will administrate sequential oocyte IVM system and group B will
      administrate traditional standard oocyte IVM system. The comparison will be made between
      groups, and both groups are conducted with the HMG administration and embryo vitrification
      freezing. The primary outcome of the study is live birth rate. The embryo development and
      pregnancy outcomes will be followed up and compared between groups.
