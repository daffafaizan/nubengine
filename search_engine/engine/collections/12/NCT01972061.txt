      somatic afferent nerves in the foot using skin surface electrodes. The foot stimulation is
      non-invasive, can be performed at home, and has no adverse effects. Foot neuromodulation
      therapy will likely be accepted by more patients and have the potential to make a broader
      impact on the improvement of OAB conditions.
