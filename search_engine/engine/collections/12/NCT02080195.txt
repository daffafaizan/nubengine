      predominantly affects young women, is more common in African-Americans than in whites, and
      results in poor quality of life. Lupus has no cure, and up to 90% of patients require
      corticosteroids for disease control. More than half of patients with lupus have permanent
      organ damage, much of which is either directly due to or increased by corticosteroids. To
      satisfactorily manage moderate-to-severe SLE, the investigators need effective treatments
      that will allow corticosteroid-sparing.

      High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT or peripheral blood progenitor
      transplantation (PBSCT) has been proposed as a novel approach to treat severe autoimmune
      diseases. Allogeneic BMT is not currently utilized for the routine treatment of SLE because
      of the significant morbidity (GVHD) and mortality associated with the procedure.

      The investigators have recently developed an approach to BMT using post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide that allows us to safely perform allogeneic BMT from matched, mismatched,
      unrelated or haploidentical donors. Transplant-related mortality, graft-failure and risk of
      GVHD have been very low with this approach. Furthermore, this approach allows us to greatly
      expand the donor pool since any patient shares exactly one HLA haplotype with each biological
      parent or child and half of siblings, an eligible haploidentical donor can be identified
      rapidly in nearly all cases.

      This trial will employ a fludarabine + cyclophosphamide conditioning along with
      posttransplantation cyclophosphamide on for patients with refractory SLE. The purpose of this
      trial is to improve the salvage rate for patients with refractory SLE through a reformatting
      of the immune system.
