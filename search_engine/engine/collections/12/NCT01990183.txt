      Neonatology. The eligibility of infants, i.e. children who meet the criteria for inclusion
      and exclusion, will be evaluated by the Neonatology team. Recruitment should take place after
      discharge from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) until the age stated by inclusion criteria
      and will begin with the signing of the participation agreement by the parents. During the
      recruitment extensive perinatal data will be collected from medical records. Each clinical
      centre will maintain these data in an internal database storing. Every child will be
      evaluated on the basis of a standard neurological examination supplemented by movement
      analysis on video recording using Prechtl's Method Qualitative Assessment of General
      Movements.

      The sample will be randomized in two groups in order to compare the effectiveness of the
      CareToy intervention program vs standard care on motor, cognitive and visual development. We
      designed the study as randomized clinical trial. The sample size was calculated on the basis
      of the primary outcome measure (Infant Motor Profile [IMP], see Outcome measures).

      Before the starting of the RCT we have planned a short pilot phase where few infants in order
      to assess the feasibility of the CareToy training and to tune and set-up the CareToy system
      and the rehabilitation packages. These cases will follow the same steps planned for the RCT.
