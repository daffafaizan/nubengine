        -  To identify and validate individual genes for diagnosis of three major translocations in
           acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  To correlate transcript expression data in the various translocations with age, sex,
           race, response to treatment, and survival and with other known mutations.

      OUTLINE: Blood and/or bone marrow samples previously procured from patients on CALGB-9665 are
      obtained from the CALGB Leukemia Tissue Bank from patients enrolled on CALGB AML treatment
      studies. Mononuclear cells are isolated from samples and mRNA is extracted. Gene expression
      profiles are analyzed via custom mRNA microarray and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR.
