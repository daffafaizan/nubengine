      abnormality. Therefore, most practitioners are confused to perform a caudal block.
      Ultrasonography is a safe and cost effective screening tool in pediatric patients. Ultrasound
      guided investigation of the anatomical features of sacral region may play a key role to
      eliminate suspicions. It is possible to detect spinal abnormalities and also measuring dural
      sac level, distance between dural sac and estimated needle insertion site or needle entry
      angle. In this study, we will examine whether there is a difference between normal children
      and children with dimple in the sacral region.
