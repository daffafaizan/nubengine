      administration (film-coated tablets) of two different dose levels of febuxostat: children
      (from 6 to less than 12 years of age) will receive two different dose levels respectively;
      adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years of age) will receive 80 and 120 mg/day
      respectively and adults (equal or major than 18 years of age) will receive 120 mg/day. The
      two dose levels for children and adolescents groups will be sequentially administered,
      whereas the groups that will receive the first dose levels will simultaneously start the
      treatment at the study beginning. The individual treatment duration will be of 7 to 9 days,
      according to chemotherapy duration, as per Investigator's judgement.
