    
      Introduction: Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer can cause severe mucositis (ulcers in the
      mouth) and pain. Photobiomodulation (Light therapy) will be used before and during
      radiotherapy to try to reduce the occurence and severity of mucositis in patients treated
      with radiotherapy for head and neck cancer

      Rationale: Previous studies in head and neck cancer patients have shown that
      photobiomodulation (light therapy) can prevent mucositis. There are currently no centers in
      Canada using this technique in routine practice, but this is recommended in International
      guidelines and widely used in Europe. The investigators therefore wish to implement this
      technique in Ottawa under the umbrella of a clinical trial to insure its safety and efficacy
      in a Canadian context.

      Purpose/Objectives: Primary Objective Primary Objective

      â€¢ To determine the cumulative incidence of acute mucositis as defined by CTCAE version 2.0
      for radiation induced mucositis (Appendix 1) during radiotherapy and for 1month following
      radiotherapy

      Secondary Objectives

      To determine the following during radiotherapy and for 24 months post-treatment

        -  Rate of occurrence of acute radiation dermatitis

        -  Pain scores

        -  Opioid use

        -  ESAS scores during and after RT

        -  FACT-HN questionnaire scores

        -  Late subcutaneous neck fibrosis

        -  Late mucosal and skin telangiectasia

      Study design/methodology:

      This is single arm prospective cohort study of a single intervention (photobiomodulation) in
      patients with head and neck cancer for the prevention of oral mucositis.

      Outcomes will be the following:

        -  Rates of acute and late mucositis according to CTCAE version 2.0

        -  Rates of acute and late dermatitis and fibrosis according to CTCAE version 5.0

        -  Rates of late teleangiectasia

        -  Pain scores as per Edmonton Symptom assessment scale (ESAS) and modified brief pain
           inventory

        -  Rates of opioid use

        -  FACT-HN scores

        -  EQ5D scores

      Anticipated public/scientific benefit:

      This study aims to study the use of Photobiomodulation treatments for prevention of oral
      mucositis. This is recommended in international guidelines but not used in routine practice
      in Canada. The benefit of this study is to allow implemetation of this technique in the
      Canadian context in a controlled and evaluated manner. This will hopefully then allow further
      study and wider implementation of this technique both in Ottawa and in Canada
