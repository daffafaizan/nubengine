      non-communicable diseases. It is estimated that office workers spent up to 80 % of their
      working time sedentary and do not compensate by sitting less in their leisure time.
      Therefore, interventions with potential to reduce sedentary behavior and increase phyical
      activity levels are of increasing interest. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects
      of active office, including sit-to-stand desk, bike desk, seddle chair, and active breaks, on
      sedentary behavior, physical activity levels, and cardio-vascular parameters. The study
      design will be randomised control trial with one experimental and one control group. The
      participants in the experimental group will use active office for one week whereas the
      control group will use the conventional office. All the participants will wear ActivePal for
      5 consecutive day and complete the measurements (heart rate, blood pressure). The
      participants will also complete quastionaires about the sedentary behavior and physical
      activity levels (Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire).
      Moreover, at the baseline and on the last day of measurements the investigators will measure
      the work environment factors (light, noise, air flow, temperature). The goal of the study is
      to evaluate the effects of active office on sedentary behavior and physical activity levels
      in office workers.
