      Smoke and bio-aerosols are routinely produced by surgical instruments; eg, lasers,
      electrosurgical units, radiofrequency devices, ultrasonic devices, power tools. Plume and
      bio-aerosols contain odor-causing and odorless toxic gases, vapors, dead and live cellular
      debris (including blood fragments), and viruses. These airborne contaminants can pose
      respiratory, ocular, dermatological and other health-related risks, including mutagenic and
      carcinogenic potential, to patients and operating room personnel. The National Institute of
      Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also
      studied electrosurgical smoke at length. Therefore, the equipment of smoke evacuation in OR
      needs to be used. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the pre-post smoke evacuation uses
      on surgical smoke and bio-aerosols particles in operating rooms at a university hospital,
      Thailand.

      Methodology Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) guideline is used as the
      conceptual framework of this study including evidence based practice for smoke and
      bio-aerosols evacuation systems. The study design is a quasi-experimental study (manipulation
      and control only, without randomization) comparing the amount of surgical smoke and
      bio-aerosols particles pre- post smoke evacuation uses. The samples consist of 64 cases of
      surgical patients who receive head-neck or breast surgery and 64 cases of surgical patients
      who receive abdominal laparoscopic surgery. The amount of surgical smoke and bio-aerosols'
      particles in the surgical field and OR environment are measured by AeroTraxTM Handheld
      Airborne Particle Counter Model 9306.
