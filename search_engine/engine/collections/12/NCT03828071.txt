      for 2 days and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 5-10 μg/kg per day was
      administered when the level of peripheral leucocytes was < 1×109/L. Peripheral leukocyte
      counts were monitored, and harvesting was performed when the peripheral white blood cell
      level rebounded (usually 11 days after cyclophosphamide). The target acquisition was CD34+
      cells > 2×10^6/kg and mononuclear cells > 2×10^8/kg. The graft was preserved at a temperature
      of -196 ℃ for further use. The conditioning regimen consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide
      (40 mg/kg/day × 4 days) 5 days before transplantation (a total dose 160 mg/kg) and rabbit
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (2.5mg/kg/day × 3 days) 4 days before transplantation. The dose
      of cyclophosphamide and ATG could be reduced according to the patients' condition.
      Methylprednisolone (80-500 mg/day) was administered through intravenous drip at the same time
      with ATG to reduce anaphylaxis. The incidence of drug-related complications was decreased by
      hyperhydration (the volume of infusion liquid is 50 ml/kg/day), urine alkalization (infusion
      of sodium bicarbonate 250ml/day), and anti-emetic medication. G-CSF (0.5 μg/kg/d) was
      administered to each patient beginning the day after stem cells reinfusion until the level of
      absolute peripheral neutrophil count was consecutively higher than 1.0 × 10^9/L.
