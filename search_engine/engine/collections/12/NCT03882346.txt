    
      Patient should have acute or acute-on-chronic liver failure and be registered in KONOS
      (Korean Network for Organ Sharing) system as a candidate of liver transplantation. Patients
      who meet the eligibility criteria will be assigned to control group or experimental group.
      Experimental group patients will receive LifeLiver treatment in addition to the best
      supportive care for the disease.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To evaluate the efficacy of LifeLiver in terms of a comparison of 30 day-survival rate
      between control group and experimental group. (after patient's KONOS (Korean Network for
      Organ Sharing) registration date)

      Secondary Objective:

        1. To compare a median value of 2 week-survival rate and duration of survival between both
           study groups

        2. Survival analysis respect to each group of patients divided according to the KONOS
           status

        3. To investigate safety and change of overall efficacy indicators in terms of Glasgow Coma
           Scale, West Heaven Criteria for hepatic encephalopathy, MELD (Model for End-stage Liver
           Disease) score, blood ammonia, inflammatory cytokine
