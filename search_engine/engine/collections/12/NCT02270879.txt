      demographics (age and gender) and several parameters for both the first and second eyes:
      surgery date, axial length, keratometric corneal power in 2 meridians, predicted intra-ocular
      lens (IOL) power recommended for plano target in each formulae (HofferQ, SRK II, SRK/T and
      Holladay 1), implanted IOL power, predicted post-operative refraction for the implanted IOL
      for the 4 formulae, observed post-operative refraction in spherical equivalent and
      post-operative best corrected visual acuity. The prediction error was calculated for the
      first eye (PE1) as the difference between the observed post-operative refraction in spherical
      equivalent and the predicted post-operative refraction by the IOL Master for the implanted
      IOL. This was obtained for the 4 formulae. The prediction error for the second eye (PE2) was
      obtained in a similar fashion. The optimal partial adjustment for second eye refinement was
      obtained subtracting a portion of the PE1 from the PE2 (PE2-xPE1, where 0≤x≤1) for the 4
      formulae. The optimal correction factor was determined for all formulae by using an array of
      different proportions of PE1 that were applied to the second eye. The values ranged from 10%
      to 100%, with increments of 10% each.
