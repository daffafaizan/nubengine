      extract on soluble RAGE and renal damage in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, by means
      of a clinical trial, double blind, with randomization and placebo control group. In male and
      female population, with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus type 2, under treatment with
      hypoglycemic agents and / or insulin and kidney damage, 2 - 3a grade according to
      classification of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and HbA1c
      levels 9 - 12% who sign the letter of consent under information, from 35 to 65 years of age,
      residents of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara.

      All patients who meet the selection criteria and who sign their informed consent will be
      given the clinical history, as well as anthropometric and laboratory determinations. Once
      these values are known, the intervention will proceed with the research product, extract of
      green tea 400 mg twice a day or placebo 400 mg twice a day, this will be according to the
      technique of masking by the closed envelope technique for 12 weeks. Patients will be
      evaluated at 30, 60 and 90 days of intervention, for attachment assessment, tolerability of
      treatment, side effects and laboratory safety determinations. At the end of the 12 weeks of
      the intervention, the anthropometric and laboratory determinations will be made again as well
      as the determination of soluble RAGE by means of Elisa sandwich type, in serum obtained at
      the beginning and at 12 weeks of intervention.

      The database will be developed in the statistical program Statistical software (SPSS) version
      21.0. The qualitative variables will be expressed in frequencies and percentages, while the
      quantitative variables will be expressed in means and standard deviations, the normality test
      will be carried out through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and, according to the result, it will
      be decided for the analysis intra group perform paired t or Wilcoxon method and for
      intergroup t student or Mann-Whitney U. A value of p â‰¤0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.
