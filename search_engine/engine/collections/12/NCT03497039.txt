    
      The study will be performed in Participants diagnosed with OA of the knee who are scheduled
      for arthroplasty of the knee as a treatment for their OA.

      Approximately fifty (50) male and female OA participants, who, at the time of screening, are
      â‰¥50 years old, will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio: two thirds will receive DDEA gel treatment
      and one third placebo gel.After providing informed consent to participate in the study the
      participants will need to forego any non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) or
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 treatment for at least 7 days prior to starting study treatment (Visit
      2) to allow wash-out of existing therapy and thus avoiding confounding the effect of the
      study treatments.

      There will be 4 study center visits as follows:

      Visit 1 Screening visit: Day -7 (Window: Day-10 to Day-7) Visit 2 Baseline (randomization)
      visit: Morning of Day 1 Visit 3 Hospital admittance through to surgery and post-surgery:
      Evening of Day 7 through Day 8 (Surgery may be delayed by up to 7 days) Visit 4 Final visit:
      Day 8 to Day 10 (Between recovery and discharge)

      The Participants will be provided paracetamol as rescue medication, to be used up to a total
      daily dose of 4 gram (g). Rescue medication will be available from the Screening Visit (Day
      -7) through to end of Day 7. Should the need arise for additional pain relief, the
      investigators will be allowed to prescribe codeine or tramadol. Postoperative analgesia will
      be handled according to the surgical center's pain management procedures.
