      outcomes and radiological assessments of modified suture bridge technique for medium rotator
      cuff tears.

      Methods: We prospectively followed 50 consecutive patients with medium rotator cuff tears
      treated with the modified suture bridge (MSB) or traditional suture bridge technique (TSB)
      from December 2018 and December 2019. On the basis of preoperative findings and MRI
      performance, 26 patients underwent MSB repair whereas 24 underwent TSB repair. Range of
      shoulder motion, visual analog scale score (VAS score), University of California-Los Angeles
      score (UCLA score), Constant-Murley shoulder score (Constant score), American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons score (ASES score) were assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging were performed
      preoperatively and at 12 months postoperatively.
