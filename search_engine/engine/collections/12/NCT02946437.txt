      the patients are screened for eligibility. When the patients are coming back to the ICU,
      after successful aneurysm coiling or clipping, data of artificial ventilation, systemic and
      other cerebral parameters will be collected continuously by online monitoring, starting at
      baseline and stopping at discharge of the ICU. Sevoflurane will be vaporized and
      administrated by the MIRUS™System directly to the inspiratory part of the ventilation circuit
      for the next 4 hours. In the following 14 days of the stay on the ICU, standard monitoring
      parameters, the appearance of vasospasm and brain oedema will be recorded. Besides the
      continuous online monitoring, laboratory assessment will be performed daily. At day 7±2 and
      day 14±2 after bleeding a MRI or CT examination will be performed, according to the clinical
      condition of the patient, to detect secondary brain injuries, as ischemia or brain oedema. At
      ICU discharge, the neurological outcome will be assesses applying GOS.
