      This includes standard clinical tests for acuity and contrast performance. Subjects will then
      receive a demonstration of the device. If the demonstration shows favourable results
      (improved functional visual performance for some rudimentary tasks such as reading), and the
      subject consents to the study, the subject will return to the site a week later to receive
      their personalized device (lens prescriptions incorporated into the unit), and more
      comprehensive training on its operation. They will then use the unit in their
      home/work/school environment over a period of three months. At the start of the study, after
      a period of one month, and at the end of the three month period, the subject will visit the
      clinical setting for administration of various specified ADL tasks, and the Veterans Affairs
      (VA) Low Vision (LV) Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ) 48-question VA LV VFQ-48 survey. The
      intent of this repetition is to understand how ADL proficiency and VFQ-48 QoL assessment
      changes over time, as the subject becomes more accustomed to the device.
