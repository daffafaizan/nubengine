    
      All patients will be given the Functional Living Index- Emesis (FLIE), a standardized
      questionnaire. This is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of nausea and
      vomiting on the patient's functional living, including physical activities, social and
      emotional function, and ability to enjoy food and drink. Patients will complete the
      questionnaire during the 5 days following carboplatin administration (at 24 hours, 48 hours,
      72 hours and 96 hours) during their first and third cycles of chemotherapy. The questionnaire
      should take approximately 10 minutes or less to complete.

      Patients will also be interviewed by a trained CRA or research nurse over the telephone 24-48
      hours following carboplatin administration in order to assess the severity of the delayed
      nausea and vomiting.
