      patients with Barrett's esophagus (non-dysplastic IM, LGD and HGD). The primary objective is
      to provide a tool for participating physician investigators to collect outcomes data related
      to the use of the HALO Ablation Systems.

      Protocol Design:

      This is a prospective, multi-center patient Registry. Sites may choose to also
      retrospectively enroll previously treated patients (after obtaining informed consent) and
      enter retrospective data into case report forms on-line. "Retrospective data collection" is
      defined as any data other than patient history collected prior to signing of the informed
      consent. A set of case report forms (CRFs) is provided along with this protocol to track
      outcomes. The CRFs may be completed and retained on site, but the site is recommended to
      utilize the internet-based data entry system.
