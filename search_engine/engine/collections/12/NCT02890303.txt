      during cataract surgery with phacoemulsification to evaluate safety and effectiveness. The
      primary effectiveness endpoint is a complete capsulotomy in at least 95 percent of the cases.
      The primary safety endpoint is posterior capsular rupture and virtuous loss in 4 percent or
      less of the subjects. Other parameters to be captured during the study include anterior
      capsule tears, corneal touch, capsulotomy diameter, contraption of the Zepto capsulotomy,
      size of the corneal incision pre and post Zepto, interocular lens contraption and evaluation
      of zonular stability and the incidence and severity of adverse events. The criteria for
      patient success will be accessed based on the successful completion of a 360 degree
      capsulotomy without tissue bridges and no posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss. The
      criteria for study success will be accessed based on a greater than or equal to 95 percent of
      the cases having a complete 360 degree capsulotomy without tissue bridges and less than 4
      percent of subjects with posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss.
