    
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational drug and drug combination to use for further studies. "Investigational" means
      that the drug and drug combination is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Venetoclax for this specific
      disease, but it has been approved for other uses.

      Venetoclax is an inhibitor of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 is critical for keeping cancer cells alive.

      By inhibiting Bcl-2, venetoclax promotes cancer cell death. This drug is currently being used
      in other clinical trials for people with certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple
      myeloma. There is some evidence from those and other laboratory trials that venetoclax may
      kill cancer cells and cause tumors to shrink.

      In this research study, the investigators are investigating how safe the combination of
      Venetoclax and standard chemotherapy is and how it affects this disease.. The participant
      will be given Venetoclax alone first and the standard chemotherapies will be given in
      combination. This study aims to provide information to help determine the dose of Venetoclax
      , in combination with standard chemotherapy, affects this disease the best and which dose is
      the safest.
