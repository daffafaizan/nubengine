      incidence will increase in the coming years. Ablation of AF is a recent technique, the
      efficiency of which has considerably increased in recent years. Nevertheless, the success
      rates of ablation vary between 50% and 70% depending on the paroxysmal or persistent nature
      of AF. These rates are difficult to assess in routine practice because they are based on the
      recurrence of fibrillation.

      This definition of recurrence based on symptoms (palpitations, asthenia, fatigue, shortness
      of breath, malaise, precordialgia) is widely debated because some patients have asymptomatic
      AF recidivism, while others experience palpitations that are not due to AF.

      In this context, studies have been carried out with electrocardiographic recording devices
      implanted subcutaneously. Given the invasiveness of this monitoring, it is not feasible in
      current practice.

      The Vitaphone is a non-invasive device, with which the patient can record a single-track ECG
      as his or her symptoms take place. The plot is then transmitted via the internet to the
      centre, which can thus diagnose a relapse of AF.

      The aim of our study is to correlate the rhythm and symptoms of 20 patients with Vitaphone 6
      months after AF ablation and to compare them with 20 other patients receiving conventional
      monitoring.

      This is, to our knowledge, the first non-invasive French study using the Vitaphone.
