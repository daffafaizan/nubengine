      studies. It is used in 20 million diagnostic procedures worldwide annually. It became popular
      as a radioisotope because of its easy availability from a 99Molybdenum (99Mo)/99mTc
      generator, historic low costs, and previous high availability.

      The National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Chalk River Laboratories (Ontario, Canada)
      was shut down unexpectedly in May 2009 following a leak of heavy water. The NRU reactor
      supplied approximately a third of the world's demand of 99Mo for 99Mo/99mTc generators used
      diagnostic nuclear medicine tests. Given the fragility of 99Mo supply, alternative
      radiopharmaceuticals, such as 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), are attractive options to
      replace 99mTc bone scans. Several studies suggest that 18F-NaF may be more accurate and more
      sensitive in the detection of bone metastases than 99mTc bone scans.
