      reactions. This approach is designed to utilize our extensive knowledge of the allergens
      involved in peanut hypersensitivity to devise an immunotherapeutic approach that would lower
      the risk of anaphylactic reactions and would down regulate peanut-specific T cells in
      peanut-allergic patients. Previous attempts to utilize peanut-specific immunotherapy (IT)
      have been unsuccessful primarily because of the side effects of therapy.
