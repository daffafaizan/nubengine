      I. To prospectively evaluate the efficacy, as defined by uric acid response rate, of 2
      different single low doses of rasburicase followed by allopurinol in 2 treatment arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients requiring additional doses of rasburicase to
      maintain a uric acid level =< 7.5mg/dL on day 2 through day 6.

      II. To identify differential characteristics of the patients who do not respond to treatment.

      III. To measure the area under the plasma uric acid concentration-time curve (AUC) from
      baseline (day 1) to day 7, time to plasma uric acid level less than or equal to 7.5mg/dL.

      IV. To evaluate the rate of patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) V. To evaluate the safety of
      low single-doses of rasburicase. VI. To evaluate the rate of patients expressing a doubling
      of serum creatinine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive 1.5mg of rasburicase intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1* and
      allopurinol orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-6.

      ARM II: Patients receive 3 mg of rasburicase IV over 30 minutes on day 1* and allopurinol PO
      QD on days 1-6.

      NOTE: *Patients with serum uric acid >= 7.5mg/dl also receive rasburicase IV on days 2-3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
