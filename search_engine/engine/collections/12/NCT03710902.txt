      ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      in stroke patients is challenging, but highly relevant since anticoagulation can effectively
      reduce the risk of recurrent strokes. Furthermore, hypertension remains poorly controlled
      even after stroke despite multiple available treatment options. In the CARDIOSTROKE trial,
      the investigators aim to randomize 405 patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA into (1)
      standard diagnostic work-up, follow-up and treatment (control group) and (2) 3-week ECG
      monitoring to detect occult AF and self-monitoring of blood pressure with
      mobile-device-assisted self-titration of antihypertensive medication (intervention group).
      Randomization will occur 2:1 into control and intervention groups. The co-primary outcomes
      include (1) incidence of new-onset AF and (2) difference in the mean blood pressure at
      12-months.
