      women. Lipedema is an under-recognized condition, often misdiagnosed as lymfedema or
      dismissed as simple obesity. The diagnosis of lipedema is a clinical diagnosis and may be
      challenging to determine among patients who are obese. Measurements of muscle strength and
      physical fitness may give more clarity to differentiate between lipedema and obesity. This
      may lead to improvements in the criteria of diagnosing lipedema. The research question of the
      study is: Is there a difference in muscle strength between adult women with lipedema and
      adult women with obesity?

      In this study 40 patients will be studied; 20 patients in every group. Besides the general
      data as length, weight, age, abdominal circumference, volume of the legs additional muscle
      strength and physical fitness of women with lipedema and women with obesity will be measured
      and analysis.

      This study doesn't involve a negligible risk for participants. The study will not have direct
      benefit for the participants, but may be useful in giving more clarity in defining the
      phenotype for patients with lipedema.
