      therapies are useful in reducing the frequency of inflammatory processes (relapses) but don't
      delay significantly the progression of the disease, prevent long term disability or induce
      the repair of damaged tissue. This proposal contemplates the use of adult autologous bone
      marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat
      patients with active MS. This is a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial in
      which 8 patients with active forms of MS and moderate disability will enter the trial with
      the primary objective of assessing the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous
      infusion of BM-MSC. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by gadolinium enhancing
      lesions though magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological effects and immunological
      effects. Once randomized, patients will undergo BM extraction and once confirmed the
      availability of the needed dose, they will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms
      (BM-MSC named XCEL-MC-ALPHA, or placebo). XCEL-MC-ALPHA will be cryopreserved for all
      patients regardless the allocated arm. At month 6, the treatment will be crossed. Patients
      will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years.
