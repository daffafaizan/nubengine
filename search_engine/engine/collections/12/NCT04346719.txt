      kHz) have an inhibitory effect over muscle strength and somatosensory threshold.

      However, in these studies the intensity needed to reach block threshold is very high. The
      purpose of the present work is to reduce the amount of current intensity needed using a
      percutaneous approach by apply two acupuncture needles near the nerve as electrodes.
