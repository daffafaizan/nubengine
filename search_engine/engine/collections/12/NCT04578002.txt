      event-to-treatment-time. On-site, pre-hospital, clinical assessment of patients with
      suspected acute stroke can optimize further diagnostic and treatment pathways after patient
      arrival at the dedicated stroke center. A telemedical approach (interactive video and audio
      streaming) allows time efficient pre-hospital triage, via patient evaluation by simple,
      pre-defined assessment measures and a standardized questionnaire. This study is to
      investigate clinical efficacy of the pre-hospital triage of patients with suspected acute
      stroke by using advanced telecommunication tools with digital audio and video real-time
      streaming.
