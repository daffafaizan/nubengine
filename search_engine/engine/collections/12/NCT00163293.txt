      treat children who have mild asthma.

      The study enrolled 240 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Ciclesonide 100 µg

        -  Ciclesonide 200 µg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive inhalation) - this is a metered-dose inhaler that looks like the
           study drug but has no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take two puffs from a metered-dose inhaler once daily, in the
      evening, for up to 12 months.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Canada, Hungary and South Africa. The overall time
      to participate in this study was 12 months preceded by a baseline washout period of 3 to 4
      weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic including a safety follow-up visit
      within 30 days of the last treatment.
