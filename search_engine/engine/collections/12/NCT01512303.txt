      posttraumatic stress symptoms in veterans with PTSD. Twenty percent of the approximately 2
      million veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan ("Operation Iraqi Freedom" or OIF and
      "Operation Enduring Freedom" or OEF) suffer from the symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress
      Disorder. PTSD may be the reason behind alarming increases in suicidal behavior among
      returning veterans in Wisconsin and nation-wide. In addition to traditional treatments,
      Veterans Administration (VA) Hospitals and other community institutions for veterans now
      offer CA programs to their patients. Past research from our laboratory and others suggests
      that CA programs may provide effective relief from anxiety while increasing psychological
      well-being. However, little research exists on the effects of CA programs for combat veterans
      with PTSD. The proposed study aims to address this important gap by assessing CA programs
      such as Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). 150
      veterans with PTSD will be randomly assigned to either SKY, MBSR, or the wait-list control
      (WLC) group. We will assess participants' PTSD symptoms pre-intervention, post-intervention
      (approximately 10-14 days after initial visit), and 1 month post-treatment (approximately 6
      weeks after initial visit). In order to evaluate the programs' effects as comprehensively as
      possible, we propose a multi-method approach: baseline psychophysiology, autonomic reactivity
      and recovery, neuropsychological (cognitive) assessments, self-report questionnaires, and
      functional brain imaging (fMRI). Baseline measures will be collected from a group of 50
      combat-exposed veterans without PTSD to assess group differences on these measures prior to
      treatment.
