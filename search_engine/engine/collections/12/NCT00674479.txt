      Ruxolitinib is designed to block the protein product of a mutated (changed) gene that may be
      important in cancer cell growth and survival.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, every day of each 28-day cycle
      you will take ruxolitinib by mouth 2 times a day (in the morning and evening).

      On Day 1 of each cycle, the morning dose of study drug should not be taken until you visit
      the clinic unless the doctor says differently.

      If the doctor thinks it is necessary, your dose of study drug may be raised or lowered.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will be asked to list any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any
           side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 (+/- 2 days), the following tests and procedures will be
      performed (these can be done at your local physician's office):

        -  Your medical history will be reviewed, including any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-4 (+/- 2 days) and then once every 3 months, the following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be reviewed, including any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is necessary, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  During these visits, you will also be receiving your new supply of medication.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests at your local doctor's office.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, and every 6th cycle after that (Cycles 13, 19, 25, and so on), you
      will have a bone marrow aspiration or biopsy to check the status of the disease. On Day 1 of
      Cycle 4, the bone marrow aspiration/biopsy will also look at the genes and chromosomes of the
      leukemia cells. If there is not enough information from the biopsy/aspirate, leftover blood
      will be used to look at this gene and chromosome information.

      Every 2 weeks of Cycles 4-7, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      You will be called once a month while you are on study. During this phone call you will be
      asked how you are doing, if you have experienced any side effects, and if you are taking the
      study drug at the correct dose and time. This phone call will take a few minutes. You will be
      sent a card in the mail to remind you about any study visits you need to complete.

      Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test if there is a
      suspicion of pregnancy. If the test is positive, they will then have a blood (about 1
      teaspoon) pregnancy test.

      Length of Study:

      You may stay on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if you
      experience intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After you go off study you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be reviewed, including any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is necessary, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test. If the test is
           positive, they will then have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test.

      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat myelofibrosis. Giving ruxolitinib to patients with advanced hematological malignancies
      is investigational.

      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
