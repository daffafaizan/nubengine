      implant (REGENERA) in excision or lumpectomy of non-malignant breast lesions.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety of the implant procedure

        -  To assess the feasibility of the implant procedure

        -  To evaluate the performance of REGENERA breast implant:

             -  In replacing the removed tissue

             -  In potential interference with current diagnostic standard of care imaging
                procedures

             -  On patient's quality of life and satisfaction

             -  On investigator's satisfaction.
