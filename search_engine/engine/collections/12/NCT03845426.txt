      of the teeth. Following dental trauma regular monitoring and follow up of the teeth is
      required to ensure that the appropriate treatment is delivered promptly. Although there is
      information in the literature focused on child and adolescent dental trauma, there is limited
      information regarding traumatised permanent teeth. Permanent teeth have differing healing
      capacity after injury and this is dependent on the degree of root formation.

      During the initial assessment of patients that have suffered from dental trauma, negative
      responses to investigations assessing the health of the vasculature might lead clinicians to
      initiate unnecessary and irreversible treatment on traumatised teeth. Equally false positive
      results might delay treatment which might have an effect on the outcome, leading to the
      development of healing complications such as infection and root resorption. By collecting and
      analysing the clinical factors, we aim to identify which of aspects of the assessment might
      influence the prognoses of the teeth.
