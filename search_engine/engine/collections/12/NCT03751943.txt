    
      NanoFUSE® is indicated to be placed into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system that are
      not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure (i.e. the posterolateral spine and
      pelvis.) These defects may be surgically created osseous defects created from traumatic
      injury to the bone. NanoFUSE® must be used with autograft as a bone graft extender in the
      posterolateral spine. This product provides a bone graft substitute that remodels into the
      recipient's skeletal system. Radiographic success will be the primary judgement of success.
      All patient's achieving fused or probably fused status will be judged as a success.
