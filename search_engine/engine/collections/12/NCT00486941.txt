      intervention programmes to the primary care setting is necessary if such knowledge is to be
      used for disease prevention at the population level. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate
      the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention programe in the primary health care setting,
      targeted at patients with moderate- to high-risk of cardiovascular disease according to
      cardiovascular risk factor levels, physical activity and quality of life ratings.

      Randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months, carried out in a
      primary health care centre in Northern Sweden. A total of 151 middle-aged men and women, with
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes or obesity were enrolled. The subjects were
      randomised to an intervention (n = 75) or control group (n = 76). 120 subjects completed the
      three-year follow-up. The intervention was based on the protocols used in the Finnish
      Diabetes Prevention study (DPS) and the U.S Diabetes Prevention Program
