      Primary objective: To compare rates of opioid requirement as a function of supportive care in
      patients experiencing CTCAE grade â‰¥2 oral mucositis at completion of radiation or
      chemoradiation as part of OPTIMA II

      Secondary objectives: To compare total opioid equivalent dose above baseline opioid
      requirement at end of radiation, quality of life metrics, swallowing function, feeding-tube
      dependence, and protocol compliance in patients managed with best supportive care with or
      without prophylactic gabapentin. To investigate rates of gabapentin-related toxicity and
      discontinuation for patients treated on protocol.
