      5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus sorafenib was more effective and safe than sorafenib for
      hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. Programmed cell death protein-1
      (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma. No study has compared HAIC plus toripalimab with HAIC plus sorafenib. Thus, the
      investigators carried out this prospective, randomized, non-comparative study to find out it.
