    
      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized trial. All eligible subjects (patients
      identified to be contacted to schedule screening colonoscopy) will be randomized to one of
      three study arms: usual scheduling process (control), a generic message arm, or a tailored
      message arm. Patients in the "tailored message" arm will receive a telephone call and be
      asked a series of questions that will be used to assign patients to one of four messaging
      cohorts. After these questions have been answered, the patient will then receive a tailored
      message corresponding to his or her respective messaging cohort, encouraging them to schedule
      a colonoscopy with a directed script. In the "generic message" arm, patients will receive a
      telephone call and be asked to answer the same series of questions as the "tailored message"
      group, then receive a single, standard script encouraging them to schedule a colonoscopy.
