    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      usefulness of using a mobile app (nOCD) for treatment of OCD in a sample of 25 adults (ages
      18-65). nOCD is a free iOS/Android app that provides EX/RP-consistent treatment strategies.
      The study team will evaluate the effect of the app using gold-standard clinician-administered
      and self-report measures. Prior to downloading the app, participants will receive 4 (up to 5)
      in-person visits and receive brief weekly phone check-in. The long term goal of this line of
      research is to increase access to evidence-based treatment and to ultimately reach more
      patients giving them access to tools to reduce their OCD symptoms and improve their quality
      of life.
