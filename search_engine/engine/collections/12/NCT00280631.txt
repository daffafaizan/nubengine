      all World Health Organization or French-American-British classification types of
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In Phase 1, the safety, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic
      response rate with TLK199 Tablets will be evaluated. The Phase 1 dose-ranging stage is
      designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose or optimal biologic dose of TLK199 Tablets.
      Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of TLK199 Tablets will be conducted. In Phase 1, an
      additional 12 patients will undergo pharmacokinetic evaluation under fed conditions at the
      selected Phase 2a dose. In Phase 2a, further safety and hematologic responses by the modified
      International Working Group MDS response criteria will be studied.
