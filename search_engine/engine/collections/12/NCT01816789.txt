      model should be independently evaluated in a population different from the one on which the
      model was elaborated. External validation of the model is therefore crucial to assess the
      generalizability to other populations.

      In the present RCT the new AMH-based individualized treatment will be compared to the wide
      accepted age-based strategy.

      Primary endpoint:

      The percentage of women with an appropriate number (n=8-14) of retrieved oocytes in IVF/ICSI
      cycle.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Serum E2 levels on r-hCG day

        2. Serum P levels on r-hCG day

        3. Number of growing follicles (≥11mm) on r-hCG day

        4. Number of large (≥ 17 mm) ovarian follicles on r-hCG day

        5. Total r-FSH dose employed

        6. Treatment duration

        7. Rate of women with dose adjustment

        8. Number of cancelled cycles because of poor and hyper-response

        9. Fertilization rate

       10. Embryos obtained

       11. Implantation rates

       12. Biochemical pregnancy rates

       13. Clinical pregnancy rates

       14. OHSS rates
