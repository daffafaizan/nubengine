      explained to them. All patients who provide written informed consent will undergo screening
      to determine eligibility for the study. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be
      admitted to the clinic for 5 days / 4 nights as an in-patient. During this time, participants
      will be assigned to a specific dose cohort and will receive sequence that includes both
      placebo and RL-007. Brain activity and cognitive performance will be assessed on study days 2
      and 4.
