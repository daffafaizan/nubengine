      respiratory failure under long term oxygen therapy will be objectively measured using a
      electronic remote monitoring device (TeleOxâ„¢) over 15 days. The actual use time will be
      compared to their oxygen prescription.

      Participants whose actual time of use will be less than prescribed will be offered an
      intervention which will consist of a presentation of the adherence record. The participant
      will also be asked about the presence of possible barriers concerning the use of oxygen
      therapy. The collaborator in charge of home visits will attempt to resolve these barriers as
      much as possible. Only participants with an actual time of use less than prescribed will be
      offered this intervention and will continue the monitoring over a period of 15 additional
      days.
