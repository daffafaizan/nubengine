      decrease quality of life. The vibration exercises have been associated with improvements of
      the muscle component. Due to this, some researches have proposed that this technique could be
      applied to weak pelvic floor. However, it is unknown which vibration trainings have the
      highest impact on the pelvic floor muscle and urinary sphincter, more objectives studies to
      validate these data are necessary.

      The purpose of our research is to evaluate the activity in the urinary sphincter and the
      pelvic floor muscle by vibratory platform training in women.

      Subjects will be recruited, criteria exclusion will be evaluated, age, and BMI will be
      recorded. Each subject will exercise on the vibratory platform in 3 different positions, each
      one with 2 different frequencies and 1 minute each position and frequency. Pelvic
      electromyography (EMG) will assess the activity of the urinary sphincter and pelvic floor
      muscle with vibratory exercise. Data will be collected during all procedures.

      According to our purpose and anticipating the impact of this research extrapolating whole
      body vibration (WBV) training as program to improve the strength of the pelvic floor muscle
      elaborating a guided plan to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients
      suffering from urinary incontinence with this new nonsurgical treatment approach to women
      with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence, as well as this research allow us to
      increase our knowledge in urinary continence and the pelvic floor.
