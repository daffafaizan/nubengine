      intervention, called I-CoreDIST when applied in comprehensive rehabilitation after discharge

      positions and functional activities, 2) effects on and level of physical activity, and 3)
      user's identifications of positive and negative features in content and coordination of
      physiotherapy integrated in post stroke rehabilitation. Function parameters of balance, gait
      and levels of physical activity at baseline and at 12 weeks will be compared to those
      obtained from the standard care group. Semistructured interviews will be conducted to
      identify patients' perceptions of key positive and negative features of content and
      coordination of I-CoreDIST and standard care rehabilitation after a stroke.
