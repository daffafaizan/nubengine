      receiving an islet cell transplant; all participants will receive Campath-1H + Infliximab
      induction therapy followed by sirolimus and ultra-low dose tacrolimus maintenance therapy.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of this treatment regimen in
      adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet transplant.
