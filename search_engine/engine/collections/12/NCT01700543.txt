    
      This study is a prospective, noncontrolled, multi-center post market clinical follow-up study
      involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in hemi and total shoulder arthroplasty procedures.

      A total number of 160 subjects will be included in the study.

      Ethics Committee (EC) approval for each site has to be obtained prior to conducting this
      study. Sequentially, all eligible patients will be offered study enrollment at each center to
      avoid potential selection bias. All potential subjects will be required to participate in an
      informed consent process and sign the EC approved written Informed Consent prior to study
      enrollment.

      The study is designed to be prospective to ensure that the study population is representative
      of the type of population that the device is intended to treat. Patients will be selected
      according to the subject selection criteria described in section 8. All subjects will undergo
      preoperative, intraoperative and immediate postoperative assessments including physical
      examinations, radiographic evaluations and collection of quality of life metrics. Follow-up
      evaluations are to be conducted at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years postoperation.
