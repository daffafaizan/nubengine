    
      This is a quasi-experimental trial examining the effects of a proposed family-based
      intervention for drug abusers on motivating them to stay drug abstinence and improve family
      functioning, in which 40 drug abusers with focal families (including spouses and/or children)
      will be recruited for intervention group receiving both family-based intervention and routine
      care and 40 drug abusers without involving family will be recruited for comparison group
      receiving routine care. In the in-take, drug-abusing subjects will be given a brief
      introduction and invited to provide basic background information about themselves and
      families. After filling the informed consent, participants will be assigned to intervention
      group or comparison group according to whether their family will join sessions together.
      After drug abusers and families fill in the online questionnaire at the baseline (T0), the
      intervention group will receive family-based intervention and routine care in one month,
      while the comparison group will receive only routine care in one month. Both groups will be
      assessed at three follow-up time points (T1 = 1-month after baseline; T2 = 2-month after
      baseline; T3 = 4-month after baseline). As hypothesized, the intervention group will show a
      greater reduction in the primary outcomes of drug use and greater increase in the secondary
      outcomes of family functioning than the comparison group. A repeated-measures analysis of
      covariance will be conducted to assess the effects of family-based intervention.
