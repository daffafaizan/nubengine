    
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of long-acting injectable risperidone
      on psychiatric inpatient hospitalization, schizophrenia symptoms, quality of life, medication
      adherence, side effects, and health care costs.

      Objectives:

      Primary: To evaluate the impact of long-acting intramuscular (IM) risperidone on risk of
      inpatient psychiatric hospitalization in comparison to standard oral antipsychotic treatment
      in a randomized controlled trial to be conducted with 450 veterans diagnosed with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at 16 VA medical centers over three years.

      Secondary: To evaluate adherence, health benefits, and costs of long-acting IM risperidone as
      compared to standard oral antipsychotic treatment as measured by: a) symptom reduction over
      12 months, b) time to all-cause medication discontinuation, c) quality of life, d) VA and
      non-VA health service use and related costs, e) medication side effects, f) violent behavior,
      g) use of concomitant medication, and h) the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
