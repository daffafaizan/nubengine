      participants. The actual size will vary depending on the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
      observed and the resultant sizes of the cohorts. Participants will receive IMC-1121B,
      administered intravenously, once every 2 or 3 weeks for 6 weeks (one cycle). After one cycle
      of treatment, participants who have an objective response or stable disease may continue to
      receive IMC-1121B at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or other withdrawal
      criteria are met. A minimum of three participants will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose
      escalation in successive cohorts will occur once all participants complete one cycle of
      therapy.

      Participants will be enrolled sequentially into each cohort.

      A completed participant will be either a participant who completes the initial 6 week
      treatment period (Cycle 1) or a participant who discontinues therapy for an IMC-1121B related
      toxicity during Cycle 1. Participants who do not complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for
      reasons other than an IMC-1121B -related toxicity will be replaced. Toxicity data for each
      cohort will be reviewed prior to dose escalation. Upon completion of all required safety
      evaluations during the initial 6 weeks, the next cohort of new participants will be treated
      at the next higher dose level using a dose escalation scheme.
