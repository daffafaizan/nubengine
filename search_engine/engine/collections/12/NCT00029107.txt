      presence of cryoglobulins-abnormal proteins that white blood cells called B lymphocytes
      produce in response to the chronic hepatitis C infection. Rituximab decreases the number of B
      cells. The Food and Drug Administration approved Rituximab in 1997 for the treatment of
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with hepatitis C and signs and symptoms of
      cryoglobulinemic vasculitis may be eligible for this study. They must have failed, or been
      unable to tolerate, treatment with IFN-a and ribavirin. Candidates will be screened with a
      history and physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine tests, 24-hour
      urine collection and chest X-ray, if clinically indicated.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Rituximab or standard therapy for 6 months
      after entering the study. All patients will be followed once a month at NIH for disease
      evaluation and blood tests during that time.

      Patients will be given Rituximab 375 mg/m2intravenously once a week for 4 weeks. The day
      before each infusion they will have a history and physical examination, blood work, and other
      tests, such as X-rays, as clinically indicated.

      After the four infusions, patients will be followed for drug side effects and response to
      treatment. They will have blood tests every week for 4 weeks and will then return to NIH for
      1 day every month for 12 months for a physical examination, blood tests, and X-rays, if
      medically indicated. Visits may be more frequent, if necessary.
