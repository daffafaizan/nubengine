           necessary to achieve a long-term effective ocular hypotensive response balancing risks
           related to a high energy treatment and risks related to retreatment due to suboptimum
           dose delivery.

        -  There are two main approaches to delivering laser energy, the pops-titration method and
           the fixed energy method that are the fixed-high and low-energy (the Gaasterland's
           slow-coagulation technique).

        -  Of particular interest is which laser energy delivery method (slow-coagulation versus
           pops-titration) affords the optimal dose of photocoagulation necessary to achieve an
           effective long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction while minimizing the risk of
           adverse events related to overtreatment and retreatments especially in refractory
           glaucomatous eyes with dark iris color.
