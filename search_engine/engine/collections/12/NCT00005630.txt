        -  Determine whether a specific T-cell response can be induced in patients with stage IB-IV
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with mutant K-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the
           specific K-ras peptide mutation in their tumors) and sargramostim (GM-CSF).

        -  Determine whether skin test reactivity or HLA type correlates with the induction of
           anti-K-ras immune responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally (ID) on days 1-10 beginning a
      maximum of 6 months after complete surgical resection. Patients receive mutant K-ras peptide
      vaccine (limited to the specific K-ras mutation in their tumors) ID on day 7. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 and 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
