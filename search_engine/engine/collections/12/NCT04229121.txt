           mutation, and detect the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation, Anaplastic
           lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion, ROS proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (ROS1)
           fusion, RET proto-oncogene (RET) fusion and Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition factor
           (MET) 14 exon skipping by Lung cancer Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) panel kit, and
           verify the mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and tumor tissue.

        2. Enrich ctDNA from advanced NSCLC patients with Driver gene mutation, detect the EGFR
           mutation by PCR, and detect the ALK fusion, ROS1 fusion, RET fusion and MET 14 exon
           skipping by next generation sequencing (NGS), and compare the mutation coincidence rate
           between CTCs and ctDNA.
