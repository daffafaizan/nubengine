      family-centered transitional care program named the BREATHE program. The BREATHE program
      stands for 'Better Respiratory Education and Treatment Help Empower'. The BREATHE program
      offers the following:

        1. Individualized transition support services to help ensure that the patient (and family
           caregiver if available) are prepared for discharge, understand the discharge plan of
           care, and receive post discharge follow up to help meet their needs

        2. Tailored COPD self-management education and support program that starts during the
           hospital stay and continues post discharge in the community setting

        3. Facilitated access to community based services.

      The intervention is delivered by a new team member called "COPD Nurse Transition Guide". The
      new team member works with both the hospital and outpatient care teams, is a registered nurse
      with homecare services experience, and have received additional training in COPD
      self-management and motivational interviewing. The nurse meets participants in the hospital
      and then follows up with them via home visits and phone calls.The intervention involves both
      patients and family caregivers (if available), is literacy adapted, and follows a tailored
      approach based on patient needs, priorities, and preferences.
