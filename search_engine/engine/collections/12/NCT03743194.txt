      liposomal bupivacaine, provides superior recovery compared to routine parenteral and enteral
      analgesia in patients recovering from MICS. The primary outcome will be the simple
      multi-dimensional quality assessment, Overall Benefit Analgesia Score (OBAS score).53 Our
      secondary aims are to: 1) compare cumulative postoperative opioid consumption (pain
      medications administered over one-day periods quantified as morphine equivalents and provided
      by the EMR for the day of surgery and postoperative days 1, 2, and 3; 2) evaluate respiratory
      mechanics (forced expiratory volume in first minute (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and
      peak flow) after extubation on the postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 while patients remain
      hospitalized; and, (3) evaluate the Quality-of-Recovery-15 score on the postoperative days 1,
      2 and 3.
