    
      In spite of scarce and non-conclusive evidence on the prognostic value of self-reported
      functional capacity for perioperative cardiovascular events, the estimation of cardiovascular
      functional capacity in metabolic equivalents (METs) based on a questionnaire represent the
      core question in the preoperative cardiac risk assessment in patients undergoing elevated
      risk noncardiac surgery endorsed by ESA, the ESC, and the ACC/AHA. MET-REPAIR will examine
      the ability of MET estimated using a questionnaire to predict perioperative cardiovascular
      events correcting for preoperative risk factors, (e.g. comorbidity and type of surgery) and
      calculate the effect on risk stratification (net reclassification improvement) by the
      addition of METs estimated by questionnaire to established risk scores, such as the Revised
      Cardiac Risk Score (Lee-index) and the NSQIP MICA . Further, investigators will address
      alternative approaches to functional capacity estimation (1. ability to climb stairs; 2.
      self-assessed functional capacity compared to peers; 3. Daily/weekly physical activity) and
      their predictive value for perioperative cardiovascular events.

      The association between elevated natriuretic peptides prior to noncardiac surgery and
      perioperative cardiovascular events is well established. However, a direct comparison of the
      predictive ability of biomarkers vs. self-reported MET is lacking. Therefore, in a substudy
      (NTproBNP substudy), investigators will evaluate in how far the addition of NTproBNP improve
      prediction of perioperative cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality when added to
      clinical data and estimated METs.
