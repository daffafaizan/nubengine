      Faculty to the General Surgery Outpatient Clinic between March of 2012 and December of 2020
      with umbilical symptoms such as umbilical discharge and umbilical pain. All patients were
      diagnosed by physical examination confirmed with ultrasonography . Patients with diseases
      other than umbilical sinus were excluded from the study. Examined patients' characteristics
      include age, gender, intergluteal sinus disease history, family history, belly shaving
      histoy, daily shower, treatment modality and healing status. There were 3 treatment
      modalities: conservative approach (daily shower, shaving, antibitics if infected); topical
      silver nitrate treatment; surgical operation for umbilical sinus as excracting the hairs from
      the sinus Â± excising the sinus. To determine if "healed" the investigators followed up our
      patients ensuring no symptoms for a minimum 2 years.

      Chi-square tests were conducted to compare the distribution of categorical variables. Age was
      analyzed as a continuous variable with a t-test. Univariable and multivariable logistic
      regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. P-values
      of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were
      conducted with R version of 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,
      https://www.r-project.org) software packages.
