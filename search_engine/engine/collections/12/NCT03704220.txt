      anticoagulation therapy (INR range 1.5-1.9 along with antiplatelet therapy) has been
      accomplished safely will be screened for participation in the study. If inclusion criteria
      are met, patients will be transitioned to a single anti-thrombotic therapy with
      Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) and anticoagulation with warfarin will be removed. ASA will be
      administered in a minimum dose of 100 mg per day with dosage adjustments based on VerifyNow
      testing up to a maximum of 200 mg daily. The primary endpoint will be analyzed at 90 days
      after initiation of the single antiplatelet therapy.
