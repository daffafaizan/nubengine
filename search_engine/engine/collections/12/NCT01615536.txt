      results from endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) because failure to clear the disease leads to
      ongoing inflammation and symptoms. In particular a subset of CRS patients with thick
      eosinophilic mucin (EMCRS) develop recurrent symptoms and require further surgeries. ESS
      techniques for the maxillary sinus requires a WMA in the side wall of the sinus and the use
      of curved debrider instruments to clear the polyps. Sometimes this doesn't provide access to
      the inferior/floor and anterior/front aspects of the maxillary sinus due to the fact that the
      maxillary sinus is on the side of the nasal cavity at an angle. The CFT through the front
      wall of the sinus was developed years ago as an alternative approach to improve access to
      these areas. Both techniques are acceptable standard treatments and which one is initially
      used to address the maxillary sinus currently depends on surgeon preference. The role of CFT
      has been studied by Sathanatar et al (Laryngoscope 2005) and Lee et al (Laryngoscope 2008)
      which provided conflicting results. Differences in their study patients and methodology could
      explain the different outcomes. Hence this study is proposed to clarify the role of CFT in
      patients with extensive maxillary sinus disease to see whether initial use of CFT is more
      helpful than WMA in the severely diseased maxillary sinus with polyps and mucin. Findings
      from this study may improve surgical outcomes for CRS patients in the future.
