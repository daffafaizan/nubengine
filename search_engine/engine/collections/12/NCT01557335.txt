      patients at risk for developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers.

      Aspirin 81 mg taken concomitantly with clopidogrel 75 mg as maintenance doses is standard of
      care in some patients with cardiovascular disease. The combination of aspirin and
      clopidogrel, however, significantly increases the risk for bleeding events. To mitigate upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding events, these patients would require the use of a proton pump
      inhibitor. For that reason, the reference arm in this study uses PrilosecÂ® 40 mg as a
      comparator - the same proton pump inhibitor at the same dose level.

      The primary objective is to evaluate adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation
      following administration of clopidogrel, EC aspirin 81 mg and EC omeprazole 40 mg, all dosed
      concomitantly, and PA32540 and clopidogrel dosed separately
