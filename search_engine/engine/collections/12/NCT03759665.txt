    
      In the Parent Study, Patients will be assessed during three study phases: a baseline period,
      a 6-week treatment period, and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. If within 6 weeks
      prior to the initial screening visit, a patient has received any of the prohibited
      medications defined in the eligibility criteria (irrespective of the preceding treatment
      duration) a wash-out study-run-in of 6 weeks is required prior to the first baseline
      assessment. All patients will receive the study drug during the treatment period. For each
      individual patient, the Parent Study lasts for approximately 3.5 - 4 months during which
      there are 6 visits to the study site.

      This Extension Phase allows patients who have completed the Parent Study to, at the
      discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), continue treatment with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine
      (IB1001). Patients will receive treatment with IB1001 for two one-year treatment periods,
      separated by a 6-week washout. All patients will receive the study drug during these two
      one-year treatment periods. For each individual patient, the Extension Phase lasts for
      approximately 25.5 months, during which there are 6 visits to the study site.
