      I. To determine the response rates to weekly, sequential paclitaxel/ bryostatin-1 in patients
      with unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      II. To determine the toxicity of therapy. III. To determine patient survival after therapy.
      IV. To determine Bryostatin-1 pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 followed by bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour
      on day 2 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
