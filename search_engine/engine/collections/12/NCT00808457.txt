      • Assessing the sensitivity of chest ultrasound in diagnosing pneumonia.

      Secondary target criteria comprise

        -  Assessing specificity, negative and positive predictive value of chest ultrasound at the
           time of diagnosing,

        -  Characterizing pneumonic infiltrates at the time of diagnosing and further course,

        -  Describing the association between clinical, X-ray and sonographic findings in the
           course of pneumonia.

      The tertiary target criterion includes

      • Characterizing the range of pathogens detected by microbiological examination.
