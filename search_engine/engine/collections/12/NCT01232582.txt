      effectiveness of using ExAblate MRgFUS in the treatment of pain resulting from facet joint
      osteoarthritis.

      Patients with chronic LBP associated with one or more lumbar zygapophysial joints that meet
      all eligibility requirements and have given their written informed consent will be enrolled
      to the study.

      All patients will be treated and followed for 12-months post treatment. A total of 50
      patients will be enrolled at up to two clinical sites.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events
      associated with the ExAblate MRgFUS system used for the treatment of pain resulting from
      facet joint osteoarthritis
