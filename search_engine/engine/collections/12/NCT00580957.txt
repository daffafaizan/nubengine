      involuntary nervous system that controls your blood pressure, in insulin resistance and the
      metabolic syndrome. Insulin is a substance that helps your body use the sugar in the food
      that you eat. Some people's tissues stop reacting in a normal way to insulin, a condition
      known as insulin resistance. A person with insulin resistance can have other health problems,
      such as obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. These problems together are
      called the metabolic syndrome. We think that the autonomic or involuntary nervous system
      controls the way your body responds to insulin. This system is changed in obese people, and
      we think that it may cause the insulin resistance. We plan to study this with two drugs
      -trimethaphan and L-NMMA. Neither of these drugs are approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA), and they will be used for research purposes only.

      Fifty people will take part in this study.
