      used to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the cefprozil tablet products when dosed (1
      x 500 mg) under fed conditions. The washout period will be at least 14 days between doses.

      Twenty four plus two alternate (24 + 2) subjects were enrolled in this study and all
      volunteers were healthy adults. Twenty six (24 + 2) subjects began the study, and twenty-five
      (23 + 2) subjects completed the clinical portion of the study in its entirety.
