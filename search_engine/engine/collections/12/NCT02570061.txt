      may be challenging. The use of the telephone for giving information and obtaining consent may
      be practical but little formal research has been done.

      This study examined the use of the telephone for the purpose of informing expectant mothers
      about a randomized clinical trial assessing neonatal Bacille Calmette-GueÃÅrin vaccination.
      Expectant mothers who were contacted for participation in the Calmette Study were randomised
      to receive information by telephone or at a face-to-face consultation. The primary outcome
      was a communication score, consisting of comprehension of information about the study and
      satisfaction with the information process. The outcome was measured using a questionnaire two
      days after the information was provided and two and a half months after birth.
