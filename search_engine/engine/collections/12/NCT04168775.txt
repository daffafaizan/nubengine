      generate a sufficient inspiratory effort to achieve adequate lung delivery of inhaled
      medications through dry powder inhalers. Sparse data is available about the inspiratory
      capacity of these patients in the home setting, whether clinically stable or when
      experiencing worsened respiratory symptoms outside the acute care setting. This study is
      undertaking this study to better understand the proportion of patients with suboptimal peak
      inspiratory flow rate (sPIFR) measurements amongst COPD patients receiving dry powder
      inhaler(s) (DPI) in the ambulatory setting. Further, the study will characterize PIFR over
      time, the variability of PIFR measurements, and the associations with potential predictors
      (demographics, clinical, PRO, body position, and device) as well as exacerbations frequency
      and change in PIFR around period of exacerbation. To complete these aims, 120 participants
      will be enrolled in a 6 month study to perform PIFR measurements and respiratory
      questionnaires at home.
