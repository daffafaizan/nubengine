      wholegrain (WW) vs. refined wheat (RW) grain products on body weight and composition.

      Design: In this open-labeled randomized trial, 72 postmenopausal women with metabolic
      syndrome features were prescribed a mild calorie-restricted diet with a deficit of
      ~1,250kJ/d. Following 2 weeks run-in period on RW products, they were randomized to 12 weeks
      intervention with RW or WW products providing 2,000kJ/d.
