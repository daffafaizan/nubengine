      belt that surrounds the abdomen and supports the incision . Abdominal binder is routinely
      used after open surgery and Cesarean section, because it has been reported, according to a
      recent systematic review, to facilitate enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) such as pain
      relief, reduced risk of seroma formation, improved respiratory function, and assisted
      physical function using additional support to the lower abdominal musculature.

      However, the routine use of abdominal binder after laparoscopy has been challenged due to a
      potential risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and deep venous thrombosis due to
      increased intra-abdominal pressure. Also, abdominal binders after laparoscopy have been
      criticized for being uncomfortable and hot to wear and for impinging the breast line in
      females. Therefore, some laparoscopists prefer the use of abdominal binder in patients
      undergoing laparoscopy, while other laparoscopists did not. However, there have been no
      studies exploring the efficacy of incision support using an elastic abdominal binder after
      laparoscopy to date. The investigators performed therefore a randomized controlled trial to
      determine the effect of post-laparoscopic abdominal binder use on ERAS in patients with
      gynecologic disease.
