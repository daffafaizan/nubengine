      patients. Treatment will take place in outpatient facilities. It is hypothesized that among
      older adults with low back pain manual therapy will reduce low back pain and improve balance
      more than physical therapy; and that among older adults without low back pain manual therapy
      and physical therapy will be equally efficacious in improving balance. The results of this
      study will help to further define effective treatment protocols.
