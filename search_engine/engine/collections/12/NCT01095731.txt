      Mortality rates following aSAH range from 30-70% with 10-20% of survivors experiencing severe
      neurological disability. Following aSAH, a major cause of morbidity and mortality is
      vasospasm, which causes delayed ischemic neurologic deterioration. There is currently no
      effective treatment for preventing or ameliorating the damage that occurs following cerebral
      ischemia. A myriad of neuro-toxins are produced in the ischemic brain resulting in a vicious
      cycle of cellular death and destruction. The polyamines spermine and spermidine are
      metabolized by polyamine oxidase (PAO) into putrescine and 3-aminopropanal (3AP).

      Tiopronin (Thiola) is an FDA approved drug used for the treatment of cystine stones in
      patients with cystinuria in the U.S. In Europe, it is also used for the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis and bronchial hypersecretion. In previous animal studies, we
      demonstrated that tiopronin is able to bind and neutralize the toxic effects of 3AP. We have
      shown in previous studies that aSAH patients have elevated 3AP levels, and higher levels
      correlate to a poor neurologic outcome.

      The goals of this phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blinded safety and efficacy trial
      are to (1) further evaluate the safety of the drug in our patient population at the dose
      established in phase I; (2) demonstrate that tiopronin crosses the blood-brain barrier; (3)
      show that both serum and CSF 3AP levels are reduced by administration of tiopronin; and (4)
      demonstrate that a reduction in 3AP levels is associated with improved neurologic outcome in
      aSAH patients.
