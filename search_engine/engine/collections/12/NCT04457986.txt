    
      Patients undergoing lumber disc surgery will be randomised into 3 groups. To receive either
      Erector spina plane block (ESP) or Modified thoracolumbar interfacial plane block (MTI) or
      Intravenous patient controlled analgesia IV-PCA.

      Patients in the ESP and MTI groups will receive the blocks before anesthesia induction in the
      preoperative holding area.

      All patients will receive IV-PCA with tramadol. Postoperative analgesia will be evaluated
      with a numeric rating scale at postoperative recovery room admittance, postoperative 1st ,
      second, 4th, 12th and 24th hours both at rest and during movement.

      Postoperative tramadol consumption and time to first tramadol demand will be determined.
