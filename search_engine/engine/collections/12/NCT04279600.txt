      Capsules of taurine (3 grams) (GTau) or placebo (GP) were daily supplemented 2 hours before
      training. The training program was composed of aerobic and strength exercises during one
      hour, 3 times a week, for an 8-week period (intensity of 80% heart rate). The taurine
      supplemented group received only taurine capsules (3g/day) during 8 weeks. Measurement of
      weight, hip and waist circumference, and body composition (by Deuterium oxide) were performed
      before and after the intervention. Resting energy expenditure and nutrients oxidation were
      assessed by calorimetry.

      In order to check the effects of the intervention, abdominal tissue biopsy will be performed
      for white adipose tissue analysis, evaluation of mitochondrial function and quantification of
      the expression of genes related to energy metabolism and lipid oxidation and taurine pathway;
      blood collection will be done for quantification of taurine levels, inflammatory (IL-10,
      IL-15, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, and CRP), adipokines (adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, fetuin and
      leptin) and oxidative stress (GPx, SOD and MDA) markers. Also, evaluation of telomere length
      was performed. Body composition was evaluated by deuterium oxide method, weight, waist and
      hip circumference were accessed. All the measurements were performed before and after the
      intervention period.
