      and development. Preschoolers are thought to be very active but previous studies have shown
      that they are sedentary for the majority of time and not getting adequate opportunities to
      engage in active play. Experts have recommended strategies to promote physical activity in
      early learning settings and to involve parents in efforts to promote active living from a
      young age. Through early learning settings, we may be able to change behaviors in large
      groups of children and particularly benefit more vulnerable children who have fewer
      opportunities for outdoor play and physical activity at home or in their neighborhoods.
      However, meaningful engagement from families is also important and research suggests that
      there is gap in communication and perhaps alignment between educators and parents on the
      topic of preschoolers' physical activity. This research uses wearable technology to monitor
      physical activity in children, motivate parents and educators to help create active play
      opportunities, and create a platform for communication and shared accountability about this
      important health behavior. We will focus particularly on children from lower income
      backgrounds who suffer from disparities in both health and educational outcomes. Our primary
      outcome of interest is accelerometer measured physical activity. We will also explore how
      changes in preschooler's physical activity relate to behavioral indicators, which are topics
      of great significance to early childhood educators, policy makers and parents.
