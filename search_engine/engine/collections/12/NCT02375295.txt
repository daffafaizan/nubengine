      bacterial infection. They only make up 15% of all kidney stones, but account for a much
      higher percentage of mortality (up to 67%) compared to other stones-due to the infectious
      component. Treatment is to ensure 100% eradication of the stone with surgery followed by
      antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Failure to eliminate the bacteria results in the
      stone growing back quickly. It is unknown how long antibiotics should be administered
      immediately after surgery-some urologists give 2-4 weeks while others give 2-3 months. We
      seek to randomize patients to receive 2 weeks of antibiotics or 3 months of antibiotics after
      surgery to remove all the kidney stones. We will see patients at 3, 6, and 12 months with
      x-rays and to test their urine for bacterial infections. This is a multi-centre study with
      participating 12 sites across North America.
