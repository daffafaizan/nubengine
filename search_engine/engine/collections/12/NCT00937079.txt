      the pancreas. Insulinomas produce insulin and can become life threatening if they cannot be
      localised and removed surgically. Complete tumour resection cures most patients, hence
      surgery is the treatment of choice for begin and malignant insulinomas. The potential for
      surgical cure necessitates accurate tumour localisation before surgery because preoperative
      imaging facilitates the detection of small localised, multiple and metastatic insulinomas.
      However, the successful localisation of insulinomas is an challenging problem since
      approximately 30% of insulinomas cannot be visualised radiographically.

      A novel nuclear medicine scanning method using radioactive exendin-4 (111In-exendin-4) has
      recently been developed for imaging of insulinomas. 111In-exendin-4 accumulates specifically
      in insulinoma cells via the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor. The accumulation of
      111In-exendin-4 can be visualised by the use of a special camera (Single Photon Emission
      Computed Tomography (SPECT) camera) that detects radioactivity and lights up tumours as hot
      spots.

      The decision to perform surgery is independent of this study. If surgery is performed a small
      sample of the tumor will be used for identifying the sites where 111In-exendin-4 binds to the
      tumor.
