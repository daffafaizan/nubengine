    
      This study was an open-label randomized efficacy and safety pilot trial in patients with
      acute heart failure (AHF) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] â‰¥160 mm Hg)
      requiring parenteral antihypertensive therapy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive
      clevidipine or standard of care (SOC) intravenous antihypertensive treatment in an open-label
      manner in a ratio of 1:1. At the time of randomization, a patient-specific, prespecified SBP
      target range was determined and be recorded, prior to study drug treatment. Information on
      the dosing regimen, use of additional or alternative agents and transition to oral therapy if
      needed is detailed in the study 'ARM' and 'INTERVENTION' sections.

      A Data Safety Monitoring Board was utilized periodically throughout the study to monitor the
      safety of patients. Adverse events were assessed for 7 days post-study randomization or
      hospital discharge, whichever occured first. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed for
      30 days following study randomization. Subjects were contacted by telephone or in person up
      to 5 days after their 30-day time point to determine if any SAEs occurred following study
      drug treatment and to follow up on the Heath Economic assessments.
