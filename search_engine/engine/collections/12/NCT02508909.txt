      an ultrasound dissector. The inguinal step is performed via three ports (one 3-5 cm above the
      apex of the femoral triangle, a second 5 cm medial to the adductors, and the third 5 cm
      lateral to the Sartorius muscle). After subcutaneous inflation, a formal inguinal lymph node
      (LN) dissection is performed, removing the contents of the femoral triangle, with incision
      and removal of the femoral fascia and proximal and distal ligation of the saphenous vein with
      vascular endostaplers and endoclips. The specimen is extracted using an endobag from the
      incision of SLNB, which is systematically removed, or through a small enlargement of the
      incision of the apex trocar for patients with clinically positive LNs. The iliac step starts
      with open insertion in the pro-peritoneal space of a Hasson trocar, followed by positioning
      of two additional trocars (5 and 10 mm respectively) just laterally of the umbilical pubic
      line. After creation of pneumo-pelvis, the iliac femoral vessels are identified, isolated and
      all the external iliac LNs removed. Afterwards, the obturator LNs are dissected off the
      obturator nerve. LNs are retrieved with an endobag or directly through the 10mm trocar after
      insertion of protective endotrocar. Two drains are positioned at the end of procedure in the
      obturator fossa and in the inguinal space, respectively. Intra-operative and early
      post-operative outcome (lenght of stay, complications, number of LNs) is recorded. Follow-up
      consists in detection of any recurrence, measurement of lymphedema of the leg and evaluation
      of quality of life
