      Dpt of our Hospital (Internal Medicine Dpt, Endocrinology, ICU) will be screened for
      multi-drug resistant bacteria carriage (after written consent), regardless a travel in a
      foreign country during the past year, or not. They will answer to a questionnaire about
      previous travel in a foreign country during the previous year, hospitalization or not during
      this travel. The aim of the study will be to compare the rate of carriage of multi-drug
      resistant bacteria among previous travelers, or not.
