      metastasis development following cancer surgery compared to analgesia based on strong opioids
      such as morphine or piritramide. These beneficial effects, if present, are probably
      attributable to less immunosuppression of antimetastatic immune defenses.

      The aim of this study is to identify techniques of perioperative analgesia with the potential
      to prevent metastasis development in patients undergoing open radical colon cancer surgery.
      In the early postoperative period, a relationship between metastasis development and the
      number of circulating cancer cells representing minimal residual disease has been shown.
      Therefore, effects of epidural, morphine-based and piritramide-based analgesia on the number
      of circulating cancer cells will be compared at several time points during the peroperative
      and early postoperative periods. The number of circulating cancer cells will be assessed in
      peripheral venous blood samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Perioperative care
      will be standardized and patients will be followed by clinical observation, laboratory
      analyses and monitoring instrumentation daily during their hospital stay.
