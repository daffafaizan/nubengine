      the standard of care (SoC), PegIFNα-2a (P) and ribavirin (R), in adult, genotype 1
      HCV-infected participants who relapsed after previous IFN-based therapy in Japan. The study
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of TMC435 by the percentage of participants with
      undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). Participants will receive 12 weeks of treatment with
      TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus PR followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with PR. TMC435 is
      a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally (via the mouth). Treatment with PR will last 24 or
      48 weeks. Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0 mL solution with 180 µg
      PegIFNα-2a and will be injected by a syringe under the skin once weekly. Ribavirin is given
      as 200-mg tablets (daily dose: 600-1000 mg), taken orally two times a day after meals. The
      participants will receive oral capsules of TMC435 (100 mg) once daily up to Week 12.
