      randomized via concealed envelopes into 2 groups (each included 75 patients), group I managed
      by direct surgery while group II managed by PBD followed by surgery. Both groups were
      compared regarding perioperative mortality, morbidities, tumor recurrence and 2 years
      survival rates.
