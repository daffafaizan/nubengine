    
      A total of 20 patients will be included. 10 patients with uveitis and 10 control patients
      scheduled for phacoemulsification. Each patient will undego complete ophthalmic examination
      and clinical biomicroscopic grading of the anterior chamber flare applying the SUN working
      group grading system. Aqueous specimens will be obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis for
      protein analysis. Each Patient will undego paracentesis and 0.2 ml of aqueous will be
      obtained. The aqueous sample will be stored at -70Â°C until the time of analysis for protein
      content. Objective assessment of flare will be done.
