    
      The aim of this pilot study is to examine the impact of H@W intervention(s) on job retention
      and return to work and compare outcomes with those from normal GP care. The target population
      for this study is people still at work but experiencing a work-related health problem as well
      as those off work. For the purpose of the study, short term sickness absence is defined as a
      period of 4 weeks or less and long term sickness absence defined as a period of 4 weeks or
      longer. Hypothesis

      That H@W intervention in comparison to standard care:

        -  promotes work retention

        -  enables a quick and sustained return to work for those on short term sick leave (4 weeks
           or less)

        -  achieves sustained return to work for those on long term sick leave of 4 weeks or more.
           This could include a phased return to work.

        -  achieves positive outcomes which could mean leaving one job and starting another.
