      mortality worldwide. Breastfed infants have been shown to have less cardiovascular risk
      factors in adulthood, which can be partially explained by their slower growth compared to
      formula fed infants. The primary objective of this study is to investigate if consumption of
      lower protein formula can slow the rate of weight gain of formula-fed infants between 3 and
      12 months of age. Secondary objectives include investigation into whether infant nutrition
      and growth have an impact on later risk of obesity and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), the critical windows for these programming effects, and the mechanisms of action.
