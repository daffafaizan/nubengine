      monitor. We are investigating whether the waveforms obtained from a near infrared
      spectroscopy device can predict what the intracranial pressure is non-invasively.

        -  Patients with intracranial hypertension who are intubated and ventilated in the ICU will
           be recruited

        -  we will record there intracranial pressure and systemic arterial pressure

        -  recordings from the near infrared device will be recorded and analysed off-line

        -  we will correlate the waveform tracings from near infrared spectroscopy and the arterial
           tracing
