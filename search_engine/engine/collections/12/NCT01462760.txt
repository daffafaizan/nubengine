      of autonomy and directly affects the quality of life of the individual.

      Support and appropriate rehabilitation for the patient's return home is essential. It
      requires physiotherapy assessment, which includes, among other things, a joint assessment
      with a measure passive range of motion.

      Physical therapists have different techniques to achieve these measures for each of them, the
      benefits (time, reliability) and disadvantages. Among them, the goniometer and inclinometer
      are technical references The main objective of the study is to validate the MotionPod and the
      software BioVal as valid tool for measuring range of motion of the elbow in a joint geriatric
      assessment.

      Secondary objectives are the study of the reproducibility of the measurement time and ease of
      use The measurement range of motion in the elbow in degree, estimated by actigraphy and
      software BioVal will be compared to those obtained with an inclinometer.

      The movements are examined successively flexion, extension, pronation and supination.

      The proportion of valid measurements will be calculated for each movement. The confidence
      interval 95% partner will also be calculated.

      Moreover, in order to judge the validity of actigraphy in all of these measures, the
      investigators will calculate the proportion of patients for which the measures are valid for
      all four movements and the confidence interval 95% partner.

      85 patients aged 65 years or more will be recruited at the Cimiez hospital the CHU of Nice,
      in the services of short, medium and long geriatric stay
