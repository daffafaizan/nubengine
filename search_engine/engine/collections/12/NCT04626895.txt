      diverse patient population with success measured as prevention of >grade 2 alopecia by
      self-report using the modified Dean scale or the VAS scale in >50% of participants using the
      intervention. We propose that scalp cooling has distinct efficacy in participants with black
      or ethnic-minority hair types due to differences in textures, hair thickness.

      The study aims include delivery of scalp cooling at each chemotherapy cycle with measurements
      of CIA at assigned intervals using patient self-report measured by the modified Dean scale
      and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) outlined below.

      The secondary aims are provider assessments of alopecia as measured by the NCI grading scale
      of alopecia, adverse effects of scalp cooling procedures such as headaches, dizziness, and
      pain, reasons for refusal or drop-out of study intervention.

      Psychosocial and quality-of- life (QOL) effects of CIA in study participants will be measured
      using patient reported outcomes. The EORTC QLQ-B45 and Chemotherapy-Induced-Alopecia-Distress
      Scale (CADS) will be administered at designated time intervals.
