      Primary

        -  Assess the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of neoadjuvant sorafenib tosylate and
           ifosfamide in patients with resectable high-grade soft tissue or bone sarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the long-term efficacy or impact of therapy in these patients, in terms of the
           duration of local recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, and
           disease-specific survival.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14
           in course 1. Patients then receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28 and
           ifosfamide IV continuously on days 1-7 in courses 2 and 3. Treatment repeats every 14-28
           days* for 3 courses.

      NOTE: *Course 1 is 14 days in duration; courses 2 and 3 are 28 days in duration.

        -  Surgery: At least 1 week after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo
           surgery.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning â‰¥ 3 weeks after surgery, patients who respond to neoadjuvant
           therapy receive oral sorafenib twice daily for 6 months. Patients also receive 2 courses
           of ifosfamide as in courses 2 and 3 of neoadjuvant therapy.
