      to confirm bioequivalence. Determination will be via measurement of drug concentrations in
      the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 288 hours post-patch application.
      Approximately 100 healthy male and female volunteers will receive both BTDS patches across
      two study periods with a 14-day wash-out between applications.

      Each patch will be worn for 7 consecutive days and the study will also review the adhesion of
      each patch to the skin of the subjects. The overall safety and tolerability of both patches
      will be assessed.
