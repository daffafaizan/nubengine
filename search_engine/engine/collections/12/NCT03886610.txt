      mechanisms caused by forces directly affecting the spinal cord and secondary mechanisms
      consisting of complex physiological processes after trauma.

      Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current standard to assess morphologic
      changes of the spinal cord after injury. However, conventional MRI provides little
      information regarding the health and integrity of the brain and spinal cord tissue itself,
      due to the fact that signal intensity changes are non-specific and do not correspond directly
      with physiological processes. This is reflected in the poor correlation of conventional MRI
      data with neurological and functional impairment in various spinal cord pathologies (such as
      multiple sclerosis compression myelopathy) and failure to provide reliable prognostic
      information.

      By applying a combination of diffusion weighted imaging, functional MRI and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy will give us a better understanding of the changes after injury of the
      cervical spinal cord, brainstem and brain. Correlating the imaging data with the neurological
      and clinical status of patients could improve the patient status prediction and therapy
      planning.

      This study is divided into three sub-projects:

      i) Reproducibility study of the MR measurements in healthy controls ii) Progression of MR
      biomarkers in subacute patients with SCI and comparison to chronic patients with SCI iii)
      Prediction of clinical outcome based on MR biomarkers
