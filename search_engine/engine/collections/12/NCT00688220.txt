      particles (1-1.2 micron diameter titanium dioxide, quarts and aluminum oxide particles) with
      modify absorption, reflection and transmission of light in the visible and near infrared
      portion of the spectrum. It is believed that the Celliant particles increase skin
      illumination such taht cytochrome pigments and other enzymes are activated, leading to
      increased blood flow and oxygenation of the skin and neighboring soft tissues. In addition,
      numerous anecdotal reports from patients with chronic foot and arm pain indicate that wearing
      Celliant garments for even a few days leads to dramatic improvement in many different painful
      conditions. This is a single center, stratified, randomized, prospective, double-blind study.
      Questionnaires that subjects will be asked complete are 1) Visual Analog Scale, 2) Brief Pain
      Inventory, 3) McGill Short Form Pain Survey and 4) SF-36 Quality of Life Inventory.
