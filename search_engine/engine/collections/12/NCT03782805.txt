      of the markers of type 2 diabetes is low-grade inflammation, which can be the result of an
      elevated circulation of cytokines. High amounts of circulating inflammatory cytokines such as
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contribute significantly to
      insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissues. The aim of this randomized, controlled,
      double blind study is to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on some inflammatory
      markers in older Lebanese patients having type 2 diabetes.
