    
      This randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study will assess
      the safety and efficacy of rhNRG-1 also known as Neucardin as a treatment for stable chronic
      heart failure.

      A total of 120 subjects, who have chronic heart failure with a NYHA classification of II or
      III, and are on a stable regimen of ACEI/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), beta-blocker,
      and/or diuretic for at least 3 months prior to receiving study medication and anticipated to
      remain on the stable regimen through the treatment period can enroll as per specific
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Subjects will be hospitalized for 10 days during the treatment period and will be infused
      subcutaneously with rhNRG-1 or placebo.
