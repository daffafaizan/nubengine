      nerve disease.

      As many peripheral nerves run a superficial course, especially in the arms. This is a big
      advantage over Magnetic Resonance Imaging that is relatively expensive, time consuming and
      not readily available everywhere.

      Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) can be determined at multiple sites along the nerve.

      CSA can be measured at entrapment sites but also at nonentrapment sites. vascularization,
      echogenicity, fascicular pattern and endoneurial thickness can be investigated as well. All
      those modalities can give critical insight in the origin and development of various
      peripheral neuropathies1,2,3

      Major peripheral nerves in the extremities, such as the median,ulnar thick enough to reflect
      the sound beam, resulting in hyperechoic on the US scan 4.

      The correlation between nerve conduction study parameters and CSA in ultrasound Ultrasound of
      the peripheral nervous system is an additional useful diagnostic tool in neuromuscular
      disorders..5,6,7,8,9 In the longitudinal plane, nerves present as long, slim structures with
      a mixture of parallel hypoechoic and hyperechoic lines.

      Nerves must be distinguished from other nearby structures to ensure correct identification
      Muscles are hypoechoic and interspersed with small hyperechoic foci which easily
      distinguishes muscles from nerves. Tendons, which are sometimes adjacent to nerves, move
      proportionately with joint movement.

      US has higher specificity than sensitivity in differentiating myopathic and neuropathic
      changes The most sensitive diagnostic marker for symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome patients
      is an enlarged crosssectional area of the median nerve 10,11,12
