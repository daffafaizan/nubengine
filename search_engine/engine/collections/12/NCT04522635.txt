      AIM 1: Can the utilization of intravenous albumin enhance the efficacy of fluid removal in
      hospitalized patients undergoing dialysis for AKI or ESRD.

      The hypothesis to be tested:

        1. Addition of albumin solutions to dialysis therapy will enhance the efficacy of fluid
           removal (total amount of fluid removed)

        2. Albumin solutions will improve the efficiency of fluid removal by dialysis per unit time

        3. Albumin addition will reduce the time to achieving and maintaining fluid balance and
           correcting fluid overload.

      AIM 2: Can the utilization of IV albumin improve the safety of fluid removal during dialysis?

      The hypothesis to be tested:

        1. Addition of albumin solutions will reduce the frequency of Intradialytic hypotension
           associated with fluid removal on dialysis.

        2. Albumin solutions given during dialysis will reduce the incidence and magnitude of
           myocardial stunning associated with fluid removal on dialysis

        3. Albumin solutions given during dialysis will reduce post-dialysis symptoms AIM 3: Does
           utilization of IV albumin improve the microcirculation in hospitalized patients
           undergoing fluid removal with dialysis?

      The hypothesis to be tested:

        1. Patients with AKI or ESRD will have deranged microcirculatory profile as compared to
           normal

        2. During fluid removal with dialysis changes in microcirculation correlate with
           alterations in hemodynamics related to the rate and amount of fluid removal

        3. Utilization of IV albumin during dialysis will reduce the microcirculatory stress of
           fluid removal
