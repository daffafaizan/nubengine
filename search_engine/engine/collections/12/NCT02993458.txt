      dietary patterns and two levels of sodium intake on blood pressure and blood lipids in
      adolescents in the upper third of distribution for blood pressure. The study also assesses
      whether influences on blood pressure and blood lipids of dietary interventions vary according
      to sex, race/ethnic groups, baseline levels, and other personal characteristics. The proposed
      dietary interventions of DASH dietary patterns and sodium reduction have been shown to be
      effective in lowering blood pressure in adults. The two dietary patterns are based on the
      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial in adults. They are a Usual diet typical
      of what many American adolescents eat, and a DASH-type diet. The DASH diet is rich in fruits,
      vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and low in saturated fat and total fat compared to the
      Usual diet. The two sodium levels are High reflecting current US consumption and Low
      reflecting current recommended intake levels. Weight will be held constant by adjusting
      energy intake. The study participants will live in a residence hall on the Purdue campus
      where all food and beverages will be provided, and meals and snacks will be supervised.
