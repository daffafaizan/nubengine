      Protocol as a means to improve neurocognitive functioning in recently detoxified alcohol
      dependent subjects. For many alcohol dependent patients entering treatment, a range of
      neurocognitive deficits are present that not only had adverse effects on the patient's
      ability to function and think clearly but these deficits also impair the process of addiction
      treatment. For example, alcohol dependent subjects typically experience high levels of
      alcohol craving in the early stages of treatment. The patient is left with the choice of
      relieving craving by drinking alcohol to provide immediate relief of craving symptoms or
      abstaining from alcohol to obtain long-term benefits from recovery of the complications from
      excessive drinking. We have previously shown in open label trials that the PROMETA速 Treatment
      Protocol helps stimulant abusers in the early stages of recovery, have relatively low rates
      of relapse to stimulant use. It is not clear if the Protocol is effective because of less
      urges to use stimulants or the ability to resist these urges is improved from a recovery of
      Neurocognitive functioning. The present proposal extends our previous research by comparing
      the efficacy of the PROMETA速 Treatment Protocol in a double blind placebo controlled trial
      using a new population of substance abusers (alcohol dependent subjects) and assessing the
      effects of the PROMETA速 Treatment Protocol on neurocognitive functioning, particularly those
      aspects of functioning that affect the ability to make decisions that have important
      long-term benefits.
