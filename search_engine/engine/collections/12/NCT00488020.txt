      the cell therapy lab this blood is harvested and mononuclear cells are separated.This
      procedure takes roughly 4 hours.After dilution in albumin (40cc)the mononuclear cells are
      injected into the calf muscles through 40 shots.This procedure is indicated for patients with
      lower limb ischemia on whom all the others known therapies have failed
