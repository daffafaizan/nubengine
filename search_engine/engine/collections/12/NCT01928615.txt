      weeks (Cycles 1-6). They first received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg once (Cycle 1) followed by
      trastuzumab 6 mg/kg 5 times for 15 weeks (Cycles 2-6). Participants could also receive a
      maximum of 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy for early breast cancer (neo-adjuvant or
      adjuvant) in the run-in phase.

      Following the run-in phase, participants were randomized to receive trastuzumab 600 mg
      subcutaneously every 3 weeks in the thigh and upper arm in a cross-over design for a total of
      24 weeks (Cycles 7-14). They received trastuzumab either in the thigh first for 4 cycles
      (Cycles 7-10) followed by trastuzumab in the upper arm for 4 cycles (Cycles 11-14) or the
      upper arm first (Cycles 7-10) followed by the thigh (Cycles 11-14). For Cycles 15-18,
      participants could choose the injection site for trastuzumab 600 mg subcutaneously every 3
      weeks.
