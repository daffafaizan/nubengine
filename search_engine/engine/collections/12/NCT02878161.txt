      demonstrated an outstanding performance in relieving joint inflammation and retarding bone
      erosion involved in RA. However, there is still about one-thirds of RA patients had a poor
      response to TNF α inhibitors. Currently the personalized biological treatment is the research
      hotspot. Recent studies focuses on exploring biomarkers predictive of drug response. The
      research methods such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and
      immunocytology, have been applied,but they are not successfully integrated. The related
      studies in China are still at an initial stage, which necessitates an in-depth study in this
      area. The investigators' preliminary study showed that TNF-α-308 gene polymorphisms existed
      in Chinese RA patients and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signal pathway was activated in
      proliferated synovial fibroblasts stimulated by TNF-α. Therefore, for the first attempt in
      China, the investigators intend to screen for differential proteins by using isobaric tags
      for relative and absolute quantitation(iTRAQ) technique in RA patients receiving anti-TNF-α
      therapy, and then verify the predictive effects of selected differential proteins from the
      upstream gene polymorphism to the downstream protein expression. The investigators will also
      explore the mechanisms of differential proteins involved in TNF-α related signal pathway by
      using in vitro gene transfer, siRNA interference, and RA animal models. Through this study
      investigator hope to discover some prediction proteins with a domestic genetic background and
      finally establish a prediction system with Chinese characteristics.
