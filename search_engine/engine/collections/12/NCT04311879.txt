      received soft tissue laser therapy after root canal treatment and the other group received no
      treatment just conventional RCT. â€¢ Patients were equally divided into 2 groups (n=12 in each
      group ) The study in a Single blinded RCT , Numbers for patients will be generated and
      distributed randomly in a table on an Excel sheet, and in front of each number either a
      letter (C) for control or (I) for intervention will be typed After patients were selected in
      the study they will be asked to fill in a consent form , that states that they are part of a
      clinical trial and that they may or may not have a laser session following root canal
      treatment Group A Soft tissue laser application : Endodontically treated teeth were targeted
      by virtue of a dental applicator positioned at a right angle to the mucosa at the level of
      the apices. Application of the laser probe were applied to both the buccal and lingual
      mucosae overlying the apices of the target tooth. Total exposure time for each tooth was 60
      seconds (a dose = 70 j/cm2 for analgesia) by the co-investigator The laser unit used in this
      study will be a diode laser (Lite Medics 1.00 Watt serial number 148 Ver.SwvM.
      150VS108VT.100) of wavelength 980nm and Max power 15 WCW Class IV Laser Product ) in
      continuous wave mode Group B : Placebo : conventional root canal treatment : mock laser
      intervention A CBCT was taken preoperative and after 12 month postoperative, both linear and
      volumetric measurements were calculated
