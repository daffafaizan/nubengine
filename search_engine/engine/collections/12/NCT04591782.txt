      apparently healthy normal weight and prediabetic overweight and obese subjects. Participants
      will be asked to consume one serving of PJ, sugar mix and water separated by one week of
      beige diet without PJ consumption (crossover design). The PJ will be provided by
      POMWonderful. Timed blood collections over a three-hour period following the
      juice/sugar/water consumption will be used to measure how PJ vs. sugar mix vs. water affects
      glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity in human subjects.
