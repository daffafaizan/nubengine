    
      This study is a phase 1/2a, single arm study with main purpose to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of BSG-001 in subjects with cancer that causes an abnormal amount
      of fluid to collect between the thin layers of tissue (pleura) lining the outside of the lung
      and the wall of the chest cavity, namely malignant pleural effusion and/ or subjects with
      cancer that causes the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, causing abdominal
      swelling, namely malignant ascites.

      The study aims to recruit 9 - 18 subjects in phase 1, and once the safety, tolerability and
      the preliminary efficacy of BSG-001 reach an optimal target exposure for recommended dose
      (RD), phase 2a will be opened for enrolment of approximately 40 subjects.
