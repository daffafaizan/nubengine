      The project headquarters in the Portland Oregon Veterans Affairs Medical Center will be
      tasked with the development of the workshops and writing of a Curriculum and Procedures
      Manual. The Atlanta VAMC research collaborators enrolled the 13 Veterans. Staff turnover
      reduced time available for enrollment and data collection. We therefore eliminated the
      original comparison group design and this study had only one experimental intervention arm
      and no control intervention or other arm. Veterans were chronologically enrolled who
      responded to recruitment letters and who passed telephone and onsite screening. The
      intervention consisted of six weekly two hour workshops providing information, skills
      training and exercises about self-managing DSL effects on daily life. Preliminary
      effectiveness data was collected and analyzed, and a large scale clinical trial will be
      proposed as a followup to explore the efficacy of this management approach. This study data
      tracked pre and post intervention within subject changes.
