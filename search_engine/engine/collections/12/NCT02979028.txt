      or indirectly affect the prognosis of the patients, resulting in patients with delayed
      recovery and increase the hospitalization time and cost. Serious complications can lead to
      patients deaths during perioperative period. It has been proved that the electroacupuncture
      application during perioperative period can reduce the dosage of anesthetic drugs, and has a
      good effect on the protection of the heart and brain. At the same time, the
      electroacupuncture can also regulate the body's immune function, reduce allergy, reduce
      postoperative pain and so on.Compared with acupuncture, transcutaneous electric acupoint
      stimulation (TEAS) is a noninvasive technique that has similar effects to acupuncture. The
      investigators hypothesize that TEAS before anesthesia and during surgery would decrease the
      morbidity and mortality of postoperative complications in 30 days after artificial joint
      replacement surgery.
