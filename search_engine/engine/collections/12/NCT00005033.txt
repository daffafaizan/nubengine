        -  Determine the response rate, freedom from progression, and survival of patients with
           recurrent osteosarcoma when treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin).

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this drug in young patients with a history of osteosarcoma and
           prior therapy with doxorubicin.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly. Treatment continues
      for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      approximately 12 weeks of treatment, patients are evaluated for response and undergo surgical
      resection if clinically appropriate.

      Patients are followed for 1 year for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2
      years.
