      study and accepted the optimized therapy (add on ADV or switch to LDT) for 48weeks. All these
      patients were followed for 48 weeks and the HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA level were
      observed. Safety and the economic effect of the two optimized therapy methods also were
      observed.
