      pain (SSP). Guidelines suggest active rehabilitation program for at least three months and
      existing research highlights the importance of progressive loaded exercise therapy at higher
      dosage. However, it is not clear which is the best type of exercise and if pain should be
      provoked during exercise. Recent research found that painful exercises are beneficial in
      short term on pain and function in patients with different kinds of chronic musculoskeletal
      pain. The aim of the future randomized clinical trial is to investigate if "exercising into
      pain" gives better results in term of clinical outcomes compared to a non-painful exercise
      program. Since the intervention consists in painful exercises, it is essential to test the
      rate of adherence in the intervention group (both during physiotherapist-led session and
      home-based exercises). Moreover, the practicability of clinical questionnaire via online
      survey will be tested and the time needed to collect clinical data will be calculated as
      well. Furthermore, feedback from physiotherapists and participants will be collected and
      analyzed.
