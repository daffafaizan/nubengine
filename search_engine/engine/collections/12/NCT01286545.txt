      et al.Lancet 2007, 369:1379-90). Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      is the cornerstone of the treatment of the disease and is widely used to suppress
      inflammation and ameliorate spinal pain (Zochling et al.:Ann Rheum Dis 2006, 65:442-52).
      There is evidence that antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is highly effective in SpA,
      especially in AS and psoriatic arthritis. Thus, TNF blockers may even be considered as first
      line treatment in a patient with active AS whose condition is not sufficiently controlled
      with NSAIDs in the case of axial disease, and sulfasalazine or methotrexate in the case of
      peripheral arthritis (Zochling et al.:Ann Rheum Dis 2006, 65:442-52). Long-term data on
      anti-TNF therapy in patients with AS are rather limited. Infliximab in a dosage of 5mg/kg was
      shown to be efficacious over 5 years, including a short period of withdrawal and
      readministration (Baraliakos et al.:Arthritis Res Ther 2005, 7: R439-44; Baraliakos et al.:J
      Rheumatol 2007, 34: 510-5; Braun J et al: Ann Rheum Dis 2008, 67: 340-5). In our EASIC study
      the investigators have also shown the efficacy and safety of infliximab treatment in patients
      with AS over 5 years. Long term data for the treatment of AS with etanercept has proven the
      efficacy as well (Dijkmans B et al.:J Rheumatol 2009, 36: 1256-64). But long term data for
      efficacy and safety of treatment with anti-TNF therapy beyond a time period of 5 years is
      lacking. These data on long term treatment are essential for several reasons. At first
      patients with AS are predominantly of younger age. When taking into account that withdrawal
      of anti-TNF therapy leads to disease relapse in a very high proportion of patients , anti-TNF
      therapy in AS patients is most often designed as a continuous therapy on a long term basis.
      The second reason for the need of long term data beyond 5 years is the ongoing debate whether
      anti-TNF agents have the potential to inhibit radiographic progression (Baraliakos X et
      al.:Ann Rheum Dis 2005, 64:1462-6; van der heijde D et al:Arthritis Rheum 2008, 58: 3063-70).
      Radiographic data on a larger cohort of patients treated with infliximab or other anti-TNF
      blockers for a long time period could contribute to answer this important question.
