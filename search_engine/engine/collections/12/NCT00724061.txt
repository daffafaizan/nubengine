      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive UV light
      therapy (either PUVA or NB-UVB).

      Health-related quality of life is assessed periodically using the FACT-BRM, FACT-G, and
      FACT-CTCL questionnaires.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 1 year.
