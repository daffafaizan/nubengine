      Half of the group will receive additional trainings on person-centered care (PCC) principles
      and respectful care while the other half of the group will not receive this additional
      training. Women working with both the control ASHAs (FP trained) and Interventions ASHAs
      (FP+PCC trained) will be surveyed following their interactions with the ASHA to understand
      the quality of their experience with the ASHA and whether the woman has taken up a FP method
      of her choice following interaction with the ASHA.
