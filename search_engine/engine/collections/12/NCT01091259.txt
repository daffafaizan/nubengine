      development of a number of solid tumors including ovarian cancer. For women with ovarian
      cancer, a direct relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression
      and tumor vascularity has been documented. In vivo and in vitro data has demonstrated that
      increased angiogenesis and microvessel density are negative prognostic factors for women with
      ovarian cancer. These observations have fueled interest in incorporating anti-angiogenic
      agents into ovarian cancer treatment regimens.

      Several phase II trials of irinotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer showed that
      the drug had efficacy in both chemotherapy-na√Øve patients and in those who had been
      previously treated with standard therapies, including platinum-based compounds, radiation, or
      both. Combination of bevacizumab, an antibody against VEGF, and irinotecan was studied in
      colorectal cancer and malignant brain neoplasms. In these trials, the combination was shown
      to be safe and effective.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan in the
      treatment of women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer when
      combined with bevacizumab. In this phase II open-label study patients will be treated with
      bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and irinotecan 175mg/m^2 every 3 weeks. Patients will undergo
      pre-treatment evaluation within 4 weeks of enrolling into the study. Clinical and laboratory
      evaluation will be performed every 3 weeks. Imaging studies and CA-125 measurements will be
      used to assess response to treatment.
