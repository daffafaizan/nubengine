      disease, which is, however, related to a significant development of postoperative
      complications. Evidence has been gathered for other surgical procedures about improved
      outcome after early rehabilitation programs (fast track surgery), preoperative smoking and
      alcohol cessation programs, respectively. Hitherto, no studies have been published concerning
      a combined program of the preoperative prevention programs and fast track surgery.

      Aim: The aim is to evaluate the outcome after spine surgery when using an integrated program
      that combined preoperative prevention and early postoperative rehabilitation compared to the
      routine procedures.

      Outcome measurements: Postoperative hospital stay, complications, function, pain, and patient
      satisfaction.

      Method: 60 patients scheduled for surgery for degenerative lumbar disease were
      computer-randomized to intervention. The control group followed the routines in the
      department. The intervention group followed the integrated program consisting of preoperative
      prevention, which began 2 months prior to the operation: an exercise program designed to
      strengthen the muscles of the spine, and optimization of the analgetic treatment. Smokers and
      harmful drinkers were offered cessation intervention. The day before surgery all had enteral
      protein supplement.

      Early postoperative rehabilitation included balanced pain therapy, including
      self-administered epidural analgesia, intensified mobilization immediately after surgery and
      enteral protein supplement.
