      thyroidectomy. In this retrospective, observational, multicentre study, the investigators
      evaluated the quality of life using the SF-36 survey in comparison with a control population
      of patients thyroidectomized but free from this complication. Patients in six centers in
      France (Angers, Le Mans, Limoges, Nancy, Nantes, la Pitié-Salpétrière) and in the association
      "Hypoparathyroïdisme France" were contacted by mail. The primary endpoint was the mental
      health. The physic and global quality of life scores were assessed as secondary endpoints.
      Medical and VHI surveys were also send to the patients. The voice quality, the cardiovascular
      risk, the kidney function and the incidence of urinary lithiasis were also evaluated.
