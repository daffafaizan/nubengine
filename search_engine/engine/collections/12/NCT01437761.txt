      gallons of dialysate for a treatment because it can turn used dialysate into fresh dialysate
      again by filtering it through a special cleaning cartridge (called a "sorbent"). This new
      machine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to clean the blood of patients
      whose kidneys have failed.

      This study will compare the degree of blood cleansing achieved with the new 2008 Sorbent
      System using two different speeds at which the dialysate runs through the dialysis machine.
      This will tell us if the faster speed really does provide better cleaning (and how much) with
      this new machine.

      How well the blood of a patient is cleaned by this procedure is determined by several
      factors. For example, longer treatment times generally provide better blood cleansing. Higher
      speeds at which the cleaning fluid runs through the artificial kidney do, too.

      Since the 2008 Sorbent System is a new machine (and in some ways different from standard
      hemodialysis machines), other aspects may be different, too, between the 2008 Sorbent System
      and regular hemodialysis machines. Specifically, this study looks at how well this new
      machine corrects the patients' acid-base status (a common requirement in these patients),
      what effect the treatment has on inflammation in the patients' blood, how the levels of
      important substances in the blood are influenced (acetate, sulfate, nitrate, carbon dioxide),
      and if cleaning fluid in the 2008 Sorbent System contains any substances that are not found
      in the cleaning fluid used by regular hemodialysis machines.
