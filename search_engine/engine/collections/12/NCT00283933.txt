      consisted of a 4-week screening period, during which participants' galactosidase (GLA)
      genotype was assessed for α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in response to migalastat.
      Participants were required to have α-Gal A activity responsive to migalastat. The study
      consisted of a 24-week treatment period, followed by an optional 24-week extension period.
      Participants received migalastat once every other day (QOD) for 24 weeks during the treatment
      period and the optional 24-week extension for a total treatment duration of up to 48 weeks.
