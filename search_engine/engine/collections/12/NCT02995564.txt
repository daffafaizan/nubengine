    
      During group study visits, a group of six young adults with Asperger's Syndrome or
      high-functioning autism will meet weekly for about 90 minutes. The purpose of the group
      sessions is to work on everyday social skills such as initiating and maintaining
      conversations, establishing friendships, and dealing with situations such as job interviews
      and dating.

      A generalization session will be held every week after the group therapy session with
      same-age peers who have been screened to participate in the study. The purpose of including
      peers in the class is to give young adults with Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning
      autism a chance to practice the social skills learned in the group study visit with a peer
      group. Study participants will be paired with a typically developing peer for an outing in
      the community to a nearby restaurant or shop or an in-class exercise such as a mock job
      interview.
