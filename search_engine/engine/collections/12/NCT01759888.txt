      Subjects will be evaluated sequentially with 18F-DTBZ during a 36 month period. 18F-DTBZ PET
      scans will be performed twice, at baseline, and 24 (21~27) months following the start of
      their participation in the study. Subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of
      approximately 10 mCi 18F-DTBZ immediately prior to imaging. Whitney test will be used to
      compare the mean standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) values between groups. The decline rate
      of VMAT2 density will be calculated by comparing the SUVRs of age-matched healthy subjects
      from our previous studies. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3
      visits in each scan (total 6 visits in this study), as one screening visit, one imaging
      visit, and one safety evaluation visit.

      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.
