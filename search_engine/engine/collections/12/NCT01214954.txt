      and functional performance. There is a lack of evidence concerning the effectiveness of
      postoperative physiotherapy and training, however a few small studies have shown promising
      effect of resistance training.

      The present study will provide new and important knowledge concerning the effect of different
      rehabilitation strategies after THR. This might lead to a change in the rehabilitation
      regimes and faster and better recovery after THR surgery.
