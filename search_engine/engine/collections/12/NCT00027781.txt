        -  Assess the activity of MEN-10755 in patients with progressive hormone-refractory
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the rate and duration of objective PSA response in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Beginning within 2 weeks after the last PSA measurement, patients receive MEN-10755 IV over
      30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete or partial
      response continue to receive additional courses. Patients who achieve stable disease may
      receive more than 4 courses at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of a new therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
