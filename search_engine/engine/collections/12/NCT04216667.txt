    
      The Posterior Wall and/or Left Atrial Appendage Empiric Electrical Isolation for
      Non-Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (The PLEA Trial) is a prospective multicenter randomized
      controlled study that has the overall goal of establishing the efficacy and safety of
      different ablation techniques for patients with persistent and long-standing persistent
      atrial fibrillation. The PLEA trial is designed to test the hypothesis whether posterior wall
      isolation (PWI) with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), PWI plus left atrial appendage
      electrical isolation (LAAEI) with PVI and PWI plus LAAEI plus coronary sinus isolation (CSI)
      with PVI is superior to the standard approach alone (i.e. PVI alone) in decreasing the
      incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-atrial arrhythmia
      recurrences.
