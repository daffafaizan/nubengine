      to receive either the standard paper based instructions or receive an educational video in
      addition to the standard paper based instruction. Physicians performing the procedure were
      blinded to this assignment. The investigators obtained information relating to the
      cleanliness of the colon as noted during the colonoscopy examination. The investigators
      obtained this information from the colonoscopy reports. The investigators also obtained
      information regarding colon polyps,wanting to see if there is any difference in the number of
      patients in whom adenomatous polyps were detected.
