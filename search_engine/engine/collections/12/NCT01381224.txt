      biomechanics parameters; walking pattern, lumbar flexibility and balance. The surveys will
      help assess the patient's sense of functional ability and feeling of wellness compared with
      low back pain scores. The long terms goals of this project will be to elucidate the mechanism
      of action of injections and to improve identification of patients that are likely to benefit
      from injection therapy
