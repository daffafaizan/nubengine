      accelerated with the use of microneedle pretreatment. The study will evaluate the anesthesia
      as a randomized split-body study where each subject serves as their own control. The study
      will be performed on the volar forearm. Prior to application of the topical 4% lidocaine, one
      arm will be exposed to a microneedle pretreatment on a microneedle roller and the other arm
      will be exposed to sham microneedle treatment that will consist of a flat roller with no
      microneedles. Then pain will be assessed with the use of a spring loaded needle lancet that
      will be applied at 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 30 minutes after treatment.
