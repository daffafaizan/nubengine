      loading device).Before using threshold loading device, we will measure the relevant
      parameters of lung volume, respiratory flow,diaphragm electromyogram, central drive
      mechanical and other baseline index.Then incremental inspiratory load will be applied to
      investigate the effects of inspiratory load on the above mentioned respiratory mechanics
      parameters.
