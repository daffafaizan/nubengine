      complication of drug therapy. Until now it is very challenging to predict occurrence,
      severity and outcome of DILI. Previous data provide evidence that cells from peripheral blood
      may reflect hepatocellular damage (Fannin RD, Hepatology. 2010). Own research could show that
      peripheral monocytes are capable to obtain several hepatocyte-like functions while
      maintaining individual characteristics of the donor, especially cytochrome P450 metabolism
      (Benesic, Gerbes, et al, Lab Invest 2012). This study investigates the effects of potentially
      hepatotoxic drugs on cells generated from patient blood in comparison to the clinical
      presentation. Its aim is the evaluation of in vitro tests using monocyte derived cells for
      diagnosis and exclusion of DILI and the potential to use the patient derived-cells for
      mechanistic investigations of DILI. 4 groups are investigated: 1) donors without liver
      disease 2) patients who will start a therapy with DILI-potential; 3) DILI patients; 4)
      patients with liver injuries other than DILI.

      Patient history and clinical data are obtained and a single blood sample will be collected
      after informed consent.
