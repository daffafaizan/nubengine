      is now considered as a potentially non-pharmacologic intervention and supplementation of
      functional food may positively affect cognitive function for patients with AD. However, there
      are few existing studies involving the role of mixed functional foods with multiple
      compositions on cognition and neuroimaging biomarkers for subjective cognitive decline (SCD).

      Sixty participants with SCD will be recruited in this three-month, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. Each group had thirty participants. Participants in the functional
      food group will take mixed functional foods for three months and those in the placebo group
      will take placebo. After that, the investigators will investigate the changes of memory
      measures, which is the primary outcome. Furthermore, based on the neuroimaging technique of
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the regulatory mechanism of mixed functional
      foods in intervening SCD will be revealed from the perspective of altered brain functional
      activity.

      In conclusion, these results are beneficial for understanding the therapeutic effect of mixed
      functional foods as a non-drug therapy for preclinical AD and further elucidating the
      potential brain mechanism, which are of great values in solving scientific and clinical
      practice issues.
