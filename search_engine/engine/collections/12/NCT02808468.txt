      stress disorder (PTSD) or alcohol use disorders (AUD), and development of these disorders is
      costly to both the victim and society as a whole. Intervening early, in the initial weeks
      following sexual assault, can provide victims with coping strategies that can decrease the
      likelihood of developing chronic symptoms. Cognitive approaches for treating symptoms of PTSD
      have strong empirical support with chronic presentation of symptoms. Less is known about
      effective strategies for intervening acutely following sexual assault. This project is
      designed to adapt existing empirically supported cognitive treatment principles for both PTSD
      and AUD symptoms to be delivered acutely (within 10 weeks of assault) in a brief one session
      format followed by 4 weekly coaching calls. The first 6 participants enrolled will receive
      the intervention and provide us with feedback on strengths and weaknesses of the protocol to
      help us improve it (Open Trial). In the next phase, the pilot testing phase, the study will
      enroll 38 women to complete the one session intervention followed by 4 once per week coaching
      calls. Participants will then be assessed again for symptoms of PTSD and alcohol use behavior
      at 3 month follow-up. This brief intervention group will be compared at the 3 month follow-up
      to a group of 38 women who receive weekly symptom monitoring only. Thus, this research aims
      to provide information on the efficacy of the intervention compared to the natural recovery
      process. This research is significant in its potential to use a very brief and easy to access
      treatment to decrease the development of chronic psychopathology in a high risk group of
      women.
