      disturbances negatively impact outcomes in this population by contributing to metabolic
      dysfunction, reducing quality of life, and impairing psychosocial functioning. Additionally,
      in HIV depressed populations, insomnia may hinder remission from clinical depression. To
      date, there have been no pharmacotherapeutic studies treating insomnia in this population,
      emphasizing the need to determine whether known hypnotic medications work as effectively in
      HIV positive patients, including those with comorbid depression. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics
      represent an attractive pharmacotherapy for treatment of insomnia in a depressed population,
      as there are reduced side effects and abuse potential compared to classical benzodiazepines.
      Consequently, an open-label study evaluating zaleplon for insomnia in HIV positive patients
      with comorbid depression warrants further study.
