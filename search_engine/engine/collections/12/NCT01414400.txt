      18.0%. However, infectious complications of cholangitis/sepsis occur in only 0.5%- 3.0% of
      patients undergoing this procedure. The Spyglass Direct Visualization System allows
      cholangioscopy with direct visualization of the bile duct during ERCP by using a specialized
      small caliber endoscope. During the Spyglass portion of the procedure, saline is introduced
      into the bile duct to to irrigate the biliary system, in order to distend the biliary ducts
      and to improve visualization by clearing contrast, pus and stone debris. Saline irrigation
      may increase intrabiliary pressures and may therefore theoretically increase the risk for
      bacteremia and infection.

      The effect of Spyglass cholangioscopy and biliary irrigation on the frequency of
      bacteremia/post cholangioscopy infections is unknown and has not previously been studied.

      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the frequency of bacteremia after
      ERCP/cholangioscopy using the Spyglass system.
