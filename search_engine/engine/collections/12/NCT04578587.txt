      consent underwent a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. Two
      raters assessed isometric strength of lumbar flexor and extensor muscles, by a hand-held
      dynamometer. Strength was measured and recorded by each of the two raters and re-assessed
      after a week.
