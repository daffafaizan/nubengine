      the index lesion is the foundation of surveillance. Detection of other medical conditions is
      a secondary benefit. Psychologically, follow up testing can serve as a source of reassurance.
      Whether an increased frequency of follow up and the use of various expensive imaging
      modalities for screening and early detection of recurrence actually results in improving
      overall survival of patients with extremity sarcomas is a question that remains as yet
      unanswered. Currently followed post -operative surveillance regimes are empirical and vary
      widely from centre to centre. Allocation of limited health funding should be guided by
      evidence based recommendations rather than empirical beliefs. An ideal surveillance regime
      should meet the criteria of easy implementation, accuracy and cost effectiveness.

      In a vast country like India where patients often travel thousands of kilometers in their
      search for quality medical care the frequency of routine follow up visits is as important as
      studying the role of expensive screening modalities while drawing up guidelines for cost
      effective follow up strategies.

      This study, a prospective randomized controlled trial, attempts to outline guidelines
      regarding the role of follow up vis a vis frequency and the use of various imaging modalities
      for early detection of recurrence in improving overall survival of patients with extremity
      sarcomas.
