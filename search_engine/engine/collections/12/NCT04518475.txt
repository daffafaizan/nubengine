      combining rituximab treating previously treated ITP patients compared to eltrombopag. The
      secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of eltrombopag combining rituximab in ITP
      patients with positive autoantibody compared to eltrombopag .In addition, health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL) measure was assessed in all participants.

      224 eligible subjects were randomized to either eltrombopag combining rituximab or
      eltrombopag treatment in 1:1 ratio. 112 enrolled patients are randomly picked up to take
      eltrombopag combining with rituximab at the indicated dose. 112 enrolled patients are
      randomly picked up to take eltrombopag at the indicated dose.

      The initial dose of eltrombopag administration was an oral 75 mg once daily in all
      participants .The dose of eltrombopag was adjusted according to the subject platelet count
      during the period from week 1 to week 24.

      Subjects in eltrombopag combining rituximab treatment group received single dose infusion of
      rituximab 375 mg/m(2) within 14 days after enrollment.
