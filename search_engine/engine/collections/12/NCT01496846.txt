      mandibular molars, either by IANB administration of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine
      (NDA 022466), or in case the IANB appeared to be clinically unsuccessful by supplemental
      infiltration of either articaine or lidocaine.

      The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to answer the following questions:

        1. What is the success rate of an IANB with articaine using a conventional IANB technique
           and standardized speed of administration?

        2. Is there a difference in complete pulpal anesthetic efficacy using supplemental
           infiltration with either articaine or lidocaine after an unsuccessful articaine IANB?

        3. Is there a difference in first or second molars in achieving complete pulpal anesthesia
           using supplemental infiltration with either articaine or lidocaine?

      This study will combine the data from HUM00049692- Articaine Efficacy in Inflamed Molars to
      create a larger sample size, giving a total sample size of approximately 200 patients.
