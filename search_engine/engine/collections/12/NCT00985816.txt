      intestinal motility when compared with infants receiving placebo. Primary Objective Evaluate
      the effects of L. reuteri in the intestinal motility by measuring the gastric emptying rate
      in infants before and after 21 consecutive days of administration of L. reuteri.

      Secondary Objectives 1. Mechanisms of action of L. reuteri - L.reuteri impact in the host
      immune response by determining fecal cytokines, sIgA and calprotectin before and after 21
      days of administration - L.reuteri rate of colonization after its administration.

      2. Efficacy and safety of L. reuteri to premature infants - Clinical beneficial effects
      secondary to the administration of L. reuteri to premature infants. The following clinical
      outcomes will be identified and compared between groups:

        -  Number of gastrointestinal symptoms (regurgitation, vomiting, stasis)

        -  Days to full feeds. Number of days to reach full feeds defined as > 120cc/kg/day) x2
           days or more.

        -  Days on parenteral nutrition

        -  Weight gain defined as the number of days needed to reach 150% of birth weight

        -  Length of hospital stay

        -  Any possible side effects and adverse events secondary to the administration of L.
           reuteri to premature infants.

        -  Incidence of late onset sepsis.

        -  Incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis categorized by Bell's classification

        -  Use of antibiotics (number of days on antibiotics during the hospital stay)

        -  Mortality (at 28 days after birth and at hospital discharge).
