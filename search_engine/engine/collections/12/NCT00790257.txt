      side effects in islets transplantation as well as whole pancreas transplantation. Several
      complications are associated with the administration of standard immunosuppressive agents
      (based on use of Sirolimus and Tacrolimus for example) used for human islets
      allotransplantation.

      The herein presented protocol is a Phase 1 pilot study. This will be a single center clinical
      study. Study will be divided in 2 Phases.

        -  Phase 1A: T1DM patients, already transplanted with an organ (kidney, heart, liver or
           totally unfunctioning primary whole vascularized pancreas) and under immunosuppression,
           will receive the "Monolayer Cellular Device" in subcutaneous tissue in view to assess
           the capacity of encapsulated human islets to secrete insulin without immunological
           reaction.

        -  Phase 1B: T1DM patients will receive the "Monolayer Cellular Device" in subcutaneous
           tissue without immunosuppression in view to assess the biocompatibility of the device.

      This protocol is designed as a limited series of islets transplants for 15 Type 1 diabetic
      adult subjects. In both Pase 1A/1B: Vascularized pancreas transplantation cannot be proposed,
      for these patients, following vascular disease, the older age, psychological reasons. Phase
      1A consists in the transplantation of encapsulated human islets in Type 1 diabetic patients
      already transplanted with primary vascularized organ and under immunosuppression therapy.

      Phase 1B consists in the transplantation of encapsulated human islets in Type 1 diabetic
      patients who cannot be eligible for whole vascularized pancreas transplantation.
