      living accidents and almost half of the post fall injuries are fractures (Ricard and Th√©lot,
      2007). These falls with fracture lead to a loss of autonomy and a high health cost. Their
      prevention is a crucial focus of research.

      Even if it is obvious that subjects with osteoporosis have a higher risk of fracture than
      those with a normal bone mineral density, recent studies have shown that most victims of
      fracture post-fall do not comply with the densitometric definition of osteoporosis.

      It is well established that the presence of cognitive disorders, frequent in the elderly, is
      an important risk factor for falls; It might also be a risk factor for fracture after a fall
      with an unadapted postural or balance control.

      The investigators will test this hypothesis on 150 victims of fracture (upper or lower limb)
      consecutive to a fall from standing height, recruited in the hospitals of Caen and Rouen
      (France) in the context of their medical follow-up (with blood and dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry [DXA] exams). These patients will be matched to 150 control participants
      (victims of a fall with no fracture, submitted to the same exams).

      All the participants are subjects to an in-depth study of cognitive functions, postural and
      walking tests and to various scales (daily life activities, depression, ...).

      These exams will take half a day, with a two-year follow up (in which the participant will
      have to note new falls and new medical treatments)
