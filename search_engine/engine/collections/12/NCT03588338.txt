      received the IV infusion of paracetamol (1.5 ml/kg); and the metoclopramide group who
      received the IV infusion of saline (1.5 mg/kg). The presence of vomiting and the actions
      indicative of nausea, such as repeated gagging or spitting, within 24h following general
      anesthesia are defined as PONV. All PONV episodes and postoperative pain scores are recorded
      during 24h postoperatively. The postoperative 0-4h and 4-24h are defined as early and late
      postoperative period, respectively. Intravenous 4 mg ondansetron as rescue antiemetic drug is
      administered in case of two or more vomiting episodes.
