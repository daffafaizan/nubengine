      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Determine any preliminary antitumor
      activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GEM 231. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours on day 1, immediately followed by GEM 231 over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18.
      Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with one of two doses of paclitaxel and
      escalating doses of GEM 231 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 1 patient will be accrued per week for this study until the
      maximum tolerated dose is reached.
