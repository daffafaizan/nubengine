    
      This is a multicentre, randomised, phase II trial which aims to compare the combination of
      hydroxychloroquine and gemcitabine/carboplatin versus standard carboplatin/etoposide
      chemotherapy, as first line treat in patients with stage IV disease.

      The standard first line chemotherapy treatment remains a platinum-based chemotherapy and this
      has been unchanged for 20 years. Novel active treatment approaches are urgently needed to
      improve survival in SCLC.

      Patients are randomised to one of two treatment arms; carboplatin/etoposide or
      gemcitabine/carboplatin/hydroxychloroquine.
