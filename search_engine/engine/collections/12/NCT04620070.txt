      circulation (ROSC) within 10 minutes. However, If ROSC is not achieved within 20 minutes,
      favourable neurological outcome is rare. Currently, patients without ROSC at scene die at
      scene, or are transported (while still in cardiac arrest) to the hospital. In the hospital,
      advanced life support is continued, or, when presented to selected hospitals capable for this
      strategy, patients receive Extracorporeal CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR). ECPR is a
      strategy in which a miniaturized heart-lung machine (similar to that used in open-heart
      surgery) is attached to the patient. Nowadays, the greatest drawback transporting OHCA
      patients with refractory arrest to the hospital are the low quality of thorax compression
      during transport and long time needed to arrive in the hospital, in part because not all
      hospitals are able to provide this treatment. In the Netherlands, Helicopter Emergency
      Medical Services (HEMS) deliver highly specialized medical care to trauma and non-trauma
      patients, covering the entire country.

      Hypothesis: Implantation of on-scene ECPR by the HEMS teams in patients with sustained
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results in the rapid return of circulation and, thus,
      improved survival and less neurological impairment, which is associated with lower health
      care costs.

      Objective: To improve survival to hospital discharge and costs/QALY in young patients with
      OHCA by decreasing the time in cardiac arrest by initiating ECPR on scene.
