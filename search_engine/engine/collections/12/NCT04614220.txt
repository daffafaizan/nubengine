      patients who undergo surgery. There are many causes of preoperative anxiety including fear of
      death due to anesthesia or surgical procedure and fear of preoperative or postoperative pain.

      Preoperative anxiety varies according to the patient's age, gender, educational status,
      history of previous operations, and medical status as well as the type of surgery and type of
      anesthesia. Patient's safety and satisfaction are major concerns of anesthesiologists and
      obstetricians. According to evidence guidelines, and quality markers, regional anesthesia is
      preferred over general in obstetric surgery. Already a high level of anxiety is present in
      obstetric patients preoperatively.

      The anxious patients tend to prefer general anesthesia (GA) for cesarean section (CS). The
      patient refusal is the main contraindication for applying spinal anesthesia (SA) during CS.
      The anxiety can be reduced variably by non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods including
      preoperative visit, information, and music, listening to Holy Quran recitation, hypnosis,
      nitrous oxide, and benzodiazepines. Intravenous sedation can control the anxiety in 90% of
      patients subjected to spinal procedures. While the evidence supports the benefits of
      procedural sedation for distressed, anxious pregnant women.
