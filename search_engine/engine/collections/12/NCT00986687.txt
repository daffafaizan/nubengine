      pregnancies at rates equivalent to those obtained with fresh oocytes is urgent.
      Cryopreservation of oocytes is desirable because: 1) it would allow infertility patients to
      store excess oocytes instead of embryos, eliminating some of the ethical and religious
      concerns that accompany embryo storage; 2) permit storage of donor oocytes in egg banks,
      analogous to existing sperm banks. This option would allow the cryopreserved oocytes to be
      quarantined until screening for infectious diseases is completed, and would also avoid
      donor-recipient synchronization difficulties; and 3) can help cancer patients preserve their
      fertility before they face sterilization due to chemotherapy or radiation. Oocyte
      cryopreservation is therefore gaining in popularity as an option for infertility treatment as
      well as fertility preservation.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the outcomes of oocyte vitrification using the Cryotop
      method in women undergoing IVF, by simultaneously evaluating embryos derived from vitrified
      and fresh oocytes coming from the same stimulated cycle.

      The primary outcome measures that will be tracked and tabulated are oocyte survival,
      fertilization and cleavage rate, and subsequent embryo development, compared between
      vitrified and fresh oocytes. Secondary outcomes are implantation, clinical pregnancy,
      miscarriage and live birth rates using embryos derived from the vitrified oocytes for
      transfer.
