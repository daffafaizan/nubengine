      a large impact on the clinical course of patients with atrial fibrillation or ischemic stroke
      and has large financial implications as well. Misdiagnosing the presence of LAA thrombus can
      lead to unnecessarily cancelled procedures (cardioversion and atrial fibrillation ablation)
      and potentially hazardous, unnecessary changes in clinical care (such as prolonged Coumadin
      anticoagulation). Missing LAA thrombus can result in continuation of cardioversion or atrial
      fibrillation ablation procedures at a time when there is higher risk of subsequent embolic
      stroke.

      Several of the patients with atrial fibrillation require transesophageal echocardiography
      (TEE) performed prior to cardioversion or atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. There is
      opportunity to enroll most of these patients in our proposed study. There has been
      essentially no work published about the use of echo contrast materials in TEE (other than
      agitated saline), particularly the use of Optison. Thus, the investigators will be exploring
      a new field in echocardiography and echo contrast.
