      giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the immune
      repertoire is being shifted by chemotherapy to anti-breast cancer response and offer the
      chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. Participants with
      HER-2 driven IBC at least Stage IIIA with N2 (4 positive nodes) following chemotherapy with
      or without trastuzumab or those with recurrence exclusive of new primary tumor but rendered
      NED will be undergo mammograms, laboratory studies, and leukapheresis. Vaccines will be
      manufactured using participants' leukapheresis product, which will be administered in the
      Clinical Research Center 1 Dulles Building weekly for 6 weeks. Three booster vaccines will be
      administered at 3 month intervals following the initial induction vaccines. Immune analysis
      will be done after participant receives all induction vaccines and again after they receive
      all booster vaccines.

      This study began at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and will be
      continued at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute.
