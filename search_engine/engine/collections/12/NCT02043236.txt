      care. Strategy 1 - Patient and physician-specific written educational material. Pilot-tested
      customized written educational material about bone health for men on ADT will be used for
      this study. A customized letter will be prepared for the patient's primary care physician,
      with specific advice and recommendations for the targeted strategies. Both pamphlet and
      letter will include a list of additional resources. Strategy 2 - patient written material and
      a bone health care coordinator (BHCC). The same written patient material as in strategy 1
      will be used, along with a BHCC who will follow the approach of successful studies and
      contact the patient by phone or arrange an in-person visit at the hospital if preferred by
      the patient. The BHCC will also encourage the patient to pursue a bone mineral density test
      (BMD) with their physician and adopt bone-appropriate diet, lifestyle, and supplement intake
      recommendations, and will follow up with the patient at least twice over the next 3 months to
      facilitate behavioural changes and BMD ordering. Counselling sessions are short, typically
      <15 min. The BHCC will also contact the patient's physician to help facilitate BMD testing.
      Time points in the study are baseline, 3-month follow up, and 6-month follow up.

      Control group The control group consists of a wait-list control for 6 months, during which no
      specific recommendations or interventions will be made by the study team. Prostate Cancer
      (PC) clinicians can still provide usual care. At the end of 6 months, control group
      participants will be referred to the Osteoporosis Clinic at the University Health Network.
