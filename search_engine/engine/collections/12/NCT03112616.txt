      neck muscles in the long term improved postural asymmetry in connection with the egocentric
      representation of body disorders.

      The effect of vibration simultaneously on improving postural asymmetry and on improving
      markers of the perception of the body in space (LBA, SSA, Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV),
      Rod and frame) will be assessed.
