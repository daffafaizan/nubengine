      organs are the skin, joints, kidneys and peripheral nervous system. Cryoglobulinemia
      vasculitis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and require therapeutic
      intervention. Management of non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is based on
      corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and/or immunosuppressants. These treatments are associated
      with frequent side effects. To date, no study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of these
      different therapeutic options, explaining the lack of recommendations.

      Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, has emerged as a novel therapeutic
      option in B-cell related disorders. Data from the French AutoImmunity and Rituximab (AIR)
      registry recently reported the positive effect of rituximab in non-infectious mixed
      cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. More recently, the multidisciplinary national French CryoVas
      survey also suggested a significant superiority of the combination corticosteroid plus
      rituximab compared to the corticosteroids alone in terms of complete clinical and
      immunological responses and corticosteroid sparing. However, no randomized controlled data
      addressing this issue has been published to date.
