        -  Measure plasma cathepsin D levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and in
           healthy volunteers using mass spectometry.

        -  Measure fatty acid synthase levels in these patients and healthy volunteers using mass
           spectometry.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected from patients and healthy volunteers to measure the
      levels of cathepsin D and fatty acid synthase by proteomic profiling and mass spectrometry.
