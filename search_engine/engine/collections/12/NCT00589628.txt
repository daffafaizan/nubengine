      time there are no prospective studies for this use. Participants will be randomized to
      initial suggested dose of infliximab (5 mg/kg/dose vs 10 mg/kg/dose) and data will be
      collected prospectively with regard to ophthalmologic outcomes. Study participants will be
      followed for up to 10 months to determine efficacy and side effects, and an additional 30
      days for safety reports. Descriptive statistics will be gathered on participant demographics,
      uveitis characteristics, change in immunosuppressive medications, number of responders,
      ophthalmologic measures and change in corticosteroid dose during the study period. Initial to
      final dose will be examined by paired t-test. The proportion of responders in the 5 mg/kg
      initial dose group will be compared to the 10 mg/kg/dose by a Chi-square or Fisher's exact
      test, depending on numbers available. Predictors of response will be examined by logistic
      regression.
