      defecography commode will be tested. Patients with refractory constipation due to known
      pelvic floor laxity and/or excessive perineal descent will be examined without, then with the
      device in place. Patients will complete questionnaires pertaining to device safety and
      efficacy before and after using the device. Radiographic images to document efficacy of
      support plus adequate emptying will be acquired during the study resulting in very low dose
      radiation exposure.
