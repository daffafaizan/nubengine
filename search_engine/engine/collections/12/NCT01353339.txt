      significant reduction in graft survival. There are currently no proven strategies to prevent
      or treat BK virus infection. Quinolone antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, have demonstrated
      activity against BK virus. The investigators hypothesize that administration of a quinolone
      antibiotic, when given early post-transplantation, will prevent the establishment of BK viral
      replication in the urine and thus prevent systemic BK virus infection. A non-randomized study
      in kidney transplant recipients found that patients given levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin had a
      significantly lower incidence of BK viremia compared to those not receiving a quinolone (4%
      versus 24.5%, P=0.02).

      Objective: The primary objective of the full trial will be to determine if the quinolone
      levofloxacin decreases the occurrence of doubling creatinine, transplant failure or death in
      kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this pilot trial is to assess the efficacy, safety
      and feasibility of a 3-month course of levofloxacin in the kidney transplant population.

      Results from this pilot study will provide vital information to design and conduct a large,
      multi-centre trial to determine if quinolone therapy decreases meaningful clinical outcomes
      in kidney transplantation. If levofloxacin significantly reduces BK viruria and urine viral
      loads in kidney transplantation it will provide important justification of biologic effect to
      progress to the larger trial. If the full trial shows that levofloxacin significantly reduces
      BK infection and improves outcomes, its use in renal transplantation will be strongly
      endorsed given the lack of proven therapies for this condition.
