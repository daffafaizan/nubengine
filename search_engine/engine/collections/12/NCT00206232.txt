      diastology parameters and brain natriuretic peptide level will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion
      to either placebo or spironolactone 25mg daily for 6 months. They will be assessed over this
      6 month period for improvement in exercise capacity, clinical symptoms, echocardiography
      diastology parameters, and biomarkers specific for heart failure. Safety of spironolactone in
      this patient population will also be assessed by recording adverse events and following
      electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels.
