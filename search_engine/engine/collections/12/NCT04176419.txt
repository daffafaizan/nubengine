      regimen affects opioid-related side effects, participant satisfaction with pain management,
      PACU length of stay, hospital length of stay, chronic pain level, and chronic pain-related
      disability in participants, and to determine the safety and tolerability of the non-opioid
      pain control regimen in head and neck cancer patients undergoing cancer surgery with free
      flap reconstruction. Ketamine, Lidocaine, Acetaminophen, Gabapentin, and Celecoxib are
      FDA-approved drugs that have been approved for use individually, and have been used in
      combination for perioperative pain control. However, the use of these five drugs together in
      head and neck cancer patients undergoing free flap reconstruction has not been studied, which
      is why this study is experimental.
