      observational study to assess the clinical profile of patients with moderate to severe
      psoriasis in Spain. The data for each patient will be recorded only once, in one visit.
      During this visit the specialist will ask the patient a series of questions to describe the
      existence or absence of a number of conditions and their associated treatments, to record the
      characteristics of psoriasis experienced by the patient and the type of associated treatment.
