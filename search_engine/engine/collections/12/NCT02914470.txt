      840 mg, all administered intravenously. One cycle is 28 days. On day 1 carboplatin,
      cyclophosphamide and atezolizumab will be administered. On day 15 atezolizumab only will be
      administered. Patients will be treated until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable
      toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. It is expected that 6-12 patients will be enrolled,
      depending on safety issues observed.
