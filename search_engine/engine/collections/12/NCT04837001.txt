    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FDY-5301 compared to
      placebo on cardiovascular clinical outcomes in subjects with an anterior ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).

      The study is designed as a randomized double-blind parallel-group comparison of FDY-5301 and
      placebo. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been designed to ensure a broad population
      including seriously ill patients, with or without prior myocardial infarction or coronary
      artery bypass graft. Demonstration of efficacy in the anterior STEMI population will
      translate to all STEMIs agnostic of anatomical location, as the pathophysiology and
      pharmacology are highly likely to translate from anterior STEMIs to non-anterior STEMIs.
