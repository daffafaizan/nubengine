      concentration (Cmax) when administered as a single oral dose in patients who have undergone
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) compared to historical controls. This is a phase one, single
      dose pharmacokinetic study in stable patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy.
      Apixaban is an orally administered highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, belonging to the
      class of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) along with rivaroxoban and edoxaban. Factor
      Xa is an essential mediator of the clotting pathway in humans. Apixaban is currently approved
      by the FDA for treatment of VTE, prophylaxis of DVT in patients undergoing knee and hip
      replacement surgeries and for reducing the risk of embolic stroke and systemic embolism in
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This study aims to compare the
      pharmacokinetics and absorption of oral apixaban in patients who have undergone
      pancreaticoduodenectomy to that of apixaban in historical controls.
