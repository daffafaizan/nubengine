      Open-label, multicentric, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled trial to evaluate at 48
      weeks, the capacity of a weekly strategy of 4 consecutive days on treatment followed by 3
      days off treatment, in HIV-1 treated patients with undetectable viral load for at least 12
      months and continuous antiretroviral regimen unchanged for at least 4 months, to maintain a
      therapeutic success defined by the absence of virological failure (2 consecutive viral loads
      > 50 cp/mL) and the absence of interruption of therapeutic strategy (interruption or change
      of the " 4 days on / 3 days off " strategy for a time longer than 30 consecutive days).
