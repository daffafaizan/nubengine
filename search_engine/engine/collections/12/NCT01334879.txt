      subjects with radiation retinopathy. This is a single center, non-randomized, active
      treatment study involving 10 consecutive patients. This study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a high dose (2.0 mg) intravitreal ranibizumab and its effect on regression of
      radiation retinopathy and mean change in visual acuity.
