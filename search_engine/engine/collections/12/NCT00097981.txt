    
      This is a multi-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) study to compare the safety and
      effectiveness of Thalidomide + Dexamethasone versus DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome
      injection) + Thalidomide + Dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
      Treatments are administered in 28-day cycles. Patients will receive 4 to 12 treatment cycles,
      depending on the response of their multiple myeloma to the treatment (measured according to
      the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant Response Criteria). Patients will have
      additional tests that include Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scans or echocardiograms to
      assess the patients for potential cardiotoxicity that could be related to treatment with
      DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection). Maximum duration of study participation for each
      participant will be 48 weeks.
