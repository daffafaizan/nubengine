      left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Their legally
      responsible caregivers were provided with mobile tDCS device, and were instructed to use it
      on the patients at home. 30-minute session of the stimulation were applied everyday in the
      morning for 12 weeks. The patients were evaluated at baseline, at week 6 and 12.
