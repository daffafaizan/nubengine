    
      Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial (ESPRIT) is a 4,000
      patient, 6-year study investigating the clinical effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients
      with HIV infection. Because of the size and duration of this study, substudies to the parent
      trial are being performed in order to improve the knowledge regarding the use of IL-2 in
      HIV-infected individuals and to enhance the overall scientific output of this international
      effort. This protocol will serve as the umbrella under which the ESPRIT substudies will be
      performed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.
