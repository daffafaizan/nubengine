    
      Injured/concussed subjects will be studied at time of injury, and at 3 follow-up time points
      following injury. Matched controls will be tested following the same schedule as the injured
      athletes. In addition, the study will include an additional pool of contact and non-contact
      athletes who are not head injured and will be assessed prior to the season and then after the
      season has ended. This data will be used to populate a database for the purpose of deriving a
      multimodal concussion index.
