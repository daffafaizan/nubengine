      include: (1) inhibition of NF-ÎºB and COX-2 (increased levels of COX-2 are associated with
      many cancer types); (2)inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism via lipoxygenase and
      scavenging of free radicals generated in this pathway; (3) decreased expression of
      inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a, resulting in growth inhibition of cancer cell
      lines; and (4) down-regulation of enzymes, such as protein kinase C, that mediate
      inflammation and tumor-cell proliferation.

      Curcumin's potent anti-oxidant and free-radical quenching properties play an important role
      in the inhibitory effects of the compound on the initial stages of carcinogenesis.
      Antioxidants are implicated in the pathogenesis of OSMF and hence this preparation may be
      helpful in resolution of this lesion.
