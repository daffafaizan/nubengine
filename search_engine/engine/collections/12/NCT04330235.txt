      kids' beverage policy on children's fast-food restaurant meal purchases and dietary intake.
      Annotated receipt and survey data will be collected from parents purchasing a food or
      beverage for a child 2-10 years of age at fast-food restaurants. Eligible participants will
      be asked to participate in a telephone dietary recall the following day. Data will be
      collected from a repeated cross-section of children in two intervention cities implementing a
      healthy default kids' beverage policy (New York City and Philadelphia) and a control area not
      implementing the policy (northern New Jersey) before the policy is implemented and after the
      policy goes into effect. A difference-in-differences analytic approach will be used to
      compare the change in children's fast-food restaurant meal orders and dietary intake pre- to
      post-implementation in the intervention versus control groups. A Holm-Bonferroni correction
      for multiple comparisons will be applied to p-values for secondary outcomes.
