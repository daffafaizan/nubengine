      symptoms. DBR was designed by Dr. Frank Corrigan, a Scottish psychiatrist interested in the
      brain mechanisms underlying effective trauma psychotherapy. For this study, participants will
      be randomized to either the DBR treatment or wait-list study conditions. Trauma processing
      through DBR involves bringing up a traumatic memory and encourages the client to focus on
      tensions arising in the muscles of the shoulders, neck, head and face (i.e., those involved
      in orienting toward a threatening person/event). It is believed that this approach will allow
      the participant to process the traumatic memory in an emotionally manageable way, changing
      how it is represented/accessed in the brain's innate defensive system. Online Stream -
      Assessments will include clinical interviews (pre/post treatment, and follow-up) using Webex
      video conferencing, and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans (pre/post
      treatment). In-Person Stream - Assessment will include clinical interviews (pre/post
      treatment and follow-up), and fMRI scans (pre/post treatment).
