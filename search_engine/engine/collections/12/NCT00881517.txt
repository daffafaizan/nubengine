      congenital HCMV infection. Primary HCMV infections during pregnancy carry the highest risk of
      fetal infection and disease. No intervention of proven efficacy is available in case of
      primary HCMV infection in pregnancy. However, a study published in 2005 (Nigro et al., NEJM
      353:1350-62, 2005) reported that in pregnant women with primary HCMV infection treated with
      HCMV-specific hyperimmune globulin (Cytotect®, Biotest) the risk of transmitting the
      infection to the fetus was reduced from 40% to 16%. Unfortunately, since the study was
      conducted with inadequate controls, the actual efficacy of hyperimmune globulin could not be
      properly assessed.

      In the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial pregnant women
      with ascertained primary HCMV infection at 4-26 weeks of gestation will be randomized to
      receive Cytotect® or placebo intravenously within 6 weeks after the presumed onset of
      infection.

      Primary efficacy parameter will be the number of HCMV-infected newborns or fetuses.
