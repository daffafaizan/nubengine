      hilar lymphadenopathy. Although EBUS-TBNA is a minimally invasive procedure, rare but serious
      infectious complications such as pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, mediastinal
      adenitis/abscess, mediastinitis, pericarditis, and sepsis were reported. EBUS-scope might be
      contaminated with oropharyngeal commensal bacteria while passing the oropharyngeal airway
      during EBUS-TBNA. Contamination of punctured lymph nodes by oropharyngeal commensal bacteria
      can cause severe infections.

      Chlorhexidine gluconate is an antimicrobial agent that has a broad antibacterial activity
      including both gram-positive and negative bacteria. Chlorhexidine has been widely used for
      surgical scrub, skin disinfection, and mouthrinse. We, therefore, designed a phase 4,
      single-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate whether chlorhexidine
      mouthrinse is effective in preventing microbial contamination during EBUS-TBNA.
