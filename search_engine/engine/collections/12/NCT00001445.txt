      of HIV-1 Immunogen, gp120-depleted inactivated HIV-1 preparation in Incomplete Freund's
      Adjuvant (IFA), in children with HIV-1 infection. A total of 32 children with HIV-1 infection
      will be enrolled in the study. Arm A of the study will enroll children who have no or
      moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC classification and
      who have no history of and do not require antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral treatment
      given for less than 7 weeks (up to 6 weeks and 6 days) prior to entry will be considered as
      "no history" of treatment (treatment naive). Arm B will enroll children who have no or
      moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC classification and
      who are on or have received antiretroviral treatment for more than 7 weeks. In order to
      assess the age-associated impact on the immune response rate, we plan to continue to attempt
      to enroll infants younger than 24 months of age. Children in each arm will receive 10 units
      of HIV-1 Immunogen intramuscularly at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Antiretroviral treatment will commence once patients meet the criteria for an initiation of
      the treatment as defined in the protocol. All antiretroviral agents that are currently
      approved by FDA for clinical indications in HIV-1-infected children (pediatric labeling) are
      permitted in the protocol. If the child has been receiving a single agent other than ddI, or
      has been on investigational antiretroviral agents, his/her antiretroviral therapy will have
      to be changed to an optimal combination regimen of the approved agents at least 6 weeks prior
      to the enrollment.
