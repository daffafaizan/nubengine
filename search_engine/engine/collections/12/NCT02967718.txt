      atherosclerosis or coronary artery spasm. Despite improvements in interventional and
      pharmacological therapy for acute MI, the mortality early after AMI remains high. Nowadays,
      as our life quality develops and dietary structure changes, the morbidity of hyperlipidemia
      dramatically increased. Based on the Chinese medicine, hyperlipidemia belongs to phlegm and
      it's the basis of atherosclerosis, blood-stasis is the pathological basis of ischemia.
      Therefore, the investigator proposes that phlegm and blood-stasis syndrome is the main
      differentiation on CHD. Based on that, the investigator prospectively and retrospectively
      explores the evolutionary process of CHD phlegm-blood stasis syndrome by large samples,
      multi-centre, cross-section observation combining with longitudinal tracking on-site survey
      method.It will provide evidence and guidance to the future clinical treatment using Chinese
      medicine.
