      patients with psychiatric disorders may be at higher risk of COVID-19 contamination, may
      experience delayed treatment when infected, may have a poor prognosis in terms of
      complications and success of treatment for COVID-19 but also for the underlying psychiatric
      disorder which could be exacerbated, and finally their psychotropic pharmacological treatment
      could be impacted by the inflammatory state linked to COVID-19.

      The present study is an observatory of patients with psychiatric disorders and suspected to
      be infected by the COVID-19, hospitalized in a specific unit dedicated to the treatment of
      this comorbidity in the University Hospital of Nantes (France). The primary objective is to
      investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of acute traumatic stress
      response. Secondary objectives include: (i) a description of the sample included; (ii) an
      assessment of the clinical evolution of these patients 4-6 weeks after admission; (iii) to
      investigate the links between the levels of stress, peritraumatic distress, and traumatic
      stress (whether it is acute or has evolved into a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD));
      (iv) to investigate the links between resilience and coping on the one hand, and stress,
      peritraumatic distress and traumatic stress (acute or PTSD) on the other hand; and (v) to
      measure the impact of COVID infection and of the reduction on the residual plasma
      concentrations of psychotropic medications (especially antipsychotics and lithium).
