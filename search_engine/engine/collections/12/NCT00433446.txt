      Primary

        -  Assess the confirmed prostate-specific antigen response in patients with
           hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treated with anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal
           antibody.

      Secondary

        -  Assess overall survival and progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  Assess the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial
           response) in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
