      have been shown to be effective for the treatment of macular edema when administered orally,
      also for central serous chorioretinopathy. However, this treatment carries the risk of severe
      side effects.

      The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of the topical form of treatment of
      carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with chronic, non-resolving, central serous
      chorioretinopathy.
