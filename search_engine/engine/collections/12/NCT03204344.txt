      attenuates discomfort and anxiety; it also reduces stress, insulin resistance and catabolism
      in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, resulting in earlier recovery of
      gastrointestinal function and short length of hospital stay after surgery. However, for
      diabetic patients scheduled to undergo gastrointestinal surgery, the risks and benefits of
      preopertive oral carbohydrate remain unclear. The purpose of this pilot study is to
      investigate the impact of preoperative oral carbohydrate (outfastÂ®) on the recovery in
      diabetic patients after gastrointestinal surgery.
