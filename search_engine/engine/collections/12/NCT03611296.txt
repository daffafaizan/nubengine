      and above the 85th BMI percentile (i.e., overweight to severe obesity) in this pilot
      ancillary study. The objective is to examine interactions between the following
      energy-balance related factors:

        1. Ad libitum post-exercise food intake

        2. Cognitive factors, including inhibitory control, food wanting, and motivation for food

        3. Exercise-related factors, including cardiorespiratory fitness, substrate utilization
           (carbohydrate versus fat), and perceived exertion

        4. Habitual physical and sedentary activity

        5. Body composition and cardiometabolic health

      The prospective, longitudinal nature of the study will allow the investigators to examine
      these variables cross-sectionally and quantify change over two years. Of particular interest
      is whether cognitive factors related to energy balance, including perceived exertion,
      inhibitory control, food wanting, and food motivation, vary across time or are relatively
      stable. Finally, the investigators will assess the ability of these factors to predict
      changes in body composition and cardiometabolic health over two years.
