      context of culture and value system in which he lives, in relation to its goals,
      expectations, standards and concerns "(WHO 1993).

      This concept refers to multiple dimensions, both objective and subjective:

        -  The physical condition of the person, his functional abilities;

        -  His somatic sensations;

        -  His psychological health;

        -  His social status, relational environment.

      This concept focuses on perception's basics. Quality of life is a criteria supposed to be
      objective even though it is subject to subjective interpretation at the highest point.
      Indeed, if the quality of life varies depending on the discretion of each person, it also
      changes over time: it refers to a situation at a given moment and not to a stable state.

      Therefore in this study, it seemed appropriate to show the concept of "quality of life
      objective" which is linked to objective data measures recognized criteria for evaluating the
      elderly. These criteria are repeatable, validated and not dependent operator.

      This process completely matches with the actions promoted by the 2009-2013 Cancer Plan
      (measures 23 and 26) on the basis of an improvement of:

        -  The quality of consideration of the psychosocial dimension (customization accompaniment,
           living environment, social, involvement, ..)

        -  The quality of the integration of physical and psychological dangers inherent to this
           weakness situation induced by cancer.
