      recognized that bacteria in the gut lumen may have a role in the etiology and/or symptoms of
      this disease. Antimicrobials have often been used in treating Crohn's disease although their
      effectiveness has not been well established. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are also believed to
      play an important role in this disease. Nitazoxanide, a thiazolide anti-infective, is active
      in vitro against a broad spectrum of anaerobic bacteria, and it inhibits secretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, -4, -5, -6, -8, -10 and TNF alpha. The drug is
      also highly concentrated in the gastrointestinal tract. With these characteristics,
      nitazoxanide offers a unique approach to treatment of Crohn's disease.
