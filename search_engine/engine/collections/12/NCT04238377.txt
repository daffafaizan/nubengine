      surgery with axillary dissection at National Cancer Institute, Cairo University were included
      in this study. Patients will be randomized into two equal comparable groups of patients.

      (Group A the study group) was received pre-operative ultrasound guided stellate ganglion
      block one hour before surgery and multimodal analgesia and (Group B the control group) was
      received multimodal analgesia only.

      The present study showed in regards to the acute pain management of the stellate ganglion
      block: intraoperative hemodynamics, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (MABP, HR)
      were statistically significant less in group A (Stellate Group) than group B (Control Group)
      and this leads to significant less opioid consumption in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group
      B (Control group). In the 1st 24h postoperative opioid consumption measured by number of
      rescue dose of morphine 5mg IV were administered when visual analogue score was more than 4
      and total requirement per 24 hours was recorded. The results show statistically significant
      less opioid consumption in Group A (Stellate Group) with average visual analogue score 3.5 in
      1st 24h than Group B (Control group) with average visual analogue score 5.5 in 1st 24h.

      The present study showed in regards to the chronic pain management of the stellate ganglion
      block that, the 6-month relative frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes, using the grading
      system for neuropathic pain (GSNP) shows statistically significance lower frequency of
      neuropathic pain syndromes in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).

      Assessment of patient daily activity and functional capacity using Eastern cooperative
      oncology group (ECOG) scoring showed statistically significance higher performance status
      (lower numbers in the score) in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).

      Number of patients discharged on tramadol & or Lyrica whom developed Post Mastectomy Pain
      syndrome (PMPs) is statically significant lower in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B
      (Control group).
