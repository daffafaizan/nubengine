      dysfunction among young and elderly intensive care unit (ICU) survivors that is altering the
      landscape of society. Fully two-thirds of ICU patients develop delirium, which is associated
      with longer stays, billions of dollars in costs globally, and 3-fold excess mortality at 6
      months. Over one-half of ICU survivors suffer a functionally debilitating dementia-like
      illness, which appears related to delirium duration. The impact on a person's life is often
      devastating. The main goal of the proposed INQRI project is to implement, analyze, and
      disseminate an evidence-based, nurse-led, inter-professional, multi-component program focused
      on improving the care and outcomes of critically ill adults. The study will focus on applying
      Awakening-Breathing Coordination, Delirium Monitoring/Management & Early Mobility (ABCDE), a
      program of delirium screening, prevention, and treatment developed at Vanderbilt University.
      The ABCDE approach analyzes and merges the best available evidence related to delirium,
      analgesia, and sedation (DAS) management in the ICU and tailors the pharmacologic and
      nonpharmacologic interventions used in prior DAS clinical trials into a program that can be
      adopted into practice in less "research focused" ICUs. Specifically, the study aims are to
      (1) implement the ABCDE program in a medical center that does not currently perform routine
      ICU delirium screenings and identify facilitators and barriers to program adoption; (2) test
      the impact of the ABCDE program on patient outcomes, nursing quality outcomes, and system
      outcomes; and (3) assess the extent to which ABCDE implementation is effective, sustainable,
      and conducive to dissemination into other settings.
