      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of sirolimus when combined with gefitinib in
           patients with recurrent or refractory stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR])
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease control rate (CR, PR, and stable disease) in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study of sirolimus followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily and oral sirolimus once daily on
           days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
           disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sirolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gefitinib and sirolimus as in phase I at the MTD. Quality of
           life is assessed at baseline, day 1 of each course, and then at 1 month
           post-progression.

      Patients are followed every 9 weeks. Patients withdrawn from study treatment without evidence
      of disease progression are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients (11 for phase I and 14 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 8.3 months.
