    
      Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a eutectic mixture containing
      25 mg/g of lidocaine and 25 mg/g of prilocaine (EMLA®) with injectable 2% lidocaine, topical
      benzocaine, and 2% placebo for reducing pain during subgingival scaling and root planing
      (SRP) procedures.

      Methods: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in this split-mouth, double-blind randomized
      clinical trial. Patients were randomized to a sequence of four anesthetics: 25 mg/g lidocaine
      and 25 mg/g of 5% prilocaine (EMLA®), injectable 2% lidocaine, topical 2% benzocaine, or
      placebo. Pain and discomfort were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Verbal
      Scale (VS). Patient satisfaction with anesthesia was also determined at the end of each
      treatment session.
