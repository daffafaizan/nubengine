      recordings obtained from the implanted DBS lead to predict ideal stimulation parameters.
      Additionally this study will compare the therapeutic window for stimulation delivered through
      directional and conventional leads and determine if the spatiospectral LFP patterns correlate
      with the presence of stimulation side effects.

      Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled in this clinical investigation. The clinical
      investigation will be conducted at 2 centers in the USA.

      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will monitored during DBS implant
      procedure and programming. The expected duration of enrollment is 8 months. The total
      duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 1 year.
