      neurologic, respiratory, circulatory and many other systems. The outcomes of patients with
      severe stroke depend largely on medical strategies on acute stage, especially on nutritional
      support management. Unfortunately, clinical evidence are sparse and the ideal initial feeding
      strategy remains disputable.

      The IF-STROKE study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of modified full enteral
      feeding (target recruitment 200) and permissive underfeeding in patients with acute severe
      stroke (target recruitment 200) compared to full enteral feeding (target recruitment 200).
      Patients presenting with acute (<72h) severe stroke (GCS ≦ 12 or NIHSS ≧ 11) and dysphagia
      (defined by Water Swallowing Test) will be randomly assigned to full enteral feeding,
      modified full enteral feeding, or permissive underfeeding treatment for 7 days.
