      complications in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Frequency of contact with the
      medical care team has been associated with better control. Both the American Diabetes
      Association and Canadian Diabetes Association recommend regular quarterly visits. However,
      the increase in case loads and the limited manpower available forces us to look at
      alternative models of care. A model of care in which medical visits alternate between a face
      to face multidisciplinary visits and a virtual visit done via fax or e-mail communication and
      a phone call may be advantageous to both the patient and the medical care team. For the
      patient and his family, this model would decrease time away from school and work, travel
      inconveniences and costs. For the medical care team it may decrease time per patient and
      therefore increase the number of patients served with the same resources.
