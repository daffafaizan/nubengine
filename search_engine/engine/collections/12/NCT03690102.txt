        1. How is the quality of CPR and use of AED when performed by an inexperienced bystander
           who receives telephone assistance compared to the quality when performed by a trained
           bystander, who has passed a standardized European Resuscitation Council (ERC) course in
           basic life support (BLS) but does not receive telephone assistance?

        2. How is the quality of CPR and use of AED when performed by a trained bystander who has
           passed a standardized ERC course in BLS and who receives telephone assistance compared
           to the quality when performed by a trained bystander who does not receive telephone
           assistance?

      The questions are sought answered through simulated cardiac arrest scenarios in non-classroom
      settings.

      Participants are recruited from ERC courses in BLS.

      Participants are randomised to one of three groups (stratified for course type using
      computer-generated randomisation lists with blocks of variable sizes):

        1. Cardiac arrest scenario test before BLS course with telephone-assistance.

        2. Cardiac arrest scenario test after BLS course, no telephone-assistance.

        3. Cardiac arrest scenario test after BLS course with telephone-assistance.
