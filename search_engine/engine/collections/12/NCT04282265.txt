      muscle size in two groups of adults before and after 11 weeks of intervention in a
      randomized, double blinded study. One group (n=15 ) will receive an intervention of
      resistance exercise and a Red Spinach Extract supplement, and the other group (n=15) will
      receive resistance exercise and a placebo (maltodextrin).
