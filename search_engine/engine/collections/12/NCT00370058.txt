      Elevated homocysteine levels have been found in depressive disorders. The modulating effects
      of homocysteine on glutamatergic neurotransmission have been discussed to be an underlying
      cause of depression and can also lead to cognitive impairment and may facilitate seizures.
      Electroconvulsive therapy is the most effective treatment for depression, but often leads to
      cognitive impairments.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      Homocysteine levels normalize during rECT. This normalization is associated with the clinical
      improvement of depression. Short term changes in homocysteine levels (i.e. increase directly
      after ECT) may explain the cognitive impairments of the patients.

      METHOD:

      10 patients with therapy-resistant depressive disorder are to be enrolled into the trial.
      Patients are treated with rECT, two to three times a week. Blood withdrawal and psychometric
      analysis will be performed before, directly after and one day after ECT treatment
      1,4,7,10,(13). Necessity of further treatment will be checked after the first 6 ECTs.
