      either a Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) or a Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic Coma (HONC). Once informed
      consent has been given, each patient will receive standard intravenous treatment. They will
      also receive a daily sub-cutaneous bolus of either a long-acting insulin or a placebo.

      Blood will be taken at regular intervals to analyse the rate of fall of glucose and
      normalisation of blood pH.
