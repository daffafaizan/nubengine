      Classification of ROP. Data of the patients who received IVR for type 1 ROP or aggressive
      posterior ROP (AP-ROP) according to early treatment ROP study (ETROP) were collected.
      Intravitreal ranibizumab injection was performed as follows; topical anesthetic drop was
      applied, standard aseptic eye preparation with 5% betadine was performed, a lid speculum was
      inserted and intravitreal injection of 0.25 mg/0.025 ml ranibizumab with a 30-gauge needle
      1.5mm from limbus was given. In case of bilateral ROP, both eyes are injected in the same
      session. Infants were examined a day after the procedure and weekly thereafter until full
      vascularization of the retina was observed.

      ROP reactivation was defined as any of the following: recurrent plus disease, recurrent
      neovascularization, or reformation of ridge despite treatment . Once recurrence was
      determined, second injection of IVR (0.25mg/0.025mL) was given to patients or surgery was
      performed if progressed to stage 4 or 5. All treated infants were examined until complete
      regression of ROP and full retinal vascularization.
