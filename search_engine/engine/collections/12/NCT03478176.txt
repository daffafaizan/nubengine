      intensive care patients. Gold standard for estimation of intraabdominal pressure is
      intravesical pressure (IVP) measurement. IAH is defined by IVP elevation above 12mmHg. IVP
      measurement is recommended in patients presenting IAH risk factor(s). Acute kidney injury
      (AKI)is the most frequent and described complication of IAH condition. IAH related AKI
      traduces renal hypoperfusion and its severity seems to correlate with IVP levels.

      Patients undergoing kidney transplantation have several risk factors to develop IAH :
      abdominal wall surgery, acidosis and hypervolemic resuscitation. Nevertheless, to our
      knowledge, IAH incidence, associated factors and impact on renal function recovery remains
      unknown.

      We aim to study IAH incidence in post kidney transplantation period. Thus, we want to
      identify associated factors with IAH development in this context. We also aim to correlate
      IVP early evolution with extra-cellular hydration status evolution. Finally, impact of IAH on
      renal function recovery will be investigated.

      Presupposing that 50 kidney transplantations per year will take place in University Hospital
      of Reims (France), we attend to include about 100 patients in this study. With a prevalence
      of at least 30% of IAH prevalence (as reported in intensive care units cohorts), enrollment
      of 100 patients will permit to estimate IAH prevalence with a 9% precision (with a 95%IC).
