      influenza viruses and others. The majority of colds are however caused by rhinovirus
      infection, which is responsible for up to 80% of all common colds. This study evaluates the
      effect of creating a physical barrier on the pharyngeal mucosal membrane to prevent or reduce
      virus cell entry during common cold infection to reduce total virus load and common cold
      symptoms in vivo in relation to placebo.
