    
      Two researchers from the Department of Computer & Information Sciences at Towson University
      are seeking individuals who have difficulty using their hands and arms (e.g., as result of
      carpal tunnel syndrome, high level spinal cord injuries, etc.) to participate in a survey.
      The survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete and all responses will remain
      completely confidential and anonymous.

      The purpose of the survey is to gain insight into the computing behaviors of individuals with
      upper-body motor impairments. We expect that the results will help researchers and system
      developers create more effective access control techniques to meet the special needs of this
      user population. The results should also assist employers in providing improved technical and
      procedural support to computer users that have difficulties using standard input devices.

      If you would like to take the online survey, please go to the following link:

      If you prefer a paper version of the survey, please send us an e-mail that contains your
      mailing address and we will send the survey to you.
