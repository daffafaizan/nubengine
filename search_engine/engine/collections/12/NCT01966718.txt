      some patients have disease that is refractory to treatment and cannot achieve remission. The
      objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injections of
      repository corticotropin as an adjunct therapy in patients with active RA who have had an
      inadequate response to at least two biologic agents as well as a third agent they are
      currently receiving.
