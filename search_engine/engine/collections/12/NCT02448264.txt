      1 of the study. Eight subjects will be treated with a single dose of study drug per dose
      cohort (6 subjects per cohort will receive BCX7353 and 2 subjects per cohort will receive
      matching placebo). Escalation to the next higher dose level will occur only after completion
      of a review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetics by the Sponsor and PI.

      Up to 4 ascending, multiple dose cohorts will be enrolled in a sequential manner in Part 2 of
      the study. Twelve subjects will be treated with study drug per dose cohort (10 subjects will
      receive BCX7353 and 2 subjects will receive placebo per cohort). The planned doses, dosing
      regimens, and duration of dosing (7 or 14 days) for each of the Part 2 cohorts will be
      determined based upon safety and pharmacokinetic data collected during the study. Escalation
      to the next higher dose level in Part 2 will occur only after completion of a review of
      clinical safety and pharmacokinetics by the Sponsor and clinical site study physician.

      In Part 3 of the study, the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and multiple doses of
      oral BCX7353 versus placebo in healthy subjects of Japanese origin will be evaluated. In the
      single dose cohort, 16 Japanese subjects will be randomized into a single cohort to receive
      either placebo or 1 of 2 active doses of BCX7353. In the multiple dose cohort, twelve
      subjects will be treated with study drug (10 subjects will receive BCX7353 and 2 subjects
      will receive placebo per cohort). The planned doses (single and multiple dose cohort), and
      dosing regimen and duration of dosing (7 or 14 days; multple dose cohort) for Part 3 will be
      determined based upon safety and pharmacokinetic data collected during Parts 1 and 2 of the
      study.
