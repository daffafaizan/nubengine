      in men until approximately a decade following menopause, suggesting that estrogen is
      vasculoprotective. Infectious pathogens such a Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) and human
      cytomegalovirus (hCMV) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
      Experimental studies in cultured lymphocytes and animals suggest that estrogen stimulates
      cell-mediated immune responsiveness, observations that are potentially relevant to the
      eradication of intracellular pathogens including C. pneumoniae and hCMV. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether estrogen therapy augments cell-mediated immune responsiveness
      in estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women who have serologic evidence of chronic infection
      with C. pneumoniae and/or hCMV. A comparison will be made between seropositive and
      seronegative women. We propose that estrogen therapy will stimulate a more efficient
      cell-mediated response to these chronically persistent infectious intracellular pathogens,
      resulting in eradication of these organisms that are of potential importance in
      atherogenesis.
