      versus subtherapeutic CPAP in patients newly diagnosed with OSA with reference to visceral
      fat especially mesenteric fat thickness, liver fat, carotid artery intima media thickness
      (IMT), lateral pharyngeal wall (LPW) thickness, plasma lipids and adipokines over a treatment
      period of 3 months. The results of this study will advance our understanding of the relative
      role of OSA and obesity in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and whether CPAP
      therapy can improve these metabolic dysregulation.
