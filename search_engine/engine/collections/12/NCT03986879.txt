      mortality rate in the adult population. One of the precursors of these diseases is low
      cardiac autonomic modulation. Thus, factors that may be related to greater cardiac autonomic
      modulation should be investigated with the aim of preventing cardiovascular diseases. One of
      these factors that may contribute to increases in cardiac autonomic modulation is the
      practice of physical activity. However, the studies investigating this relationship have been
      controversial, generally evaluating the practice of physical activity in a subjective way,
      and there is no clarity as to whether the different domains of physical activity would be
      related differently to cardiac autonomic modulation. Overall objective: To analyze the
      relationship of the physical activity practice measured directly with the autonomic cardiac
      modulation in adults. Specific objectives: i) to verify through the Baecke questionnaire
      whether the different domains of physical activity (work, leisure and occupational
      activities) are related in the same way to the autonomic cardiac modulation; ii) Analyze
      whether high blood pressure and resting heart rate values are related to poor cardiac
      autonomic modulation regardless of nutritional status. Implications: The results of this
      study will contribute to clarify the relationship between physical activity practice and
      cardiac autonomic modulation considering a large sample of subjects (n = 252), as well as
      whether the different domains of physical activity are related to autonomic modulation
      cardiac. These results may help in the elaboration of health promotion strategies.
