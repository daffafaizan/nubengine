        -  Determine the complete remission rate (CR).

        -  Determine the proportion of patients who are bone marrow-positive at day 7
           post-induction chemotherapy.

        -  Further evaluate the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1-4 and
      idarubicin IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1-3. Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
      7 days after completion of induction chemotherapy. Patients with > 25% cellular biopsy or >
      10% abnormal cells on aspirate receive 4 more doses of cytarabine and 1 dose of idarubicin.
