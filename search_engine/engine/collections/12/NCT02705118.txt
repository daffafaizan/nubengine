    
      1. Patients will be randomized and assigned.

        2. For automatic registration group, automatic image fusion will be done by RS80A US unit
           and RF ablation will be performed. Image fusion time will be measured.

        3. For manual registration group, manual image fusion will be done by LOGIQ-E9 US unit and
           RF ablation will be performed. Image fusion time will be measured.

      3) After radiofrequency (RF) ablation, immediate, contrast enhanced CT will be performed to
      evaluate technical success and complications 4) Accuracy of registration will be measured by
      home-made software using 3D techniques.

      5) After one month, technical effectiveness will be evaluated by contrast enhanced CT 6) F/U
      of CT images will be obtained until one year after RF ablation with a interval of 1-3 months.
