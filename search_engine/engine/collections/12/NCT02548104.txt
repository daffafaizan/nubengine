      challenges in the recovery process of the patients undergoing this procedure. Traditionally,
      opioids have played a significant role in treating postoperative pain. It is well established
      that opioids are highly effective in relieving pain at rest, but are less effective in
      relieving pain associated with motion (e.g. ambulation, passive motion, and physical
      rehabilitation). Furthermore, the use of opioids for analgesia is associated with well-known
      side effects (such as: nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, bladder dysfunction,
      respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, sedation, and allergic reaction). These opioid
      side effects, which range in severity, can significantly interfere with the rehabilitation
      process and contribute to a delay in hospital discharge.

      Significant interest exists in the application of regional anesthetic techniques as an
      adjuvant to traditional opioid analgesics for pain control in patients after TKA.
      Specifically, the incorporation of femoral nerve blocks (FNB) as an adjunct in postoperative
      pain control has been widely reported in the anesthesia literature. While it has shown to be
      effective in post-operative pain control, it has introduced additional challenges for
      physical therapy and raised new concerns regarding the associated quadriceps muscle weakness.
      Until adequate quadriceps function returns, the need for knee immobilization devices to
      protect patients with traditional FNB from falls interferes with the early recovery process
      and the achievement of physical therapy milestones.
