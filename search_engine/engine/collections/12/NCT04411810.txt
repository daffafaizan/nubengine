    
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a teledermatologist can correctly diagnose skin
      cancer with the same accuracy as an in-person dermatologist. Telemedicine allows health care
      professionals to remotely evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients (i.e. without seeing you in
      person). A dermatologist who is not seeing the patient in person is called a
      teledermatologist. Currently, the standard of care, which means the accepted first choice of
      management, is an in-person evaluation. The telemedicine method that will use in this study
      is called 'store and forward'. This means the information will be sent to the
      teledermatologist after the patient leaves the clinic. The teledermatologist will use
      close-up photos and a device called Nevisense to make the diagnosis.
