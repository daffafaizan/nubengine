    
      This is a 48-week, Phase IV, randomized, open-label, to assess the non-inferior antiviral
      activity (VL < 50 c/ml) of 2DR DTG+3TC versus 3DR TDF/FTC + DTG over 48 weeks in HIV1 naïve
      adult patients without baseline GT available at Day 1 visit. Subjects will be stratified by
      screening HIV-1 RNA (≤100,000 c/mL or >100,000 c/mL) and Screening CD4+ cell count (≤ or >200
      cells/mm3).

      The study will comprise:

        -  a 28-day Screening Phase (which may be extended to 35 days to allow receipt of all
           Screening assessment results).

        -  an Open-label Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48).

      Approximately 200 HIV-1 naïve adult patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive 2DR DTG+3TC
      versus 3DR TDF/FTC + DTG for 48 weeks.
