      products on postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels in healthy premenopausal women and
      men aged 18-40 years old.This study will use a randomized crossover design. Participants will
      complete a series of 9 study visits during which participants will consume 9 study treatment
      meals consisting of muffins, soup and chilli, with and without lentils. Participants will
      then have their blood sampled for the following 2 hours by finger prick. Participants will
      remain seated during the test period. All study visits will occur at the Human Nutraceutical
      Research Unit and be separated by a washout period of 3-7 days. Throughout the study, it will
      be asked that participants' lifestyle and physical activity remain unchanged. Participants
      will be instructed to not start any new dietary approaches, and to not start any new natural
      health products (unless instructed by a physician).
