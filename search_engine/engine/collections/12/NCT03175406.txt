        1. Cervical dilatation in centimeters will be given a score of zero if dilatation less than
           1cm, a score of 1 if 1-2 cm dilated, a score of 2 if more than 2 cm dilataion.

        2. Length of the cervix will be given a score of zero if more than 2 cm, a score of 1 if
           1-2 cm, a score of 2 if less than 1 cm.

        3. Station of fetal head will be given a score of zero if -2 or higher , a score of 1 if
           -1, a score of 2 if zero or lower.

        4. Consistency of the cervix will be given a score of zero if firm, a score of 1 if soft
           and a score of 2 if soft and stretchable.

        5. Position of the cervix will be given a score of zero if posterior, a score of 1 if mid
           position and a score of 2 if anterior. So, a total score (sum of all scores) of zero at
           a minimum to 10 at a maximum can be estimated.

      and also preinduction cervical assessment using transvaginal ultrasound and Manipal system
      where:

        1. Length of the cervix will be given a score of zero if more than 3 cm, a score of 1 if
           2-3 cm, a score of 2 if less than 2 cm.

        2. Length of the funnel will be given a score of zero if absent, a score of 1 if ≤ 0.5 cm,
           a score of 2 if more than 0.5 cm.

        3. width of the funnel will be given a score of zero if absent, a score of 1 if ≤ 0.5 cm, a
           score of 2 if more than 0.5 cm.

        4. cervical position and shape will be given a score of zero if curved, a score of 2 if
           straight

        5. Distance of presenting part to external os will be given a score of zero if more than 3
           cm, a score of 1 if 2-3 cm, a score of 2 if less than 2 cm
