      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of bevacizumab in combination with letrozole in
           postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive,
           unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate (partial response [PR] and complete response [CR]) in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical benefit rate (PR, CR, and stabilization of disease for ≥ 24
           weeks) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients treated with this regimen who have stable disease
           for ≥ 24 weeks.

        -  Determine the molecular profile of the patient's breast tumor and explore the
           relationship between these molecular characteristics and response or resistance to
           treatment.

        -  Obtain serial measurements (pre- and post-treatment) of circulating endothelial cells
           and epithelial cells and explore the relationship between these cells and serum markers
           of angiogenesis and response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral letrozole once daily on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
