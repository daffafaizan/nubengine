    
      This study is designed to evaluate the performance of a new ELISA based QuantiFERON-TB plus
      In-tube test to identify M. tuberculosis specific immune Responses as evidence of latent
      infection with M. tuberculosis in immunosuppressed populations. Both qualitative and
      quantitative test results will be related to the level of immunodeficiency and to the
      presence of risk factors for prior exposure with M. tuberculosis. In addition, patients with
      active tuberculosis (both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals) will be included
      to evaluate a potential increase in sensitivity in these groups. Immunocompetent individuals
      with low risk of exposure will be analysed as a proxy to estimate specificity. Finally, this
      study will be extended to longitudinally assess the predictive value of a positive blood test
      for progression to active disease.
