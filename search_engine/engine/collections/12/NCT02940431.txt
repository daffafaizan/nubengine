      youth and later in life. Physical activity declines sharply during adolescence, making ages
      8-12 a critical period to encourage healthy exercise habits. Increased childhood weight has
      been linked to sedentary leisure time activities, such as video games. "Active video games"
      (AVGs) are now being studied as a method to increase children's interest and participation in
      physical activity. Although research indicates that AVG play may lead to energy expenditure
      comparable to light/ moderate physical activity, children prefer sedentary video games to
      AVGs and often find AVGs boring. Children do not play AVGs as often or with the same
      intensity as traditional games/sports and lose interest in them; efforts must be made to
      increase the appeal of AVGs so they are competitive with sedentary video games. This study
      will examine whether children's motivation to engage in AVG play may be increased with
      greater autonomy, as well as whether increasing children's motivation to play AVGs also
      increases their motivation to play sedentary video games.
