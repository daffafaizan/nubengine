      cells) from human adults and children can be reprogrammed to change their characteristics and
      become other types of cells that may be useful for disease modelling and drug screening. This
      includes the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) which can be derived
      from these somatic cells by a process known as "cellular reprogramming". These iPSCs share
      many characteristics with embryonic stem cells, including an unlimited capacity for
      proliferation and the potential to differentiate into any cell of the body. However, unlike
      embryonic stem cells, the generation of iPSCs avoids the practical and ethical difficulties
      of obtaining embryonic tissues. Consequently, cellular reprogramming and iPSC technology has
      great implications in the field of disease modelling and drug screening.

      Many obstacles must be overcome before iPSC based disease modelling and drug screening can
      fully be realised and allow replacement of inadequate animal models and simplistic cell
      models. This study will enable us to gather samples from a range of participants from
      different disease backgrounds, and to develop suitable panels of iPSCs for the purpose of
      protocol development. Development of robust protocols which are suitable for use across
      multiple iPSC lines and repeatable across multiple laboratories are essential for the use of
      iPSCs in disease modelling and drug screening. This study will allow us to look at causation
      of disease across a range of disease specific cell lines with known genetic backgrounds which
      are representative of a cohort of human patients. This is fundamental for development of iPSC
      based drug screening assays.
