      follicular-luteal phase transition generate powerful negative feedback at the pituitary
      gland, effectively switching off gonadotropin production. Without stimulation by endogenous
      luteinizing hormone (LH), the corpora lutea undergo involution and menstruation follows,
      preventing the establishment of pregnancy.

      To address these detrimental effects of ovarian stimulation, the investigators will do a RCT
      with the use of aromatase inhibitors, which suppress the conversion of androgens to estrogens
      to ameliorate the unwanted effects of high estrogens.

      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that preventing supra-physiological estrogen
      levels during ovarian stimulation restricts pituitary suppression sufficiently to allow LH
      levels to rise and support the corpora lutea, leading to a normal post-ovulatory luteal
      phase, evidenced by a normal duration and luteal phase endocrine profile. To test this,
      consenting oocyte donors will be randomized to receive co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors
      or no co-treatment during ovarian stimulation. Following oocyte retrieval, no luteal support
      will be provided to donors in both Groups.
