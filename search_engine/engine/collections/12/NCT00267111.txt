      compared with placebo (Eucerin plus) in decreasing the pain response in term neonates
      subjected to intramuscular injection for administration of vitamin K. Neonatal pain response
      between groups will be assessed using the Neonatal Facial Action Coding System (NFCS) which
      is currently the gold standard for infant pain assessment, latency to first cry and cry
      duration. Parents' (father) perception of infant's pain will be assessed using a visual
      analogue scale (VAS) when possible.

      Neonates will be randomized to receive either amethocaine gel or identical appearing placebo
      administered locally at the injection site (the upper part of the neonate's thigh) using a
      pre-prepared syringe 30 minutes prior to the administration of vitamin K. The gel or placebo
      will be covered using a Saran wrap. Each neonate will be videotaped during the procedure.
      Parents (father) will be present during the procedure (observing) so that they (he) can
      assess their neonate's pain response using VAS.
