      prevalence of overweight/obesity negatively affects the health of the population, as obese
      individuals are at increased risk for developing several chronic diseases.

      Successful control of body weight depends on effectively regulating eating. Satiation, the
      process by which an eating bout ends, assists with eating regulation, and factors that
      quicken the onset of satiation may aid with decreasing intake. One factor believed to
      influence satiation is the rate of decrease in consummatory response (habituation) to
      repeated presentations of food orosensory cues. Habituation is a basic form of learning, in
      which behavioral and physiological responses decrease in response to repeated presentations
      of a stimulus, with the decrease in response unrelated to sensory adaptation/fatigue or motor
      fatigue.

      In one condition, participants will smell lemon and lime across 12 trials (olfactory
      exposure), in another condition participants will taste the juices across 12 trials
      (gustatory exposure), and in the last condition participants will smell and taste the juices
      across 12 trials (olfactory + gustatory exposure). The primary dependent variable will be the
      amount of salivation in the 12 trials. It is hypothesized that a more rapid decrease in
      salivation will occur across trials in the combined olfactory and gustatory exposure as
      compared to the other two conditions, indicating a more rapid rate of habituation
