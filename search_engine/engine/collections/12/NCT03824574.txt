      1.5 mm thickness adapted on the patient's teeth. This is followed by the construction of
      acrylic bite ramps bonded over the splints. The bite ramps are constructed as such when the
      patient bites into occlusion, he/she has to advance the mandible to bring the two parts of
      the appliance together. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were obtained pre and
      post-treatment to evaluate the effects on the patient's maxilla, mandible and dentition.
