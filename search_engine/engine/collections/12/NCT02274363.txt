    
      This is a cross-sectional (studies in which the presence or absence of disease or other
      health-related variables are determined in each member of the study population or in a
      representative sample at one particular time), observational (clinical study in which
      participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the
      investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions), non-interventional,
      multicenter study (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study). Participants with plaque psoriasis will be followed up at specialized
      dermatology centers. Participants will undergo assessment at a single time point and all
      assessments will be conducted on the same day. Information will be collected about disease
      severity/ socioeconomic variables and demographics; clinical characteristics; treatment
      (current and past procedures and therapies to treat psoriasis); quality of life; and
      comorbidities identified after plaque psoriasis was diagnosed. The information will be
      obtained from the medical records, as requested, and during the medical interviews. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess the severity of plaque-type psoriasis.
