      undertaken at up to 170 sites internationally to evaluate the effect of OCA on clinical
      outcomes in 428 subjects with PBC. The study will include a screening period of up to 8
      weeks, requiring two clinic visits. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to
      treatment with either OCA 5 mg or matching placebo tablets, taken orally once daily for the
      majority of subjects; dose and frequency will be modified for subjects with cirrhosis and
      classified as Child-Pugh B or C. Randomization will be stratified by standard treatment with
      UDCA (yes/no) and baseline liver function. The treatment period involves clinic visits
      approximately every 3 months. At the 3 month visit or any study visit thereafter, if study
      treatment is tolerated, participants' dose should be titrated per protocol in a blinded
      manner eg for participants who are non-cirrhotic or classified as Child-Pugh A and randomized
      to OCA, they should receive the maximum daily dose of 10 mg OCA, those on placebo continue to
      receive placebo. Subsequently, daily dosage may return to 5 mg if necessary for these
      participants who are non-cirrhotic or classified as Child-Pugh A, but should be increased to
      10 mg if possible, based on tolerability and clinical judgment. Safety and tolerability will
      be assessed by monitoring adverse events and vital signs, and blood and urine testing. The
      study is event driven and total duration will be determined by the time required to accrue
      approximately 127 primary endpoint events, estimated to be approximately 10 years. Subjects
      are expected to have a minimum follow-up time of approximately 6 years.
