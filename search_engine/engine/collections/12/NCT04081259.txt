      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      LY3214996 is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor that is being developed
      as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. ERK inhibitors stop the signal that a
      cancer cell receives telling it to grow. In this research study, the investigators are
      testing to see if LY3214996 is a safe treatment for AML that has returned or not responded to
      standard treatment. Several doses of the study drug will be explored in this study.
