      80 people who were identified and accepted to study were divided into two groups as
      experiment and control. Initially, pre-menstrual screening tool, interpersonal relationship
      dimensions scale and perceived stress scale were applied to all groups. Then, 8 sessions of
      interpersonal counseling, each lasting 40 minutes, were applied to the experimental group for
      2 months. Scales were repeated for both groups after the application was completed. Repeated
      measurements were made 3 months later.
