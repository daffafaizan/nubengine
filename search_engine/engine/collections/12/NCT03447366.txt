    
      Mitral Doppler will be performed before vascular filling. Patients will be classified in two
      groups (normal or high cardiac filling pressure).

      The evolution of the respiratory data (SpO2/FiO2) of the two groups of the patients before
      and after vascular filling will be compared.
