      caregivers of patients with progressive dementia and to test the efficacy of an intervention
      designed to reduce stress and sleep disturbances. We will compare the efficacy of a Stress
      Management Plus Health Sleep Practices (SM+HSP) intervention to an attention-only control
      condition in spousal caregivers of patients with progressive dementia.

      Specific Aims for this study are:

      Aim 1: To characterize stress-related sleep disruptions in spousal caregivers of patients
      with progressive dementia.

      Aim 2: To test the short-term efficacy of a Stress Management Plus Healthy Sleep Practices
      (SM+HSP) intervention versus an attention-only control for improving sleep and health
      outcomes in caregivers of patients with progressive dementia.

      Aim 3: To test the durability of the SM+HSP intervention among spousal caregivers of patients
      with progressive dementia.

      Aim 4: To characterize:

        1. the impact of stress-related sleep disruptions on health in older adults, and

        2. the effects of sleep interventions on health and functioning.
