    
      Principal objective :

      To determine whether chronic sleep restriction affects more snorers driving performances than
      healthy subjects' driving performances.

      To determine whether chronic sleep restriction affects more young people driving performances
      than mature subjects' driving performances.

      Secondary objective :

      To determine whether chronic sleep restriction affects more snorers reaction time performance
      and sleepiness than non snorers subjects'.

      To determine whether chronic sleep restriction affects more young people reaction time
      performance and sleepiness than mature subjects'.

      To determine how age and snoring intensity affects the degradation of performance over the 5
      days of sleep deprivation.

      To determine age-related changes in the time course of sleepiness during 5 days of chronic
      sleep restriction.

      To compare the impact of total sleep or chronic sleep restriction on driving performances
      according to the age and snoring intensity.

      To determine recovery facilities to chronic sleep restriction according to the age and
      snoring intensity.

      Study plan :

      G2: Group of subjects:

        -  patients

        -  controls

      B1: Baseline normal night:

      One night of normal sleep

      A2: Acute sleep deprivation:

      Night 1: night of total sleep deprivation Night 2: night of sleep recovery

      C6: Chronic sleep deprivation:

      Night 1 to 5: nights of sleep restriction Night 6: night of sleep recovery

      Experimental plan : S20 <G2> *B1 * A2 *C6
