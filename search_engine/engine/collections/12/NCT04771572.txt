    
      Primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability profile, determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-118
      administered once daily (QD) as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory NHL, RT, MM, T-PLL (Group 1) and acute leukemia (AML, ALL), MDS, MDS/MPN,
      MF (Group 2).

      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect
      of LP-118 on objective response rate (ORR) using disease specific response criteria,
      progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) in
      adult subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL, RT, MM, T-PLL (Group 1); and acute leukemia
      (AML, ALL), MDS, MDS/MPN, MF (Group 2
