      Among HF patients, prevalence of attention impairment is reported as 15-27%. Attention is
      fundamental to human activities including HF self-care. However, cognitive interventions
      focusing on attention are scarce in HF. The investigators developed a new cognitive
      intervention with immersive virtual reality technology and created a prototype of the virtual
      reality-based natural restorative environment intervention (Nature-VR). The prototype was
      feasible and showed larger effects in improving attention among 10 HF patients.

      In this 2-group randomized controlled pilot study, specific aims are to: 1) examine
      preliminary efficacy of Nature-VR compared with Urban-VR on improving attention; 2) examine
      preliminary efficacy of Nature-VR compared with Urban-VR on HF self-care and health-related
      quality of life; and 3) explore possible biomarkers of attention in HF. This study is
      important and novel because this is the first intervention study targeting attention using
      virtual reality technology and investigating possible biomarkers associated with attention in
      HF patients.
