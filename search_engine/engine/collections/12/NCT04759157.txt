      and sleep health among older couples. The focus of this study is patient who are starting
      CPAP treatment and their partners. Couples will be randomized to a 3-session sleep health
      intervention delivered via telehealth or to standard educational support for CPAP. The
      intervention is based on a transdiagnostic model of sleep and circadian disorders (TransS-C)
      and rooted in the idea that older adults with OSA are often also having other sleep problems,
      and that OSA is best treated in the couples context.
