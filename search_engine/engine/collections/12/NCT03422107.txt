      during various kinds of cardiac surgeries. To attain this objective, we have three specific
      aims. Firstly, surgical insults such as excessive or asymmetric sternal retraction have long
      been regarded as the main causes of PNI. Therefore, we will investigate this by comparing
      cardiac surgeries with sternotomy to the ones without sternotomy. Secondly, more and more
      cardiac surgeons utilize minimally invasive techniques these days. In the current study, we
      will investigate the incidence, mechanisms and patterns of PNI in minimally invasive cardiac
      surgeries by comparing conventional surgeries to minimally invasive surgeries. Thirdly,
      recent studies have suggested systematic insults such as ischemia, inflammation, and
      underlying neuropathy might play more prominent roles in the mechanism of PNI. In this study,
      we will analyze various factors such as intraoperative hemodynamics and baseline patient
      characteristics to pinpoint the most responsible factors.

      Background The studies regarding mechanisms of PNI in cardiac surgeries have not been done
      over the past few decades. With respect to minimally invasive cardiac surgeries, no studies
      have been done to investigate the mechanism of PNI.

      Regarding the device used in this study The conventional SSEP device is large in size,
      invasive, and requires expertise to interpret. These characteristics have prevented its use
      in the operating room. This new portable SSEP device is devoid of these properties.

      Significance Identification of causative insults will help clinicians to recognize and
      possibly prevent PNI during cardiac surgeries.
