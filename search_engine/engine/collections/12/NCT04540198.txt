      "intense caregiving" and is associated with significant daily burdens and an overall threat
      to the caregiver's quality of life. Despite evidence suggesting that negative consequence can
      be remediated with community-based supports, those services remain allusive to caregivers due
      to the systemic challenges of turning interventions into services. This study is based on a
      practical approach of applying technology to an existing evidence-based intervention,
      Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II (REACH II), refined with real-world
      user feedback and rigorously tested with the goal of creating an online family caregiver
      support system that has the potential of both scalability and sustainability. This two-group
      randomized controlled trial will compare the relative impact of GP4C to an education-based
      online site called Resources4Care (R4C) on a wide range of family caregiver outcomes. Family
      caregivers will be randomized to one of the two conditions and will complete an assessment
      battery at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up.
