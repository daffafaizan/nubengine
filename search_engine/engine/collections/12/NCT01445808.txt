      and effective measure for reducing mortality substantially. Major targets are the improvement
      of physical activity and dietary habits, smoking cessation and stress reduction. Despite the
      effectiveness of life style changes, the compliance rate of patients is very low. To improve
      compliance with life style change programs psychotherapeutic interventions appear to have
      significant potential. Against this background our study aims to examine the effectiveness of
      a Psychodynamic Motivation and Training Program (PMT) in addition to one session of advice in
      exercise training based on the results of spiroergometry (+EX) and usual cardiological care
      (TAU). PMT will be compared with +Ex and TAU. N = 90 patients with stable coronary artery
      disease class, low physical activity, class I to III angina pectoris will be randomly
      assigned to the three treatment conditions. The Primary efficacy endpoint is change in the
      anaerobic threshold from baseline to 6 month follow-up. The results of the study will 1) help
      to determine the effectiveness of a psychodynamic life style change programs for the
      secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and 2) will help to identify measures for
      designing specifically tailored interventions to improve compliance with cardiovascular
      prevention.
