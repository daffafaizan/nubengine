      to determine the effect of instructional online videos on medication administration on
      psychological well being during controlled ovarian stimulation.

      The investigators hypothesize that usage of online instructional videos by women undergoing
      their first cycle of controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization or oocyte
      cryopreservation improves measures of psychological well-being (Infertility Self Efficacy
      Scale, FertiQoL-T and Perceived stress scores) when compared to subjects that do not have
      access to this educational resource.
