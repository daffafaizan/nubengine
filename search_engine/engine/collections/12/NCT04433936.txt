      enrolled. Diagnosis of TGD was based on history, clinical examination and laboratory
      investigations. Exclusion criteria included previous thyroid medications, thyroidectomy,
      previous ocular surgery, corneal pathology and other risk factors of keratoconus (KC). All
      eyes were examined by Pentacam, (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Pentacam
      parameters were compared between TGD patients and controls. Spearman's correlation
      coefficient between different pentacam parameters and the level of free T4 and TSH was
      calculated.
