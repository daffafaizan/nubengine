      Cognitive dysfunction (e.g in attention, memory, etc.) is an enduring feature of the illness,
      a strong predictor of functional outcome, and presently has no established treatment.
      Therefore, advances in treatment of cognition in schizophrenia are likely to alleviate a
      significant health burden. Deficits in executive control functions, such as those measurable
      on task-switching paradigms, are among the most important cognitive deficits in
      schizophrenia, and arise from disturbances in distributed neural networks operated by the
      prefrontal cortex. An important phenomenon that underpins cortical information processing are
      oscillations in brain activity that can be measured both with intracranial electrical
      recordings and at the scalp with EEG. These networks and their cortical oscillatory
      signatures are also strongly modulated by cortical interneurons that use gamma-amino butyric
      acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. Post-mortem evidence suggests that GABAergic neurons are
      altered in schizophrenia. Furthermore, studies in animals, using optogenetic manipulations
      that are restricted to a subset of cortical GABA neurons, also suggest that GABA neurons can
      be selectively modulated to improve PFC-dependent cognition in animal models of
      schizophrenia. This includes experiments that involve administration of sub-sedating doses of
      clonazepam, a representative FDA-approved medication from the benzodiazepine class.

      Therefore, this neurochemical system represents a novel set of candidate treatment targets
      that are both implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the potential
      remediation of associated cognitive dysfunction.
