      containing physical exercise and home improvement are available.

      In this study the crucial question was to test whether unlicensed staff, assistant nurses,
      could be used for preventive work.

      Estimation of study power gave that 170 participants in each group would be needed to detect
      a difference in days with falls, the main outcome measure.
