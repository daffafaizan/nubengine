      implementing a well-formulated low carbohydrate lifestyle program over 2 years. Positive
      therapeutic effects would be represented by improved glycemic control in patients with type 2
      diabetes without use of additional glycemic control medications and failure to progress to
      type 2 diabetes in individuals with pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

      Secondary purposes of this research are to determine if therapeutic effects of the
      intervention differ between patients who self-select onsite vs. web-based education delivery,
      explore relationships between change in LDL cholesterol and carotid intima media thickness,
      and to evaluate the sustainability of health outcomes achieved and the economic impact of
      therapeutic effects over 5 years.
