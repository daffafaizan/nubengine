    
      HYPOTHESIS.:

      A proportion of patients admitted to the Hospital with a diagnosis of Aortic Syndrome without
      phenotypic characteristics are carriers of mutations. The presence of these mutations can
      condition both the indication for treatment, post-surgical aortic remodeling, and family
      traceability.

      OBJECTIVE.:

      The objective of this study is to analyze the prevalence of mutations in non-phenotypic
      patients admitted urgently due to Aortic Syndrome.

      Material and method:

      Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Virgen del Rocio University Hospital in
      Seville (third level Hospital) with the diagnosis of Aortic Syndrome will be included. The
      clinical and angiographic variables were analyzed. All patients will undergo, with prior
      informed consent, a peripheral blood extraction, from which a DNA sample will be obtained
      using the ChemagicTM 360 equipment. This DNA will be processed for massive sequencing on
      Illumina's NextSeq500 platform using the technology Capture SeqCap EZ Choice Library
      NimbleGen. The data generated will be analyzed bioinformatically and the identified variants
      prioritized based on their population frequency (<0.01), location (exonic and close to
      splicing sites), their presence in databases of clinical significance ClinVar, HGMD and LOVD
      and the phenotypic association of the mutated gene OMIM and Orphanet.
