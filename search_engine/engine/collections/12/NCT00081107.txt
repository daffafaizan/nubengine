      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of epothilone D, in terms of confirmed objective
           response rate, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer who failed
           prior initial platinum-containing chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response duration in patients who achieve complete response or partial
           response, time to tumor progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare the power associated with the estimated treatment effect of this drug in these
           patients vs standard treatment.

        -  Correlate efficacy and safety with plasma concentrations of this drug and its major
           metabolites in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive epothilone D IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33-85 patients will be accrued for this study.
