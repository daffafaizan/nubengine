        1. Primary Objective: To examine if in children with acute asthma remaining in moderate to
           severe respiratory distress despite maximized initial bronchodilator and steroid therapy
           there is a reduction in hospitalization rate from the ED in those who receive nebulized
           Mg with salbutamol versus those receiving salbutamol only.

           Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the children with Pediatric Respiratory
           Assessment Measure (PRAM) ≥ 5 points after optimized initial inhaled bronchodilator and
           oral steroid therapies who are given nebulized Mg in addition to nebulized salbutamol
           will have significantly lower hospitalization rate within 24 hours of starting the study
           compared to those given salbutamol only.

        2. To compare a difference in the changes in the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment
           Measure (PRAM), respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure from
           randomization baseline to 240 minutes in the two groups

        3. To determine if there is a significant association between the difference in the primary
           outcome between the groups and the patient's age, gender, baseline PRAM score, personal
           history of atopy and "viral-induced wheeze" phenotype.

      Hypothesis(es) to be Tested In this randomized, double-blind seven-centre trial, the
      investigators hypothesize that children with acute asthma with a Pediatric Respiratory
      Assessment Measure (PRAM) of ≥ 5 points after optimized initial inhaled bronchodilator and
      oral steroid therapies who are given nebulized Mg in addition to nebulized salbutamol will
      have at least a 10% lower hospitalization rate within 24 hours of starting the study as
      compared to those given salbutamol only.
