    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the viral load, safety, tolerability, and clinical
      efficacy of RV521 compared to placebo. This is a Phase 2, international, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Up to 200 adult subjects with a
      documented symptomatic RSV URTI who have undergone HCT within 1 year of randomization and who
      are moderately to severely immunocompromised will be randomized.

      Qualified subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive RV521 capsules or matching
      placebo twice daily for 10 days. After the completion of the 10-day double-blind treatment
      period, subjects will be followed for an additional 28 days. Study drug may be taken on an
      outpatient or inpatient basis, depending on clinical status and site practices. Randomization
      will be stratified by type of HCT graft and ALC count. There are 9 clinic visits planned for
      this study.
