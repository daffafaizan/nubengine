      by selecting treatment for patients that is individualized based on the hENT1 biomarker.
      Gemcitabine (gem) requires human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) to enter
      cells. If a pancreatic cancer has low hENT1, gem will not be able to enter cells efficiently.
      5-fluorouracil (5FU) does not require the same transport into cells. Thus, upfront hENT1
      testing will allow determination of therapy.
