      consisting of skin and cartilage, of the alar lobule of the nose. In reconstruction of these
      defects, a combination of local flaps and autologous cartilage, typically harvested from the
      nasal septum or the ear, is used to restore the stability, function and proper 3D shape of
      the alar lobule. Harvesting autologous cartilage from the ear has been associated with a
      number of complications that could be overcome by the use of engineered cartilage graft
      generated in vitro with autologous cells.

      This study is a phase I, prospective, uncontrolled, investigator initiated clinical trial
      involving 5 patients, with the objective of demonstrating safety and feasibility in the use
      of engineered nasal cartilage grafts. The specific surgical target of the trial is the
      reconstruction of a two layer defect of the alar lobule using a tissue engineered nasal
      cartilage graft and a local flap, following resection of a non melanoma skin cancer.
