    
      Primary goal of this study is to Evaluate the characteristics of regulatory networks of iron
      and redox balance in leukemic cells, to study the correlations between the prognosis of AML
      patients (in terms of response to induction chemotherapy and survival i) and metabolism of
      these markers. Secondary ones areto assess the impact of induction therapy on markers of
      oxidative stress and to correlate biological iron and redox metabolism with the molecular
      status of patients (eg Flt3/IDH/CEBPA/NPM...).

      Eligibility criteria are patients at diagnostic of de novo acute myeloid leukemia
      (promyelocytic excluded) aged from 18 to 100 years.
