      received GSK2248761 while enrolled in the Phase 2b studies SGN113399 or SGN113404 evaluating
      GSK2248761. There will be no formal hypotheses tested, and the data collected will be
      utilized to build individual subject narratives for each subject.

      All subjects who were previously randomized in the Phase 2b studies SGN113399 or SGN113404
      and received GSK2248761, will be targeted for enrollment in the study. Study SGN11339 had 20
      subjects randomized to receive GSK2248761 and was conducted at 12 sites in the United States
      and one site in Romania. Study SGN113404 was conducted at three sites in France and three
      sites in Germany, with 15 subjects randomized to receive GSK2248761. Therefore, the study
      population for the current study will consist of 35 subjects originating from sites located
      in the United States, Romania, France, and Germany.

      All subjects enrolled in this study previously received GSK2248761 in one of the Phase 2b
      clinical trials SGN113399 or SGN113404 of GSK2248761 for the treatment of HIV. This study
      will collect clinical and safety data on all subjects. Data from these subjects' medical
      charts will be collected from the point of termination of the Phase 2b clinical trials. Any
      subject who experienced any seizure during the Phase 2b clinical trial will be followed for
      two years. Subjects who experienced no seizure during the Phase 2b clinical trial will be
      followed for one year. In the event that a subject who did not previously have a seizure
      experiences a seizure during the study period, the subject will be moved to the "seizure
      subject group" that is being followed for two years. Data collection will occur on a
      quarterly basis for all subjects.

      No formal analyses will be performed. All data collected for each subject will be
      incorporated into a narrative of the subject's medical events during the follow-up period.
      The narrative will recreate the clinical course and evolution of disease history for the
      subjects and allow assessment for evidence of residual or new adverse events potentially
      related to their exposure to GSK2248761. Listings of AEs will be generated for each subject.
      Data on AEs collected quarterly will be combined with the subject's demographic and medical
      history details in the listing reports. The listings will be delivered to GSK every six
      months in coordination with the safety advisory committee meetings.
