      Healthy Lifestyles clinic. First, families attend a half-day session at the clinic where
      child anthropometrics and labs are obtained, and nutrition and physical activity group
      counseling is provided. Height and weight of the primary adult caregiver are measured and BMI
      is calculated. Second, families return 2 weeks later to meet individually with a pediatric
      obesity medical provider and a registered dietitian. Thereafter, frequency of visits is
      determined based on the families needs with a final visit 1 year after starting treatment.
      The ideal is to have visits with the HL staff at intervals of 4-6 weeks for 5 more visits to
      complete the primary phase of the program over 6 months.

      Parents enrolled in the study will also receive the Track intervention. The investigators
      will use a modified version of the Track intervention, which utilized the Interactive Obesity
      Treatment Approach (iOTA). iOTA uses a computer algorithm to assign 3-4 personalized
      behavioral goals known to create an energy deficit to produce weight loss (e.g., sugary
      drinks, fast food consumption walk 10,000 steps/day, etc). The team at Duke Digital Health
      has shown that iOTA can be successfully delivered to adults on multiple modalities -- web,
      text messaging and interactive voice response phone calls. Each week, participants will
      receive a prompt from the Track intervention system in order to self-monitoring these
      behaviors goals. These prompts will be delivered either via interactive voice response or
      text message. Intervention participants will also receive an analog bathroom scale and a
      pedometer to self-monitor daily weights and steps.
