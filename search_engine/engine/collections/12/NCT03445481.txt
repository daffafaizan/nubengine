      the hospital's protocol. The surgical intervention will be performed under general or spinal
      anesthesia with a tourniquet at the root of the lower limb. Under sterile conditions, the
      incision of the stump will be done at the level of the previous surgical scar. Preserving the
      soft tissue, the distal femoral bone is reached. Then, the medullary canal is opened and
      prepared with reamers of increasing diameter. A femoral cemented stem of appropriate
      dimensions correlated to the size of the canal and 105 mm of height is implanted. To the
      above-mentioned stem, the Medacta prosthesis will be fixed with a blocking screw. The
      prosthesis is then covered with the soft tissue and layered suturing of the stump is
      performed.
