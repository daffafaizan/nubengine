      administering CapeOx in 10 patients. After completion of this run-in, immune environment
      characterizing and response data will be analysed, and it will determine how CapeOx is
      influencing the tumor immunologically. CapeOx + Pembrolizumab administered until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal.

             -  Cycle 1 Only CapeOX monotherapy

             -  Cycle 2 up to Cycle 8 CapeOX + pembrolizumab therapy

             -  Cycle 9 up to Cycle 35 Capecitabine + pembrolizumab therapy

        2. CapeOx+Pembrolizumab therapy (N=68)

             -  Cycle 1 up to Cycle 8 CapeOX + pembrolizumab therapy

             -  Cycle 9 up to Cycle 35 Capecitabine + pembrolizumab therapy : CapeOx +
                Pembrolizumab administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
