      inhibitors (SRIs) and a type of cognitive behavioral therapy called exposure and response
      prevention (EX/RP). But more than a third of patients with OCD do not respond to these
      treatments, and less then half become well. Thus, new treatment approaches are needed.

      EX/RP is thought to involve fear extinction learning. Recent research suggests that
      modulators of the endocannabinoid system such as nabilone (a synthetic cannabinoid and
      agonist of the cannabinoid 1 receptor, CB1R) may enhance fear extinction learning and
      therefor could enhance EX/RP. However, nabilone could also work via modulating activity in
      cortico-striatal circuits, which contain high concentrations of CB1R, and thereby might
      reduce repetitive behaviors like compulsions seen in OCD.

      To test both ideas, we will conduct a small pilot randomized trial to explore the effects of
      nabilone on its own for 4 weeks, vs. combined with EX/RP, in adult patients with OCD. This
      proof-of-concept study will investigate whether nabilone administration is feasible and
      well-tolerated in adult patients with OCD. The intent is to collect pilot data to support
      future grant applications.
