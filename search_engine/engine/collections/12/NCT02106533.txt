      expressed as the minute ventilation/ carbon dioxide production ratio have been validated to
      be useful in assessing the presence and severity of both heart and lung diseases. In this
      context, previous studies have showed ventilatory inefficiency in patients with coronary
      artery disease suggests abnormalities in the distribution of ventilation and perfusion in the
      lungs. In addition, a growing body of studies has demonstrated that lower ventilatory
      efficiency during exercise is considered an important predictor of risk mortality,
      hospitalization, and other outcomes than peak VO2.
