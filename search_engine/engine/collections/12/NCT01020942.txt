      approximately one third of cases.Troponin release is a sensitive and specific marker of
      myocyte necrosis and infarction resulting from a form of ischemia/reperfusion injury,
      downstream embolization of atheromatous material, and coronary side-branch occlusion. A
      number of studies have demonstrated that procedure-related troponin release is associated
      with subsequent cardiovascular events.

      Transient sublethal episodes of ischemia before a prolonged ischemia/reperfusion injury,
      known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial
      infarction (MI).Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulus, as a pretreatment method, limits MI size in
      animal models. However, there are limited outcome to demonstrate protection from EA
      pretreatment during PCI. The present study investigated the ability of EA pretreatment to
      attenuate cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release after elective PCI in a single-center, randomized
      controlled trial.
