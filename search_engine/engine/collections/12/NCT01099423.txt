        -  To determine if immediate versus deferred nephrectomy has an effect on disease control
           in patients with resectable, synchronous, metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with
           sunitinib malate.

        -  To identify potential response criteria based on histopathology and molecular research
           on tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to WHO performance
      status (0 vs 1), number of metastatic sites (1 vs 2 or more), and institution. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (immediate nephrectomy): Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy. Beginning 4
           weeks after surgery, patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28.
           Treatment with sunitinib malate repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (deferred nephrectomy): Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days
           1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. About 1 day after completion of sunitinib malate,
           patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy. Patients then receive oral sunitinib malate
           once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients undergo tumor tissue collection at baseline and at time of surgery to assess
      possible differences in gene expression. Patients also undergo blood sample collection
      periodically to evaluate the potential impact of serum proteins on the clinical outcome.
      Samples are then stored for future studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
