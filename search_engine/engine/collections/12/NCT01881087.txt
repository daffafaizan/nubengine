      arthroscopy will be randomly allocated to receive unilateral spinal anesthesia with 7.5
      (group Levo-7.5, n=59), 9.37(group Levo-9.37, n=61) and 11.25 (group Levo-11.25, n=60) mg of
      HLBP 0.75% using a 27-gauge Whitacre needle at a rate of 0.1 ml/ seg. and lateral decubitus
      position maintained for 5 min after injection.

      An independent observer will evaluate motor (modified Bromage scale) and sensory
      (transcutaneal electrical stimulation at T10, L1, L3, and S1 dermal segments) levels and
      presence of adverse events immediately after return to supine, at the end of surgery and each
      10 min from admission to PACU until home discharge conditions.

      Trans-cutaneal electrical stimulation (TES) will be made with a PNS (MinistimÂ® model MS- IV,
      Organon, Dublin, Irland) using 50-Hz tetanus stimuli for 5 seg. from 10 to 60 mA 3,4.
