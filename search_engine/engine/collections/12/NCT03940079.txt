      during the experiment: baseline, pretest, posttest, and follow-up. After the baseline
      assessment, participants were randomized to two groups: gross-motor group (GMG) and
      fine-motor group (FMG). The intervals between baseline and pretest as well as between pretest
      and posttest were both 4 weeks, while the interval between posttest and follow-up was 8
      weeks.

      The investigators developed a computer-based cognitive game and compared the efficacy of
      cognitive and motor functions between computer-based cognitive game combining two different
      demands on motor control. Investigators hypothesized: All participants who take part in the
      computer-based cognitive game training don't have learning effects on pretest and are able to
      improve cognitive functions including short-term memory, divided attention and inhibitory
      function after intervention; Gross-motor group make more progress than fine-motor group on
      cognitive and motor functions after intervention. Furthermore, gross-motor group maintained
      more training effect over cognitive and motor functions at follow-up than fine-motor group.
