      1 Diabetes using the FMPD Insulin plus Glucagon Delivery Algorithm vs. the FMPD Insulin-Alone
      Algorithm. Subjects will undergo two 28-hour sensor-augmented glycemic control studies. Each
      subject will be fitted with two short term continuous glucose monitoring systems and two
      subcutaneous (SC) infusion catheters. These catheters will allow for SC delivery of insulin
      and glucagon (or insulin plus a glucagon placebo). The accuracy of the wire sensors will be
      verified every 10 minutes with a venous blood glucose test. For the first 4 hours, the
      insulin and glucagon delivery will be controlled by venous blood in order to assess and
      compare the accuracy of the two sensors, after which the more accurate sensor (if it remains
      accurate) will control the FMPD algorithm. The main outcomes of our study are time spent in
      the target range (70 - 180 mg/dl) and the percentage of studies requiring intervention due to
      hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dl). The accuracy of the sensors over the life of the study
      will also be evaluated.

      The specific system used in this study of frequent blood testing and the use of two separate
      infusion pumps is not feasible for every day use for individuals with diabetes. However, if
      the glucose control algorithm (with or without the use of glucagon) provides effective blood
      glucose management over long time periods the calculation program may be integrated into a
      continuous blood glucose monitoring system with an insulin and glucagon pump.
