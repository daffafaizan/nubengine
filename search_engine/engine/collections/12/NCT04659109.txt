      phase II study evaluates the efficacy and safety of glenzocimab in ARDS.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility and all tests should have results prior to any
      randomization, so as to avoid screening failures to a maximum extent. The turn-around time
      for these tests should be comprised within 24hrs to allow for rapid inclusions if needed.
      Eligible patients (n=68) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to glenzocimab or placebo. Patient
      inclusions will be fractioned into sequential (3-day apart) cohorts of growing size (2, 4
      then 6 patients), each balanced between glenzocimab and placebo in order to check safety in a
      gradual manner. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet after 12 patients will have
      been accrued, and again after the first 30 patients.

      Glenzocimab will be administered by IV infusion. The dosing regimen will be 1000mg for 3
      days. All patients will receive in parallel the best medical care at the discretion of the
      investigating center, or per local guidelines. The allocation of each patient in any given
      center to an active treatment or placebo will strictly follow a central randomization scheme.
      The study period will be of a maximum of 40 days per patient. Patients will be closely
      monitored during the first 7 days following randomization with complete evaluations being
      performed at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs, then on Days 4 (96 hrs), 5 (120 hrs), 7 (+/-1 day), 14
      (+/-2 days), 20 (+/-2 days), 40 (+/-3 days). Should a patient being discharged before Day 40,
      distant consultations by telemedicine may be undertaken if it is not deemed desirable that
      the patient comes back to the institution.
