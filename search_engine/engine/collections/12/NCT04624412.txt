      mental function by maximising cardio respiratory fitness and reduces the risk of multiple
      chronic diseases.

      Aerobic exercise is the type of physical activity that accelerates and maintain fitness, well
      being and quality of life of human being. Aerobic means in presence of oxygen and is based on
      the power generating process by the utilization of oxygen as a major fuel to cope up the
      energy demands during sustained physical activity. During Aerobic exercise lungs get more
      efficient by enhancing their breathing capacity which leads to the removal of carbon dioxide
      and maximal utilization of oxygen and improvement of its transport to lungs and muscles by
      circulating blood. Aerobic is the form of exercise which helps in oxygen transportation and
      absorption while enhancing the efficiency of cardiovascular system. Long term aerobic
      exercises significantly affect the structure of heart and improve stroke volume of heart.

      Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness and leads towards the inability of muscles to perform
      physically. It is mostly complained during cardiovascular disease and affects the functioning
      and quality of life in cardiac patients.

      Mental well-being is an important constituent of health. Good mental health proves to be
      beneficial for patients' recovery and independency in activities of daily living. Chronic
      diseases have a very strong association with mental disorder.

      Mindfulness is the ability to be fully alert and mental presence in the moment. Physical
      training boosts the mindfulness by enhancing the functioning of anterior cingulate cortex
      that has been linked to the improvement of self-regulation and attention. Aerobic exercises
      can improve the mood mindfulness.
