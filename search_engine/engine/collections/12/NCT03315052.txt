    
      This study will be a randomized, open-label non-inferiority trial to assess the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of budesonide in combination with low-dose FK and standard-dose MMF
      as post-OLT ISP in comparison to standard ISP (S-ISP). Subjects will include OLT patients age
      18 years and older receiving their first single-organ living- or deceased-donor liver
      transplant. Subjects must have post-operative recovery of graft function and be able to take
      oral medications before beginning treatment according to the study protocol.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either (1) investigational oral ISP including
      budesonide 9mg by mouth in three daily divided doses, FK with an initial target trough level
      of no greater than 5-6ng/mL, and MMF (I-ISP); or (2) S-ISP including prednisone, calcineurin
      antagonist, and MMF. After randomization, subjects will be followed for a total of 52 weeks
      and assessed for adequacy of graft function, and complications of therapy, particularly ACR
