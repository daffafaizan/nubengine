      fracture will be asked to join the trial. After informed consent we will do a randomization
      between 6 weeks above elbow cast and 3 weeks above elbow cast in combination with 3 weeks
      under elbow cast.

      Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will
      investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complaints in
      daily living and complications.
