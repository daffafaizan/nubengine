      mutation, but reducing dose occurring in some patients because of the drug related
      side-effects. Thus, we sought to investigate that in Chinese patients with EGFR mutation
      whether low dose (100mg) Erlotinib had similar efficacy but lower toxcities compared with
      standad dose (150mg) Erlotinib.
