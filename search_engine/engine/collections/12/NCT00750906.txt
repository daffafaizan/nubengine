      doses of succinylcholine. Serum potassium and creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels will be
      determined pre and post anesthesia; serum and urine myoglobin will be determined post
      anesthesia. Vital signs data [i.e., heart rate (arrhythmias) and arterial blood pressure]
      will be compared pre and post anesthesia. In addition patients will be asked about the
      presence of muscle pain (myalgia) 1 hour before discharge from the recovery room and the
      following day post ECT.
