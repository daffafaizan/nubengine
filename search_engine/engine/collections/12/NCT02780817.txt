      extensively used to evaluate the concept of motor adaptation. By inducing a systematic
      perturbation on the hand, it is possible to examine the implicit motor response on the
      trajectory of the hand. Error-augmentation (EA) training is relatively new concept in motor
      learning intended to promote the adaptation process. Applying these perturbating forces on
      the hand shift the hand trajectory form the straight line to a curve like shape. Making
      repetitive movement under the same conditions will results in a gradual correction of this
      faulty movement trajectory toward the straight line, e.g. motor adaptation.

      Participants: Healthy volunteers, aged 20-50, males and females. The participants will be
      randomly assigned into two groups: study or control group.

      Procedure: One practice session of 25 minutes on 3D robotic device. The study group will
      carry out the session with EA forces. The control group will carry out the same training
      without the EA forces.

      Outcome Measures: Size of trajectory error from the straight line, level of exertion.
