      with Chemotherapy has been the first line treatment regimen to advanced NSCLC. Clinical data
      proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could
      suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human
      genome. China NCCN colon or rectal cancer clinical practice guideline recommends Chemotherapy
      plus angiogenesis inhibitor as the first line treatment scheme. So we design FOLFOX4 plus
      Endostar to treat advanced colorectal cancer to research the RR and safety. We believe this
      treatment regimen may be a new approach to the advanced colorectal cancer patients.
