      Subjective photopic refraction and visual acuity were measured before light was turned off
      and mesopic refraction was obtained after a dark adaptation period of five minutes. Finally,
      frames and lenses were fitted by a centration system. Lens grinding was executed centralized
      by a grinding workshop. In the course of this study, subjects were randomly assigned to wear
      two glasses double-masked in turn. One with photopic subjective refraction data and another
      with mesopic subjective refraction data. Both were worn for 14 Â± 2 days each.

      Follow Up 1:

      After two weeks, participants were asked for their subjective experiences with the first
      correction by a visual analogue scale questionnaire. After the evaluation, glasses were
      changed.

      Follow Up 2:

      Two weeks later, subjective experiences were evaluated again. After visual analogue scale
      questionnaire, subjects were asked to compare the two glasses concerning quality of mesopic
      vision and subjective safety level during night driving.
