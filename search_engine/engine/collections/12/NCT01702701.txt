      on the rise, and has limited treatment options. Current gold standard of treatment is with
      topical steroids (swallowed fluticasone). There is preliminary data that oral montelukast may
      prove to be effective in inducing and maintaining symptomatic along with histologic remission
      of this disease. Investigators will be comparing the effectiveness of singulair to swallowed
      fluticasone in inducing and maintaining histologic and symptomatic remission of eosinophilic
      esophagitis.
