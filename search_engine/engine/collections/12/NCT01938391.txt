    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm (non-randomized), post-market study which will enroll
      up to 25 subjects. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and angiography will be used to
      assess procedural outcomes in patients who have symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are
      treated with the Sponsor's OAS and adjunctive balloon angioplasty. An independent IVUS Core
      Lab will be used to provide adjudicated analyses for IVUS outcomes. In clinic follow-up
      visits will be performed at 2 weeks, 6 months and at 12 months.
