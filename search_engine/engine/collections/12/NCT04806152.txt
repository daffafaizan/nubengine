      (grip strength and walk speed) and persons with sarcopenia were identified using the European
      Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older Persons (EWGSOP) algorithm for case finding (N=1344). Of
      the 77 seniors with sarcopenia, 38 consented to participate and were randomly allocated to
      receive 6 months combined-modality high intensity treadmill based exercise and a 'usual care'
      home exercise programme. A comparison of the effects of treatment assignment on muscle mass,
      function, fitness, physical activity level and disability was done. Participants in the
      supervised combined-modality high intensity group were required to attend sessions 3 times
      per week; participants in the home exercise programme were required to attend 1 supervised
      session at the start of their 6-month intervention. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at
      the end of the 6-month intervention. Data were analysed using standard statistical parametric
      and non-parametric methods including repeated measures analysis of variance to determine
      changes in outcomes and regression to establish determinants of outcomes.
