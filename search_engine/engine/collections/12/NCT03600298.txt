      Management (CRM) strategy thought to be effective for enhancing patient safety by enforcing
      reiteration and clarity, thus reducing ambiguity during verbal communication among health
      care providers. The transfer of this CRM strategy into clinical practice seems to require
      recurring exposure. Teaching and training is needed to help health care providers develop
      routine in communicating. This training is most effective if practiced in the clinical
      setting that is familiar to the health care provider (in situ simulation). As trainees become
      more proficient, the ultimate goal is to integrate Closed-Loop Communication into daily
      habits of verbal interaction in every health care setting. One way to practice the
      utilization of Closed-Loop Communication is simulation. The investigators seek to investigate
      if simulation participants can incorporate CRM strategies such as Closed-Loop Communication
      into their communication repertoire. This shall serve as an example of attitude transfer
      following a simulation based learning experience.The primary study objective is to measure
      the success of simulation training for increasing Closed-Loop Communication as a behavioural
      change in the clinical setting.
