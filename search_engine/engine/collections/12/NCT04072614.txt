      often involves associated symptoms, including anosognosia, extinction, difficulties with
      sustained attention and problems with emotional processing. Correct identification of SN and
      associated problems is essential for initiating alleviating strategies and for measuring
      progress. Several assessment tools exist, but psychometric testing has mostly been conducted
      in non-dynamic environments; a single country or culture. Thus non-transferable to a wider
      context and ward-based care. To optimize identification of SN and develop procedures for
      diverse healthcare settings, this cross-country study includes patients from Iceland and
      Lithuania. We will seek to maximize the clinical utility by avoiding exclusion of patients,
      e.g., with psycholinguistic difficulties and multiple strokes. We will: a) use behavioral SN
      assessment and visuo-graphic tests to validate a newly developed SN tool that incorporates
      many aspects of SN that are currently not addressed in conventional tests, b) validate
      integration of an additional component into the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale as
      a screening tool to identify SN, and c) evaluate differences in clinical characteristics
      between patients with left- and right-sided SN, and patients with and without SN.
