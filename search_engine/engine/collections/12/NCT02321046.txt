      representative oncology departments / institutions in order to determine the prevalence of
      EGFR mutations in treatment-naive Russian patients with cytologically verified advanced NSCLC
      in Russia. No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical
      practice will be applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the
      current practice.

      It is planned to enrol approximately 300 subjects in Russian Federation. Approximately 60
      EGFR m+ (mutation-positive) patients will be followed for 1.5 years.

      EGFR mutations rate before treatment in cytology and plasma samples in treatment-naive
      patients with advanced NSCLC in Russia is considered as the primary outcome variable in this
      study.
