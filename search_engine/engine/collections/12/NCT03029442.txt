      agent, denosumab [receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) antibody; Amgen
      Inc.] to preserve bone mass at the hip and knee and trabecular connectivity at the knee after
      subacute motor-incomplete SCI [American Spinal Injury Association (AIS) neurological
      classification scale C and D] at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (JJPVAMC) and Kessler
      Institute for Rehabilitation (KIR). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group trial will be performed in thirty-two subjects with acute, motor-incomplete SCI (≤6
      months) who have been admitted to JJPVAMC or the KIR. Denosumab (60 mg SC) will be
      administered at baseline, 6, and 12 months; the placebo group will receive normal saline
      subcutaneously. Denosumab will be administered as soon as possible, but up to 24 weeks, after
      SCI. The last dose of denosumab and placebo will be administered at 6 months, with the
      anticipated effect of the drug to persist and inhibit bone resorption at least until the 12
      month time point.
