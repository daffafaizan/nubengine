      weight-loss program (six weeks of formula diet, followed by the reintroduction of regular
      food with gradually increasing energy intake over nine weeks) for a duration of 15 weeks. All
      subjects undergo bioelectrical impedance analyses to investigate body composition and magnet
      resonance imaging to measure fat mass and fat fractions of abdominal organs, at three time
      points: first before the program, then at the end of the six weeks of formula diet and
      finally, at the end of the program after 15 weeks. Laboratory data are measured before and
      after the program.
