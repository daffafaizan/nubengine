      hypopigmenting agents, chemical peels and lasers. There are variety of less-tried systemic
      agents like fish oil, green tea and . Although no single agent has proved to be effective for
      all patients, a combination of two or three agents is often tried to achieve optimum results.

      Chemical peeling is the application of a chemical agent to the skin, which causes the
      controlled destruction of a part or of the entire epidermis, with or without the dermis,
      leading to exfoliation and removal of superficial lesions, followed by the regeneration of
      new epidermal and dermal tissues.

      Chemical peels are a well-known modality of treatment for melasma. The basic mechanism of the
      action of chemical peels in melasma is the removal of unwanted melanin by causing a
      controlled chemical burn to the skin.

      Trichlroacetic acid peeling has been the gold standard in chemical peeling for many decades.

      For superficial peels Trichlroacetic acid 10% to 25% are used. some authors consider up to
      35% Trichlroacetic acid as also a superficial.

      Skin microneedling is a technique predominantly used to improve the appearance of cutaneous
      scarring and photo damage.

      Fine needles puncture the skin, resulting in increased dermal elastin and collagen, collagen
      remodelling, and thickening of the epidermis and dermis. Additionally, skin needling creates
      small channels, which increase the absorption of topically applied preparations A property
      which has been used in various dermatological treatments.
