      interact with ongoing neuronal activity, has emerged as a potentially effective and promising
      treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the 4Hz frequency was suggested to improve
      working memory Methods: The proposed study is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial
      that will include 40 individuals with mild AD, and the participants will be randomized to
      either a 4Hz tACS group or a sham stimulation group. Both groups will undergo 30 one-hour
      sessions in 3 weeks (21 days). The outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, end of
      intervention and 3 months after the first session. Primary outcome is global cognitive
      function, assessed by the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale (ADAS-cog), and the second outcomes include changes in other neuropsychological
      assessments, structural MRI, resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and simultaneous
      EEG-functional MRI (fMRI).
