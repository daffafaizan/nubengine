    
      This study was conducted by GW Research Ltd as a pilot study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of GWP42003 (50 milligram [mg] up to 250 mg twice daily [BID]), compared with placebo,
      as assessed by the percentage of participants achieving remission quantified as a Mayo score
      of 2 or less (with no sub-score >1) after 10 weeks of treatment. This was the first study to
      determine whether the study drug has a positive benefit for participants on their ulcerative
      colitis symptom control, as well as effects on inflammatory marker cytokines (C reactive
      protein [CRP]), a fecal inflammatory marker (calprotectin), stool frequency, and rectal
      bleeding. In addition, various inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) questionnaires were
      implemented in the study to observe further benefits on the study drug, compared with
      placebo.

      This study was multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and
      parallel-group. The study consisted of a 7-day baseline period, a 10-week treatment period,
      and a 1-week follow-up period. Each participant had a Mayo assessment (including endoscopy)
      conducted to confirm eligibility. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into
      the GWP42003 and placebo groups. At the start of the treatment period, participants entered a
      2-week dose escalation period to achieve their maximum tolerated dose, up to 250 mg BID in
      the GWP42003 group. Participants remained at the maximum tolerated dose for the rest of the
      treatment period.
