      compared to open surgery. It is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and hospital
      stay. There is growing evidence that increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), even for short
      periods of time, is associated with increased perioperative morbidity (pain, increased
      inflammatory markers peritoneal injury worse splanchnic perfusion abnormalities hemodynamic
      and ventilatory ...).

      The study is a prospective multicenter randomized clinical intervention trial to assess the
      impact of IAP individualization strategy (IPP-Individualized pneumoperitoneum Pressure)
      relative to a IAP standard strategy (SPP-Standard pneumoperitoneum Pressure) using a
      validated scale (VAS) (PQRS- Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale). Postoperative pain in
      the first 24 hours (area under VAS curve , opioid rescue, referred pain to the shoulder) and
      surgical stress and inflammatory markers (neutrophil/lymphocyte, ratio,C-reactive protein,
      interleukin-6, procalcitonin) are also measured. Postoperative complications are evaluated by
      Clavier-Dindo classification.
