    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (a medical research study in
      which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving,
      "unblinded"), parallel-arm (participants receive 1 of 2 possible interventions during the
      same time frame throughout the study), optimal dose-titration, multicenter (when more than
      one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study evaluating the
      conversion rate based on the number of participants achieving pain control and safety within
      1 week after switching from an ongoing around-the-clock opioid analgesic (morphine
      sustained-release [SR], oxycodone controlled-release, or fentanyl transdermal) to tapentadol
      ER or morphine SR, for their moderate to severe chronic, malignant tumor-related cancer pain.
      The study consists of 2 periods: 1 to 2 week screening period, followed by 8-week open-label
      treatment period. During the study period, participants will be hospitalized or outpatient.
      However, it is preferable to be hospitalized 1 week before and 1 week after to evaluate
      efficacy before and after switching opioids for securing participants' safety. At Day 1,
      participants will receive either tapentadol ER or morphine SR twice daily. During the
      treatment period, the dose of the study drug will be titrated to the participant's optimal
      dose. The participants will receive either tapentadol ER or morphine SR twice daily for 8
      weeks. The maximum dose allowed for tapentadol ER will be 500 milligram (mg) daily or
      morphine SR 140 mg daily throughout the study. Efficacy is primarily evaluated using pain
      intensity score on an 11 point Numerical Rating Scale (an 11-point NRS is used to measure the
      pain level where 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Participants' safety will
      also be monitored.
