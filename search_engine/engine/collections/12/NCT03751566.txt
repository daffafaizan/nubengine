      acute radiotoxic symptoms at least of G1. The patients will be randomized (by ticket) in two
      regimens 1:1.

      Regimen A (control regimen): standard support treatment of adverse events of the
      radiotherapy.

      Regimen B (acupuncture regimen): standard support treatment of adverse events of the
      radiotherapy and acupuncture.

      Due to the disease and patients differences, treatment will be individualized. Used
      acupuncture points will be documented. The patients difficulties will be observed and their
      medication and will be recorded in the patient diary.

      Possible skin toxicities wil be documented by the photography.

      Before the randomization, all subjects will sign the voluntary informed consent. After the
      achievement of 50 enrolled subjects in any regimen, the enrollment will continue only to the
      other regimen.

      Head and neck cancer therapy will include only curative and adjuvant radiotherapy.
