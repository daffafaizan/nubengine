      maintain the skills needed to best manage their lives with a chronic disease. FTE includes
      organized awareness, information, learning and psychological and social assistance about the
      disease, prescribed treatments, various treatments offered, as well as information on
      organization of the global health system, and health behaviours. Performed by health
      professionals trained in this practice, FTE is intended to help patients and their close
      relatives and to understand their pathology, their treatments, collaborate with health care
      teams, and maintain or improve their quality of life. It aims to produce a complementary
      therapeutic effect of other health care interventions
