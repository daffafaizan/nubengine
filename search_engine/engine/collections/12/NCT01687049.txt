      treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Red yeast rice has the potential to slow prostate cancer
      growth by inhibiting cholesterol and androgen biosynthesis. There is a strong rationale for
      the use of RYR in patients being managed with active surveillance for localized, low risk,
      prostate cancer. To date, no human studies utilizing RYR in this setting have been reported.
