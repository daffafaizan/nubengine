      (PDE)-4 and -10 inhibitor at peak clinical exposures (Rolan, Hutchinson et al. 2009) that
      increases glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression (Mizuno, Kurotani et
      al. 2004) and reduces microglial activation (Suzumura, Ito et al. 1999; Suzumura, Ito et al.
      2003), including HIV-induced glial activation (Kiebala and Maggirwar 2011). IBUD
      significantly reduces methamphetamine (MA) prime- and stress-induced reinstatement of MA
      seeking in rats (Beardsley, Shelton et al. 2010) and has multiple effects that may make it an
      effective treatment for MA dependence including amelioration of dopaminergic and
      neuroinflammatory dysfunction. Multiple studies implicate glial cells in a variety of
      neurodegenerative diseases (Hirsch and Hunot 2009; Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz, Wegrzynowicz et al.
      2011) including MA dependence and HIV infection (Nath 2010). Activated glial cells secrete
      pro-inflammatory mediators (Minghetti, Ajmone-Cat et al. 2005) that may exacerbate MA-induced
      dopaminergic dysfunction. Glial cells also produce neurotrophic factors, including GDNF,
      which may ameliorate dopaminergic dysfunction (Pascual, Hidalgo-Figueroa et al. 2008). Thus,
      IBUD may be an effective medication for MA dependence due to its modulation of glial cell
      activation resulting in amelioration of dopaminergic and neurocognitive dysfunction and
      improved treatment outcomes in MA dependence. IBUD may also have unique effects in HIV
      positive MA users as it may additionally block the degradation of neuronal integrity seen in
      HIV infection (Chana, Everall et al. 2006; Dash, Gorantla et al. 2011).
