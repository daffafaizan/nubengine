      Medicine. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive 6.5 mg prasterone
      vaginal inserts daily for twenty weeks. After the informed consent is signed, a baseline
      physical examination and vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule,
      urethral meatus and vagina will be performed. Physical examination and vulvoscopy with
      detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule, urethral meatus and vagina will be repeated
      prospectively every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks. Therefore, physical examination and
      vulvoscopy with detailed photography of the vulva, vestibule, urethral meatus and vagina will
      be performed prospectively at baseline (vulvoscopy session 1), 4 weeks (vulvoscopy session
      2), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 12 weeks (vulvoscopy session 4), 16 weeks (vulvoscopy
      session 5) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 6) following daily administration of 6.5 mg
      prasterone. In addition, pain diaries will be dispensed at each visit and collected at the
      following visit, with questions regarding pain during sexual activity.
