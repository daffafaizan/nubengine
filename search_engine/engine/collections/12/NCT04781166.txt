      emotion-triggered impulsivity, to better detect states of high emotion and arousal, to learn
      new strategies for self-calming high arousal, and to pre-plan how to cope with high arousal
      states. As part of the program, participants receive daily texts and prompts to remind them
      of the intervention content and skills. At baseline and follow-up, participants will complete
      measures of emotion-related impulsivity, self-harm, and suicidality.
