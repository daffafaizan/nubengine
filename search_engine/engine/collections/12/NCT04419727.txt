      widespread especially in highly developed countries. The most common complication of PAD is
      critical limb ischemia with rest pain and leg ulcers. To date the pathophysiology of PAD is
      linked to atherosclerosis but other pathways are also under evaluation. A recent study (Serra
      et al) investigated the presence of ER-alfa, ER-beta, and GPER in the wall of normal and
      varicose veins.

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the expression and the role of estrogen
      receptors in patients with PAD, and undergoing surgical treatment with reconstructive
      arterial surgery. Therefore, we will collect tissue samples from diseased arteries that will
      be further analyzed for ER expression. We will then correlate the results with the clinical
      spectrum of the patients.
