      intervention will motivate classroom students to reduce exposure at a critical life period
      and will create lifetime learned sun exposure behaviors. Students' sun exposure behaviors
      will be assessed prior to the educational intervention. The educational intervention consists
      of three educational sessions and one lab lesson. At the conclusion of the intervention,
      students' sun exposure behaviors will be assessed again via a post-intervention
      questionnaire.
