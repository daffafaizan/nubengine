      on a general ward is contingent on the quality and frequency of vital signs measurement like
      respiratory rate. This is due to the EWS escalation schemes of hospitals with an acute
      intervention team. Obtained sub-score trigger levels of vital signs contribute to higher and
      more frequent scoring.

      We examine the influence of different respiration rate sensor concepts and measurements on
      scoring (NEWS and CREWS) and workflow in a typical UK gastroenterology and respiratory ward.
