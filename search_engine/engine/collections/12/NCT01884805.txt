      interface has been designed to be user-friendly, being very similar to the software usually
      managed by the clinicians in their daily professional practice. The complete procedure in one
      patient takes less than 5 minutes and is completely non-invasive. The optical measurements
      only involve the use of low power infrared laser and the visual testing is as simple for the
      patients as watching television and making responses.
