      will be asked to fill out questionnaires, engage in interviews, and complete paper and pencil
      tasks at the beginning of the study, at the halfway point of the training course (1 month),
      and end of the training course (2 months), and another 2 months later. One training focuses
      on how to make good judgments about what other people may be thinking or feeling in social
      situations, and why people might act in certain ways in different situations. The other
      training focuses on different strategies for handling everyday problems and stressors. Both
      trainings are done in one-on-one sessions with a research staff member. There will be 16-20
      training sessions, each about 45-60 minutes long. The investigators will ask participants to
      attend 2 training sessions per week, so the total training time should be about 2 months.
