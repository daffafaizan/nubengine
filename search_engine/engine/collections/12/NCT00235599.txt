      standard growth hormone stimulation test. This study is designed to investigate a new tool
      for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency.

      Ten short, prepubertal children, who fulfill the inclusion criteria, will undergo a
      two-secretagogue standard growth hormone stimulation test, and an insulin like growth factor
      binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) stimulation test simultaneously. During this test, components of
      the ternary complex moieties, viz, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGFBP-3 and acid
      labile subunit (ALS) will also be measured along with growth hormone.

      The aim of this study is to detect an acute rise in IGFBP-3 of >15% from baseline.

      The importance of this study is that it inculcates the specificity and improved sensitivity
      of stimulated IGFBP-3 in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency.
