      I. To evaluate for efficacy by response rate (RR) when patients with advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation who have
      progressed following EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy are treated with XL184
      (cabozantinib [cabozantinib-s-malate]) and erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression free survival (PFS) for combination XL184 (cabozantinib) and
      erlotinib in EGFR mutation positive patients following progression on erlotinib.

      II. Assess overall survival. III. Evaluate change in tumor growth rate on XL184
      (cabozantinib) and erlotinib.

      IV. Evaluate type, severity, duration and outcome of toxicities. V. Correlate outcome with
      tumor biomarkers such as met proto-oncogene (MET) amplification, T790M mutation, and serum
      markers of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and MET pathways in a preliminary
      manner.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year and
      then annually thereafter.
