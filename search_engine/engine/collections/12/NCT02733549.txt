      department (ED). In most cases, the etiology remains unclear. Dizziness has a broad
      differential diagnosis. The initial symptoms of ALD can include many general complaints. The
      diagnosis of acute liver dysfunction (ALD) can usually be made by initial symptoms, physical
      examination, and biochemical tests, including liver function tests (LFTs) with high
      sensitivity and specificity. LFTs include albumin, bilirubin, coagulation factors (Activated
      Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR)), and liver
      enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline
      phosphates (ALP), and y-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), which are marker of hepatic damage.
      Aim of this study is to investigate whether SOD is a symptom of ALD, the necessity of LFTs
      for patients with SOD in the ED, and a cost analysis of LFTs.
