      reduction in distal blood flow. Seventy percent of aSAH patients develop angiographic
      vasospasm but only 30% progress to develop evident neurological deficits. Cerebral vasospasm
      may be asymptomatic with no clinical symptoms and signs but only abnormal investigations,
      such as vascular stenosis by angiography or high blood flow speed by Doppler ultrasound.

      Standard tests used to determine the source of bleeding and diagnose cerebral vasospasm (CV)
      include neuroimaging studies that administer contrast either intravenously (computed
      tomography angiography [CTA]) or intra-arterially (digital subtraction angiography [DSA]).
      Cerebral blood flow measurements using computed tomography (CT) perfusion techniques may
      detect the degree of cerebral ischemia in a very early stage. Although well-tolerated, these
      studies cannot be readily performed on the bedside and expose the patient to additional
      radiation, thus significantly restricting their use in daily cerebral hemodynamics
      monitoring. Moreover, they involve patient transportation to the CT scanner and utilization
      of resources such as nurses, technologists, and ancillary personnel.

      Early detection of cerebral vasospasm is an important step in the way of the improvement of
      the outcome and the survival of aSAH patients. Transcranial duplex (TCD) is a non-invasive
      modality which can assess the cerebral blood vessels diameters and flow velocities that can
      be a useful maneuver in early detection of vasospasm after aSAH
