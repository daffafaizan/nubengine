      utilizes to regulate innate and adaptive immunity (Andersson, 2012). The afferent arm of the
      reflex senses inflammation both peripherally and in the central nervous system, and
      down-regulates the inflammation via efferent neural outflow. The efferent arm of this reflex
      has been termed the "cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway" (CAP). The reflex serves as a
      physiological regulator of inflammation by responding to environmental injury and pathogens
      with an appropriate degree of immune system activation An increasing body of evidence
      indicates that the CAP can also be harnessed to reduce pathological inflammation. Electrical
      neurostimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) with either a surgically implantable device, or
      alternatively using a non-invasive device that stimulates the auricular branch of the vagus
      nerve (ABVN) may be a feasible means of modulating diseases characterized by excessive and
      dysregulated inflammation.
