      very frequent in HIV-positive patients (HIV+), especially in men who have sex with men (MSM),
      but also in women. Consequently, HIV+ have a strongly increased risk for anal cancer.
      Screening for and treatment of AIN are recommended in HIV+, although only two RCT on AIN
      treatment have been published. We plan a multicenter, unblinded, non-inferiority RCT that
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of 2 high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-guided treatment
      options for AIN: topical application of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and surgical treatment
      with electrocautery (ECA).

      ECA was the best option for intra-anal AIN in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      TCA, an inexpensive and established therapy for genital warts, has been evaluated for AIN
      only in a retrospective pilot study that showed clearance rates comparable to those found for
      ECA, with possibly less adverse events (AE). Our primary hypothesis is that cost-saving and
      simple TCA is non-inferior to ECA. 2800 HIV+ will be screened by HRA in 9 proctological
      centers and 560 HIV+ with histologically confirmed intra-anal AIN will be randomized (1:1) to
      receive up to 4 treatments with TCA or ECA within 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is
      clinical (HRA) and histological resolution of AIN 4 weeks after the last treatment. Secondary
      endpoints comprise recurrence of AIN 24 weeks after end of therapy, the number of
      interventions, AE, and the influence of HPV parameters such as anal HPV-types, viral load and
      HPV-oncogene-mRNA.
