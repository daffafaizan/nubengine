      extrahepatic control flow.

      This management can lead hemodynamic instability and reduction in oxygen delivery so an
      advanced monitoring should be used.

      This study analyzes hemodynamic changes, in patients undergoing liver resection, through the
      Vigileo/FloTrac system.
