      University and Hospital-Co-Investigator Dr. David Whellan, and Duke University Medical
      Center-Co-Investigator Dr. Christopher O'Connor. Each center may recruit up to 3
      geographically close, tightly affiliated 'satellite' sites under their management and
      budgetary control. Together, these sites will recruit a total of 352 consenting patients â‰¥ 60
      years old hospitalized with ADHF. Following informed consent and baseline testing, the
      participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive a 12-week novel, progressive,
      multi-domain rehabilitation and exercise training intervention or attention control. The
      multi-domain rehabilitation intervention will include endurance, mobility, strength, and
      balance training and will be tailored based on participant performance in each of these
      domains. It will begin upon randomization during the hospitalization and will continue 3
      times per week in an outpatient setting. Participants randomized to the attention control arm
      will receive all services ordered by their primary physician and will be contacted bi-weekly
      by study staff. All participants will undergo measures of physical function and quality of
      life at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Clinical events will be monitored for 6 months
      following the index hospitalization.
