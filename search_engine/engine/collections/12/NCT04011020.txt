      tightly binds stem cells CB-SCs without interfering with their immune modulating capability.
      We originally designed a chamber for co-culture of lymphocytes and CB-SCs that included nine
      discs of the material with a flow pathway and adherent CB-SCs sandwiched between a top cover
      plate and a bottom collecting plate. In this trial, we are going to use the 12-layer SCE
      device.

      The SCE therapy carried a lower risk of infection than a typical blood transfusion, and did
      not introduce stem cells or reagents into the patients. In addition, CB-SCs have very low
      immunogenicity, and the CB-SCs cultured in the device are a highly restricted population and
      contain no CD3+ T cells or other lymphocyte subsets, eliminating the need for human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) matching prior to treatment. This innovative approach has the potential to
      provide CB-SC-mediated immune modulation therapy for multiple autoimmune diseases while
      mitigating the safety and ethical concerns associated with other approaches such as T1D, type
      2 diabetes (T2D), and alopecia areata (AA) in clinics. The relative simplicity of the
      approach may also provide cost and time savings relative to other approaches.
