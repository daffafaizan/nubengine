      lungs, consensus on their phenotypic characterization is still missing.

      Current translational protocols use human AMs obtained by invasive methods (broncho-alveolar
      lavage and lung biopsy) or differentiate macrophages from blood monocytes cultured in the
      presence of growth factors such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The group has already published
      the phenotypic and functional comparison of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages
      differentiated with M-CSF or GM-CSF. Aim of this study is to use a multi-staining flow
      cytometry (FACS analysis) to better characterize the phenotype of AMs isolated from
      broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of patients affected by non-infectious lung diseases. The FACS
      profiles of AMs will be further compared to the phenotypic profile of blood monocyte-derived
      macrophages differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF or M-CSF. The results of this study will
      allow to define the most valid in vitro model of AMs in a non-infectious setting.
