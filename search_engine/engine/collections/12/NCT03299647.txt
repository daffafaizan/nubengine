      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies, detection
      and diagnosis are very important for ADHD. According to the investigators' previous work,
      children with ADHD have visual memory deficits as well as inattentive deficits. Previous
      studies show that polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with cognitive problems in
      children. Analyzing differences in polyunsaturated fatty acids between children with ADHD and
      healthy controls could provide insight into underlying disease pathology of cognitive
      deficits. In this one-year project, the researchers will perform an analysis of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum to identify potential biomarkers for the visual memory
      deficits of ADHD.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. To identify the specific polyunsaturated fatty acids of ADHD symptoms;

        2. To identify the relationship between specific polyunsaturated fatty acids and visual
           memory deficits of ADHD.

      This is a one-year project. After careful calculation of sample size, the study will recruit
      35 children with ADHD, aged 7-18, and 35 healthy controls with matched age, sex and BMI. The
      investigators will quantify the polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum. The behavioral measures
      include ADHDRS-IV, SNAP-IV, CBCL, CGI-ADHD-S, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C. The Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be used to assess the visual memory
      of all participants. Conditional logistic regression and partial least squares discriminant
      analysis will be applied to identify significant polyunsaturated fatty acids for ADHD and
      visual memory deficits.
