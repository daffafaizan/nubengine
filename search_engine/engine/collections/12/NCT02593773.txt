      be eligible to enter this 6-month study. All participants will receive ACTIMMUNE® 3 times a
      week (TIW) for 26 weeks. In order to maintain the study blind in HZNP-ACT-301 (NCT02415127),
      all participants in this open-label extension study will undergo ACTIMMUNE® titration,
      regardless if they received ACTIMMUNE® or placebo in HZNP-ACT-301 (NCT02415127). The Week 26
      Visit from HZNP-ACT-301 (NCT02415127) will serve as the Baseline Visit (Day 1) for this
      study. During the treatment period, additional clinic visits are scheduled at Weeks 4, 13,
      and 26; in between clinic visits, participants (and/or caregivers) will be monitored via
      emails/phone calls on a weekly basis until participants reach their maximum tolerated dose,
      and on a monthly basis thereafter.
