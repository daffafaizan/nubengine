      atrial flutter, both of which are referred to as AF, after cardiac surgery. AF is the most
      common complication after cardiac surgery. AF is when the upper chambers of the heart (atria)
      experience disorganized electrical activity which causes the heart beat to be irregular. The
      two treatment strategies to be used in this study are called rhythm control and rate control.
      The rhythm control strategy will attempt to bring the heart beat back to a regular rhythm
      using treatments known and approved to control heart rhythm. The rate control strategy will
      attempt to bring the heart rate to less than 100 beats per minute at rest using medications
      known and recommended to control heart rate. Both strategies are commonly used to treat AF.
      All of the medications that will be used in this study are the standard of care for use in
      patients experiencing AF. This research seeks to determine whether rhythm control is better
      than rate control in patients with AF after cardiac surgery.
