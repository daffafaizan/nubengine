      obstruction and is part of the benign prostatic hyperplasia syndrome (BPH) in men.
      Unfortunately, it does not often resolve after treatment (TURP, etc) of the obstruction from
      enlarged prostate gland. Patients with obstructive BPH typically commence treatment with
      alpha-blockers or anticholinergic agents; the former being used to treat enlarged prostate
      medically, and the latter to treat overactive bladder symptoms. However, as mentioned,
      anticholinergics cause many intolerable side effects leading to discontinuation in many
      patients. Furthermore this class of drug is still considered a relative contraindication in
      this population by some clinicians. Therefore other modalities need to be studied in these
      men.

      Based on numerous studies in overactive bladder (OAB), we hypothesize that these patients
      will experience significant improvement (particularly if their symptoms of urgency and
      frequency) without significant side effects from intradetrusor injections of BOTOXÂ® even
      though they have were refractory to systemic anticholinergics.
