      researcher injects SB-509 into your legs, the drug enters the muscle and nerve cells around
      the injection site and causes these cells to make a protein. This protein causes your cells
      to increase production of another protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      which may improve the structure and function of nerves. In addition, there are changes in the
      levels of 28 additional proteins in your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth
      of cells, are structures in cells, help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and
      some have unknown functions. This increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair
      the damaged nerves caused by diabetic neuropathy.

      The study doctor will test SB-509 (60 mg) and placebo. Everyone in this study will receive
      intramuscular (IM-directly into the muscle) injections into both legs. This will happen 3
      times over about 4 months. Two out of every 3 participants will receive SB-509 and 1 out of
      every 3 will receive placebo. You will not know, and the study doctor will not know, whether
      you will receive SB-509 or whether you will receive placebo.
