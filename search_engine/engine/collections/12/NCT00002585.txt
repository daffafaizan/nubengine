      in women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative
      toxicities of PZA on this schedule. III. Assess the response duration and survival of
      patients treated with this agent.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive intravenous pyrazoloacridine (PZA) every 3 weeks in the absence
      of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Therapy continues in responding patients
      until 6 months after a complete response or for 1 year, whichever is shorter; stable patients
      receive a maximum of 4 courses. The dose is increased once for patients who experience
      minimal toxicity. Patients who fail PZA are encouraged to continue therapy with
      cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (CAF). All patients are followed for survival.
      Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is not permitted.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 20 patients will be accrued over 7-12 months. If no more than 1
      response is seen in the first 12 evaluable patients, accrual will cease.
