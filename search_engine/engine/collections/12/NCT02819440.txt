      disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Increased CV risk in obese individuals appears to
      depend largely on the degree of metabolic dysregulation and metabolic risk factors (glucose
      intolerance, dyslipidemia, etc.). Notably, interventions that improve insulin sensitivity and
      cardiorespiratory fitness can reduce CV risk in obese individuals, even in the absence of
      weight loss.

      The cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway (cGMP) is involved in energy homeostasis and
      systemic metabolism. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that increasing cGMP activity is
      beneficial from a metabolic standpoint. Tadalafil is a clinically-available drug that
      inhibits the enzyme that breaks down cGMP.

      The study investigators hypothesize that chronic PDE5 inhibition in obese, insulin-resistant
      adults will improve cardiometabolic health.

      Aim 1: To examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on energy expenditure. Aim 2: To examine the
      effect of PDE5 inhibition on insulin sensitivity and secretion.

      Aim 3: To examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP tone and circulating mediators of
      cardiometabolic risk.
