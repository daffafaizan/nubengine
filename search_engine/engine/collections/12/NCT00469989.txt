      risk of asthma and allergic disease. This association is potentially important not only to
      understanding the aetiology of asthma and allergic disease, but also because it suggests that
      hookworms or their products might be therapeutically effective in these conditions. To test
      the hypothesis that hookworms protect against asthma ultimately requires a clinical trial.

      We have carried out a dose-ranging study to establish the dose of hookworm larvae necessary
      to generate infection at the intensity shown to be protective in epidemiological studies,
      with acceptable side effects. We have also completed a randomized controlled clinical trial
      of hookworm infection in people with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and have shown that there
      is no significant change in airway responsiveness during the lung migration phase of the
      hookworm life cycle. We are now performing the definitive study which is a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial of the effects of therapeutic hookworm infection in people with
      asthma. During this study, we will be monitoring various indicators of asthma control but
      will also be able to measure a range of relevant immunological parameters to explore the
      relation between these parameters and expression of the allergic and asthmatic phenotypes
