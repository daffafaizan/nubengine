      efficacy of EN Foam versus the reference listed econazole nitrate cream and the foam vehicle
      in adults, the current clinical study is being conducted to provide additional
      pharmacokinetic data for EN in the foam formulation in subjects ages 12 to less than 18 years
      with interdigital tinea pedis to support a clinical bridge for systemic safety to the RLD in
      this pediatric population. The study also includes clinical and safety endpoints.
