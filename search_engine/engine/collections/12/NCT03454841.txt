      dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Both
      drugs exert comparable antiplatelet effect following a loading dose. However, pharmacodynamic
      differences exist between these P2Y12 receptor inhibitors. Prasugrel is a prodrug that
      requires hepatic activation and permanently binds to platelet P2Y12 receptors, whereas
      ticagrelor is an active drug and blocks P2Y12 receptors reversibly. Another important
      difference is that prasugrel maintenance dose is administered once daily, while ticagrelor
      requires next dosage every 12 hours. These fundamental distinctions may affect the degree of
      platelet inhibition on maintenance doses during the first days after acute myocardial
      infarction.
