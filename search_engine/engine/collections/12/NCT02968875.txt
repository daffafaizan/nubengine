      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to both learning and memory processes. This protein
      is found in lower amounts in people with AD. Acute physical activity of moderate to vigorous
      intensity would increase the levels of plasma BDNF whether for a healthy person or a person
      with AD. Nevertheless in rest, healthy people have higher level of BDNF than individuals with
      AD. There are no studies on the effect of chronic exercise based on BDNF level at rest in
      people with AD. In a hypothetical endurance training of 18 sessions, whether interval or
      continuous training the levels of BDNF would increase in people with AD at rest. Their
      physiological and neuropsychological performances would also show a rise.
