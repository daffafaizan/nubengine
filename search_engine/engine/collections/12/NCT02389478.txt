      questions.Recent studies have shown that Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum to very
      low birth weight infants can reduce the time reach full enteral nutrition .But there are no
      evidence support that it can promote infants' immune response. The hypothesis of the current
      study is that Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum to very low birth weight infants may
      increase the secretion of sIgA in urine and saliva.

      The current study adopts randomized, double blind, controlled intervention trial, gives
      Oropharyngeal administration of colostrums to very low birth weight infants in intervention
      group and Oropharyngeal administration of Normal saline to control group. All indicators in
      this study are discrete traits, for sIgA、Lactoferrin number in Saliva and urine， number of
      CRP，time Begin oral feeding，time up to full enteral feeding， Person's chi-square tests were
      used for comparisons. For Blood culture results，The number of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
      occurred， the investigators use Chi-square tests for comparisons between two groups. The
      study expects that Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum to very low birth weight infants
      can increase the secretion of sIgA in urine and saliva.
