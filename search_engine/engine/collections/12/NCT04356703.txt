    
      Children submitted to fetoscopic in utero myelomeningocele repair using the SAFER
      (Skin-over-biocellulose for Anternatal FEtoscopic Repair) technique will evaluate the
      neuropsicomotor development at 30 months of chronological age. The mental evaluation will use
      the Bayley III and thePEDI neurodevelopmental scale. The motor development will use the
      difference between anatomic and motor level of the lesion. Urinary and fecal continence will
      be evaluated using clinical and ultrasonographic parameters. For the anatomical level
      determination, immaging of the spine at the lesion level will be used. Motor level and
      ambulation will be evaluated through standard clinical examination.
