      the end of the trial,We will utilize a battery of tests to assess the effect of the treatment
      on cognitive functions.The side effect assessments are also performed every 3 weeks. Side
      effect assessments include Simpson-Angus Rating Scale for extrapyramidal side-effects,
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia, and Barnes Akathisia Scale.
      Systemic side effects are reviewed by applying the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU)
      Side-effects Rating Scale. DAAO level, routine laboratory tests, including CBC, biochemistry
      , urine analysis, and EKG, will be checked at baseline and the end of week 12.

      To compare the metabolic syndrome parameters among groups, body mass index, hip size, waist
      size, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, and total-cholesterol will be
      checked at baseline and the end of the study.
