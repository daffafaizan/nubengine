      modified ovarian carcinoma vaccine and ganciclovir in patients with stage I, II, or III
      malignant mesothelioma. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities
      of this vaccine in these patients. III. Determine the immunologic response to this treatment
      regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the intrapleural pharmakokinetics of ganciclovir in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of PA-1-STK modified ovarian carcinoma vaccine.
      Patients receive PA-1-STK modified ovarian carcinoma vaccine intrapleurally on day 1 followed
      by ganciclovir IV over 1 hour for 7 days beginning on day 1. Patients in the first 2 cohorts
      receive 1 course of treatment only. In all subsequent cohorts, treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PA-1-STK modified ovarian
      carcinoma vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-16 patients will be accrued for this study.
