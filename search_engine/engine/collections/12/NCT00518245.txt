      of a heart attack benefit from anticoagulant therapy such as enoxaparin. However, even
      patients without abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or bloodwork are at increased risk
      for heart attack or death, if they have certain clinical risk factors. It is currently not
      known whether enoxaparin is also beneficial for these patients.

      Comparison: enoxaparin in addition to optimal standard care at the discretion of the treating
      physician, versus optimal standard care without enoxaparin
