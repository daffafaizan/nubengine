    
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of DS-1594b followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive DS-1594b orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION SUB-STUDY: Patients receive DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-8 and 19-28, and
      posaconazole PO BID on day 9 and once daily (QD) on days 10-18 or voriconazole PO BID on days
      9-18 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      FOOD-EFFECT SUB STUDY: Patients receive DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-8 within 30 minutes after
      eating a standard meal and PO BID on days 9-15 under fasting conditions in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients with MLLr receive DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B: Patients with NPM1m receive DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT C: Patients receive DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-28, venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28, and
      azacitidine intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT D: Patients receive DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-28. For cycles 1, 3, 5, 7, patients also
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days 1-3, mesna IV over 24 hours on days 1-3,
      vincristine IV on days 1 and 11, dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1-4 and 11-14, filgrastim SC
      on days 1-28, methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on day 2 of cycles 1 and 3, and cytarabine IT
      on day 7 of cycles 1 and 3. For cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, patients also receive methotrexate IV over
      24 hours on day 1, cytarabine BID IV over 3 hours on days 2 and 3, leucovorin IV or PO every
      6 hours (Q6H) starting 12 hours after completion of methotrexate, filgrastim SC days 1-28,
      cytarabine IT on day 5-8 of cycles 2 and 4 and methotrexate IT on days 8-11 of cycles 2 and
      4. Patients with CD20 expression may also receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 11 of cycles 1
      and 3 and days 1 and 8 of cycles 2 and 4. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 8 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then receive
      DS-1594b PO BID on days 1-28, vincristine IV over 15 minutes on day 7 and prednisone PO BID
      on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 30 and 100.
