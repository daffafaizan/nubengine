      diagnose influenza by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to determine colonization rates
      with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia. All samples except the first
      naso-pharyngeal swab for influenza diagnostics will be stored in a biobank and analysed in
      batches. Each influenza virus isolate will be sequenced using a "whole genome sequencing"
      approach. The viral transmission and evolution will be analysed using whole genome data for a
      detailed molecular and phylogenetic tree analysis, respectively. The epidemiological and
      geographical data will be incorporated into the phylogenetic model.
