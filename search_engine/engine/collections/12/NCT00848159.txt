      bodies, resulting in compression and collapse of vertebrae, with narrowing of intervertebral
      disc spaces and, determining a number of deformities in the spine and postural changes, among
      which can highlight the increase in thoracic kyphosis. This becomes significantly higher with
      age and after menopause, defined as an increase in curvature in the sagittal plane of the
      thoracic spine.

      Radiographic images have been used for the measurement of thoracic kyphosis, but with some
      drawbacks of this method such as radiation exposure, radiographic image quality
      unsatisfactory hampering its analysis and the lack of equipment in the physical environment
      to monitor clinical evolution of the treatment, causing thus the search for noninvasive
      methods for evaluating the curves of the spine, including the photogrammetry computed.

      According to the American Society of Photogrammetry, the computed photogrammetry is "the art,
      science and technology of information on physical objects and environment through processes
      of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic
      radiant energy and other sources." It is a widely used tool for assessment by quantifying the
      postural changes through the application of photogrammetric principles to photographic images
      obtained in body movements, adding to the diagnostic evaluation for physical therapy in
      different areas.
