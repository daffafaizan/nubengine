      and coping capabilities, and to promote independence and participation in society. According
      to current political documents, there are large variation in the content and quality of
      rehabilitation in Norway, and systems to improve coordination and communication are needed.

      This trial is a collaborative project between eight centres across Norway, investigating
      whether a new program aimed at bridging gaps in rehabilitation across levels of care increase
      and/or prolong the effect of rehabilitation for people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal
      diseases. Additionally, we will use a newly developed set of quality indicators to monitor
      and compare the quality of rehabilitation across different centres, and explore relationships
      between adherence to structure and process indicators and the outcomes of rehabilitation.

      The effects will be evaluated in a multi-centre stepped wedge randomized controlled trial,
      where participating centres switch from control (current rehabilitation program) to
      intervention phase (adding the BRIDGE program to the current program) in a randomized order.
      Primary outcome is goal attainment after seven months, and secondary outcomes are health
      related quality of life and function.

      The results will give insight in the content and organisation of current rehabilitation
      programs, what follow-up people want and receive in primary care, their planned and completed
      efforts to implement and maintain life style changes, and predictors for improvement
      following rehabilitation in specialist health care. Results will also have consequences on
      how rehabilitation is to be organized in the future regarding follow-up and coordination
      across levels of care.

      The study has been developed in close collaboration with patient research partners,
      clinicians and international experts, who will also contribute in the process of integrating
      study results in clinical practice.
