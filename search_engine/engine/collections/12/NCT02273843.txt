      systems. There are very few studies of such roles in the neonatal population. It is
      potentially an attractive therapeutic agent for sepsis given its low cost and low risk of
      toxicity and side effects. There is no consensus regarding to the dose of vitamin D
      supplementation required for preterm infants given the paucity of evidence. AAP and ESPGHAN
      have recommended different dosages of vitamin D ranging from 400 IU to 1000 IU per day. The
      influence of different doses of vitamin D on immunological status and clinical outcomes of
      preterm infants with late-onset sepsis has not been evaluated before. This RCT will evaluate
      the influence of different doses of vitamin D3 (800 IU/d versus 400 IU/d), on serum levels of
      interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha and C- reactive (CRP) in premature infants with clinical
      evidence of late-onset sepsis we will also evaluate their safety and influence on clinical
      outcomes of these infants
