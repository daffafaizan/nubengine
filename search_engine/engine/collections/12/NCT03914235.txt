      use of local anesthesia, epinephrine and tourniquet in the areas of the hand to be repaired,
      making costs and time and comfort more efficient.

      Objective: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the WALANT technique versus regional anesthesia
      with tourniquet in pain control, surgical management of stenosing tenosynovitis.

      Material and methods: Open clinical trial including patients with the trigger finger, tunnel
      syndrome in the operating room, candidates for surgery, and excluding previous surgeries at
      the site of the injury, hemodynamic instability, peripheral vascular diseases, smoking,
      anxiety, or psychiatric diseases. The anesthetic method was applied to the incision sites
      according to the diagnosis and the proposed procedure. At the end of the test, tumescent
      solution and control, 1% lidocaine plus pneumatic tourniquet on the forearm at 250mmHg. The
      main variables were: type of anesthesia and pain during the procedure. Descriptive and
      inferential statistics were applied (xi2, t-student or Mann-Whitney U).
