      epilepsies can cause frequent and difficult to control seizures. Because of the ongoing
      seizures, these epilepsies can also cause cognitive impairment and neurological impairment.

      In many children with these Epileptic Encephalopathies, seizures are difficult to control
      with medical treatment, such as anti-convulsants or non-drug treatments like the ketogenic
      diet (a high fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet). This has resulted in a need to
      find therapies that are effective and better tolerated for children with epileptic
      encephalopathies.

      There is very limited data regarding the use of cannabis products in children, in particular
      cannabidiol-enriched cannabis oil in children with epilepsy. However, hemp oil products with
      high cannabidiol and low tetrahydrocannabinol ratios have been reported to provide seizure
      relief and cognitive improvement in children who take them.
