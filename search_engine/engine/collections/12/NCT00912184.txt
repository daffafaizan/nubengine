      molecules are difficult to remove by standard haemofiltration. Accordingly, they accumulate
      and contribute to morbidity in long-term dialysis patients. Molecules such as cytokines have
      been shown to play a central pathogenic role in critical illness. In critically ill acute
      renal failure patients, they accumulate in serum and likely contribute to much morbidity
      (fever, low blood pressure, myocardial dysfunction, renal failure itself etc.) Therefore, the
      removal of cytokines appears desirable. Although different approaches have been undertaken,
      all have had limited success due to complexity, limited efficacy or uncertain clinical
      response [10-15].

      It is possible that in using a different and more porous membrane, the removal of cytokines
      would be much more efficient and that clinical benefits of blood purification would,
      therefore, be greater.

      A membrane of this kind is now available. It is a modification (moderate increase in pore
      size) of another standard material called polyamide, which has already been used in millions
      of people for dialysis and haemofiltration. The increased pore size of these new membranes is
      directed at a more effective removal of middle molecular-weight toxins such as cytokines.
