    
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, monocentric, non-randomized trial. All patients
      with biochemically confirmed Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) who are scheduled for
      elective parathyroidectomy in the Endocrine and Digestive Surgery Unit of the University
      Hospital of Strasbourg are considered. Data concerning the age, the operative date, the
      results of the pre-operative biological work-up (plasma calcium, phosphor, parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) level, vitamin D), the results of pre-operative imaging (CT (computerized
      tomography) scan, 99mTc SestaMIBI Scan, 3D-Vitual Neck Exploration (VNE)), the operative data
      (the surgical approach, the localization and the dimensions of the adenoma (s), the necessity
      to convert to classical approach and its reason, the values of the intra operative PTH), the
      pathology results, the biological work-up at follow-up (plasma calcium, phosphor, PTH,
      vitamin D) are prospectively recorded in the database.
