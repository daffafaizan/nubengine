      downsizing primary tumors and metastatic lesions in patients with metastatic and advanced
      differentiated thyroid cancers before RAI Treatment.

      Standard treatment of thyroid cancer includes thyroidectomy, RAI treatment, and levothyroxine
      replacement therapy. Before RAI treatment, L-thyroxin replacement therapy should be stopped
      to induce TSH elevation, thereby promoting the intake of radioactive iodine in residual or
      metastatic lesions. However, the process of withdrawing L-thyroxin for 4-6 weeks might
      promote the progression of the tumor. The main hypothesis is that the use of tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor will reduce the tumor proliferation or metastasis rate of patients before RAI
      Treatment.

      Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor-2. This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial.
      Patients will receive axitinib 500mg qd for up to 12 week. Patients then will receive RAI
      Treatment. If the severe adverse effects discontinued study treatment prior to 12 week, the
      patient may also receive subsequent RAI treatment at the time of suspension. The follow-up
      period was followed up to assess safety and effectiveness.
