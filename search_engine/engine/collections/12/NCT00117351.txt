      distinct subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer which are difficult to treat in advanced
      stages. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of VELCADE therapy in patients with
      advanced BAC or adenocarcinoma with BAC features who have failed epidermal growth factor
      receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) therapy.
