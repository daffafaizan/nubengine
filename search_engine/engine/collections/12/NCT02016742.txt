    
      This is an open-label, randomised, single dose, 3-way crossover study to characterise and
      compare the PK, safety and tolerability of RDC5 in 15 healthy male volunteers. Eligible
      subjects will undergo 3 Treatment Periods, each separated by a washout period at least 14
      days. Subjects will receive a single dose of RDC5 during each of the three Treatment Periods
      in line with their randomized treatment sequence. A total of 4 dose levels will be evaluated
      within the study, though each subject will only receive 3 doses. A Data Review Team (DRT)
      will review the pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Treatment Periods 1 and 2 and select the doses
      to be evaluated in Treatment Periods 2 and 3. Subjects will return for a follow visit 21 days
      after the last dose of RDC5.
