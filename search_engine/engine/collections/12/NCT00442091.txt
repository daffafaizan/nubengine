    
      Dandelion juice has been used in herbal medicine for at least 1000 years. One case report has
      shown a beneficial effect of this herbal remedy on dyshidrotic hand eczema, and the purpose
      of this pilot study is to test whether this effect can be retrieved in other patients.

      The patients are recruited from our out-patient clinic. Only patients with negative patch
      tests to Compositae are offered treatment with dandelion juice for 20-30 days.
