    
      Descriptive study population in a working population in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona
      (Spain). The population will consist of subjects who come to the annual medical checkups at
      the hospital. Exclusion criteria: pregnant women.

      Assuming a prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness of 20 ± 5% with a confidence interval
      of 95% the number of subjects to be studied is 500.

      Methods:

        1. General information and anthropometric data

        2. Questionnaires

      2.1. General questionnaire, working schedules and anthropometric data

      2.2. Sleeping habits questionnaire

      2.3. Frequency of perceived daytime sleepiness (5 item questionnaire(Kim H, Young T.Sleep
      2005;28:625-634)

        1. Not rested during the day no matter how many hours of sleep you had

        2. Feeling of excessive daytime sleepiness 0.71† 0.08 0.03

        3. Great difficulty getting up in the morning 0.62† -0.06 -0.05

        4. Need for coffee, or other stimulants to stay awake during the day

        5. Falling asleep or dozing momentarily at meetings, church, etc. (item responses
           (frequency per month): 0=never, 1=rarely (once), 2= sometimes(2-4), 3 (often (5-15),
           4=almost always (16-30)

      2.4. Epworth sleepiness scale

      2.5. Berlin Questionnaire

      Questionnaires will be answered in an anonymous and voluntary way on the part of workers.

      Data analysis:

        1. General and anthropometric data (Mean and Standard Deviation)

        2. Sleep habits: sleep latency, sleep time (night and 24 hours), satisfaction with sleep,
           sleep-debt, anxiolytic medication before bedtime

        3. Prevalence of daytime sleepiness:

             -  Daytime sleepiness questionnaire, consisting of five items coded on a 0-4 ordinal
                scale (range 00-20 final score).

             -  Epworth sleepiness scale: range 0-24, being a value ≥ 10 indicative of daytime
                sleepiness.

             -  Association between daytime sleepiness, anthropometric variables, and variables
                derived from sleeping habits questionnaire.

        4. Prevalence of traffic accidents in itinera, and their association with daytime
           sleepiness, shift work or sleep apnea symptoms.

        5. Berlin Questionnaire: - Category 1 positive with 2 or more positive answers to questions
           2-6 - Category 2 positive with 2 or more positive answers to questions 7-9 - Category 3
           positive response with a positive and / or a BMI> 30 or more positive categories
           indicates a high probability of sleep apnea syndrome.
