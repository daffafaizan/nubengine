      treatment, following pelvic radiotherapy, in patients with high risk prostate cancer (PrCa)
      treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). One hundred patients with localized high
      risk PrCa will receive ADT for a total of 3 years. Three months after initiation of ADT all
      patients will receive pelvic (lymph node and prostate) treatment of 45Gy in 25 fractions (5
      days per week). Then patients will be randomized to receive either The conventional
      radiotherapy (CRT) of 33 - 35 Gy in 16 fractions (5 days per week - over 22 days) (comparator
      arm) or SBRT boost treatment of 19.5 - 21 Gy in three fractions (1 treatment per week - over
      22days) (experimental arm). SBRT boost treatment will be delivered with either cyberknife or
      VMAT technique.
