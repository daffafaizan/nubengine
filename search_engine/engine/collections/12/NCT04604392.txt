      effects of tooth tissue-borne (KBME), tooth-borne (Hyrax), and bone-borne (MIDME) rapid
      maxillary expansion (RME) appliances on sleep quality with polygraphy. Methods. This study
      was designed in parallel with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. 46 patients with narrow maxilla
      and OSAS were included in this study and randomly assigned to three groups: tooth
      tissue-borne, tooth-borne and boneborne expanders. Participants were congregated from the
      Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey. In
      all groups, the expansion appliance was activated one-quarter turn twice a day until the
      desired suture opening was achieved. The primary outcome of this study was the correction of
      posterior crossbite. Secondary outcomes included polygraphic assessment of sleep parameters.
      Each subject participated in 1 overnight sleep test with polygraphy before the expansion (T0)
      and after a 3- month retention phase of treatment (T1). According to the results of
      polygraphy, 7 parameters; (apnea hypopnea index (AHI), number of apnea and hypopnea,
      desaturation index, lowest desaturation, average saturation, supin AHI) were examined to
      evaluate the changes in sleep scores. Kruskal-Wallis analysis and Dunn-Bonferroni test were
      used for inter-group comparisons and Wilcoxon analysis was used for intra-group evalaution.
      P<0.05 was accepted statistically significant. Computer-generated randomization was used with
      group allocation concealed using opaque, sealed envelopes. The outcome assessor was blinded
      to group assignment. The outcome assessor was blinded; however, it was not feasible to blind
      either operator or patients.
