    
      This study is a domestic, multi-center, prospective, observational study designed for locally
      advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who plan to receive palliative
      chemotherapy. When patients voluntarily express their consent to provide their information to
      this study by signing a written agreement, their baseline information including demographics,
      comorbidities, pancreatic cancer-related information, medical treatment history, etc. shall
      be used for screening. When patients are judged eligible for study participation, they shall
      receive an appropriate palliative chemotherapy. After first-line chemotherapy (baseline),
      information review shall be conducted at month 2, 6 and 12 for chemotherapy currently in use
      (whether or not chemotherapy ended/discontinued and relevant reasons; type, frequency and
      duration of administered drugs), RECIST, quality of life (month 2 and 6), activity
      performance assessment, laboratory tests, tumor marker test, adverse drug reactions, etc.
      However, if first-line chemotherapy moves to second-line chemotherapy due to causes such as
      progressive disease (PD), information review shall be restricted to the relevant drug name
      and survival until the end of the study (month 12).
