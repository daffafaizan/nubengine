    
      Preksha Meditation Research: The goal of this project is to assess impact of an 8 week course
      of Preksha Meditation (combination of Green color and buzzing sound meditation), in a group
      of college students to assess potential benefits to their pulmonary function, cognitive
      ability (immediate recall, attention), and happiness. The investigators will compare the data
      received from prior study to analyze their performance before and after. The investigators
      will also compare this data with control group data, to assess potential improvements as a
      benchmark. Analyse the EEG data to investigate its impact on brain. Further analyze their
      blood cells if they show any epigenetic changes. Data analysis team will be blinded for no
      identifiers are available.

      METHOD AND PROCEDURES:

      The data analysis will be undertaken by experts and will be blinded. The data currently is
      only de-identified.

      The data which is already collected from the research "Effect of Preksha Meditation (Green
      color and Buzzing Meditation) on Cognitive Abilities and Pulmonary Function in Students with
      a Control Group" will be analyzed. The data is related to students having practiced minimum 3
      guided 25 minute sessions per week in a controlled environment. The control group did not
      meditate for those weeks when they enrolled in the program.

      The intervention the subjects received was as follows:

      Experimental group 3 days per week Sessions: 5 minutes: Relaxation and Review of Meditation
      Practices 10 minutes: Mahapraan Meditation 10 minutes: Green color meditation Begin in stages

        -  0 - 2 Weeks: Teach technique and carry out 15 minutes meditation sessions.

        -  2 - 9 Weeks: Increment meditation sessions to a length of 25 minutes. 5 minutes: Review
           of meditation experience and collection of information
