      (LLS), essentially due to progress of the surgical techniques, technology and diagnostic
      imaging. During the Louisville conference on LLS (2008) the technique was thoroughly
      described and defined. One of the most important statements was the promotion of national
      registries, taking into account the logistics and feasibility problems of randomized trials
      in this setting. The main purpose to hold a Belgian national registry is to define the role
      of LLS in our country, looking for short and long-term outcomes, especially in case of liver
      tumors.

      In Belgium approximately 1000 liver resections are performed each year, however, the rate and
      results of LLS are unknown. The prospective data collection will highlight the role and
      incidence of LLS. Eventually, the registry will serve as support for scientific projects on
      different topics.

      The evolution of the national practice will be measured by looking to the ratio between
      laparoscopic and open procedures registered in the electronic CRF (eCRF) in a single center
      during a time period.

      The registration of additional parameters (as per below) will be necessary for comparing
      outcomes between conventional and laparoscopic techniques.

      The registered cases will be recorded prospectively and consecutively.
