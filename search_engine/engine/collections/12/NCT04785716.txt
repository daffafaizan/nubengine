      ovarian cancer. While there is now also evidence for the efficacy in the first line setting,
      they were initially studied in recurrent disease both as maintenance after chemotherapy but
      also as treatment on its own. The NOVA study was conducted in the maintenance setting of
      patients with recurrent high-grade serous ovarian-, tube or peritoneal cancer who had
      responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. In 2017 Tesaro opened an individual patient access
      program in Norway, and in July 2017 the first Norwegian patient was enrolled. We performed a
      retrospective observational study of patients treated with niraparib in the individual
      patient access program in Norway. The objective of the study is to provide preliminary
      efficacy and safety data in a rather unselected population of non-gBRCA patients with
      recurrent ovarian-, tube-, or peritoneal cancer.
