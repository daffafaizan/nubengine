      recommendation for patients with early and medium-stage colorectal cancer. Current guidelines
      from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network indicate that either laparotomy (open surgery)
      or laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery performed with either conventional or robotic
      techniques) is an acceptable approach to radical resection in patients with early- and medium
      stage (I to III) colorectal cancer. These recommendations have led to widespread use of a
      minimally invasive approach for radical resection, although there is a paucity of adequately
      powered, prospective, randomized trials evaluating short term and survival outcomes.

      Retrospective studies involving patients with early and medium-stage colorectal cancer have
      shown that laparoscopic resection is associated with less intraoperative blood loss, a
      shorter length of hospital stay, and a lower risk of postoperative complications than open
      abdominal radical resection. Similarly, the minimally invasive approach has not been
      associated with lower 5-year rates of disease-free survival or overall survival than the open
      approach. In addition, retrospective studies have shown that recurrence rates and survival
      rates do not differ significantly between the two approaches.

      The investigators hypothesized that minimally invasive surgery was not inferior or superior
      to open radical resection in terms of short-term and long-term outcome. In the present trial,
      the Laparoscopic Resection and Laparotomy for Colorectal Cancer (LRLCC) Trial, the
      investigators tested this hypothesis by prospectively assigning patients to minimally
      invasive (conventional laparoscopic or robotic) or open abdominal radical surgery and
      comparing the short-term outcome, the rate of recurrence, and the overall survival rate
      between the two groups.
