      intervention group (IG) and healthy volunteers of different age, sex and body mass index
      (BMI) as the reference group (RG).

      Patients of the IG participated in a training session every three days with an anti-gravity
      treadmill (Picture 1, alterGÂ®, www.alterg.com) for a total of 40 days in addition to
      physiotherapy, lymph drainage massage and manual therapy.

      Patients were evaluated on three successive dates: Baseline (S1), after mobilization without
      crutches with full weight-bearing (20 days, S2) and after 40 days (S3)
