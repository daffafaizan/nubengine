    
      This is an open-label, split-tattoo, single-center prospective, comparison study in up to 20
      male or female subjects, age 18 to 65 years, who desire laser removal of a tattoo containing
      single or multi-color ink. Subjects will receive up to 10 laser treatments, spaced 1 to 10
      weeks apart, and will be followed at 6 weeks (±2 weeks). At the Investigator's discretion, an
      optional follow-up visit may be conducted at 12 weeks (±2 weeks) post-final treatment.
