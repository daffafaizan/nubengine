      nitrofurantoin. The End of Treatment visit, Post Therapy Evaluation visit, and Final
      Follow-up visit was planned within 2 days following the last dose of study drug, on Day 14
      (+/- 2 days) after the first dose of study drug, and within 30 to 37 days following the first
      dose of study drug, respectively. The study followed a double-dummy design. To maintain the
      study blinding, participants assigned to omadacycline received active omadacycline tablets
      and over-encapsulated nitrofurantoin placebo tablets. Participants assigned to the
      nitrofurantoin arm received omadacycline placebo tablets and over-encapsulated active
      nitrofurantoin capsules.
