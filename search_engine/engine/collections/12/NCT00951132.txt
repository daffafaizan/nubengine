      mechanism is systemic inflammation. Further, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease,
      rosuvastatin decreases the risk, especially among patients with increased inflammation. This
      is a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether the antiinflammatory effect of
      rosuvastatin is similar in depressive as in patients with cardiovascular disease.
