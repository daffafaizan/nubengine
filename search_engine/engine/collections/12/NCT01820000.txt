    
      To discover new information about MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) called DWI (diffusion
      weighted imaging) and its ability to diagnose cardiac scarring.

      CMR-DE (cardiac MR with delayed contrast enhancement) evaluates if there has been scarring in
      the heart muscle following a heart attack.

      Subjects are injected with a contrast medication that makes the scarring visible if present.
      To prove the efficacy of DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) to provide the same images that
      CMR-DE (cardiac magnetic resonance with delayed contrast enhancement) provides.
