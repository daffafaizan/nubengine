      Nitric Oxide Synthase, the name for the investigational radioactive drug that targets iNOS)
      and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as a measure of lung inflammation. PET is a
      machine that detects radiation and generates pictures using a donut shaped scanner similar in
      appearance to an x-ray "CAT" scan.

      In order to show that [18F](+/-)NOS-PET is related to the amount of inflammation, the
      investigators first need to create a state of controlled lung inflammation that can be
      measured and quantified. "Controlled lung inflammation" means a reaction in the lungs that is
      similar to that which occurs during lung infection (increased respiratory secretions, and
      cough). It is "controlled" because the investigators will not be using anything alive or
      contagious (it will not spread from one part of your body to another, and cannot spread to
      another person) and a small area in only one lung will be affected. In order to create this
      state of controlled lung inflammation, the investigators plan to put a small amount of
      endotoxin into a single small section of the lung using a bronchoscope (a long, flexible,
      narrow tube that is passed through the nose or the mouth into the airways of the lung). This
      use of endotoxin is considered investigational. The investigators have received permission
      from the FDA to use endotoxin in this research study.
