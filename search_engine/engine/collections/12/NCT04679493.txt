      days), treatment (1 or 14 days) and follow-up (7 or 28 days).

      The volunteers of single dosing cohorts will receive the investigated drug (ID) ХС7 or
      placebo once and stay at the study center for at least 24 hours after the ID administration
      to monitor the safety parameters and for sampling for PK analysis. The Follow-up will last 7
      days, during which safety parameters and PK in volunteers will be studied. Based on all
      safety data from the XC7 100 mg cohort, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will
      consider dose increase and entry of the 200 mg cohort. If the single dose of ХС7 200 mg is
      considered to be safe, the third multiple dosing cohort of 200 mg will be included in the
      study.

      The volunteers from multiple dosing cohort will receive the ID (ХС7 or placebo) once a day
      during 14 days and will stay at the hospital (study center) during the first five days after
      administration of the ID. The Follow-up will last 14 days, during which they will study
      safety parameters and PK in volunteers.
