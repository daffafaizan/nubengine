      including high precision, repeatability and a large variety of corneal wound profiles. The
      aim of this study is the long term analysis of two types of FSL 3-plane corneal wound
      profiles, namely CT1 and CT2, CT2 being constructed with a reversed front corneal incision
      segment to ensure tigher wound closure and better corneal wound reapposition. The traditional
      manual wound performed with a standard keratome will be used as a reference. As FSL cataract
      surgery may be associated with a greater incidence of wound leaks at the end of surgery as
      compared to manual wound construction with keratomes, this study will also aim at determining
      wich clinical and OCT wound parameters are associated with a higher likelihood of wound
      leaks.
