      during exposure enhances outcomes for some anxiety-related problems, no previous study has
      examined this possibility in the context of unwanted obsessions. Adults with a moderately
      distressing obsessional thought were randomly assigned to four twice-weekly sessions of
      either: (a) gradual exposure (EXP-G), emphasizing hierarchical exposure completion, or (b)
      variable exposure (EXP-V), emphasizing variability in exposure intensity.
