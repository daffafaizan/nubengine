      States. Cardiac rehabilitation is a multifaceted physical activity program that incorporates
      medication adherence, smoking cessation, nutrition, and psychological counseling.
      Implementation of cardiac rehabilitation among those with cardiovascular disease (including
      ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and valvular heart disease) has been shown to increase
      physical activity and reduce cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and hospital readmission
      rates. Cardiac rehabilitation carries a class I indication (standard of care) for post-acute
      coronary syndrome, post-percutaneous coronary intervention, in patients undergoing coronary
      artery bypass grafting/valve surgery, in patients with stable angina, and in patients with
      chronic heart failure per American College of Cardiology guidelines. Patient attendance and
      completion rates of a full regimen of cardiac rehabilitation therapy have been shown to be <
      40% of those referred, depriving many eligible patients of the benefits of cardiac
      rehabilitation. The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of using behavioral
      economic interventions targeting daily step goals using wearable activity monitors to improve
      cardiac rehabilitation attendance among patients already referred for cardiac rehabilitation.
      We will compare three groups of 30 patients each as follows: 1) behaviorally designed
      gamification with social support; 2) loss-framed financial incentives; and 3) behaviorally
      designed gamification with social support AND loss-framed financial incentives.
