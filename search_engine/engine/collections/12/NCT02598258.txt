      countries, 30 healthy subjects aged 40 years and older will be at the Montreal Heart
      Institute Prevention and Cardiac Rehabilitation centre. A recent complete evaluation will
      have excluded any cardiac condition. Subjects will first spend 10 minutes in a dry sauna at
      85 degrees celtius. Immediately after , subjects will be immersed in a cold water bath (ICool
      , Australia) at a temperature of 5 degrees celtius for approximately one minute. Blood
      pressure , ecg , gaz exchange and thoracic impedance will be measured during sauna and cold
      water bath.

      Principal goal of study: to determine the safety of this practice. Secondary goals of study:
      to measure the blood pressure response, heart rate, presence of arrythmyas, cardiac output
      and cerebral perfusion during both conditions.

      Primary endpoint: Change in systolic blood pressure from sauna (after 10 minutes ) to cold
      water (after one minute).

      Physiologic measurements: continuous ECG monitoring, BP measurements at every 3 minutes
      during sauna and at one minute in the cold bath, gaz exchange with a portable equipment
      (Cosmed K4), bioimpedance and cerebral perfusion with a single frontal NIRS electrode.
