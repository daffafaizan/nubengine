    
      This is an open-label pharmacokinetic (PK) study of twice daily doses of 50 mg of N91115
      administered for 14 days in F508del-CFTR homozygous CF patients. Six patients are planned for
      enrollment. Each patient will undergo screening (Day 28 to Day 3) and, if eligible, will
      return to the clinical site on Day 1 or optionally on Day 1. Eligibility will be reconfirmed
      and the patient will be admitted to a clinical research unit (CRU). Patients will stay
      overnight from Day 1 to Day 2 and will be discharged on Day 2 after all procedures and
      assessments are completed. Patients will return to the CRU as outpatients on Days 4, 7, 11,
      14, and 15 for PK sample collection and other assessments. They will receive an oral dose of
      investigational medicinal product (IMP), N91115, twice daily on Days 1 through 14 and will be
      followed for PK through Day 15. Telephone calls to assess safety and ensure compliance with
      dosing will be made on days that patients do not make clinic visits (Days 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,
      12, and 13). Follow-up safety calls will then be made on Day 21 (adverse events) and Day 28
      (serious adverse events only). Participation of an individual patient may last approximately
      56 days from the time of screening until the end-of-study (Day 28) follow-up call.
