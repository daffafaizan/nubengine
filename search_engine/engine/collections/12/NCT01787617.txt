      African American males. African American males have higher rates of diabetes and lower levels
      of fitness when compared to Caucasian males. A project such as this is necessary because
      there is evidence to show that exercise training can reduce the risk of developing diabetes,
      though no studies have been conducted in African American males. In addition, ARTIIS will
      test the effect adhering to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (150 minutes
      of moderate intensity aerobic activity and 2 days of 20 minutes of muscular strength
      activity), on insulin resistance in African American men. This study will provide important
      information that can either strengthen or refine current physical activity recommendations.
      Furthermore, this intervention will be delivered through community facilities in order to
      increase the likelihood that the intervention will be sustainable.
