    
      This is a Phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TACE combined with sintilimab
      and bevacizumab in patients with unresectable intermediate or advanced HCC.

      36-39 subjects with unresectable intermediate or advanced HCC will be enrolled in the study.

      This study includes dose escalation and dose expansion stage. 6-9 subjects will be enrolled
      in dose escalation stage for the safety evaluation. Then, sintilimab 200mg/kg IV. every three
      weeks (q3w) + the select specific dose of bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg (group 1) or 15mg/kg (group2)
      IV q3w, expand to 36 patients (18 patients each group) for the further safety and efficacy
      study.

      Sintilimab and bevacizumab will be started at 3-7 days after the first TACE. TACE will be
      repeated if clinically indicated based on the evaluation of follow-up laboratory and imaging
      examination. And the study treatment of sintilimab and bevacizumab will last up to 24 months,
      or until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of
      follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever
      occurs first.
