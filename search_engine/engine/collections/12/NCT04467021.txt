    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the feasibility of an intensive (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 120 mmHg)
      "Intervention" versus standard care (SBP < 140 mmHg) "Non-Intervention" approach to blood
      pressure (BP) control in metastatic renal cell and thyroid cancer patients initiating
      anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive intensive systolic blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients
      receive increased blood pressure medication every 2 weeks while systolic blood pressure is
      120 mmHg or higher. Patients also monitor blood pressure at home 1 day a week (4 times in 1
      day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressure readings to the provider and to a
      central blood pressure monitoring team. Patients with changes in blood pressure medications
      monitor blood pressure readings on 3 days in 1 week (4 times in 1 day).

      ARM B: Patients receive standard blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients receive
      blood pressure medications per doctor's instruction. Patients also monitor blood pressure at
      home 1 day (4 times in 1 day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressures to a
      central monitoring team.
