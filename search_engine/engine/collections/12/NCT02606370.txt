      extremity muscles and reduce joint loading. A large number of studies have reported increased
      electromyographic (EMG) activity throughout the gait cycle in most of the lower limb muscles,
      and significant kinematic changes in the lower extremity. However, no studies have
      investigated the effects of wearing (1 month) unstable shoes on 1) spine kinematics, 2) trunk
      muscle activity and 3) Low Back Pain (LBP) during gait in Patients with chronic LBP.

      Aim: To compare trunk muscle activity, lumbar spine range of motion (ROM) and LBP during gait
      using an unstable shoe (Intervention group) and a conventional stable control shoe (Control
      Group).

      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial. Setting: A Biomechanics laboratory. Population: Patients
      with Low Back Pain.
