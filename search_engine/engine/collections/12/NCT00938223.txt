    
      Each vaccination will be administered over a 6-week period (days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43).
      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups, Group A or Group B.

      Group A will receive 4 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (1 each restricted
      by HLA-A1, -A3, and two restricted by HLA-A2) and a tetanus helper peptide.

      Group B will receive the 12 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (4 each
      restricted to HLA-A1, -A2, and -A3) and a tetanus helper peptide.

      All vaccines will contain GM-CSF-in-adjuvant and will be administered intradermally and
      subcutaneously. Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also
      receive an additional set of 3 identical vaccinations in a distal site, the response to which
      will be evaluated at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic
      mapping and sentinel node biopsy methods and will be referred to as the sentinel immunized
      node (SIN).
