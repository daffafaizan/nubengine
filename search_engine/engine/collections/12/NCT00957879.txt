      physiology. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets
      (ADHR), and tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO) are 3 rare diseases characterized by
      rickets/osteomalacia, fractures, and hypophosphatemia secondary to renal phosphate wasting
      and inappropriately low levels of activated vitamin D (calcitriol), which are caused by
      excess amounts of or mutated FGF23. FGF23 excess also occurs in renal failure, where elevated
      FGF23 levels predict increased mortality. Thus, abnormal FGF23 appears to be central to both
      rare and common diseases. While FGF23 appears to be regulated by vitamin D, dietary and serum
      phosphate, much is still unknown. The effects of different forms of vitamin D on FGF23
      stimulation are not well characterized. Similarly, any racial differences in the regulation
      of FGF23 by vitamin D have not been investigated.

      To address these knowledge deficits, we will randomize 52 vitamin D deficient (25OHD < or =
      24 ng/mL by LC/MS) Caucasian and African-American men and women to treatment with either
      dietary vitamin D or activated vitamin D for 12 weeks. Our primary endpoint will be the
      change in FGF23 with dietary versus activated vitamin D.
