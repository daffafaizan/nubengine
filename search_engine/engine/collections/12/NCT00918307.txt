      malignancies (especially lung cancer), non-AIDS bacterial infections and cardio-vascular
      diseases). Approximately 50% of HIV-infected patients are regular tobacco smokers. Tobacco
      smoking cessation has well known benefits on mortality and morbidity in the general
      population where tobacco cessation assistance programs are increasingly implemented. However,
      smoking cessation interventions have never been evaluated among HIV-infected patients. This
      trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation
      compared with placebo. A pharmacokinetic study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of
      smoking cessation on the plasma concentration of antiretroviral treatment.
