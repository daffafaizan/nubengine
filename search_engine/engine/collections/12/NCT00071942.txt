      I. To assess the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with an admixture of
      recombinant vaccinia viruses (rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM vaccine
      admixture.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity of adding GM-CSF to the admixture of the rV-MUC-1 and
      rV-TRICOM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess host immune reactivity following rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM with and without GM-CSF
      administration.

      II. To determine whether vaccination with rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM with and without GM-CSF is
      associated with antitumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive vaccination comprising recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 and recombinant
      vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine intradermally on days 1 and 29 (for a total of 2 doses) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 and
      recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients (including 5
      HLA-A2-positive patients) receive vaccination as above at the MTD and sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 1-4 and 29-32.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, monthly until disease progression, and then annually for up
      to 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-22 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
