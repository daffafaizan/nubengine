      directed at disruption or elimination of tumor tolerance, a phenomenon now demonstrated to be
      involved in the growth of many solid tumors. D-1MT, or any other substance targeting this
      enzymatic pathway indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase (IDO), has not been used previously in
      humans. Although pre-clinical toxicology in rats and dogs shows an extremely encouraging
      toxicity profile, the study needs to carefully evaluate the toxicities and pharmacokinetics
      to provide the basis for assigning a safe and biologically effective dosing regimen for later
      trials determining its contribution to tumor responses in phase II and III clinical trials.
