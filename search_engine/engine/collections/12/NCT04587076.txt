      that may impair health. These days, bariatric surgery is considered the most effective
      treatment of morbid obesity. In the last decade, the number of bariatric surgeries performed
      worldwide constantly increased. Common bariatric surgery procedures include gastric bypass,
      sleeve gastrectomy, adjustable gastric band, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal
      switch. After surgery, weight loss is induced by a reduced food volume the stomach can hold,
      malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both mechanisms. In consequence, patients
      with bariatric surgery have an increased risk of developing nutrient deficiency. Therefore,
      guidelines recommend supplementation of critical nutrients, i.e. protein, vitamins, and
      minerals, after bariatric surgery. This study assesses intake of these nutrients in patients
      with bariatric surgery based on the recommendations provided by the German S3 Guideline Group
      on the Surgical Treatment of Obesity and Metabolic Diseases. In particular, this study
      assesses the association of therapy adherence with age, sex, and socioeconomic status.
