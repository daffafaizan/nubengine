      morphologies and larger extent of coronary atherosclerosis compared with stable coronary
      artery disease. The detailed vascular information obtained by OCT may impact PCI in ACS, and
      which may improve acute results and late outcomes of PCI. Stent expansion immediately after
      PCI is a strong predictor of late outcomes of PCI, and it is associated with late clinical
      outcomes in many previous trials.
