    
      This is a cross-sectional study examining neurocognitive function and brain activity in
      resting state and during working memory and executive function tasks using blood oxygen level
      dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic and hyperglycemic
      clamps in obese adolescents with T2D compared to non-diabetic obese and lean controls. The
      investigators will measure glycemic control (acute hyperglycemia during clamps and glycemic
      variability) and insulin resistance to examine their association with neurocognitive metrics
      and brain functional activity.

      There will be one screening visit and three study visits for subjects with T2D. One visit
      will consist of neurocognitive testing and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the
      whole body to assess body composition including fat mass. In the other two visits, subjects
      with T2D will undergo normal and high glucose clamps during fMRI.

      Obese and lean control subjects will have one screening visit and two study visits, one for
      neurocognitive testing and DEXA and another for fMRI without glucose clamps. All subjects
      will have a blood sample obtained at the screening visit.

      Only adolescents with type 2 diabetes will wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 6 days
      prior to neuroimaging to determine glycemic variability. A1C will be assessed at baseline.

      Parents of subjects will also have abbreviated IQ testing.
