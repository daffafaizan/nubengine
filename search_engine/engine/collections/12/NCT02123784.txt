      muscles and tendons that form the rotator cuff) are extremely common injuries and represent
      the most common muscle-tendon tear in patients. Repair of rotator cuff tears is usually
      advocated for painful tears with functional impairment. However, high failure rates of 13-68%
      have been reported for surgical repair of rotator cuff tears, irrespective of the surgical
      technique employed. Higher rates of re-rupture are associated with larger tears, increased
      patient age, and increased fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles. There is no general
      consensus as to the causes of re-rupture; where mechanical factors, the existing techniques
      of suturing, and biological factors are considered as the main factors of recurrence.
