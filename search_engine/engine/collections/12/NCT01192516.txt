      disability among older adults. Almost 50% of users of the Veterans Affairs (VA) system
      present with osteoarthritis. Veterans are a particularly important group to target for
      symptom management interventions as they are twice as likely as non-veterans to report
      chronic joint symptoms and activity limitations. There are few evidence-based symptom
      management interventions offered by health care professionals, such as occupational and
      physical therapists, at the time when people are seeking treatment for their symptoms. The
      proposed activity pacing intervention is individually-tailored to a person's symptom and
      activity patterns. This tailoring provides a personally-relevant and focused intervention
      that may help people adopt this strategy into their daily lives.
