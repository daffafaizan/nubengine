      by different means, however right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard diagnostic
      method .

      Among the different subgroups of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), those associated with
      connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are a specific entity with distinct hemodynamic and
      prognostic features reflecting the importance of a rheumatological assessment in PAH,
      especially with the unfavorable prognostic impact in these patients.

      Compared to patients with idiopathic PAH, patients with CTD-associated PAH have a higher
      mortality and a lower walking distance on the 6-minute walk test, higher levels of B-type
      natriuretic peptide, worse right ventricular function, more left-sided heart dysfunction,
      lower lung function, and more pericardial disease.

      That's why, PAH screening is routinely performed in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and in other
      CTDs and also, as suggested by international guidelines, it is important to rule out CTDs in
      patients with PAH, because patients diagnosed as idiopathic PAH (iPAH) may have an associated
      CTD previously unrecognized.

      Although the similarities in pathogenesis of PAH in CTD such as systemic sclerosis (SSc),
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), there are
      variabilities in outcomes in patients with CTD-associated PAH.
