      coronary artery disease or aortic stenosis, who are already undergoing cardiac surgery for
      clinical purposes (e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular heart disease).

      Hemodynamic tests will be performed using standard clinical resources used as part of routine
      care in this setting, including pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization. After obtaining
      written informed consent, patients will undergo induction with general anesthesia as per
      clinical practice. The chest will be open but pericardium left intact. Cardiac hemodynamics
      (PA wedge pressure, PAWP; PA pressure, PAP, right atrial pressure, RAP) will be measured
      using PA catheter already in place at rest, and then during conditions of increased cardiac
      preload, induced by passive leg elevation and saline bolus (300 ml administered over 1-2
      minutes).

      The surgical team will then perform anterior pericardiotomy, with removal of pericardial
      restraint similar to our percutaneous approach but using currently-available surgical tools.
      This will not be a complete pericardiectomy but rather a limited anterior incision to gain
      access to the heart for surgical exposure (standard care).

      The surgical team will then repeat hemodynamic assessments at rest and with acute volume
      loading (leg raise + saline) in exactly the same manner as with the pericardium intact. Our
      hypothesis is that as compared to pericardium intact, the increase in PAWP with volume
      loading will be reduced following opening of the pericardium.
