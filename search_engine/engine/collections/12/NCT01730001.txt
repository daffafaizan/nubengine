    
      The ELITE trial is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare competent
      EARLY-intubation to LATE-intubation in patients with on-scene Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9
      and short ambulance transport times (< 20 min) to hospital.

      The study aims to establish if advanced airway management with endotracheal intubation (ETI)
      in the field by specially trained Emergency Medical Services (EMS) physicians - compared to
      endotracheal intubation (ETI) performed by physicians in the emergency department in the same
      group - improves outcome in terms of 30-day mortality, degree of disability at discharge,
      complications and length of hospital stay, and neurologic outcome at 6 months.
