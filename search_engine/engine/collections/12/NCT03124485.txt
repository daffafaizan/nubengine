      been proposed as a non-surgical procedure for the management of obesity with or without
      diabetes mellitus. Preliminary data based on single arm series or phase II studies have
      reported promising short and intermediate term weight control effect.

      However, whether ESG is a feasible option comparable to LSG in the intermediate term remains
      an unanswered question. In addition, physical and functional outcomes after ESG were not well
      documented in most of the reported series.

      Realizing there is a knowledge gap in applying ESG to patients with morbid obesity, we
      propose to study and compare the efficacy of weight control and functional outcomes of ESG
      against conventional LSG. Through this prospective randomized trial, the safety profiles,
      quality of life and changes in fasting and post-prandial gut hormone secretion after the two
      procedures will also be assessed and compared. The evidence thus generated shall lay a
      scientific foundation for ESG which may become an alternative choice for patients who have
      concerns about complication and irreversibility of most bariatric surgery.
