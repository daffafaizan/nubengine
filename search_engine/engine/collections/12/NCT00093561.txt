        -  Determine the toxicity and safety of lycopene supplementation as chemoprevention for
           prostate cancer in healthy participants.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this agent in these participants.

        -  Determine the dose range of this agent in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants ingest a single-dose of oral lycopene over a maximum of 15 minutes on day 1.

      Cohorts of 5 participants receive escalating doses of lycopene until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5
      participants experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Participants are evaluated periodically for 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 participants will be accrued for this study.
