      Two groups have been generated (pre-pandemic period and pandemic period), classified into
      scheduled and emergency surgery. The investigators determined age, type of surgery and
      specialty, hospital stay, destination at discharge including mortality and severity according
      to Diagnostic Related to Group (DRG) scale. The investigators have also determined the number
      of confirmed COVID-19 infections in patients who underwent surgery during these 2 periods and
      evaluated if the infection was due to a nosocomial infection (confirmation of the COVID-19
      during the hospitalization period). Comparisons were made between subgroups: scheduled
      surgery performed during the 2 periods and emergency surgery performed during the 2 periods.
