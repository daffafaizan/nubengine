      registry. Between March 2014 to February 2017, all consecutive 47 patients with ischemic
      stroke and PFO documented by bubble contrast with no other identifiable cause of the ischemic
      event, such as, carotid or intracranial artery stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and thrombus,
      or atheromatous plaque at the aortic arch (i.e. CS), were analyzed. PFO closure was
      determined according to the heart-brain team's discretion (the team consisted of an
      interventional cardiologist, an echocardiographer cardiologist, a neurologist, and a
      radiologist) based on clinical data, echocardiographic findings, and patients' preference.
      The Gore® Septal Occluder (WL Gore & Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) (n=19) and the
      Amplatzer® PFO occluder (St. Jude Medical, Inc. St.Paul, MN, USA) (n=19) and were used. The
      Occlutec® PFO occluder was used in one patient who were excluded from the analysis. The
      Institutional Review Board of Gachon University Gil Medical Center approved this study and
      all patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.
