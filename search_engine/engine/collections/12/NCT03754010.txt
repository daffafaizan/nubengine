      split-mouth, randomized-controlled study. The study population will be divided into four
      groups: in Group 1 (SRP): SRP+ saline; in Group 2 (SRP+HAgel): SRP + HA gel; in Group 3
      (SRP+HAmo): SRP+ HA mouthrinse; and in Group 4 (SRP+HAmo+HAgel): SRP+HA mouthrinse + HA
      gingival gel were applied. At baseline and Week 4 periodontal clinical parameters and PISA
      will be calculated. Also, GCF amount will be collected to evaluate ADA, CAT, and GSH by
      spectrophotometric analysis.
