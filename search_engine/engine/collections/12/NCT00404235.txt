      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and antitumor activity of carboplatin and paclitaxel
           albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (ABI-007) in patients with unresectable
           stage IV melanoma who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.
           (Cohort 1)

        -  Assess the safety and antitumor activity of this regimen in patients with unresectable
           stage IV melanoma who have received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.
           (Cohort 2)

      Secondary

        -  Describe the impact of this regimen on parameters of immune function and angiogenesis in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      for metastatic disease (yes vs no).

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (ABI-007) IV over 30
      minutes followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected periodically to evaluate secreted protein acidic
      and rich in cysteine (SPARC) content of tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry and to explore
      the impact of therapy on immune homeostasis. Samples are also analyzed by immunoenzyme
      techniques for angiogenesis markers.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 74 patients will be accrued for this study.
