      ongoing debate on the potential of an increased incidence of late stent thrombosis,
      particularly after discontinuation of thienopyridine therapy, as well as of delayed onset of
      restenosis or catch-up phenomenon with permanent polymer-based DES. The extent of strut
      coverage with reduction of exposed thrombogenic material has been shown to be associated with
      the inflammatory reaction grade and with the incidence of stent thrombosis. The optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) is an intravascular imaging modality based on light. The principle
      is similar to intravascular ultrasound, but due to the much shorter wave length of light, it
      offers a much better resolution up to 10Âµm, enabling the exact determination of strut
      coverage, neointimal thickness, vessel size, presence of dissections, and even the presence
      of inflammation.

      Patients who received a polymer-free or a permanent-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent about 5
      years ago without in-segment intervention since, will be evaluated by OCT regarding the
      healing pattern and the late lumen loss of the stent.
