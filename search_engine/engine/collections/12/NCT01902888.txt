      Endoprosthesis for the treatment of subjects with Popliteal Artery Aneurysms. The study
      population includes subjects with an asymptomatic aneurysm (≥ 2 cm diameter) of the popliteal
      artery, symptomatic aneurysm (no diameter requirement) of the popliteal artery, or presence
      of mural thrombus (no diameter requirement) of the popliteal artery treated with the GORE®
      VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2010. Starting with most
      recently treated within the above date range, patients meeting Inclusion/Exclusion will be
      enrolled, until a minimum of 50 subjects with adequate follow up to determine primary
      endpoints through 12 months will be provided.
