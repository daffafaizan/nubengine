      characterized by the accumulation of CD1a+ Langerhans cells (LCs) organized in granulomas
      that develop in, and destroy the wall of distal bronchioles. In adults the disease occurs
      predominantly in young smokers from both genders, with a peak incidence at 20-40 yrs of age,
      although female may be slightly older. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung
      has provided a considerable input for the diagnosis of pulmonary LCH.

      We conducted a multicenter retrospective study on patients with pulmonary LCH who were
      sequentially evaluated by concomitant lung HRCT and lung function testing. The objectives of
      this study were: 1) to determine the changes over time of lung function parameters in
      patients with pulmonary LCH; 2) to compare the variations of HRCT and lung function results
      during follow-up; 3) to address the respective interest of these investigations for
      identifying the patients who eventually will experience a progression of their disease.
      Results of this study may help to improve the management of patients with adult pulmonary
      LCH.
