      experience the interaction with a computer-generated environment. It may provide some
      advantages over conventional care: it allows the simulation of realistic environments and
      patients feel more motivated by this kind of virtual environment. VR constitutes an enriched
      environment with augmented multiple sensory feedbacks (auditory, visual, tactile VR enriched
      environment) that has already shown some efficiency in reducing chronic pain. There is
      mounting evidence from acute pain conditions, such as wound care, that VR could play a role
      as an additional treatment method to relieve pain A possible explanation for its mechanism of
      action is provided by "the gate-theory of attention". VR reduces the perception of pain by
      diverting attention away from the pain. Most children experience pain and fear when receiving
      a medical treatment; two feelings which are closely related and affecting one another.
      Moreover, children often describe procedures involving needles as the most stressful portion
      of the hospital experience. Children who have been implanted with an intrathecal baclofen
      (ITB) pump, need to come to the hospital for a refill approximately every 3 months, depending
      on the exact dose. During the refill, the physician places a needle directly into the
      reservoir to refill the pump. To alleviate the pain and fear with these refill procedures, it
      is hypothesized that VR could alleviate pain and make these refills more feasible. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to evaluate whether VR is reducing pain during a refill procedure,
      in children receiving intrathecal drug delivery compared to usual care.
