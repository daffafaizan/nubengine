      expectations well above 60%. The researchers have published preliminary evidence that
      continuous hemofiltration may greatly improve survival, if filtration is begun when the child
      first fulfills clinical criteria for ARDS. This is a departure from standard practice, as
      hemofiltration is usually begun later in the course (if at all) when multiple organ failure
      is entrenched. Hemofiltration, a 'renal replacement therapy' for critically ill patients, is
      a slow, continuous process in which a semi-permeable membrane removes plasma water and
      solutes (up to about 35 kiloDaltons). Many cytokine and chemokine molecules are smaller than
      the molecular weight limit of the filter; hemofiltration might remove a critical amount,
      attenuating the unregulated inflammatory response responsible for respiratory failure and
      progression to multiple organ failure and death. The researchers will conduct a multi-center
      randomized trial assessing the effect of hemofiltration on survival from respiratory after
      bone marrow (or more precisely, hematopoietic stem cell) transplantation. The researchers
      will perform sensitive proteomic assays of serum and ultrafiltrate, to detect the presence of
      cytokines and chemokines known to be active in idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Resulting
      profiles will constitute a uniquely complex description of ultrafiltrate and may provide
      evidence for modulation of immune function by hemofiltration.
