      restructuring the original design evaluation (rhPro - UK) at different times after
      thrombolysis combined with percutaneous coronary intervention（PCI）therapy of acute ST segment
      elevation myocardial infarction.Patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial
      infarction and thrombolysis indications, will be given the recombinant human prourokinase for
      thrombolysis treatment, and in accordance with the guidelines, will be treated with coronary
