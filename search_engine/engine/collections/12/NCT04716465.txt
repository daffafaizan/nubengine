      caused by a novel coronavirus which was first discovered in Wuhan, China in 2019 and later
      spread rapidly throughout the world. Symptoms of the disease can manifest as fever, cough,
      encephalitis, myalgia, fatigue, muscle weakness, arthralgia, anosmia, and impairment in other
      bodily functions in the acute phase. In 17% to 67% of cases, COVID-19 patients will develop
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and critical illness. Besides the impact on the
      respiratory system, coronaviruses have an effect on other systems including the central
      nervous system, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, and gastrointestinal system.

      Potential long-term secondary effects on the musculoskeletal system such as muscle weakness,
      decreased muscle mass, and myopathies have been brought under attention. Persisting symptoms
      in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection are frequently a complaint with at least 1
      symptom, particularly fatigue and dyspnea. In recent papers, the authors commented on the
      potential role of dysautonomia in the post-covid-19 entity related to microangiopathy and
      endothelial injury. Such lesions were already reported in brain biopsy samples of severe
      COVID-19.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is further to elucidate the presence of dysautonomia in
      post-covid-19 patients, by evaluating heart rate variability.
