      strides have been made in elucidating the roles of estrogen and progesterone on autonomic and
      vascular control in women; however, very little is known about the impact of testosterone in
      men. Given that low testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease, reduced exercise capacity and vascular dysfunction, it is evident
      that testosterone plays a pivotal role in autonomic and vascular function in men. Our current
      understanding of testosterone's effects on neurovascular control are confounded by numerous
      factors that independently alter autonomic and vascular function such as aging and chronic
      disease (e.g. cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease). The purpose of these studies are to
      evaluate the role of testosterone on autonomic and vascular function in young men to better
      isolate the effects of testosterone from the aforementioned confounding factors. The outcomes
      of these studies will provide novel information regarding the role of male sex hormones in
      autonomic and vascular control, and further our understanding of the influence of sex
      hormones on human physiology.
