      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the use of avelumab and
      bladder-directed radiation together for this specific disease but avelumab has been approved
      for other uses.

      While bladder-directed radiation is a standard treatment option for muscle-invasive
      urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, the use of avelumab in combination with bladder
      radiation in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is investigational. Radiation
      is used in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and avelumab has been approved by
      the FDA in patients with more advanced stages of this disease. Avelumab is a form of
      immunotherapy, which means it is designed to help the immune system fight cancer cells
      together with standard cancer treatments like radiation. Avelumab is currently approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of metastatic Merckel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and platinum-refractory
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether the combination of immunotherapy and bladder
      directed radiation is effective in treating muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The study will
      also measure other outcomes such as participant's overall health and quality of life during
      and after treatment. In addition, the investigators will determine if certain biomarkers are
      correlated with outcomes following treatment with immunotherapy and radiation.
