    
      A phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial which aims to
      assess whether regular aspirin use after standard therapy prevents recurrence and prolongs
      survival in participants with non-metastatic common solid tumours.

      The trial has four parallel tumour site-specific cohorts (breast, colorectal,
      gastro-oesophageal and prostate cancer). An overarching protocol ensures each cohort is as
      comparable as possible to allow a combined analysis of overall survival as a co-primary
      outcome measure in addition to individual tumour site-specific analyses of disease recurrence
      and survival.

      Participants who have undergone potentially curative treatment (surgery or other radical
      treatment), including any standard neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy for breast, colorectal,
      gastro-oesophageal or prostate cancer or have participated in any pre-approved trials and
      satisfy the eligibility criteria.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to 100mg aspirin, 300mg aspirin or matched placebo.
      All tablets will be enteric-coated to be taken daily for at least five years. Prior to
      randomisation, all potential participants will take open-label 100mg aspirin daily for a
      run-in period of approximately 8 weeks to assess tolerability and adherence.

      The trial incorporates a feasibility phase during which recruitment feasibility, treatment
      adherence, safety and use of the run-in period will be assessed.
