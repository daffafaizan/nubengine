    
      This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 4 doses of cenerimod versus placebo in adult
      subjects with moderately to severely active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE).

      Approximately 500 adult subjects with SLE will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo,
      0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg o.d. of cenerimod, in addition to background SLE therapy.
