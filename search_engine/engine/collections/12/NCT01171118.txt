      respiratory events. The relative prevalence of such events is thought to be high, occurring
      in up to 41% of patients in some cohorts. Many specific drugs and combinations have been
      recommended for moderate sedation, particularly when provided by a non-anesthesiologist. The
      use of an opioid and a benzodiazepine is the most frequent combination, partly because the
      availability of antagonists for both drugs may make a "rescue" easier. However, this
      combination results in frequent respiratory arrhythmias (combinations of obstructions, pauses
      and changes in respiratory patterns).There has not been a comprehensive study of the
      mechanisms underlying the disruptions of respiratory rhythm caused by agents commonly used
      for moderate sedation. This specific research, and the line of research it opens, has the
      potential to make the administration of anxiolytics and analgesics safer for patients at high
      risk for respiratory events.
