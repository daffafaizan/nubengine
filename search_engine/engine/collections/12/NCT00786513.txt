      and affects over 3,000 Canadians. Respiratory failure caused by chronic pulmonary infection
      is the primary cause of death in CF patients. The improved life expectancy of CF patients in
      the past several decades is due in part to the more aggressive use of antibiotics in the
      treatment of respiratory infections. However, there is currently no antimicrobial
      susceptibility assay that can predict which antibiotics will result in improved patient
      outcomes. Since Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to grow as a resistant biofilm in the CF
      lung, antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on biofilm growth of P. aeruginosa may lead
      to different antibiotic choices that significantly decrease the pulmonary bacterial density
      of P. aeruginosa. A biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility assay thus has the ability to change
      the way antibiotics are chosen to treat CF patients and result in improved lung function and
      longer lives for all CF patients.
