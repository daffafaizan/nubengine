    
      Dasatinib will be taken orally, daily in cycles of 28 days.

      On the first day of study treatment and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks subjects
      will have the following:

        -  Medical history and clinical exam

        -  Safety blood tests

        -  Measurement of Performance Status

        -  Review of pill log

        -  CT scans will be done every 8 weeks.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at how well dasatinib works in treating
      squamous cell lung cancer.

      Dasatinib administered at 140mg per day for the treatment of advanced SqCC of the lung is
      associated with excess adverse events, similar to other studies, so is not recommended in
      unselected patients. Further work to identify patients likely to benefit from dasatinib and
      in managing dasatinib-related toxicities is needed.
