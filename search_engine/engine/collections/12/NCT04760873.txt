      condition of chronic acute blood loss in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can lead to
      common utilization of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. This condition occurs in 0.3%
      of endoscopic studies and 4% of studies performed for chronic or acute blood loss anemia.1,2
      GAVE is commonly associated with autoimmune disease in 60% of cases and chronic liver disease
      in 30% of cases.2-4 Given the association with chronic liver disease, GAVE can be mistaken
      for other GI pathologies such as portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG).11,12 Therefore,
      identification of GAVE is important in the management of this condition.

      Historically there have been 1 series highlighting the use of a monopolar probe and heater
      probe to treat GAVE. As these therapies have a low depth of thermal penetration, these
      therapies are not commonly utilized for GAVE.13,14 The most commonly implemented endoscopic
      therapy is argon plasma coagulation (APC). Among the largest studies of APC, the efficacy for
      treatment of GAVE is variable5,6 Additional outcomes include a reduction in the number of
      PRBC transfused in patients with GAVE that were treated with APC.7 In addition to APC,
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has also been evaluated in the setting of GAVE, leading to a
      decrease in the transfusions needed during follow-up.15 Similarly, cryotherapy using a spray
      catheter has been evaluated for GAVE.8,9 In these studies, the patients did demonstrate
      endoscopic improvement, lower transfusion requirements, and normalization of their
      hemoglobin. Despite, these results, the spray cryotherapy device requires the use of a
      venting tube to prevent complications and carries with it technical limitations that can make
      ablation difficult. Our study group, which includes University Hospitals, Case Western
      Reserve, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Geisinger Medical Center, Columbia University
      Medical Center and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation of America This group has recently
      evaluated the first generation balloon cryotherapy device for GAVE, demonstrating efficacy
      and safety.10 Therefore, in this study we set out to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of a
      new balloon cryotherapy device for the treatment of GAVE. We predict that balloon cryotherapy
      will lead to greater than 80% clinical success (need for PRBC transfusion and absent overt
      bleeding).
