      the prognosis of relapsed/refractory pediatric cancer still remains poor. Advances in genomic
      technologies have improved the ability to detect diverse somatic and germline genomic
      aberrations of cancer patients, and it has been incorporated in the clinical management of
      cancer.

      Samsung Genomic Institute developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform,
      CancerSCAN™, which can detect clinically significant genomic aberrations of tumors. In this
      study, tumor samples of refractory/relapsed pediatric cancer patients will be tested with
      CancerSCAN™ and the patients will receive combination chemotherapy with matched
      single-targeted agent or multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to the
      result of CancerSCAN™.

      I. Relapsed/refractory solid tumor

        -  Perform CancerSCAN™ at enrollment

        -  Conventional chemotherapy (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) with matched
           single-targeted agent (axitinib, crizotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, imatinib,
           pazopanib, ruxolitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, vemurafenib, or trastuzumab) or
           multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (pazopanib or sorafenib) according to
           the result of CancerSCAN™

      II. Relapsed/refractory AML

        -  Perform CancerSCAN™ at enrollment

        -  Conventional chemotherapy (fludarabine, cytarabine) with matched single-targeted agent
           (axitinib, crizotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, imatinib, pazopanib,
           ruxolitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, vemurafenib, or trastuzumab) or multi-targeted
           receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (pazopanib or sorafenib) according to the result of
           CancerSCAN™
