      yoked extra-ocular muscles continue to be stimulated by movements of the seeing eye after fat
      injection into the anophthalmic orbit, the use of botulinum toxin(s) can be used to prevent
      movement of the orbital tissue bed(s) and improve anchoring of injected fat. Platelet rich
      plasma may also improve fat cell anchoring by the action of fibrin on the adhesion process.
      This innovation builds on the results of IRB protocols 10.27 and 12.01 as registered with
      Clinical Trials.gov
