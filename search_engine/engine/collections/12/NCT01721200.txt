      inadequate decision support when they face whether or not to start biologic therapy. No
      proven way exists to inform or support RA patients who are candidates for biologic therapy.
      Communicating information about biologic medication is particularly challenging because of
      the sheer number of risks to disclose, the difficulty explaining the risks of extremely rare
      adverse events (AEs), and the tendency for people to discount (or underweight) future
      benefits.

      Dr Liana Fraenkel at Yale University is the Primary Investigator and developer of this
      theory-based high quality decision support tool to effectively inform RA patients who are
      candidates for biologics. Dr. Eric Newman will be Principal Investigator for the project
      which will be conducted at Geisinger Medical Center. All subjects enrolled will complete a
      baseline survey and then will be randomized to use of the decision support tool or to usual
      care. Those randomized to usual care will be offered the opportunity to access the tool once
      enrollment is closed and all follow-up visits have been completed.

      Outcomes will be assessed at two and six weeks after the baseline visit by the Geisinger
      Telephone Survey and Interviewing Facility. This facility is equipped with 12 computers and
      runs two shifts a day. The Survey Unit uses a state-of-the-art Windows based Computer
      Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system to administer surveys and collect research data.
      The group holds 12 interviewer licenses for the CATI system. Trained and experienced
      interviewers are available to make the calls from 9 am to 9 pm Monday through Friday and from
      10 am to 2 pm on Saturdays.
