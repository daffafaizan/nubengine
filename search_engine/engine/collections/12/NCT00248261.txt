      re-uptake inhibitors, take several weeks before they show considerable effects on PTSD
      symptoms. Addition of typical neuroleptics, such as ziprasidone, offers a potential strategy
      to bring about a faster symptomatic relief, because they display anxiolytic properties
      without the risk of dependence. Therefore, in addition to standard sertraline therapy (at
      least 8 weeks), we will give ziprasidone vs. placebo over the first four weeks in a
      double-blind randomized design.
