    
      Specific Aim:

      Assess the effects of a VTE risk calculator embedded in the admission order set vs. usual
      care on physician behavior and patient outcomes in a randomized trial

      Research Strategy:

      Utilizing a Step-Wedge design, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at 10
      Cleveland Clinic hospitals in efforts to assess the effects of a VTE (venous thromboembolism)
      risk calculator embedded in the admission order set vs. usual care on physician behavior and
      patient outcomes. Hospitals will be randomized to display the risk calculator to physicians
      admitting patients or to the usual order set that contains only a description of VTE risk
      factors. The risk calculator will produce a predicted risk of VTE together with a
      recommendation regarding the use of prophylaxis for an individual patient. Physicians will be
      free to ignore the calculator or override its results if they so choose.
