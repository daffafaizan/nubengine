      progression-free survival time, and recurrence-free survival time in patients with pTanyN0M0
      upper urinary urothelial carcinoma with lymphatic vascular invasion (LVI) through a
      prospective case-control study. Therapeutic value of adjuvant chemotherapy for LVI(+)
      patients with pT1N0M0, pT2N0M0, and pT3-4N0M0 upper urinary urothelial carcinoma,
      respectively.
