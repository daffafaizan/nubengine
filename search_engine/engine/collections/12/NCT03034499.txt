    
      One hundred female patients diagnosed with vaginal apex prolapse will be recruited to a
      prospective randomized controlled study intended to compare the efficacy of 2 methods of
      robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy:

        1. Via single-port.

        2. Via multi-port. The patients will be evaluated and randomized 2 weeks before the
           expected date of surgery during which eligibility will be examined.

      Patients' electronic files will be reviewed post operatively to acquire information regarding
      medical history, prolapse scores, surgical information, anesthesia information and surgical
      complications.

      Patients will have 3 week and 3 month post operative follow-up sessions to determine surgical
      success, late complications and patient satisfaction.
