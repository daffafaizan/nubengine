      infusions of activated, gene marked, syngeneic T lymphocytes obtained from HIV seronegative
      identical twins on the functional immune status of HIV infected twin recipients. T cells from
      each seronegative twin will be obtained by periodic apheresis, induced to polyclonal
      proliferation with anti-CD3 and rIL-2 stimulation, transduced with distinctive neoR
      retroviral vectors, and expanded 10-1,000 fold in numbers during approximately 2 weeks of
      culture. These marked T cells will then be infused into the seropositive twins and the
      survival of the uniquely marked T cell populations will be monitored by vector-specific PCR,
      while the recipients' functional immune status is monitored by standard in vitro and in vivo
      testing protocols. A total of 3 cycles of treatment may be given at intervals of 6 weeks
      between infusions.
