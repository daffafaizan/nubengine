      aforementioned exclusion and inclusion criteria. Clinical examination was done by a different
      clinician than the operator, and according to the treatment indication, patients were
      allocated to the delayed implant placement group (Control), or the immediate implant
      placement group (Test). Thus, 15 implants were placed in healed extraction sites and
      immediately temporized (Control group), and 15 implants were placed in immediate extraction
      sites with immediate temporization (Test group).

      Provisional acrylic crowns were prepared. All patients were placed on a prophylactic
      antibiotic regimen, starting one day prior to surgery as they were asked to take amoxicillin
      500 mg; three times a day for 10 days or clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 10 days for
      penicillin-allergic patients.

      For the test group, tooth extractions were carried out atraumatically using periotomes. In
      both groups, the implant site preparation was completed in compliance with the general
      surgical principles and protocols defined by the manufacturer and screw-shaped implants
      (UFII, DIOâ„¢) were inserted at no less than 35 Ncm.

      Temporary abutments were connected to the implants and torqued at 20 Ncm, and then temporary
      crowns were cemented on top of the abutments after checking and reducing occlusion to
      non-existent in both centric and lateral excursions.
