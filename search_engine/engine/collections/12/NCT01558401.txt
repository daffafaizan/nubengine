      changes due to ageing, not all programs show the same effectiveness, even though they are
      generally regarded as being effective. The existence of a wide variety of programs calls for
      debate about their outcomes.

      Specific research tools and designs can assist in identifying not only program effectiveness
      but also program efficiency and use in terms of a better physical performance of subjects on
      carrying out exercises with less effort, influenced by multiple factors, one of them being
      adherence to the program. These analyses allow the influence of efficiency and the factors
      that determine it or are associated with it to be tested, and can provide classifications and
      subgroups to which interventions should be adapted if they are to offer the best service to
      them in the short and medium term.
