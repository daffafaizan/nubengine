      (VVA) is a condition that impacts up to 60% of the growing postmenopausal female population,
      and the most common symptom is dyspareunia. Women with FSD are 3.84 times as likely to also
      have VVA. Vaginal estrogen is the most common treatment for VVA, but it only marginally
      improves overall sexual function, and many women and clinicians avoid using it because of the
      risks of exogenous estrogen use during menopause. Ospemifene is a non-estrogen selective
      estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is FDA-approved for treating dyspareunia related to
      VVA, and has shown superb improvements in overall sexual health. This oral medication, taken
      daily, improves vaginal health, and has demonstrated protective activity in the breast and
      bone tissues. It also has not demonstrated any carcinogenic activity in the endometrium or
      liver. This study hopes to determine if ospemifene is superior to conjugated estrogens in
      improving sexual function and vaginal atrophy symptoms.

      104 women will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of 60mg oral ospemifene, taken daily, or 12
      weeks of 0.5mg vaginal conjugated estrogens, which is placed vaginally twice per week. Each
      participant will be informed of her assigned medication, and will receive a medication coupon
      to help offset the cost of the medication. Each medication is FDA-approved for long-term use
      of at least 52 weeks. For this study, a 12-week prescription for the medication will be sent
      electronically to the pharmacy of the participant's choice. The improvements in sexual health
      and VVA symptom severity will be compared in each group.
