      children and adolescents. The disorder is associated with high rates of suicide tentative and
      high-risk behaviors like sexual promiscuity and drug abuse. Bipolar disorder in children is
      also associated with high rates of comorbidity, especially with Attention-Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There is a scarcity of clinical trials assessing the effects
      of medications in children with BD. Moreover, the frequent presence of comorbid ADHD might
      determine lower response to treatment. Aripiprazole is a novel anti-psychotic drug. Its
      mechanism of action seems to be related to a stabilization of dopaminergic transmission,
      acting as a partial agonist especially in dopaminergic D2 receptors. It also has effects in
      5-HT1a serotonergic receptors. Thus, it might have a promising effect in children and
      adolescents with comorbid BD and ADHD. A retrospective chart review, recently published,
      suggests the efficacy of this drug in children with BD. This study aims to assess the
      efficacy of Aripiprazole (a novel anti-psychotic drug) for the treatment of 50 children and
      adolescents (age range: 08 to 17 years-old) with Bipolar Disorder comorbid with ADHD. The
      study design is an 6-week randomized, double blind, parallel group trial. Patients were
      randomized to either aripiprazole or placebo. The hypotheses are: 1) Aripiprazole will
      significantly reduce maniac scores compared to placebo; 2)Aripiprazole will significantly
      reduce ADHD scores compared to placebo; 3) Aripiprazole will not be significantly associated
      to weight gain compared to placebo.
