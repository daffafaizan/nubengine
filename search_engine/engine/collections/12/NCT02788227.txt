    
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been multiple Ebolavirus outbreaks affecting mostly
      central Africa. However, the 2014/2015 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all
      previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of individuals affected, and in disruption of
      typical activities of civil society.

      This protocol is a multi-center study to evaluate the durability of the immune response
      following the open label administration of the rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (V920) as
      pre-exposure prophylaxis for adults who have an occupational risk for potential exposure to
      Ebola virus. The vaccine uses a live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replacing
      the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the envelope
      glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola (rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP also known as V920).

      All subjects will receive a single dose of rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP (2 x 10^7 pfu) on Day 0. We
      will collect adverse events after vaccination and at Month 1 and Month 19, serious adverse
      events (SAE) for the duration of the study, and assess the immune response at Months 1, 3, 6,
      12, 18, 19, 24, 30, and 36.

      A single booster immunization with the same dose of study vaccine as the primary dose (2 x
      10^7 pfu/mL) will be given to those randomized at month 18 to the booster arm of the trial.
      However, if at any time during the observation period antibody levels fall below a predefined
      seroprotective threshold (yet to be defined in parallel or newly planned studies), a booster
      will be offered to those who have not previously received a booster injection.
