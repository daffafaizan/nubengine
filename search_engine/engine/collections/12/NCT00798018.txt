      lidocaine and 1% tetracaine groups of 25 each using sealed envelope technique. The cuff of
      the endotracheal tube was inflated by the inflation medium (with the help of intracuff
      pressure monitoring device) to occlude the leak around the tube by the Minimal Occlusive
      Volume Technique. This was done by the same anaesthesiologist in all the patients. The cuff
      volume and pressure were then recorded. The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the
      post-intubation sore throat using the visual analogue scale 6h, 24h and 48h after extubation.
      The secondary outcomes were incidence of complications during emergence of anesthesia and
      after extubation. Intra-cuff pressure monitoring was done with a pressure monitor, which
      consisted of the pressure gauge, three-way stopcock whose one end was attached to the
      pressure monitoring line. Net volume of the inflation medium was noted. Volume of the
      inflation medium, intra cuff pressure, duration from intubation to extubation and volume of
      the inflation medium withdrawn from the cuff was noted. Incidence (Yes/No) of tube
      intolerance, coughing on tube, restlessness, hoarseness, sore throat, breathlessness and
      laryngospasm were analyzed by the anaesthesiologist who did not know which group the patient
      belonged to.
