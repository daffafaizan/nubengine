      the capillary level in peripheral nerve. his therapy has been shown to improve clinical
      function in patients with diabetic-associated polyneuropathy, a model for various forms of
      ischemic neuropathy. CTS is a common condition where regional compression at the wrist
      results in ischemic focal demyelination of the distal median nerve. This results in sensory
      dysfunction, pain, and eventually axon loss and weakness if the compression is sufficiently
      severe and prolonged. Standard therapy for CTS includes wrist splints, regional lidocaine
      injections, ergonomic adjustments, various forms of occupation therapy, and ultimately
      surgical release of the carpal tunnel ligament. However, all of these are either temporary in
      their effect or invasive. The diagnosis of CTS relies on clinical, electrodiagnostic or NCS,
      and ultrasound methods.
