    
      1. Investigate the timing and dose of FTC-TDF and FTC-TAF as oral PrEP and in vitro PEP
           (applied directly to removed foreskin tissue) required to prevent ex vivo HIV infection
           in foreskin tissue and blood using the explant model

        2. Determine blood, rectal fluid and foreskin tissue concentrations of FTC, TFV, TAF and
           their active metabolites that are required for ex vivo HIV protection

        3. Evaluate inflammation, cellular activation, foreskin mucosal integrity, gene expression
           and microbiome in foreskin tissue following oral in vivo PrEP and in vitro PEP

        4. Evaluate the efficacy of in vitro post exposure dosing with PrEP in protection against
           ex vivo HIV infection using the explant model

        5. To investigate sexual behaviour, PrEP acceptability and feedback on HIV prevention
           trials implementation
