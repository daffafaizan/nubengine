      caries. It is generally agreed that anti-caries effect of fluoride (F) is mainly by
      decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the rate of enamel
      remineralization. An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness (SMH) test is widely used to evaluate
      enamel demineralization and remineralization during the caries process. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the efficacy of toothpaste formulations containing fluoride from different
      sources [sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium monofluorophosphate (NaMFP)] using an in situ
      caries model.
