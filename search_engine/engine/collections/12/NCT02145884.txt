      place 1 to 2 drops twice a day in the center of the hemangioma. Subjects are expected to use
      the study drug as directed every day for a 4 month period.

      Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter for a
      total of 5 months. Physical exam, photographs to compare size and color intensity, and a
      scale of improvement will be completed at each visit. Parents will complete a quality of life
      questionnaire regarding their child's hemangioma and its impact on quality of life.

      Subjects who have evidence of worsening would be removed from the study and transferred to
      the clinic for evaluation and treatment.
