      cancers. These include extrapulmonary small cell, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors that
      arise from pulmonary lesions, and large cell neuroendocrine (NE) tumors.

      First, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) for Rhenium
      Re188-P2045 alone will be determined when it is administered as a single dose, at 80, 90,
      130, 170, 210 or (up to) 250 mCi/m2.

      Subsequently, in the second study Rhenium Re 188-P2045 will be administered at 40, 50, 75, 85
      and up to 100 per cent of the MTD determined in the first study, as a single agent or
      following 3 daily topotecan treatments (at 1.0 or 1.5 mg/m2) in patients with advanced
      neuroendocrine tumors and SSTR2 expression as determined by Technicium (Tc) Tc99m P2045
      scanning.

      The overall response and survival rates of patient treated with Rhenium Re188 P2045 when
      administered as a single dose or following topotecan will be measured.

      The change (if any) in SSTR2 expression, as determined by Tc99m P2045 scanning after
      topotecan administration will also be determined . The correlation of pre-therapy SSTR2
      expression (as determined by Tc99m P2045 scan) with overall response and survival rates will
      be calculated.
