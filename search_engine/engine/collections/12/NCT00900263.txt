    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Establish a serum, cell, and bone marrow tissue bank of prospectively collected samples
           from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),
           asymptomatic multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, or other plasma cell dyscrasias.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of accruing patients with these diseases.

        -  Determine whether patterns of gene expression or cytogenetics exist that allow molecular
           delineation of MGUS subtypes.

        -  Characterize cellular and humoral immune response to known tumor antigens in these
           patients.

        -  Cryopreserve serum/T cells for future evaluation.

        -  Preliminarily identify biological correlates that may relate to progression to
           symptomatic disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (monoclonal gammopathy of
      undetermined significance [MGUS] or other plasma cell dyscrasias vs asymptomatic multiple
      myeloma vs solitary plasmacytoma).

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected and analyzed for microarray analysis, cytogenetic
      analysis, and immunobiology studies.

      Unused samples may be stored for future research studies.

      Patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
