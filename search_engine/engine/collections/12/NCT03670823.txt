      characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, decreased quality of life, deficits in cognitive
      functions and even suicide thoughts. Treatment of depression is often a long process and
      includes taking different types and quantities of medications. Therefore, there is a need to
      predict the success of the SSRI treatment. Our research will examine the outcomes of the
      combined technologies: BNA (EEG), Eye-tracker, structural and functional MRI scans and
      neuropsychology tasks in patients with depression while receiving SSRI treatment. The purpose
      of the research is to track biomarkers and other measures, which will allow predicting the
      SSRI treatment's success within 4 weeks instead of 8 weeks. In addition, the investigators
      will attempt to categorize patients into different subgroups according to their brain
      activation and eye movements. This division into subgroups may contribute to the
      understanding of the mechanisms that account for the responsiveness to SSRI treatment and to
      the possibility of targeting patients with depression towards a particular treatment. From
      this research, the investigators aim to personalize the treatment of depression, make it more
      efficient and reduce the amount of time for the patient to reach an optimal responsiveness.
