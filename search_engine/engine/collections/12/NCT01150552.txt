    
      This 4-year prospective cohort study to compare individuals with occupational exposure to
      poultry with non-poultry exposed adult controls for evidence of incident and previous
      infections with AI viruses. At the start of this study, study staff will obtain informed
      consent, and a blood sample will be obtained from study volunteers to establish baseline
      levels of antibodies against avian influenza types H4-H12. Subjects will be interviewed
      regarding their exposures, medical history, and behaviors using a close-ended questionnaire
      specifically tailored for this study. After one year, study subjects will be interviewed
      again to note any changes in exposure variables. At this time, another blood sample will be
      obtained and tested for any changes in antibodies' levels. The same procedures will be
      repeated at the final visit after another year. Exposed individuals will be selected from
      rural areas where poultry is commonly raised. Non-exposed controls will be selected from
      urban neighborhoods in Cairo.
