      Catheter ablation therapy has become part of international recommendations for the management
      of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Advanced catheter localization systems now enable
      3-dimensional mapping of cardiac electrical activity. The integration of 3-dimensional
      imaging data acquired prior to the procedure and its merging with the mapping geometry was
      shown feasible. Available non-invasive imaging modalities can provide critical complementary
      information to assist cardiac mapping and ablation. Multidetector computed tomography can
      provide valuable information on patient's anatomy (cardiac chambers, pulmonary veins,
      coronary arteries and veins, phrenic nerve or oesophagus location, epicardial fat thickness).
      Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography can provide valuable information
      on myocardial substrate (scar location), because most arrhythmias occur on structurally
      diseased hearts. In addition, a body surface mapping technology was recently developed,
      enabling non-invasive real-time whole-heart 3-dimensional electrophysiological mapping. The
      system computes unipolar epicardial electrograms from an array of body surface potentials
      acquired with a multi-electrode vest. Because of its real-time and whole-heart nature, body
      surface mapping gives access to the assessment of previously non-mappable arrhythmias such as
      cardiac fibrillation and non-sustained or poorly tolerated arrhythmias. This technology might
      be of value to preemptively identify ablation targets form epicardial activation (earliest
      epicardial exit of the circuit in cardiac reentrant tachycardias, location of rotor cores in
      cardiac fibrillation).
