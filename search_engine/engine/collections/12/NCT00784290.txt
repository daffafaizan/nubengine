      treatment of HCC. Orantinib is an orally administered, small-molecule, multiple receptor
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2
      (VEGFR-2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor
      receptor (FGFR). Phase I studies that have been conducted in Japan for patients with solid
      tumors recommended a dosage of 400 mg bid. As a potent antiangiogenic agent, Orantinib is
      also expected to be effective against HCC. However, because most HCC patients have
      accompanying liver cirrhosis or hepatitis, its safety must be reevaluated in the presence of
      liver function impairment.
