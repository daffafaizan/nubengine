      using the PACCI as having uncontrolled asthma results in less asthma morbidity compared to
      routine asthma care. We hypothesize that children receiving ICS prescriptions will have fewer
      unscheduled health care use for asthma exacerbations (doctor's office visits, ED visits, or
      hospitalizations), and greater quality of life.

      Specific aim 2 - Thematic analysis of interviews with parents who are adherent versus
      non-adherent with ICS prescription filling and use to determine the factors associated with
      adherence. We hypothesize that factors will include: 1) Parent beliefs about the chronic
      versus episodic nature of asthma, 2) Parent's knowledge of benefits and risks of ICS, and 3)
      Provision and use of an asthma action plan.
