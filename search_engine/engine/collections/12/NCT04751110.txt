    
      Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is the most common cause of musculoskeletal pain and its
      prevalence in the population is reported to be 21-30%. Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is an
      interfacial plane block described in 2016. It creates analgesia at T2-T9 levels in the
      hemithorax by applying local anesthetic to the fascia between the rhomboid muscle and the
      intercostal muscle. It has been used effectively in patients with chronic pain. The
      investigators planned a prospective observational study.From february to march 10 2021, a
      total of 30 patients who will apply to our clinic with MPS, will register in research. The
      investigators will perform ultrasound-guided RIB, and evaluate the clinical outcome
      Ultrasound guided RIB will applied with linear probe, in plane technique. Block needle was
      inserted to plane between the rhomboid muscle and intercostal muscles over the T5-6 ribs 2 cm
      to 3 cm medially from the medial border of the scapula. 13ml of bupivacaine 0.25% and 8mg
      dexamethasone mixture will inject into the fascial plane. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) will
      recorded before and after the block at 30 minutes, 1 day, 1-2-4-6 weeks.
