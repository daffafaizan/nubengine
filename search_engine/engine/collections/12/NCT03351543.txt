      volunteers will either receive material containing a microbial inoculum, or they will receive
      nothing. Changes in cytokine and IgE and vaccine response will be measured. Subjective
      well-being will be recorded. Changes in microbial community will be followed. The hypothesis
      is that microbial exposure increases the measured responses.
