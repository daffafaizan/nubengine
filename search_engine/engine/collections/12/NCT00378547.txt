      versus paracetamol combined with pregabalin and dexamethasone on pain and morphine
      requirements in the first 24 hours postoperatively. Outcomes include amount of morphine and
      ketobemidone used, and pain measured on a VAS scale. Side-effects, e.g., PONV, dizziness and
      sedation are also measured.
