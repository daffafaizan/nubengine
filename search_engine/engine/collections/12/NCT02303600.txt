      cough patients that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were recruited after signing the
      consent form. Patients were randomized into biomarker treatment arm and standard treatment
      arm. Positive or negative biomarker expression was confirmed by assessing fractional
      concentration of exhaled NO (FENO) level, FENO<25ppb was regarded as negative and FENOâ‰¥25ppb
      was regarded as positive.

      Patients in biomarker guided positive treatment arm were given Montelukast Sodium Tablets
      (p.o., 10mg, q.d.) . Patients in biomarker guided negative treatment arm were given placebo
      tablets(p.o., 10mg, q.d.). Patients in standard treatment arm were given Montelukast Sodium
      Tablets (p.o., 10mg, q.d.).All treatment regimens lasted for 10 days and no other
      antitussive/decongestant or bronchodilators are given to any patients.

      Examine results of all patients from all arms were recorded before and after the 10 day
      treatment. The examine recorded are FENO levels, cough symptom assessment, cough visual
      assessment, Leicester cough questionnaire, total white blood cell count, neutrophil blood
      percentage, eosinophil blood percentage. Patient cough free days after treatment and
      Montelukast Sodium Tablets . Follow up was carried out at the 8th week after first record of
      symptom and 2 month after treatment.
