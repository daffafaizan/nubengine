        -  Compare bone loss in patients receiving long-term androgen deprivation therapy for stage
           III or IV prostate cancer when treated with supportive care with vs without zoledronate.

        -  Compare the percentage change in lumbar spine and hip bone density in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare markers of bone formation and resorption in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of skeletal events (pathologic and non-pathologic bone fractures,
           spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, and radiotherapy to bone) in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of new or progressive bone metastatic disease in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the survival rate of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to race (black vs other). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and oral calcium
           gluconate and oral cholecalciferol daily. Courses repeat every 3 months for 12 months in
           the absence of toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral calcium gluconate and oral cholecalciferol as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (36 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
