      defined after a minimal follow-up of 2 months after the last injection. To prepare DLI-TK,
      donor T-cells are transduced with a retroviral vector encoding TK. Transduced cells are
      selected using a CliniMACS device (MYLTENYI). In case of previous std-DLI received, the
      DLI-TK cell dose is adjusted to be below or equal to the maximal cell dose previously
      received in std-DLI. No comparison is planned in the analysis.
