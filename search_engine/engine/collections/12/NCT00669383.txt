    
      The primary purpose of this randomized, blinded placebo controlled trial is to quantify and
      compare measurements of pulmonary function (including respiratory compliance and lung
      volumes/functional residual capacity) of hospitalized preterm infants whose mothers received
      an initial course of antenatal corticosteroids, remained undelivered after 14 days and at <
      34 weeks of gestation, and were then randomized to either a rescue course of antenatal
      corticosteroids or to a rescue course of placebo. In addition, follow-up pulmonary function
      tests, clinical outcomes, growth parameters, and the neurodevelopmental outcome of these
      infants will be followed.
