        -  Mantle cell lymphoma presents a particular clinical challenge because it is aggressive
           and incurable with chemotherapy. Thus, novel treatment approaches are needed.

        -  In follicular center cell lymphomas, another incurable disease, recent evidence suggests
           that molecular complete remissions may be achieved following idiotype vaccination in
           patients who have achieved minimal residual disease with combination chemotherapy.

        -  These results suggest that idiotype vaccines may be able to induce a clinically
           significant immune response against lymphoma.

      Objectives:

        -  To assess if EPOCH-R/idiotype vaccination is associated with a median progression-free
           survival consistent with 36 months;

        -  To assess if rituximab affects generation of T-cell immunity against the idiotype.

        -  To compare T-cell immunity using two different methods of isolating the idiotype
           protein.

      Eligibility:

        -  Tissue diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  Previously untreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. All stages of disease.

        -  Lymph node of greater than or equal to 2 cm accessible for biopsy/harvest or greater
           than 1000/microl of circulating tumor cells in the blood.

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 3.

      Design:

        -  In the present study, we propose to investigate the efficacy of idiotype vaccine
           treatment in previously untreated patients with mantle cell lymphomas. In order to
           achieve minimal residual disease, patients will receive 6 cycles EPOCH chemotherapy and
           rituximab (EPOCH-R) followed by 5 idiotype vaccine injections.

        -  This study has completed accrual of 26 patients and is only open for follow-up.
