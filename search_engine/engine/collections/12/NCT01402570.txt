      medical visit, blood draw and physical exam. There are four timepoints during the three
      months when subjects will fill out surveys and record food intake and sleep times in diaries
      for seven days. They will also wear a small device for seven days, a Sensewear monitor that
      records physical activity, body temperature and other measures.

      After the fourth timepoint they will return to the medical center for another physical exam
      and blood draw. Physicians trained in physical medicine and rehabilitation will be monitoring
      the study.
