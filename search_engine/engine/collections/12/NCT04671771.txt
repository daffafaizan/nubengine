    
      The InnAVasc AVG is intended for use in ESRD hemodialysis patients who require HD and whose
      next most appropriate access is an AVG, also including those who may require an immediate
      cannulation AVG.

      Patients with ESRD who require hemodialysis and are suitable for an AVG for hemodialysis
      access will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Subjects will be implanted with an
      InnAVasc AVG in the forearm or upper arm using standard vascular surgical techniques. The
      graft will be placed in a "straight" (soft "C") configuration in the upper arm, or looped
      configuration in the forearm (forearm loop) or upper arm (axillary loop). Placing the graft
      across the elbow will be prohibited. Subjects must be able to be on antiplatelet therapy per
      the discretion of their physician (i.e., aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.).
