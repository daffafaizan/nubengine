    
      A sub-study of the CROWN CORONATION Trial (COVID-19 Research Outcomes Worldwide Network for
      CORONAvirus prevenTION; NCT04333732). The goal of this sub-study is to identify and
      characterize biomarkers of trained immunity by measuring, in vitro, immune responses to
      heterologous products, especially virally associated products, in those exposed to MMR
      vaccine injection compared to those exposed to 0.9% sodium chloride ('normal saline') placebo
      injection.

      A secondary objective is comparison of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays between MMR and
      placebo comparison groups around 60 to 90 days after the last SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine
      injection.

      All participants are randomly assigned to MMR or placebo injection at baseline, followed by
      SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccination. Blood is drawn around 60 to 90 days after the last
      SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine injection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) will be
      isolated from samples and stimulated with heterologous products (for example; Roswell Park
      Memorial Institute medium [RPMI; negative control], MMR [the vaccine itself as specific
      stimulus], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2; heat inactivated],
      influenza virus [heat inactivated], toll-like receptor 3 ligand [TLR3 ligand; poly I:C],
      toll-like receptor 7/8 ligand [TLR7/8 ligand; R848], toll-like receptor 4 ligand [TLR4
      ligand; lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]). Supernatants will be assayed by multiplex luminex protein
      assay at 24 hr (for example; type I interferons [IFN], interleukin [IL]-1β , IL-6, tumor
      necrosis factor [TNF]-α) and after 5 days (for example; IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, IL-10). This
      process of testing stimulus-response will be conducted on both the baseline and day 30
      samples, collected from both the MMR and Placebo groups.

      Neutralization assay will be conducted on all samples using wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

      Measles IgG titres will be measured on all samples. Measles IgG titres will be used for
      sensitivity analysis.
