      adults have more sedentary time than any other group -- an average of 10-11 hours per day.
      Reducing the sedentary behavior of older adults with obesity, rather than only promoting more
      intensive physical activity, could provide a more feasible approach to health promotion.

      This randomized control pilot trial will evaluate a 12-week intervention to decrease sitting
      time and increase standing time and light physical activity among sedentary older adults a
      body mass index > 30 kg/m2 as compared to control group. Baseline and 12-week measurements
      include anthropometric measures, blood draw by finger stick, cardiovascular health
      assessments, physical function tasks, and a survey. The intervention will consist of two
      in-person visits with a health coach followed by phone-based coaching.
