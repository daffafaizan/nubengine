    
      Primary Clinical Hypothesis: Poorly controlled subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma
      (measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) ≥ 1) despite treatment with Dulera, who are
      treated with the asthma adherence disease management protocol, Asthma Adherence Pathway™,
      will achieve greater asthma control than similar control subjects who are treated with the
      current standard of care.

      Primary end point: There will be four measures of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) over
      time over 3 months. The primary endpoint is the third month measure of ACQ.

      Secondary Clinical Hypothesis: The asthma adherence disease management program, Asthma
      Adherence Pathway™, will increase observed adherence to Dulera relative to a benchmark of 60%
      adherence (i.e., expected prescribed actuations).

      Secondary end points: a) Average adherence to Dulera over the three month study period

      Tertiary Clinical Hypothesis: Responses to Adult Asthma Adherence Questionnaire (AAAQ) will
      be related to Dulera Adherence

      Tertiary Study Endpoints: There will be 2 measures of the AAAQ (first and last visit) and the
      tertiary endpoint is the last visit
