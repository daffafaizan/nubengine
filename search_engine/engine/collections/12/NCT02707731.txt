      environment of the neonatal intensive care unit newborns are subject to environmental stress
      and numerous painful interventions. Based on the physiological properties of water, it is
      known that the hydrotherapy promotes comfort, reduces stress, and as a resource for treatment
      of various diseases. This study aims to evaluate the acute effects of neonatal
      hydrokinesiotherapy in reducing stress in newborn preterm infants in the neonatal intensive
      care unit.
