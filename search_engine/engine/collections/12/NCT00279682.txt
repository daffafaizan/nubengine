      seen a primary care physician in preceding months. Depression is the strongest risk factor
      for late-life suicide and for suicide's precursor, suicidal ideation.

      The aim of the study was to determine the extent to which an intervention taht combined
      treatment guidelines with care management reduced rates of depression and suicide ideation in
      older primary care patients. The study randomized 20 primary care practices from New York
      City, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh regions into intervention or usual car. The used a
      two-stage sampling design that resulted in a representative sample with an oversample of
      depressed patients (total n=1238 subjects including 598 with a depression diagnosis and 640
      with no depression diagnosis). Patients were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24
      months.
