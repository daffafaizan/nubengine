      hypothermia in elderly patients undergoing TURP under general anesthesia. In addition, we
      aimed to evaluate the effects of prewarming on hemodynamic variables, PACU output time,
      tremor, patient comfort and satisfaction. The investigators plan to enroll 36 patients in 2
      groups. Body temperature will be measured at the core temperature, hemodynamic variables.
      Shivering will be graded by visual inspection. Thermal discomfort scale, patient satisfaction
      will be evaluated. The investigators hypothesize will decrease the forced air prewarming
      incidence of perioperative hypothermia.
