      ketamine was administered thrice-weekly for up to 2 weeks.Those who achieved depressive
      symptom remission (Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MÅDRS)) total score less than
      or equal to 9 measured 24h after any acute-phase infusion) received continuation-phase
      treatment that consisted of once-weekly i.v. ketamine infusions for 4 additional weeks.
      Remission could occur after any of the 6 acute-phase infusions, at which point the next
      infusion was the first (of four) continuation-phase infusions. Individuals who remitted
      during acute-phase and completed continuation-phase treatment had 4 additional weekly
      post-continuation follow-up visits.Those who responded to i.v. ketamine (less than or equal
      to 50% reduction from baseline in MÅDRS total score) but did not remit during acute-phase
      were not eligible for continuation-phase treatment. Suicidal ideation was assessed clinically
      throughout the trial, supplemented by scores on the MÅDRS suicide item.
