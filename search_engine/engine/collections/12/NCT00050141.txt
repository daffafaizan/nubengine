      (2/3rds of all the patients) will be taking tipifarnib in combination with another anticancer
      drug called letrozole, and the other group (1/3rd of all the patients) will be taking
      letrozole plus a placebo (an inactive substance given in the same form as a real drug). The
      assignment to one of these two groups will be by chance (like flipping a coin). Unless the
      need arises, neither the patient nor the study staff will know whether the patient is
      receiving tipifarnib with the letrozole. Comparisons between the two groups will be made for
      patients who have achieve a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). The
      interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression will
      also be assessed. The study will include evaluations of safety and tolerability. Patients
      should expect their participation in this trial to last a minimum of 4 to 8 weeks. Their
      participation could continue for several months or beyond a year, depending on how their
      disease responds to the treatment. After completing study treatment, patients will be asked
      to attend for an End of Treatment visit and then a posttreatment Follow-up visit 4 to 6 weeks
      after stopping the medication. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with either
      2.5 mg letrozole once daily plus placebo to match tipifarnib twice daily, or 2.5 mg letrozole
      once daily plus 300 mg tipifarnib twice daily. Both tipifranib and matching placebo will be
      given in 28-day cycles of 21 days of treatment followed by 7 days rest. All patients will
      receive continuous treatment with letrozole.
