    
      This was a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase IIb, two-arm study to evaluate the
      effects of telmisartan on fibrotic and inflammatory contributors to end-organ disease in
      HIV-infected subjects well controlled on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Participants were
      randomized 2:1 to the telmisartan and control arms. The participants on telmisartan took 40
      mg telmisartan daily during weeks 0-4 followed by telmisartan 80 mg daily during weeks 5-48.
      The participants in the control arm did not take any study medication, but did undergo all
      evaluations. All participants were followed for 48 weeks after randomization.

      The study clinic visits included Step 1 entry, Step 2 entry, and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48.
      Biopsies for the primary outcomes were collected at Step 1 entry and Week 48. The evaluations
      of safety (clinical assessment for signs and symptoms, diagnoses, laboratory tests) were done
      at Step 2 entry and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48.

      The co-primary objectives assessed the effects of telmisartan for 48weeks on lymph node and
      adipose tissue collagen I deposition.

      Currently, the results are entered for the primary outcome measures only. The results on the
      secondary outcomes will be posted when they become available.
