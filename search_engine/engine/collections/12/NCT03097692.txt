      cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Most of the prognostic studies failed to account for the
      effects of co-morbid conditions as these might have raised the systemic inflammation. We used
      neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a measure of systemic inflammation and investigated its
      association with cardiac preconditioning in open heart surgery .
