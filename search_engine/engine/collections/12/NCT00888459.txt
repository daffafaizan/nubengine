      risk for oropharyngeal cancer. Most smokeless tobacco users wish to quit. Assisted-self help
      interventions (i.e., self-help manual, a targeted video, and two support telephone phone
      calls) have been shown to be superior to manual-only interventions for increasing tobacco
      abstinence rates. These interventions lend themselves to widespread dissemination, but
      abstinence rates at 6 months remains low (21%). Providing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
      to ST users receiving assisted self-help interventions could improve upon these ST abstinence
      rates. If found to be effective, this intervention may increase the ability to disseminate
      effective interventions to a population of tobacco users for whom few treatment resources
      currently exist.
