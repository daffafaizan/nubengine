      worth exploring as no data exists that suggests any influence on the quality of the embryos
      from using this substance for IVF since its earliest days. Measuring time lapsed from
      injection to first oocyte retrieval as well as time lapsed in between first and last oocyte
      retrieved will grand insight into the rise of levels of Midazolam inside the follicular
      fluid, correlated with the chromosomal status and the morphokinetic development of the
      euploid embryos.
