      subjects with in-stent restenosis and randomly assign them to the trial and control groups on
      a 1:1 basis.The experimental group was treated with paclitaxel drug-coated coronary artery
      balloon catheter, and the control group was treated with SeQuent Â® Please paclitaxel balloon
      catheter, which has been marketed. In-segment late lumen loss 9 months after surgery was the
      main end point of the study. All subjects were followed up clinically at 1 month, 6 months, 9
      months, 1 year and 2 years after the surgery, and were followed up with angiography at 9
      months after the surgery.
