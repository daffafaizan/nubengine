      can cause some pain/anxiety [Shih S and Rosen P, 2018]. The pain/discomfort related to NGT
      insertion comes from anxiety, gagging and sensitivity of nasopharynx and oropharynx
      [Tapiawala SN et al, 2008]. Success rate depends on cooperation, which limits order for
      nasogastric tube insertion in most patients especially in non-pediatric hospitals.

      The pain and anxiety associated with such procedures in kids is a source of noxious stimuli
      to the nervous system. Not only does pain have a negative impact on neurological development,
      but children whose pain has not been adequately treated in infancy or early childhood
      reported lower pain thresholds as adolescents and adults [Ruda M.A.et al, 2000]. If not
      addressed, this pain can lead to distress for children, their parents and those performing
      the procedures, preprocedural anxiety in the future and can result in negative long-term
      emotional outcomes [Blount R.L et al,2006; Brewer S.G. et al, 2006].

      Nebulized 2% lidocaine at doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg has shown to be safe in infants and
      children, with all blood levels obtained were well below the toxic range [Gjonaj S et al,
      1997]. Nebulized lidocaine in doses up to 8 mg/kg appears to be safe and gave statistically
      significant reduction in pain score when used before flexible bronchoscopy [Gjonaj S et al,
      1997]. Nebulized/intranasal lidocaine did not seem to be of benefit when used alone in the
      two previous trials for NGT insertion in children [Babl FE et al,2009; Craig SS et al, 2019].
      On the other hand it greatly reduced discomfort associated with NG tube in adult population
      [Cullen L et al, 2004]. This might be explained by the anxiety and lack of cooperation,
      especially in young kids, which might limit the validity of pain score during the whole
      procedure.

      Midazolam has a controlled sedation with a quicker recovery time. The safety and tolerability
      profile of midazolam in pediatric patients is comparable/superior to that observed in adults
      [Pacifici GM, 2014]. Midazolam is a GABA receptor agonist providing anxiolysis for procedures
      in pediatric population. Midazolam has been shown to be safe and effective for use in
      children [Wilton NC et al,1988; Theroux MC et al, 1993]. Intranasal midazolam has shown
      improvements with anxiety and crying, as well as need for restraint [Theroux MC et al, 1993].
      Midazolam anxiolysis has been tried in pediatrics and ordered as nebulization, found to have
      a plasma concentration bioavailability which is comparable to the intranasal midazolam by the
      ratio (nebulized:nasal) of 1:2.9. [McCormick AS et al, 2008]. Clinically effective serum
      concentrations of intranasal midazolam can be reached within less than 10 min after nasal
      application [Knoester PD et al, 2002].

      Lidocaine / Midazolam has been commonly used in different procedures in pediatric emergency
      department; such as urethral catheterization, intravenous cannulation, lumbar puncture with a
      great safety margin.
