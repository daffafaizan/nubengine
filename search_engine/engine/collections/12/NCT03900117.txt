    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of split-course chemoradiotherapy
      for local advanced non-small cell lung cancer with severe impairment of baseline pulmonary
      function.

      Patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of 1
      day's duration, concurrent with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 40 Gy/10 fractions and
      28 Gy/7 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with one-month
      break. The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from
      the first day of radiotherapy to the date at which disease progresses. Progression-free
      survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according
      to CTCAE v. 4.0.
