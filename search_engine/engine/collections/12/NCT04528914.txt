      disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) may be triggers of symptoms in
      individuals with functional abdominal pain disorders. However, in children with FAPDs, there
      is a need for high-quality evidence regarding the dietary management. We aim to assess the
      effects of a low-FODMAP diet compared with a regular diet for the management of children with
      FAPDs.

      Methods. In this trial, seventy-four children aged 8 to 18 years with a Functional Abdominal
      Pain Disorder (Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Functional Abdominal Pain-Not Otherwise
      Specified), diagnosed according to the Rome IV criteria, will be randomly allocated to
      receive either a low-FODMAP diet or a regular diet for 4 weeks.A primary outcome will be the
      percentage of the responders, defined as the participants who have at least 30% improvement
      in abdominal pain intensity on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the last week of the
      trial compared with baseline, that is at least equal to the Reliable Change Index (â‰¥ 25 mm
      change on VAS).
