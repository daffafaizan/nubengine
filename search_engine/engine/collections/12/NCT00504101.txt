    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate toxicity of a conditioning treatment regimen comprising bortezomib, arsenic
           trioxide, and melphalan.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate response and overall survival.

        -  Determine what correlative laboratory and clinical parameters, if any, are associated
           with efficacy (e.g., serum arsenic trioxide intracellular glutathione depletion, gene
           profiling of myeloma cells).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Bortezomib will be given on days -6, -4, and -2, arsenic trioxide
           will be given on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2 (total of 5 doses), and melphalan will be
           given on day -2.

        -  Stem cell infusion: On day 0 a minimum of autologous 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg will be
           infused by central catheter.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
