    
      This is prospective study patients undergoing a translabyrinthine resection for a vestibular
      schwannoma with intact hearing in the contralateral ear. During surgery, simultaneous
      cochlear implantation will be performed if the cochlear nerve can be identified and preserved
      during the resection.

      Relevant data to be collected will include patient demographics, details related to the
      vestibular schwannoma including side, size, symptoms (specifically pre-operative hearing
      loss, degree of tinnitus), and status of hearing in the contralateral ear. Surgical details
      to be recorded will include date of surgery, surgical time, and whether the cochlear nerve
      was identified and preserved. Details related to the post-operative course to be recorded
      include length of stay in the hospital, post-operative complications such as wound infection
      or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, and need for revision or additional procedures.
