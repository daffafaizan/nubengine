      children. Children are often frightened by the appearance and the noise of the saw.
      Additionally, the saw blade can become warm, and this can be uncomfortable. Multiple methods
      have been used and studied to try to make this experience easier for children. These methods
      include: soft music, therapeutic play, and headphones. Virtual reality (VR) devices are now
      increasingly affordable and portable. VR could be a way to distract children from the
      appearance and sound of the procedure. VR has been used in other clinical settings to help
      patients with the anxiety associated with medical procedures. The investigators propose a
      randomized trial to assess the responses (e.g. questionnaires and monitors) of children to
      cast removal with VR versus the standard noise reduction headphones.
