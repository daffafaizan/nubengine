      consequences. The Emergency Department (ED) provides an important opportunity to identify
      young adult hazardous drinkers who could benefit from interventions. A Text Message (TM)
      intervention was shown to reduce alcohol consumption among young adult ED patients, showing
      durable effects over 9-months. The TM intervention uses behavior change techniques with the
      largest effect sizes in an alcohol intervention meta-analysis: "goal commitment" and
      "self-monitoring", along with real-time "feedback". However, the unique effect of these
      ingredients, and mechanisms (processes occurring within the individual) through which they
      operate to reduce drinking remain unclear, a critical gap addressed by this project. Young
      adult ED patients (ages 18-25) who screen positive for hazardous drinking will be recruited
      to participate in a randomized trial to determine how best to help individuals reduce
      hazardous drinking. All participants will be asked to complete web-based surveys at baseline,
      12 and 24 weeks after enrollment, complete brief psychomotor tasks weekly for 14 weeks, and
      respond to text messages each Thursday and Sunday for the next 12 weeks. Those randomized to
      the TM interventions will additionally receive feedback on their text reports. The four TM
      intervention arms are: (1) Drinking Cognition Feedback (DCF), (2) Alcohol Risk Feedback
      (ARF), (3) Adaptive Goal Support (AGS) and (4) a combination of DCF, ARF, and AGS=COMBO).
      Study results have implications for designing efficient mobile interventions, and developing
      a dynamic theory of behavior change.
