    
      Participants from Cohort I and Cohort II are assigned (randomized) to one of three study
      arms, all of which have a 4-week lead-in period with (PEG + RBV).

        1. Control arm, participants are treated with (PEG + RBV + placebo) for 44 weeks after the
           lead-in.

        2. Experimental arm with Response Guided Therapy (RGT)

           In this experimental arm, participants are treated with all three drugs (PEG + RBV +
           boceprevir) for 24 weeks after the lead-in. At treatment week 28, those participants
           with undetectable Hepatitis C Virus - ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) from week 8 (up to
           treatment week 24), will be considered to complete treatment, and will enter follow-up.
           Participants with detectable for HCV-RNA at week 8 or later will receive an additional
           20 weeks of therapy with PegIntron and Ribavirin (PEG + RBV + placebo).

        3. Experimental arm, participants are treated with all three drugs (PEG + RBV + Ribavirin)
           for 44 weeks after the lead-in.

      All participants were followed up to 72 weeks following randomization.
