      groups: plasma and tissue matching group and predicting clinical efficacy group. The samples
      of the plasma and tissue matching group are the same period plasma and matched
      FFPE(formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue)samples which will be collected before the first
      time patients accept any anti-tumor treatment. The samples of predicting clinical efficacy
      group are FFPE samples which will be collected before the patients receive EGFR-TKI
      treatment. In addition, the subjects have the complete prognostic follow-up data.
