    
      This is an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
      Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on
      site, estimated gestational age (EGA) at time of randomization (6 weeks-18 weeks vs. 19
      weeks-30 weeks), and whether they are on BUP-SL at the time of randomization (yes vs. no).
      Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits
      through 12 months postpartum.
