      enhancing effects. Despite its widespread use there is limited data regarding potential for
      drug interactions. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of administration of
      ginkgo for 4 weeks on single dose phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Eight healthy volunteers will
      take a single 500mg dose of phenytoin capsules orally with serial blood samples collected
      over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Following the pharmacokinetic
      study subjects will begin taking 2, 60mg capsules (120mg total) of ginkgo twice daily for 28
      days. Following 28 days of ginkgo subjects will then again undergo phenytoin pharmacokinetic
      evaluations with blood samples obtained over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin
      pharmacokinetics. The ratio of geometric means for phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameter values
      and 90% confidence intervals about the ratio of log transformed parameter values will be
      calculated. Confidence intervals falling within the 80-125% range will characterize the
      pharmacokinetic parameter values before and after ginkgo to be equivalent.
