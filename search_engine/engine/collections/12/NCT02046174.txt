    
      This is a Phase IIb, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study with RENCA macrobeads in
      patients with treatment-resistant, metastatic colorectal carcinoma to determine the effect of
      RENCA macrobead implantation on overall survival compared with best supportive care.

      Two treatment groups will be enrolled in this study, as follows:

        -  Group A (n=40) - patients who will undergo up to 4 implantations of RENCA macrobeads (no
           less than 3 months apart), at a dosage level of 8 RENCA macrobeads per kilogram of body
           weight

        -  Group B (n=80) - patients who had previously decided (independently of this study) to
           receive, or continue receiving, best supportive care, defined as management of symptoms
           aimed at maintaining or improving quality of life, but not including approved therapies
           targeting the patient's malignancy
