      objective is to determine the efficacy of local antibiotics in decreasing all-cause implant
      explantation. Participants will be randomized to local application of placebo or gentamicin,
      vancomycin and cefazolin in a saline solution onto the implant and the dissected breast
      pocket. All patients undergoing unilateral breast reconstruction will be randomized to the
      trial drug or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. All patients undergoing bilateral reconstruction
      will be randomized to the trial treatment on one of their breasts and placebo to the
      contralateral breast. A total number of 1274 of breasts undergoing breast reconstruction will
      be included in the trial.
