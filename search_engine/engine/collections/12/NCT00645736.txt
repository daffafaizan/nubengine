    
      This is a naturalistic cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis B subjects receiving
      nucleoside or nucleotide antihepadnaviral therapy.

      It is anticipated approximately 800 subjects will be recruited at 20 Australian sites. Data
      will be collected on the study subjects and analyses performed to describe factors
      contributing to the emergence of viral mutations in Australian patients with chronic
      hepatitis B.
