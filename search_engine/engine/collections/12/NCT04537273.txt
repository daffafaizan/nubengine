      patients with clinical stages IB2-IVA(FIGO2009) treated at the Instituto Nacional de
      Cancerolog√≠a in Mexico City from January 2005 to December 2014.

      A total of 1954 patients with LACC confirmed by pathology, clinical exams and computed
      tomography scan (CT) were identified.

      Demographic, clinical, pathological and follow-up as well as survival status of all patients
      was recorded. Treatment outcome was classified as complete response if the patient had no
      signs of tumor activity after 6 months of finishing treatment, persistence of disease was
      defined if tumor could be identified after treatment or before six months of treatment
      termination, progression was defined if tumor growth occurred or metastatic disease appeared.
      Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the period between finishing treatment and the
      occurrence of relapse, which was confirmed by pathological study and/or CT. Overall survival
      (OS) was defined as the time period between diagnosis and death or date at last visit.
      Quantitative variables were described with central tendency and dispersion measures and
      analyzed with Student's t or Mann-Whitney U test. Normality was determined with
      Shapiro-Wilk's test, Chi-squared for categorical comparisons between groups, Kaplan-Meir with
      the log-rank test for survival analysis were performed. The multivariate analysis was
      performed using Cox proportional Hazard regression model. Statistically significant
      differences were defined as a p value <0.05.

      Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.,
      USA).
