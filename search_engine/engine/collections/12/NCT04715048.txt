      receive Botox on one side of their face and Jueveau on the other. A random number generator
      will generate a list of 20 combinations of "1,2" or "2,1". "1,2" means the Botox
      (onabotulinumtoxin A) will be placed on the right side and "2,1" means that the Botox will be
      placed on the left. The other side will be injected with PrabotulinumtoxinA. 8-10 units will
      be injected into the designated glabella in 3 sites.
