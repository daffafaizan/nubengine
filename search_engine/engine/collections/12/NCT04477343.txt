      (MTD) of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment
      without evidence of disease progression. In addition, the investigator would like to measure
      the SX-682 pharmacokinetic data in humans. The investigator would also like to assess the
      immunophenotypic and stromal changes to the tumor microenvironment after treatment.
