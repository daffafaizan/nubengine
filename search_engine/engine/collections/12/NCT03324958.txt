      developed countries. After a curative surgical treatment, many relapses occur in the vaginal
      cuff. The PORTEC-2 trial has demonstrated a similar reduction in local relapses of
      intermediate- to high-risk endometrial cancer with vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VCB) than with
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). However, VCB induced less late toxicities. VCB is
      therefore indicated after surgery for intermediate- to high-risk endometrial cancer. VCB is
      also recommended after radiation therapy, for patients with stage II or III type 1
      endometrial cancers according to the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics
      classification (FIGO), and for all patients with histological type 2 endometrial cancers.

      If the late tolerance of VCB is correct, the acute tolerance remains limited, and is mainly
      characterized by local pain and anxiety) Virtual reality appears to be a promising tool to
      enhance treatment cancer tolerance, offering a safe and entertaining environment. By the way,
      the use of virtual reality could limit physical and psychical discomfort induced by VCB.

      This randomized phase III multicenter trial aims to assess the impact of virtual reality
      helmets (visual and audio) during VCB in patients treated for endometrial cancer, in terms of
      pain (primary endpoint), and in terms of anxiety (secondary endpoint). Randomization will
      define which patient will wear a virtual reality helmet. Stratification will be performed
      according to the following criteria: vaginal molded applicator versus cylinder, two
      applications versus four; <70 years versus> 70 years.
