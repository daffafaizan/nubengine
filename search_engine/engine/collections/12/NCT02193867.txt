    
      Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder that is
      caused by a marked decrease or complete absence of the LAL enzyme, leading to the
      accumulation of lipids, predominately cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in various
      tissues and cell types. In the liver, accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes and macrophages
      leads to hepatomegaly, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver dysfunction, and hepatic failure. In the
      small intestine, lipid-laden macrophage accumulation in the lamina propria leads to profound
      malabsorption.

      Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency presenting in infancy is an extremely rare form of the
      disease characterized by profound malabsorption, growth failure, and hepatic failure that is
      usually fatal within the first 6 months of life.
