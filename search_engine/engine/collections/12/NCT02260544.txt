      will be tested at the end of stage 1. Power analysis will be performed for the primary
      pharmacokinetic parameters of free Doxorubicin and liposome encapsulated Doxorubicin, for all
      completed patients before bioequivalence evaluation. If observed power will be >= 80% then
      two one-sided 90% CI will be calculated for bioequivalence assessment at stage I.

      If observed power will be < 80% then bioequivalence will be evaluated at stage I. If
      bioequivalence met then study will be stopped and if bioequivalence not met, then required
      additional patients will be enrolled in stage II.

      Each patient will be randomized to one of the two treatment sequences ( RT or TR ) according
      to a randomization scheme prepared prior to the start of the trial. Serial blood samples for
      determination of free doxorubicin and liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin plasma concentration
      for PK analysis will be obtained in each cycle .

      Bioequivalence Criteria : The 94.12% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least
      squares means of ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf should
      be within 80.00 to125.00% to conclude the test product is bioequivalent to the reference
      product.
