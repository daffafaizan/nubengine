    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) of study CXA-10-301, to evaluate
      the long term safety and efficacy of daily dosing of CXA-10.

      The study will be performed in approximately 50 study centers across the United States and
      the United Kingdom, which participated in CXA-10-301. Approximately 96 subjects who completed
      treatment in CXA-10-301 will be eligible to participate in this OLE study, after completing
      all Visit 9 (Day 1 and Day 2) assessments in CXA-10-301.

      Study participation for each subject will last up to approximately 6.5 months. The study will
      consist of a 6 month open-label treatment period and require 5 clinic visits and 1 telephone
      visit, including the Baseline Visit completed simultaneously with Visit 9 CXA-10-301, plus a
      follow-up visit approximately 2 weeks following the last dose of CXA-10.
