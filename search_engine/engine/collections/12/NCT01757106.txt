      non-inferiorly to the administration of the established anaesthetic sevoflurane with regard
      to haemodynamic stability, respiratory function, and depth of anesthesia. The evaluation of
      the outcome will include several secondary parameters such as the incidence of post-operative
      cardiovascular and neurovascular events, the incidence of organ dysfunction and further
      adverse events.

      This study will further function as a pilot study for the evaluation of the incidence of
      postoperative delirium (POD) following OPCAB-surgery and xenon treatment. POD is a common
      complication of cardiac surgery/anaesthesia and may significantly affect the patients'
      mortality and outcome. Xenon possesses neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory qualities that
      may directly interfere with the pathogenesis of POD, as well as reducing other factors of
      perioperative organ injury including cardiac complications. XenonÂ´s favourable
      pharmacokinetic properties further result in rapid clearance from the brain, reducing any
      residual anaesthetic effects that may predispose to POD.
