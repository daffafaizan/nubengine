      Define the lowest dose of rhIL-2 inducing TREGS in children with recently diagnosed type 1
      diabetes.

      Conduct of the study:

      Three doses will be studied versus placebo in parallel groups of six patients. Each dose or
      placebo will be studied according to three periods of treatment:

        1. Induction of TREGS following a cure of 5 days repeated once daily administration [day 1
           - day 5].

        2. Maintenance of TREGS following repeated administration once every two weeks for one year
           [day 15 - day 337].

      At each treatment period, Treg response and tolerance will be evaluated. In addition, overall
      response on T1D parameters will be assessed throughout the study.
