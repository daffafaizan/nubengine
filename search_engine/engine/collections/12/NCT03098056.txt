      with exercise and lifestyle modification education and a meal replacement formula and
      targeted nutraceuticals (PROG 2) in generally healthy, overweight subjects, fifty subjects
      with two or more cardiometabolic risk factors, aged 18 to 69 will be randomized into
      different arms, 13-week intervention trial. To evaluate safety and tolerability,
      questionnaires were collected weekly. Additionally, baseline, week 9 and 13 fasting blood
      samples will be drawn for blood counts, metabolic profiles, plasma lipids, and additional
      cardiovascular risk factors. Vitals signs, weight and body composition were monitored weekly.
