      for esophageal metaplastic mucosa and gastric mucosa over the antrum and body during
      endoscopy on enrollment. The biopsy protocol for esophageal metaplastic mucosa is following
      Seattle protocol. GERD Q score will be conducted on enrollment. Additionally, blood sampling
      for CYP2C19 genotyping is also conducted on enrollment. The eligible subjects will be treated
      by 8-week esomeprazole, and are then randomly assigned to receive either maintenance or
      on-demand esomeprazole therapy (40 mg q.d.) for 40 weeks. The patients were asked to come
      back every four weeks for the recording of symptom days and PPI tablet consumption numbers.
      Follow-up endoscopy with biopsy for esophageal and gastric mucosa is performed at the end of
      the 48th weeks. We will compare the effects of maintenance and on-demand PPI therapy on (1)
      histological changes of esophageal metaplastic mucosa (2) symptom control (3) tablet
      consumption number
