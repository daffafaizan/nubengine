      technique for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. These procedures are difficult and
      time-consuming, because they require precise catheter manipulation and multiple
      radiofrequency applications. Thus, alternative techniques are being investigated to simplify
      the procedure. Recently, a cryoenergy balloon catheter has been developed for PV isolation
      (Arctic Front速, Cryocath Technologies). When this catheter is deployed at the PV antrum, it
      can create a circumferential lesion around the PV ostium by delivering a single cryoenergy
      application.

      An implantable loop recorder for AF detection has been made available (Reveal XT速,
      Medtronic). It may help taking clinical decisions regarding anticoagulant and antiarrhythmic
      therapy and, at the same time, it may be a powerful tool to evaluate the efficacy of
      different therapeutic strategies.

      This is a prospective single-center randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of PV
      cryoablation with the Arctic Front速 catheter vs. the standard PV isolation using
      radiofrequency irrigated tip catheters. The efficacy of both strategies will be evaluated
      from a clinical point of view and from the detection and quantification of AF episodes by
      means of the Reveal XT速 implantable loop recorder.
