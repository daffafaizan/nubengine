      respective observational clinical study. However, patients with any history of eye surgery
      (except cataract surgery) including laser procedure were excluded. The investigators will
      review patients' medical chart and update any medical history in your medical record. If new
      scans are needed, investigators will do them at the time of patients' current visit and it
      will require about 30 mins. CASIA SS-OCT (CASIA 2) is a non-contact scan of the front of the
      eye with higher resolution and provides deeper, wider and three- dimensional views. It is the
      newest scan machine. It is not FDA-approved but is approved in many other countries including
      Japan for patient use. We may perform the scan in the light and dark condition. We may also
      perform the routine scan to capture images of the anterior part of the eye for comparison
      purpose. The results of the scanned data will be among patients' medical records. Age, sex
      and ethnicity within your medical records will also be used for the analysis.
