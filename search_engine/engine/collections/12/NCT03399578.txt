      receive one vaccination in total. In Groups 4 and 5, each volunteer will receive two
      vaccinations in total.

      There are five different vaccine schedules:

      Group 1 (n=6) will receive 5 x 10^9 vp ChAdOx1 MERS .

      Group 2 (n=9) will receive 2.5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS.

      Group 3 (n=9) will receive 5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS.

      Group 4 (n=6-12) will receive 2.5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS at week 0 followed by a boost of
      2.5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS at week 26.

      Group 5 (n=6-12) will receive 2.5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS at week 0 followed by a boost of
      2.5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS at week 4.

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccines, and the immune responses to the
      vaccinations. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in Oxford, England.
