    
      Objective:

      This study investigated the effectiveness of a core stability training Physiotherapy
      programme versus Acupuncture for the management of balance and functional capacity
      impairments of women with Fibromyalgia.

      Design:

      A single-blind randomized clinical controlled trial.

      Setting:

      University of Extremadura and Olivenza Fibromyalgia Association, Spain

      Subjects:

      Women with Fibromyalgia and balance impairment.

      Interventions:

      135 Participants were randomized to a core stability training physiotherapy programme group
      (n=45), an acupuncture treatment group (n=45) and control group (n=45) for 13 weeks.

      Main Measures:

      Measures were taken at baseline (week 0), post intervention (week 6) and at follow up (week
      13). The primary outcome measures were static balance (posturography) and dynamic balance and
      functional mobility (Berg Balance Test, Time Up and Go test and 10-metre walk) and functional
      capacity (Fibromyalgia Health Assessment Questionnaire (FHAQ) and the physical function item
      from the Spanish Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (SFIQ)).The secondary outcome measure were
      quality of life (Spanish- Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), pain, joint stiffness,
      difficulty to work and depression (measured with the visual analogue scale).
