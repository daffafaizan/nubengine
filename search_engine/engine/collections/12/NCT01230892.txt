    
      Primary hypothesis:

      Nebivolol therapy will reduce the number of thin-cap fibroatheromas, VH-IVUS defined
      "vulnerable plaques" compared to Atenolol in patients undergoing serial angiography and IVUS.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        -  Nebivolol therapy will improve coronary microvascular function

        -  Nebivolol therapy will improve coronary endothelial function

        -  Nebivolol therapy will improve coronary wall shear stress

      Specific Aims:

      To evaluate, in patients with stable angina or acute coronary syndromes and moderate
      angiographic coronary artery disease, the effects of Nebivolol 5 mg a day compared to
      Atenolol 50 mg a day on:

        -  The number of thin cap fibroatheromas, percent necrotic core, and percent atheroma
           volume as defined by the novel Virtual Histology IVUS (VHâ„¢ IVUS).

        -  The coronary shear stress profile measured using 3 dimensional vessel reconstruction,
           flow velocity measurements, and computational fluid dynamics.

        -  Microvascular function as determined by coronary flow reserve and fractional flow
           reserve measured by invasive Doppler/pressure assessment.

        -  Endothelial function as determined by the response of quantitative coronary angiography
           and Doppler assessment to intracoronary acetylcholine challenge.
