      2019. Three independent reviews extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Randomized
      controlled trials that assessed the effect of barley b-glucan, oat b-glucan, konjac
      glucomannan (KJM), psyllium, guar gum, and pectin, with a study duration of â‰¥ 3 weeks, in
      adults with or without hypercholesterolemia were included. Data were pooled using the generic
      inverse variance method with random effects models and expressed as mean differences with 95%
      confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by
      I2 statistic. Overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.
