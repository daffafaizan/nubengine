      I. To determine the residual tumor (R) 0 resection rate. II. To determine the pathologic
      complete response (pCR) rate of up to 36 patients treated with 4 cycles of neoadjuvant
      mFOLFIRINOX (UGTA1A1 genotype-dosed irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride]) regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (radiographic [computed tomography (CT)], and metabolic (positron emission
      tomography [PET] maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]) to chemotherapy.

      II. Chemotherapy-related toxicity. III. Surgical morbidity. IV. Overall survival (OS)
      measured from the time of histologic diagnosis. V. Disease-free survival measured from the
      time of histologic diagnosis. VI. Pattern of recurrence (distant, locoregional, both). VII.
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) vs HER2 negative (-) difference in
      clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      PREOPERATIVE THERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours,
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and
      fluorouracil IV over 46 hours continuously on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery.

      POST-OPERATIVE THERAPY: Beginning 5-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours continuously on day 1. Courses repeat every 2
      weeks for 4 more courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
