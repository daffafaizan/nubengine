      involved in the muscle angiogenesis. Mild to severe COPD patients and healthy controls will
      be recruited. All of the investigators patients will undergo a thorough baseline assessment
      in pulmonary capacity and body composition. Blood sampling and biopsy of the quadriceps will
      be done. Key proteins and microRNAs of signaling intramuscular pathways involved in
      angiogenesis will be measured in the quadriceps.
