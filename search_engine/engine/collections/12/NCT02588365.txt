    
      -  Investigators will talk to you by telephone to determine if your child might be eligible
           for the study.

        -  Children complete two baseline testing sessions to evaluate executive function (EF) and
           related skills

        -  Parents complete a packet of information, including questionnaires about the child's
           behavior, EF, and functional skills.

        -  After completion of the baseline testing, we will inform you of eligibility for the
           "Brain Training" phase.

        -  During "Brain Training" children play online computer games for 25-30 minutes/day (can
           range from 15-45 minutes/day depending on your child's attention, training version
           received, number and length of breaks needed), 5 days a week, for 5-7 weeks to complete
           a total of 25 sessions.

        -  Children return for 3 more time points, immediately after the completion of "Brain
           Training" (1 session), and also at 3 months (1 session) and 6 months (2 sessions) after
           completion of "Brain Training."
