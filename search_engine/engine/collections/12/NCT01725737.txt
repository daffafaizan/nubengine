      glutamate transport dysfunction and ADHD psychopathology. However, there is limited clinical
      trial to testify the effect of modulating the NMDA receptor function of glutamate to treat
      ADHD.

      GlyTI-M is an endogenous Glycine transporter I inhibitor, and it acts on the glutamatergic
      synapse to modulate the neurotransmission of N-Methyl-D-Aspertate (NMDA) receptor. This study
      aims to explore the effect of GlyTI-M among children with ADHD.
