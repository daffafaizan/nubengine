      normal nutrition (n = 400) and elderly who are at risk of under nutrition (n = 800).. These
      measurements will be used to examine factors influencing nutritional status and to create a
      "reference" database for anthropometric and biochemical measurements related to nutritional
      status for use in clinical practice.
