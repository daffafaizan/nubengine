      joint replacement recipients. Improved physical activity following joint replacement could
      lead to better glucose control in diabetes and ameliorate impaired glucose and cholesterol
      levels. In this study patients previously recruited to "Perioperative Hyperglycaemia in
      Primary Total Hip and Knee Replacement" study are being followed-up for one year in order to
      analyze if joint replacements have an effect on these metabolic abnormalities. In addition,
      the effect of glucose metabolism disorders on occurrence of persistent pain after surgery is
      analyzed.
