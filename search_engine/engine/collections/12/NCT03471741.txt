      plus concomitant boost to surgical bed (up to a dose of 50 Gy to whole breast and 60 Gy to
      the tumor bed).

      Aim of the study was to evaluate late toxicity and local control after this treatment
      compared with a historical control group (CG) of patients treated with 3D-conformal
      postoperative radiotherapy delivered with conventional fractionation.
