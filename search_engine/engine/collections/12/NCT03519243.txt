      evaluation as compared to the baseline Hb level ) during the 21-week period of treatment.

      This study is a study of the maintenance treatment of anemia. The study will include up to
      100 dialysis patients with stage 5D chronic kidney disease, established efficacy of dialysis
      and renal anemia without other causes of anemia, receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
      (ESA) and reaching target hemoglobin levels.
