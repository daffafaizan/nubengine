    
      Interventional, cross-sectional biomedical study of children with genetic cardiomyopathy and
      healthy children. The aim is to generate, via induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC),
      "patient-specific" cardiomyocytes (CMs) (hiPSC-CMs) to study the molecular mechanisms of
      cardiomyopathies of genetic origin.

      The study will be proposed to the parents or legal guardians of the children from 0 to 17
      included sent in pediatric cardiology consultation to the University Hospital of Montpellier
      as part of their usual follow-up or a health check (control) .

      The only direct intervention performed on the patient is a venous blood sample. The volume of
      blood collected will be lower than the thresholds defined in the Decree of December 2nd, 2016
      on minimal risks in biomedical research (3 ml).
