      protocol applied to the diaphragm within the respiratory rehabilitation treatment in patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      Aim: The main objective of this study is to assess the effects of a 3 weeks myofascial
      release protocol applied to the diaphragm on respiratory parameters in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial
