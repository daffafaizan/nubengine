      identifiable walnut-derived bioactives (urolithins) and other microbial-derived products
      (short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids). The researchers hypothesize that walnut
      consumption will result in improvements to blood lipid profiles, including decreased total
      and LDL-cholesterol; increased HDL-related cholesterol efflux capacity and antioxidant
      protection; and decreased inflammatory biomarkers relative to control diet. The researchers
      hypothesize changes in cardiometabolic health biomarkers will be correlated with food
      bioactive metabolites and/or fecal metagenome. Pathway analysis will identify metabolic
      pathways differentially regulated by walnut-derived bioactives and walnut-responsive
      microbial genes.
