    
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 4-way crossover design with
      subjects administered study drug (JMI-001), placebo, fexofenadine alone and naproxen alone on
      different study days, in conjunction with a quantity of alcohol estimated to be sufficient to
      produce a hangover the next day. The primary objective of the study is the evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two different doses of JMI-001 administered in
      conjunction with alcohol to healthy adult subjects. The secondary objective of this study is
      to compare the PK characteristics of fexofenadine administered as JMI-001 with administration
      of fexofenadine alone, and the PK characteristics of naproxen administered as JMI-001 with
      administration of naproxen alone. To compare overall hangover severity after administering
      JMI-001 with overall hangover severity after administration of fexofenadine alone or naproxen
      alone. To analyze possible quantitative differences in symptom profiles by treatment.
