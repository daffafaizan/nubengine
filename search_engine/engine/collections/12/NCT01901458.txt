      source for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Recently, Terumo BCT introduced a novel automated apheresis system for PBPC collection. The
      Spectra Optia® apheresis system uses the Spectra Optia® Collection set and the MNC software
      for PBPC collection. This system combines continuous centrifugation (high g) and subsequent
      cellular collection into an elutriation chamber, where the platelets are elutriated from
      mononuclear cells. An optical sensor detects when red blood cells begin to be elutriated and
      subsequently triggers the collection of the buffy coat into the product bag by flushing the
      chamber with donor plasma. Thus PBPCs are harvested intermittently. In contrast, the same
      apheresis systems in combination with the Spectra Optia® IDL set and the WBC-D software,
      which has been designed to perform leukodepletion procedures, permits continuous PBPC
      centrifugation (low g) and harvesting.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of the IDL set with manual adaption of the
      WBC-D-software allows a more efficient PBPC collection compared to the collection set which
      is recommended for PBPC collection. The apheresis time to collect the same amount of target
      cells dependent on the donors peripheral blood count will be shortened. In addition, the
      investigators want to compare both systems with respect to the cellular composition of the
      apheresis product and the donors platelet loss and coagulation parameters during apheresis.
