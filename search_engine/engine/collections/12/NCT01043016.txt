      by Professor Chen; it's maximum absorption wave is 670 nm. Patients receive intravenous
      injection of Photocyanine injection, and 24 hours later, patients undergo photodynamic
      therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Photocyanine Injection and photodynamic
      therapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 1 of 3 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 weeks.
