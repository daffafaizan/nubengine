      courses, children are always forced to accept lots of drug therapy and invasive procedures
      without understanding the medical purpose. Due to the immature cognition, always lead to
      anxiety in childhood cancer patients. Our team developed a mobile technology platform based
      therapeutic video game (TVG) for preschoolers with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in
      early 2018. Then three clinical experts were invited to validate TVG and had high
      appropriateness consensus. Then the pilot study was conducted in one medical center in Taipei
      and 10 preschoolers with ALL had been randomly signed in two groups-5 to intervention group
      (6 weeks game intervention) and 5 to control group (regular care). The preliminary results
      showed that crying scale and resisting behavior were no significance between two groups in
      the initial period (p=.663), but the intervention group showed lower crying grades and less
      resisting behavior than the control group in the final period (p=.028). The limitation of
      this pilot research was small sample size and short intervention time. Therefore, the purpose
      of this study is to increase the sample size and intervention time to evaluate the
      effectiveness of our TVG.

      Methods: A total of 68 fresh ALL preschool children will be randomized divided equally into
      intervention group and control group. Only intervention group
