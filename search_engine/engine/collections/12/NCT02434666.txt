    
      This is a long-term-safety roll-over extension study for a Phase II Study (Protocol
      CPC-001-07). Patients having safely completed the 12-week maintenance phase of Study
      CPC-001-07 will be eligible for admission. Subjects will remain on their CPC-201 MTD as
      determined in Study CPC-001-07. The dose of CPC-201 will be increased from 15 mg/day
      (administered in Study CPC-001-07) to 20mg/day starting on Day1. For those patients who do
      not tolerate 20mg/day CPC-201, the dose of CPC-201will be decreased to its previously
      tolerated level of 15mg/day.

      This protocol allows to increase patients' MTD of CPC-201, as previously determined in the
      Phase II Study (CPC-001-07 protocol) by, 5mg or 10mg increment up to a maximum of 60 mg/day
      starting on Day7 or Month 3 visits of this extension protocol per Investigator's judgment and
      patient's tolerability.

      This extension study is intended to continue for each enrolled patient for up to 6 months
      unless medically contraindicated. Patients may withdraw from this study at any time. Upon
      termination of this study, patients will return to their original daily donepezil dose of 10
      mg/day and will continue to receive CPC-201 mg/day for one final week.
