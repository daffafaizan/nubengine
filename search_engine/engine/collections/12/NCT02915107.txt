    
      SORT OUT IX STEMI OCT is a randomized 1:1 study comparing the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting
      BIOFREEDOM stent with a biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent patients with
      STEMI treated with primary PCI.

      Vascular healing index (uncovered stent struts, malapposed stent struts, maximal intima
      coverage and accumulated extra-stent lumen volume) assessed with optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) 1 month after primary PCI.

      Patients will be enrolled by the investigators and randomly allocated to treatment groups
      after diagnostic coronary angiography and before primary PCI. A web based Trial Partner
      randomization system will be used.

      OCT will be performed with the frequency-domain OPTIS OCT system and Dragonflyâ„¢ Imaging
      Catheter during the index procedure and after 1 months.
