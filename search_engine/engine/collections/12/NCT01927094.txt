      developed and developing countries. Prevention and treatment of dehydration are the mainstays
      of therapy. Rehydration can be achieved with oral rehydratation solution (ORS). Even though
      ORS has reduced the mortality and morbidity very significantly, it has no effect on the
      duration of diarrhea, stool consistency and frequency and remains underused. ESPGHAN and
      ESPID published together an evidence based guideline and stated that in the management of
      acute gastroenteritis rehydration is the key treatment and that selected probiotics may
      reduce the duration and intensity of symptoms and can be used as an adjuvant to ORS. A recent
      Cochrane review including 56 trials in children concluded that speciÔ¨Åc probiotics reduce the
      duration of diarrhea with about 24 hours and decrease the frequency of defecation on the
      second day. Current evidence also indicates that probiotic effects are strain-specific.
      Lactobacillus LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii are the best studied strains. However, more
      research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens and strains and as there
      is still no evidence of efficacy for many preparations. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      effects of different probiotics on the duration of acute infectious diarrhea.
