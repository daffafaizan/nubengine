        -  Compare the overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients with unifocal or
           multifocal, supratentorial, pure or mixed anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with
           radiotherapy with or without procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV).

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these 2 regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life and neurologic function of patients treated with these 2
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by age (under 50 vs 50 and
      over), Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%), and tumor grade (moderately vs
      highly anaplastic). Within 8 weeks after diagnostic surgery, patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Within 2 weeks after randomization, patients receive oral lomustine on day 1,
           oral procarbazine on days 8-21, and vincristine IV on days 8 and 29 (PCV). Treatment
           continues every 6 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 6 weeks after day 29 of course 4, patients
           undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.6 weeks followed by boost radiotherapy 5 days a
           week for 1 week.

        -  Arm II: Within 2 weeks after randomization, patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at time of CT or MRI scans during study; and every 3
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually
      thereafter after completion of study therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 292 patients (146 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 5.4 years.
