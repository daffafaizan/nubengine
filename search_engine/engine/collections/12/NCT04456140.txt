      I. To determine the prevalence of genetic mutations in cancer patients seeking care at the
      Mayo Clinic Cancer Center at St. Vincent's Riverside in Jacksonville, Florida.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform a chart review to assess the impact of genetic testing as part of standard of
      oncology care:

      Ia. Determine differences in germline mutation detection in these patients as compared to
      traditional guideline (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) based approach for
      genetic evaluation.

      Ib. Determine the percentage of relatives of mutation positive probands undergoing family
      variant testing within a 3 month window of return of testing results.

      Ic. Assess patient experience and barriers to care with a genetic service line via survey
      measures.

      Id. Develop a biorepository of samples (blood) from cancer patients participating in this
      protocol.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients watch a pre-recorded genetic counseling video and those who consent to genetic
      testing undergo collection of blood samples. Patients also complete surveys over 5-15 minutes
      each prior to receiving their genetic test results and following the receipt of genetic test
      results.
