      individuals. Liver disease has become more significant among subjects coinfected with HIV and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). Several studies have shown that coinfected individuals develop
      earlier and more severe liver disease. Pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin (RBV) has
      become the therapy of choice for HCV among people with HCV alone. However, pegylated
      interferon with RBV therapy for HIV/HCV coinfected subjects results in only modest cure
      rates. This is an open-label, non-randomized prospective trial to assess safety and
      tolerability of Alb-IFN (interferon alpha genetically fused to human serum albumin) 900 mcg
      every 2 weeks (Q2w) with daily RBV among HIV/HCV coinfected individuals. Twenty-five subjects
      who are infected with both HIV and HCV and who also have evidence of chronic hepatitis, but
      who are na ve to anti-HCV treatment, will receive Alb-IFN 900 mcg Q2w together with a
      standard daily dose of RBV for 48 weeks. These subjects will be monitored for Alb-IFN serum
      concentration level, HCV viral load, HIV viral load, and CD4 counts, and will undergo a
      baseline liver biopsy and another optional liver biopsy at the end of 72 weeks. The results
      of the study will enable us to better delineate the efficacy of Alb-IFN in suppressing the
      hepatitis C virus in HIV/HCV coinfected subjects. This will be important given the current
      low cure rate of HCV among HIV coinfected individuals.
