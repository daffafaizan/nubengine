      the treatment of patients with low or selected intermediate risk, organ confined prostate
      cancer.

      There are number of studies with high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRPBT) as monotherapy with
      several fractionation schedule treating the same group of patients. One phase II trial showed
      its effectiveness given in one fraction of 19 Gy.

      In the trial investigators randomly select patients to treat with either LDR prostate
      brachytherapy (145Gy) or HDR prostate brachytherapy (1x19Gy) as monotherapy.

      Patients are stratified into two pretreatment group: 1. low risk, 2. selected intermediate
      risk group.

      Brachytherapy is given in spinal anaesthesia, using transrectal ultrasound based real time
      treatment planning. Dose constraints are defined for both methods.
