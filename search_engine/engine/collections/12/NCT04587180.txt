      had undergone dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans before surgery were included.
      Patients were divided into two groups: patients who had cutting-through (46, group I) and
      patients who did not (32, group II). Clinical and radiological data including demographics,
      BMDs, fatty infiltration of rotator cuff muscles, tear size, tear involvement, VAS pain
      score, and ASES score were analyzed.
