    
      This is an exploratory biomarker trial to assess the ability of atorvastatin (common
      cholesterol lowering agent) alone or combining with aspirin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug) to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in high-risk individuals with Lynch Syndrome.
      Subjects will be stratified based on their prior history of polyps/cancer to receive
      atorvastatin without or with aspirin for 6 weeks. Blood and normal colon biopsies will be
      obtained at Day 0 and at 6 weeks on study. Tissue endpoints for analysis include cell
      proliferation, apoptosis and changes in gene expression. Circulating lipid profiles and
      metabolic function, and post-treatment questionnaires will be used to assess the
      acceptability of the study.
