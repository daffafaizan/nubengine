      involved in protein folding, maturation, and trafficking. Cyclophilins have been shown to
      play a key role in the lifecycle of many coronaviruses, including human coronaviruses 229E
      (HCoV-229E) and NL-63 (HCoV-NL63), feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FPIV), SARS-CoV
      and Middle-East-Respiratory-Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent
      cyclophilin inhibitor, blocks the replication of various coronaviruses in vitro, including
      HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, FPIV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), avian infectious bronchitis virus,
      and SARS-CoV.

      Alisporivir is a non-immunosuppressive analogue of CsA with potent cyclophilin inhibition
      properties. In vitro, alisporivir inhibits the replication of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, MHV,
      SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at low micromolar concentrations without cytotoxic effect. Although
      alisporivir has not demonstrated activity against coronaviruses in in vivo models to date,
      recent experiments showed that alisporivir bears concentration-dependent properties against
      CoV-2 in vitro.

      Preclinical pharmacology data indicate that, after oral administration, alisporivir is widely
      distributed in the whole body, including the lungs. Furthermore, the EC90 of alisporivir
      against SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells appears to be clinically achievable in patients. In
      addition, because alisporivir inhibits all cellular cyclophilins, it also blocks
      mitochondrial cyclophilin-D, a key regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
      (mPTP) opening, a mechanism involved in triggering cell death.

      Therefore, besides its antiviral properties, alisporivir may also be effective in preventing
      lung tissue damage.
