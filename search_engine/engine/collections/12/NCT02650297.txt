      Lymphedema is a common complication for breast cancer therapy. Patients with lymphedema may
      experience pain and body image issues. This study investigates the effect of Combined
      Decongestive Therapy and pneumatic compression pump on body image in patients with lymphedema
      secondary to breast cancer treatment.

      methods: 42 women with breast cancer related lymphedema participated. All patients completed
      the body image and relationships scale. Researchers divided the participants randomly into an
      intervention (n=21) or control group (n=21). A certified nurse worked on Combined
      Decongestive Therapy in the intervention group in two phases. In the first phase, CDT was
      accompanied by use of a compression pump for four weeks, three days per week. In the second
      phase, CDT was performed daily without compression pump for four weeks by patients at home.
      At the end of each phase, both groups completed the questionaire. Researchers analyzed the
      data with SPSS v.17.
