      safety of intravenous, single-dose metoclopramide versus dexketoprofen trometamol versus
      metoclopramide+ dexketoprofen trometamol in patients presenting with acute migraine attack to
      the emergency department (ED).

      Methods of Measurements:

      This single-center, randomized, double-blind study will be conducted in a tertiary care ED.
      Eligible patients who met the migraine criteria of the International Headache Society will be
      randomized to receive 10 mg intravenous metoclopramide, 50 mg intravenous dexketoprofen
      trometamol, or 50 mg dexketoprofen trometamol + 10 mg metoclopramide.

      Subjects reported pain intensity on both a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (limited by 'no
      pain' and 'the worst pain') will be used for pain measurement at baseline, after 15 and 30
      min. The primary outcome measure is the changes in the VAS scores at the 15th and 30th
      minutes of treatment. The secondary outcome measures are the presence of adverse effects and
      the requirement of rescue medicine.

      Primary Data Analysis:

      The study was planned as a superiority trial. The difference in the VAS values between the
      groups was assumed to detect 21.4 mm and the standard deviation (SD) value as 2.8 mm, and
      thus the minimum required the number of patients for each group was calculated as 27 at the
      alpha-critical value of 0.05 and power of 80%. All the analyses were implemented according to
      the intention to treat analysis. Differences between time intervals within groups and between
      groups and statistical significance were expressed by 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
