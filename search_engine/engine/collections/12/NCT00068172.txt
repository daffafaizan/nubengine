      growth of tumors, and also the spread of cancer cells around the body. It also has an effect
      upon blood clotting. The purpose of this study is to assess if PI-88 has any benefit to
      patients with advanced melanoma, as well as to gain further information on the safety of the
      drug. All patients in the study will receive the study drug at the same dose level. The dose
      of PI-88 that will be given is based on the dose that was found to be the best in the phase I
      portion of this study. The drug will be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily
      for 4 days every week. Patients will be treated with PI-88 for up to 6 months, but if the
      drug is well tolerated and effective, patients may be offered further treatment with the
      drug.
