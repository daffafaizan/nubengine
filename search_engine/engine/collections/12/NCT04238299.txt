      Stage 1: 45 people with CKD from nine UKRIN centres will undergo multiparametric MRI to test
      patient tolerance, data completeness and central data collection processes.

      Stage 2: A multicentre, prospective cohort study of 450 people with CKD, collecting
      multiparametric renal MRI at baseline and 2 years. Long-term outcomes will be determined with
      efficient tracking of kidney failure events via the UK Renal Registry at 5 and 10 years.

      Stage 3: A mechanistic sub-study of 45 patients (from Stage 2) who have had a routine renal
      biopsy. Detailed comparisons will be made between multiparametric MRI and histopathological
      changes. Tissue blocks will undergo quantitative analysis of fibrosis, capillary density and
      inflammation using immunohistochemistry techniques.
