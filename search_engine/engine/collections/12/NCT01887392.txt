      fractures, which lead to pain and transfer to acute care. The investigators' previous work in
      LTC has shown that awareness and use of clinical practice guidelines in LTC are low. To
      successfully transfer knowledge, it is imperative to understand the needs of the LTC teams
      and to tailor KT interventions appropriately.

      Interventions which focus on strategies to overcome barriers and on new ways to deliver and
      promote the uptake of best practices that are specific to both the learning needs of LTC
      health care providers and the operational/organizational culture in LTC are greatly needed.
      Interdisciplinary teams who participated in the Vitamin D and Osteoporosis Study (ViDOS)
      indicated several process barriers that may hinder the proper identification and treatment of
      fractures in LTC. There is a need to educate Ontario LTC practitioners on the osteoporosis
      guidelines. The investigators' aim is to facilitate the uptake of Osteoporosis Canada 2010
      Clinical Practice Guidelines, across Ontario LTC homes using the ViDOS multi-faceted KT
      model. Furthermore, the investigators will have a greater emphasis on the implementation of
      guidelines which includes risk assessment and appropriate medication use.
