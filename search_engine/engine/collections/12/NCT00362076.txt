      perceptual categorization. The proposed work is designed to examine the emergence of infants'
      ability to access internal categorical representations. Representation refers simply to
      stored information that can influence later behavior. Categorization refers to the treatment
      of discriminable objects as equivalent in some way. Even very young infants appear able to
      visually categorize diverse sets of discriminable patterns or objects. Much less is known,
      however, about how infants internally represent and utilize such information. The present set
      of studies is designed to probe the ontogeny of category of representations in infancy. The
      methodological strategy to be used in the first study consists of exposing infants to
      entirely novel configurations of objects for fixed amounts of time and later analyzing
      infants' examination and manipulation of those objects once they have become familiar.
      Infants will be exposed to these novel categories of objects at home over a 2-month period.
      Later, in a laboratory procedure, 5-month-old infants will be tested both with the familiar
      objects and similar test objects. A second study will utilize eye-tracking technology to
      examine the nature of infants' eye movements as they visually encode the individual members
      of complex categories such as animals and vehicles. Finally, a third study is being conducted
      to examine the relation between individual differences in infants' category learning and
      subsequent variability in language learning later on in childhood.
