      inhibitor and aspirin together after PCI among ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients
      who complete 3-month course of dual antiplatelet therapy. The object of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor alone, compared to P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor plus aspirin in reducing clinically relevant bleeding and in reducing ischemic
      adverse events among patients diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing
      PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stent.
