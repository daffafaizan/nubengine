      aureus bacteremia (SAB). SAB pose a threat to both catheter and patient survival and may lead
      to a permanent loss of vascular access. S. aureus carriage eradication has proven successful
      in prevention of S. aureus infections. S. aureus decolonization is a key strategy to maintain
      venous access and avoid hospitalization.
