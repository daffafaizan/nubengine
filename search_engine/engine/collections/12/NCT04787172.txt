      for echocardiography, however, it is not limited by the acoustic window or operator dependent
      like ultrasonography. In addition to the anatomic information, a cardiac CT scan provides
      hemodynamic information, including extracardiac and intra-cardiac shunts. It also enables the
      systematic evaluation of other thoracic structures like cardiovascular structures, the
      airways and the lungs by using maximum and minimum intensity projections to delineate the
      vascular and airway structures, respectively. Extra-cardiac great vessels can be evaluated
      along their length; thus augmenting the role of cardiac CT scans in children with congenital
      heart diseases .Inspite of the poorer temporal resolution of cardiac CTA compared to
      echocardiography, yet the combination of rapid acquisition time, increased anatomic coverage,
      high spatial resolution, multiplanar reformation and 3D capability combined with a flexible
      ECG synchronization have improved the image quality of cardiac CT scans and minimizing the
      patient risks. Multidetector computed tomography has greatly advanced the noninvasive
      diagnosis of these anomalies in pediatric patient, thus makes MDCT an ideal non- invasive
      method for evaluating pediatric patients .
