      surgery. The initial studies are performed on healthy test-persons and is not given in
      surgery. The investigators want to explore serum concentration over time (5h) and relate this
      to Visual Analoge Scale (VAS) postoperatively but also to given mg/kg 20 female patients
      between 30 and 60 years will be included after informed consent. They will have day-surgery.
      The patients will receive 5 mg oxycodone if weighing less than 60 kg and 10 mg if weighing
      over 60 kg. Serum samples will be taken 1, 2,3,4, and 5 hours after medication intake and
      serum concentrations will be analyzed
