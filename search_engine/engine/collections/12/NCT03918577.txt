    
      Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRD), including obsessive compulsive disorder
      and body dysmorphic disorder, are chronic and disabling conditions characterized by recurrent
      intrusive thoughts and associated compulsive behaviors that affect millions of individuals in
      the US each year. Individuals affected by OCRD differ in insight, or the degree to which they
      understand their intrusive thoughts to reflect illness. Impairments in insight limit
      individuals' motivation to engage in care and predict worse outcome in those who access
      treatment.

      This study seeks to explore whether unilateral stimulation of the vestibular system, which
      activates cortical areas hypothesized to underlie clinical insight, may beneficially modulate
      insight in individuals with OCRD.
