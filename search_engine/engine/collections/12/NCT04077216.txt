      were advised to be compliant with their medications throughout the duration of the trial.

      On their second visit, participants were asked to do a six to eight-hour overnight fast, and
      their fasting blood sugar was drawn. Serum samples were analyzed through the hexokinase
      method. The participants were then randomly allocated (first allocation) by the dietician
      through a coin toss to receive a standard breakfast without EVOO or a meal admixed with one
      tablespoon of EVOO. The standard meals were labeled with serial numbers, and both the
      participants and the investigator were blinded to the intervention. The meals were consumed
      steadily in 15 to 20 minutes, after which, the food containers were collected to ensure its
      full consumption. Breakfast was chosen in order to avoid a second meal bias. The participants
      were asked to sit in the waiting area of the laboratory until the 2-hour postprandial blood
      sugar was due to be drawn.

      After a one-week washout period, the participants were asked to come back for a cross over to
      the other treatment arm (second allocation). The participants were given the same test meal
      to ensure that that the glycemic index of the food remained constant.
