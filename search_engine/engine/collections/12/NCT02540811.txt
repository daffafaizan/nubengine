    
      The dCELLÂ® ACL Scaffold is a novel device manufactured from porcine tissue using a patented
      variation of Tissue Regenix's platform technology to render the tissue biocompatible and free
      from cellular material, providing a biological scaffold that is safe for human implantation
      whilst preserving the biomechanical properties.

      The device is used to reconstruct traumatic ACL tears to help restore normal knee function
      and therefore prevent further wear of the cartilage and future damage.
