    
      Primary Objective:

      Phase II:

      To determine the compliance and safety of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide or CMF (EC/CMF)
      and nab-paclitaxel in combination with capecitabine (PX).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. To compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and distant disease free survival (DDFS) with
           epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide or CMF (EC/CMF) vs. nab-paclitaxel in combination with
           capecitabine (PX).

        2. To compare the overall survival (OS) with epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide or CMF
           (EC/CMF) vs nab-paclitaxel in combination with capecitabine (PX).

        3. To analyze the efficacy of treatments in subgroups according to clinical stratification
           factors.

        4. To determine prognostic factors on tumor tissue collected from primary surgery and to
           correlate them with study treatment effect.

        5. To compare the geriatric assessments scores (Charlson, VES-13, IADL, G8) at baseline and
           end of therapy.
