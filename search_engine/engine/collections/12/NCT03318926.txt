      disease, but the results are still unclear. Besides, the impact of the duration of tea
      consumption has not yet been investigated in the aforementioned studies. The present study
      was conducted as a retrospective research to investigate the relationship between both tea
      consumption amount and time and renal stone disease. Information on tea consumption was
      obtained by four closed-ended questions in questionnaires, and the diagnosis of renal stones
      was established on the results of abdominal sonography.
