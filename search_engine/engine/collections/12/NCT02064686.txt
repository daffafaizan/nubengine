      with TAEP Itae study the possible relationship between different markers of inflammation:
      sputum eosinophils , FeNO , the ITAE and TAEP and see the influence spirometry or a
      bronchodilator in measuring the ITAE .

      It has designed a line of work studying the following aspects :

      1. Comparison with TAEP ITAE in a group of healthy and stable asthmatics 60 patients , 30
      asthma and 30 volunteers .

      Two . Study of the relationship between the number of eosinophils in sputum, FeNO , the ITAE
      and TAEP , 30 patients randomly FeNO , the ITAE and TAEP be measured.

      Three . ITAE measurement before and after the spirometry test , 20 patients , in stable phase
      will be measured before and after the ITAE spirometry .

      April . ITAE baseline measurement and after administration of 400 micrograms of salbutamol ,
      20 patients diagnosed with asthma , phase stable , they measure the ITAE before and fifteen
      minutes after administration of salbutamol .

      May . Measurement in patients Itae a bronchial provocation test with methacholine was
      performed , 20 patients were measured and baseline Itae after administration of methacholine
      .

      6. Measuring Itae in patients during an asthma exacerbation and stable phase , 20 patients
      during an exacerbation , the ITAE be measured. Already in clinically stable measurement is
      repeated.
