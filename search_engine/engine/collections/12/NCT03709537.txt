      administration of web-based surveys of peer workers and peer supervisors at baseline and
      follow-up (10 months post-baseline). These two surveys will be administered to peer workers
      and peer supervisors at sites enrolled in the study. A letter of informational detailing the
      risks of participation will accompany the survey. Individuals who do not complete the
      web-based survey will be invited to complete a telephone interview with the same questions.
      Sites (where one or more peer supervisors and peer workers are located) will be randomized to
      either the intervention group or standard practice control group. The intervention group will
      engage in Co-Learning Collaborative, several training sessions, and the creation of
      Implementation Teams. Peer workers from the intervention group will also be encouraged to
      attend Recovery International, an established network of self-help support groups for mental
      health. Analysis of the surveys collected from both study groups will be conducted to assess
      the efficacy of the intervention and provide Emotional Health Association with a final
      report.
