      I. To determine the rate of grade 3 breast fibrosis at 1 year in women undergoing lumpectomy
      with oncoplastic reconstruction and immediate intraoperative electron radiotherapy boost
      followed by adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of 5 year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate. II. To determine
      the change in self-reported cosmesis using the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS)
      questionnaire.

      III. To evaluate physician-reported cosmetic outcomes using the 4-point Harvard Cosmesis
      Scale and digital photographs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care lumpectomy and then undergo 1 fraction of intraoperative
      electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) boost to the lumpectomy cavity. Patients then undergo
      standard of care oncoplastic reconstruction and whole breast radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year,
      and every year thereafter for 5 years.
