      women are of child-bearing age. Whereas anyone living with HIV faces the physical challenges
      of living with a chronic disease, as well as the material and social impact of the stigma
      associated with the disease, mothers living with HIV must also meet the demands of
      childrearing while mitigating the negative impact of the disease upon their family. Mothers
      with HIV report that this is their greatest source of stress. Moreover, children of these
      mothers, growing up with a parent with a chronic, stigmatized, and often fatal disease, are
      considered a high-risk group. The IMAGE intervention was designed to improve parenting and
      self-care skills in mothers with HIV in order to improve the mother's physical and mental
      health as well as the child's mental health and behavioral adjustment.
