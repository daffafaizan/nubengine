      of cardiovascular events. Increasingly, attention is being given to high-nitrate containing
      vegetables, with emerging evidence that it might represent a source of vasoactive nitric
      oxide. Clinical data to date uniformly suggest an acute vasoprotective role of dietary
      nitrate administration and a BP-lowering effect. Whether the vascular effects extend to
      long-term intake and in individuals with elevated blood pressure is not well known. The
      investigators hypothesize that consumption of a dietary intervention high in nitrate from
      vegetable sources will have a greater effect on BP and related vascular parameters than a
      similar intervention that is low in dietary nitrates.
