        -  Cohort 1 enrolled mother-infant pairs in which the infant was expected to be ≥2000 grams
           at birth (i.e. full term) at time of enrollment and the mother was living with HIV and
           received RAL 400 mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks prior to delivery and continued to
           receive antiretroviral (ARV) drugs during labor.

        -  Cohort 2 enrolled mother-infant pairs in which the infant was expected to be ≤2500 grams
           at birth [i.e. low birth weight (LBW)] at time of enrollment and the mother was living
           with HIV and received at least one dose of RAL 400 mg within 2 to 24 hours prior to
           delivery.

      Cohorts 1 and 2 provided pharmacokinetics and safety data of in utero and intrapartum
      exposure to maternal RAL in full-term and LBW infants, respectively. Also, the study data
      were pooled with data from IMPAACT P1066 (NCT00485264) (Cohorts IV and V) and P1026s
      (NCT00042289) to determine the starting RAL dosing regimen for full-term and LBW infants in
      IMPAACT P1110 (NCT01780831).

      The study initially opened accrual to Cohort 1 under protocol Version 1.0. Upon completion of
      accrual and follow-up of Cohort 1, the protocol was amended and accrual to and follow-up of
      Cohort 2 was under protocol Version 2.0.

      No study-specific treatment was given to the participants during this study. The women
      (mothers) received RAL for clinical indications outside of the study. Infants received
      standard of care ARV therapy for prophylaxis of perinatal transmission of HIV as prescribed
      by their primary care physicians.

      Cohort 1 mother-infant pairs were enrolled prior to delivery. The women were followed-up
      until discharge from the labor/delivery unit. Infants were followed from birth through 20
      weeks after birth. If infant was eligible for PK sampling (see "Eligibility" section), blood
      samples were collected at 1-5, 8-14, 18-24, and 30-36 hours after birth. Protocol defined
      infant safety evaluations were at birth, and at 8-14 hours, 30-36 hours, 1 week and 20 weeks
      after birth.

      Cohort 2 mother-infant pairs were enrolled prior to delivery or within 48 hours after
      delivery. The women were followed-up until discharge from the labor/delivery unit. Infants
      were followed from birth/entry through 6 weeks after birth. If infant was eligible for PK
      sampling, blood samples were collected at 1-6, 12-24, 36-48, 72-84, and 108-132 hours and
      7-14 days after birth. Protocol defined infant safety evaluations were at entry/birth, and at
      36-48 hours, 72-84 hours, 1 week and 6 weeks after birth.

      For both cohorts, all infants regardless of whether they were eligible for PK sampling were
      included in the safety analyses. Infant safety data included adverse birth outcomes,
      signs/symptoms, diagnoses and chemistry/hematology test results. Protocol required chemistry
      tests were AST, ALT, serum creatinine, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin. Protocol
      required hematology tests were CBC with differential and platelet count. Also included in the
      safety data were additional laboratory events done outside of the study but considered by the
      site as relevant information.

      For both cohorts, maternal blood and cord blood for RAL concentration testing were collected
      at delivery when specimen collection was possible. The optional genotypic testing (i.e.
      testing was done only if the mother consented) was limited to infants who were eligible for
      PK sampling. Information obtained about the effect of UGT1A1 polymorphisms on the PK of RAL
      was thought to provide a better understanding of the effect of genetics on the metabolism of
      RAL in neonates.
