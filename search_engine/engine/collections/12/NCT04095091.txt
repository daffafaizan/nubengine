      minimizing complications to healthy tissue. Given the complexity of tumor and normal tissue
      response to radiation, precise and accurate delivery of absorbed dose distributions, within
      known tolerances, is necessary to achieve the maximum therapeutic ratio. The complex
      treatment process of radiotherapy introduces geometrical uncertainties including respiratory
      induced tumor motion. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a novel
      image-guidance technique to directly track tumor motion using a 4-dimensional (4D) planar
      ultrasound (US) transducer during radiation therapy that is coupled to a pre-treatment
      calibration training image set consisting of a simultaneous 4D ultrasound and 4D magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition. The image sets will be rapidly matched using advanced
      image and signal processing algorithms, allowing the display of virtual MR images of the
      tumor/organ motion in real-time from an ultrasound acquisition.
