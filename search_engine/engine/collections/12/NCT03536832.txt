      with suture after cesarean has been shown to result in lower rates of wound complications
      than with staple closure. However, the optimal choice of suture material for subcuticular
      skin closure is unclear. Vicryl vs Prolen suture materials will be used for subcuticular
      closure of transverse skin incisions after cesarean section. Patients will be controlled for
      superficial surgical site infections 1 week after the cesarean section.
