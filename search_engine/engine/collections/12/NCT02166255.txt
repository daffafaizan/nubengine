      I. To determine the toxicities and establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of APN401.

      II. To determine the effects of APN401 on immune response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document clinical response and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive autologous siRNA-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells APN401
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes for 1 course in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 1 year.
