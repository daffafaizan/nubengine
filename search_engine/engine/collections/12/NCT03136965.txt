      (PRP) will receive a single US-guided injection of 5 milliliters of autologous PRP into the
      patellar tendon, subjects in Group 2 (DN) will undergo ultrasound guided dry needling of the
      patellar tendon, and subjects in Group 3 (SH) will undergo a sham control ultrasound guided
      dry needling in the subcutaneous tissue only (not intratendon) at the level of the patellar
      tendon. The efficacy of the different treatment options will be assessed by pain- and
      function-dependent, PT-specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Patella (VISA-P)
      quality of life scores, activity level scores, knee strength measurements, and conventional
      and novel MRI and US imaging at baseline, 16, 32, and 52 weeks post-treatment.
