      chronic rejection/BOS after lung transplantation. There is currently no established treatment
      available for this condition. There is now mounting evidence that IL-17 producing lymphocytes
      (TH17) not only participate in chronic allograft rejection/BOS, but are also present within
      the airway wall during lymphocytic bronchiolitis and that IL-17 mRNA-levels in
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of these patients are upregulated. As such, TH17 may account for
      the increased BAL neutrophilia seen in these patients, as IL-17 may be responsible for
      driving IL-8 secretion (a neutrophil-attracting chemokine) from various cell types in the
      airways. Since azithromycin has previously been shown to reduce both IL-17 induced IL-8
      production by human airway smooth muscle cells 'in vitro' and bronchoalveolar IL-8/neutrophil
      levels in LTx recipients with established BOS, we believe that azithromycin has great
      potential for treating lymphocytic bronchi(oli)tis by attenuating this
      TH17/IL-17/IL-8-mediated airway inflammation, possibly even halting the subsequent
      development of chronic rejection/BOS after lung transplantation. In this study, histologic,
      spirometric, bronchoalveolar an radiologic features will be investigated in patients treated
      with confirmed lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis treated with azithromycin.
