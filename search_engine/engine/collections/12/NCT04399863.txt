    
      This is a pilot feasibility study, of the quasi-experimental before-after, non-randomized,
      mono-centric type. Feasibility is assessed on process criteria (adoption, reach
      implementation, satisfaction). Intermediate effectiveness is assessed on the skill level of
      patients and their caregivers, before, after and at a distance from education. Patients'
      anxiety levels will also be assessed before, after and at a distance from the program. The
      level of health literacy will be assessed at the start of the study.
