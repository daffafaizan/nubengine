      investigate the effects of 4-week B. lactis HN019 supplementation on whole gut transit time
      and gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with functional constipation. Participants who meet
      all study entry criteria will enter a 2-week run-in period. Following successful completion
      of the run-in period, subjects will be randomized to 4-week supplementation with B. lactis
      HN019 (10 billion cfu), B. lactis HN019 (1 billion cfu), or placebo. The primary outcome of
      whole gut transit time will be evaluated with abdominal x-rays on days 0 and 28. Secondary
      outcomes include IBS-specific questionnaires (administered on days 0 and 28); abdominal pain
      severity, bowel movement frequency, stool consistency, and adverse events (evaluated daily
      throughout the study); and overall product satisfaction (evaluated at day 28). Physical
      activity questionnaires and 24-hour food recalls will be completed periodically during the
      trial.
