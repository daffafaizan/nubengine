      effects, so through certain methods to intervene, in order to reduce the incidence of
      postoperative cough, accelerate the rapid recovery of patients after surgery, improve the
      quality of life of patients, which should also be worthy of attention of surgeons. In recent
      years, the research on intervention measures and treatment methods to reduce cough after
      thoracoscopic lobectomy is mainly focused on drug treatment, traditional Chinese medicine
      treatment, surgical operation and anesthesia intervention. However, the research on reducing
      postoperative cough by improving surgical operation is rare. The purpose of this prospective
      study was to investigate whether preoperative three-dimensional reconstruction and
      intraoperative protection of bronchial artery can reduce the severity of cough after
      thoracoscopic lobectomy, so as to further explore the effective intervention measures of
      postoperative cough and enrich the concept of accelerated rehabilitation surgery.
