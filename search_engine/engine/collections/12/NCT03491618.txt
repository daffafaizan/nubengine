      branch denervation as treatment. Many types if canulae exist, and many types of placing them
      in relation to the Medial Branch nerves (MB). The EARL study tries to compare the analgesic
      effect of thin canulae (22 gauge) placed perpendicular to MB to thicker canulae (18 gauge)
      placed parallel to MB.
