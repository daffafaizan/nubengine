      sudden cardiac death were randomized to either non-invasive or invasive cooling for at least
      24 hours. NSE was collected at designated time points and compared between patients treated
      with invasive cooling and those treated with non-invasive cooling. Neurological outcome was
      assessed between groups at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge.
