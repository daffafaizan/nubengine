      disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of the patient or the
      researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.

      The primary end point of this study is safety of cryoablation combined with carillizumab and
      apatinib for MPLC. The secondary endpoints include objective response rate, disease control
      rate, time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival. Exploratory
      endpoint is to explore biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood that could potentially predict
      the efficacy of Camrelizumab and Apatinib.
