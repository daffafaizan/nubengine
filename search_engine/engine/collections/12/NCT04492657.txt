      adverse effects of iodine deficiency and excess, and because of the complexity of the study
      of lactating mothers and infants and the difficulty of sample collection, it is proposed to
      overcome this problem with the help of the advanced dried blood spot technique and iodine
      balance study method from the panel of Iodine Global Network (IGN). Investigators intend to
      recruit 900 late pregnant women in Tianjin, Hebei and Shandong;then establishing a dynamic
      cohort of breastfeeding mother-infant to 6 months after delivery to investigate the
      physiological compensatory mechanism of iodine nutrition in lactating women with the
      combination of animal experiment; On the other hand, 180 exclusively breastfeeding mother and
      infants within postpartum 0-6 months, will be selected to participate the iodine balance
      study.

      Optimized method of iodine balance experiment of infants by both foreign partner and Pro.
      Zhang's team will be adopted to obtain the first iodine balance value of Chinese lactating
      women and infants,providing the direct evidence for the revision of DRIs in lactating women
      and infants, and guide the lactating women proper iodine supplementation to meet the
      requirements of both mothers and infants.
