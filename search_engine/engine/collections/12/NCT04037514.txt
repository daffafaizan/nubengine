      hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus and who do not meet any exclusion criteria will
      be eligible to participate in the study.

      The PARACETAMOL group will receive intravenous doses of 15 mg/kg administered every 6h for 3
      days (up to a maximum of 2 courses, i.e. 6 days). The IBUPROFEN group (control group) will
      receive the usual treatment, this is an initial dose of 10 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg
      intravenously at 24 and 48 hours after the first (all three doses are considered a treatment
      course), up a maximum of 2 courses).

      A daily echocardiographic control will be performed to evaluate the closure of the ductus. If
      the ductus remains open and with significant clinical repercussion after completing a 3-day
      course of treatment, another batch of 3 doses of the same treatment will be administered. If
      medical treatment fails after two courses (6 days), the possibility of administering a batch
      of Ibuprofen at usual doses in both groups with the intention of offering standard treatment
      to all patients will be considered. Once the medical treatment with both drugs is completed
      if the ductus remains significant, the surgical closure will be carried out.
