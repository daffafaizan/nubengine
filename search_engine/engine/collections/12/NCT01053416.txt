      video-monitors. Those referred to the Glaucoma Clinic for suspected PDS will be enrolled in
      the study.

      In a prospective study on the natural history of PDS and PG, Richter et al. (Arch Ophtal
      104:211-5, 1986) found an association between "active pigment dispersion" and elevated IOP.
      Therefore, in order to evaluate the "stability" of the pigment, a phenylephrine test will be
      performed following the method reported by Epstein et al (1978) AJO 85:43-50. The test will
      be performed by one investigator (SAG)and was considered positive if > "grade 1+" (i.e. at
      least 10 particles in a single light beam). Eyes showing a positive test will be considered
      as "high-risk" for conversion to PG.

      Yag laser iridotomy will be performed in patients showing both eyes at high risk. One eye
      only (randomly chosen) will be treated. the fellow eye will be left untreated and considered
      as internal control.

      Low risk eyes will be followed without any intervention.
