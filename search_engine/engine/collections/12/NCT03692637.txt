      of the most serious malignant tumors that threaten women's lives. It is urgent to explore new
      treatment methods, such as introduction. Tumor immunotherapy strategies to improve treatment
      outcomes and patient quality of life. Car is a group of fusion proteins composed of multiple
      parts, including antigen recognition region, transmembrane region, and NK cell stimulation
      region. NK cells are naive immune cells that are not restricted by MHI and can be activated
      without additional co-stimulatory regions. After activation, granulin-B and Î³-interferon are
      released, thereby inducing apoptosis of tumor cells and lysis of tumor cells. The study will
      follow a 3 + 3 design of dose- escalating cohorts. After a patient enrolls, leukapheresis
      will be performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclearcells which will be sent to a
      manufacturing site to produce anti-Mesothelin Car NK cells. The cells will then be returned
      to the investigational site and, after a standard chemotherapy based conditioning regimen,
      will be administered to the patient. Treated patients will undergo serial measurements of
      safety, tolerability and response.
