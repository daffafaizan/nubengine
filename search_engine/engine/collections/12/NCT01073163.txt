    
      This study was originally conducted as a substudy in a subset of patients enrolled in the
      phase 3 study C18083/3064/NL/MN (NCT00877006) who were randomly assigned to treatment with
      bendamustine in combination with rituximab (BR) and who satisfied additional eligibility
      criteria related to cardiac function. The objective of the substudy was to obtain results to
      assess the effect of bendamustine treatment on cardiac polarization and any potential changes
      in the QT interval (corrected by the Fridericia method [QTcF]). After a period of time, the
      substudy was amended to be a separate stand-alone study to ensure that an adequate number of
      patients were included. Patients were treated for 6, and up to 8, cycles in the stand-alone
      study, and efficacy and safety were also assessed. In addition, a requirement to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of bendamustine and rituximab when used as combination therapy was added to
      the objectives, to determine the potential for drug interaction between bendamustine and
      rituximab.
