      systematically study the natural history, optimal treatments, and outcomes in this group of
      diseases. This will provide a resource for future studies and for identification of new
      biomarkers of aortitis for purposes of diagnosis, disease activity measurement, disease
      damage assessment, determination of disease states, and evaluation of treatment response.
