      survival, and time to treatment failure in patients with unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with oral
      nitrocamptothecin. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (yes vs no). Patients receive
      oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease
      after week 8 may receive additional courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
