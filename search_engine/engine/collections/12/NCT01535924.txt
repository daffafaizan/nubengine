      I. To evaluate the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined
      bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in
      patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. To determine the overall response rate of bendamustine and gemcitabine in patients with
      relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether therapy with bendamustine in the setting of relapsed or refractory
      Hodgkin's lymphoma will impact future stem cell collection.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bendamustine hydrochloride followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 21-28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
