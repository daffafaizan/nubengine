      middle cerebral artery infarction defined by the association of 3 criteria: a National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥16, including a score ≥1 for item 1a (level of
      consciousness); brain computed tomography ischemic signs involving 2/3 of the middle cerebral
      artery territory; and a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume >150cm3. The first
      patient was enrolled in January 2003 and the last patient in December 2007. An independent
      data safety monitoring committee monitored the safety, progress, and ethics of the trial.
      Patients were randomized to either surgical plus medical treatment or to conservative medical
      treatment alone.
