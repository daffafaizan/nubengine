    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that is manifested by
      progressive cognitive deficits including memory loss followed by loss of independent function
      as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, depression, anxiety, agitation and
      psychosis. JNJ-63733657 is a humanized monoclonal anti-tau antibody which binds to
      phosphorylated tau (P-tau). The study will evaluate whether JNJ-63733657 can slow cognitive
      decline in participants with Early AD with evidence of elevated brain tau (T+) and assess its
      safety and tolerability. The study consists of: screening period (13 weeks), double-blind
      treatment period (up to 232 weeks), and a follow-up period (13 weeks). Safety and
      tolerability assessments will include adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiogram
      (ECG), early discontinuations, physical and neurological examinations, safety laboratory
      evaluations, suicidality risks (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [CSSRS]) and brain MRI
      will be performed during the study. The maximum treatment duration is up to 232 weeks (4.5
      years).
