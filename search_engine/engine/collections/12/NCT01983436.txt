      therefore chewing, breathing, phonation and swallowing functions. In postoperative, several
      physical and functional consequences are observed in patients: transient edema of the face,
      maxillo-mandibular blocking (causing difficulties to eat and occasional weight loss), pain
      and sensory disturbances (labial or/and chin paresthesias).

      Achieving sessions of manual lymphatic drainage by physiotherapist may allow faster decrease
      of postoperative edema, improved postoperative comfort and mental well-being.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sessions of manual lymphatic
      drainage to reduce postoperative edema. Secondary objectives of the study are to assess
      impact of sessions of manual lymphatic drainage on patient comfort (pain, aesthetic
      discomfort, difficulty in breathing and discomfort in swallowing) and on ental well-being.

      Patients allocated to the intervention group will have 13 sessions of manual lymphatic
      drainage and those allocated in control group will not.

      Edema of patients will be measured at day 1, day 8, day 15 and day 22 after surgery by a
      different physiotherapist than physiotherapist achieving drainage sessions, blind to the
      randomization group of the patient. At the same time, comfort criteria will be assessed by a
      visual analogue scale and mental well-being with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ28).
