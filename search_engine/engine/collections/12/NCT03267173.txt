      host of development of tumor biology, molecular biology and immunology. It has become the
      fourth tumor treatment model after traditional tumor therapies (surgery, chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy) . With the development of the research field, the CAR-T cell basis and clinical
      research of various targets have achieved good results. Mesothelin, PSCA, CEA, HER2, MUC1 and
      EGFRvIII are potential targets and spectacular paradigm in the diagnosis and treatment of
      pancreatic cancer. This study is for evaluation of the safety and efficacy of Mesothelin,
      PSCA, CEA, HER2, MUC1, EGFRvIII targeted and other CAR-T cell immunotherapy for pancreatic
      cancer.
