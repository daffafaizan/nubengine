    
      This non-interventional study will be conducted to characterize the risks and benefits of
      bempedoic acid and/or its fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe in a real-world clinical
      setting in adult patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia and to gain
      insight into the effectiveness (managing plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol) as well as safety (clinical events associated with the treatment modalities).
      Real world evidence will be collected in 8000 participants, treated by specialized as well as
      non-specialized physicians in hospitals and office based centers.
