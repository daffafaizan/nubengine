      diabetes. The addition of a disease in pregnancy amplifies the requirements for optimal
      self-care during pregnancy. This load of information poses a significant burden, particularly
      for women with additional socioeconomic barriers to self-care. Preliminary work suggests
      patients must overcome a number of social, psychological, and knowledge-based barriers to
      achieve successful diabetic control in pregnancy.

      This project involves development and preliminary evaluation of a patient-centered education
      and self-care tool for use with women whose pregnancies are complicated by diabetes. The
      study begins with development of a text messaging curriculum to provide motivational and
      educational support. We will use a one-way, non-interactive text-based educational platform
      to provide supportive and educational messages to a cohort of 40 women with diabetes. Women
      receive 3-5 text messages per week until delivery. The goal is to develop a program that can
      be expanded to a clinical trial in which perinatal outcomes are assessed.

      The primary outcome is patient satisfaction and opinions about the texting program, as
      measured via a qualitative interview upon study completion. Participants underwent an
      enrollment survey to assess health literacy/numeracy, diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes
      knowledge, personality, and social hassles. They underwent a baseline in-depth one-on-one
      interview focusing on barriers to successful self-care with pregnancy and diabetes. Follow-up
      surveys and an exit interview elicited information about their opinions of the texting
      program. Additional goals included determining feasibility for future expansion as a trial.
