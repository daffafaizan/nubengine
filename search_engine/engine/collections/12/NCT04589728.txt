      the impact on outcome of the combination of HMA plus venetoclax in patients with AML unfit
      for intensive chemotherapy in a "real-life" scenario. At least 104 AML adult patients
      ineligible for intensive chemotherapy treated with the combination HMA plus venetoclax under
      the Italian Law No.648/96 by December 2021 will be enrolled. No additional procedures or
      visits other than those required by normal clinical practice will be required. Patients will
      be observed for at least 24 months.
