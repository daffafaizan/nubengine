    
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel, and comparative clinical
      trial. All the enrolled subjects will be treated with Prograf速 (Tacrolimus), Basilixumab,
      Corticosteroids, and Mycophenolate Mofetil to suppress their immune system for one month (30
      days) after their kidney transplant. After the one month, the experimental group (30
      subjects) will be treated with Advagraf速 (Extended Release Tacrolimus) instead of Prograf速
      (Tacrolimus), and the Corticosteroids and Mycophenolate Mofetil will be maintained. The
      control group (30 subjects) will continuously receive Prograf速 (Tacrolimus), Corticosteroids,
      and Mycophenolate Mofetil. The clinical progress of the subjects in the experimental and
      control groups up to six months after their transplant will be investigated and compared.
