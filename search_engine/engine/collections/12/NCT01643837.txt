      compared to a light touch protocol and standard management in the treatment of women with
      cyclical and non-cyclical mastalgia (breast pain).

      A randomized placebo controlled study will be conducted at two academic health care centers.
      Women with breast pain will be evaluated and followed by the breast surgeon. Once a
      pathologic cause has been ruled out, the women will be stratified and randomly divided into
      three study groups. Group A, B, and C. Group A will receive standard of care treatment. Group
      B will receive light touch (a placebo for the OMT treatment). Group C will receive OMT
      directed at treating mastalgia. The treatment will continue for three months.

      The subjects will fill out an initial pain questionnaire and a follow-up questionnaire each
      month. They will also be instructed to fill out a breast pain log daily for three months. A
      final questionnaire will be completed at six months. Statistical analysis will be utilized to
      determine whether the addition of OMT improves the severity or duration of the pain as well
      as quality of life as assessed by the patient.
