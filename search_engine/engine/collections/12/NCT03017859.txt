      past 2 years with moderate to severe OSA (AHI>=15) at the Rabin Medical Center (RMC) sleep
      lab, and who are intolerant to CPAP treatment. Following signing an informed consent form,
      these patients would undergo polysomnography (PSG) while treated with HFNC. The HFNC PSG
      outcome measures will be compared to the baseline PSG done within the past 2 years and to an
      additional PSG while connected to a CPAP device.
