    
      This is a randomized, parallel group, open label pilot study to investigate the effect of
      Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum Linn.) on metabolic and biochemical parameters in young overweight and
      obese subjects. Thirty overweight/obese volunteers will be divided into two groups. The first
      group will receive no intervention. The second group will be supplemented with one capsule of
      Tulsi orally every morning and evening in empty stomach for 60 days. The metabolic parameters
      and liver enzymes will be evaluated before and after the intervention.
