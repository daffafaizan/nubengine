      physical activity and decreased sedentary behavior via state-of-the-art mobile phones will be
      efficacious at improving these behaviors relative to commercially available Android
      applications as a control. If efficacious, these types of intervention programs could be
      disseminated to a wide variety of sedentary and underactive adults at a relatively low cost.
      This could have a potentially significant impact on promoting improved health such as reduced
      obesity, a key problem within the U.S.
