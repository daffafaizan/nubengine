      will be recorded and analyzed in 50 overweight/obese subjects with type 2 diabetes enrolled
      in the Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) program. The Weight Achievement
      and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) program is a 12-week multidisciplinary program developed
      by Joslin Diabetes Center for intensive diabetes weight management in clinical practice. It
      includes the following components that are provided in a group setting: (1) intensive medical
      treatment provided by an endocrinologist and a registered nurse; (2) a structured dietary
      plan provided by a registered dietitian; (3) an individualized exercise training program
      provided by an exercise physiologist; (4) cognitive behavioral modification provided by a
      behavioral therapist.

      Participants will be enrolled in this study for a period of 24 weeks. They will attend the
      Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) program during the first 12 weeks of
      the study and will be followed for another 12 weeks after the program (the maintenance
      phase). During the intervention phase, participants will receive group education on a weekly
      basis for 12 consecutive weeks. During maintenance phase, participants will receive a
      monthly, 15 minute long, follow up phone call from the study dietitian.

      Participants will be instructed to complete a 3-day food log before each visit. They will
      also be asked to record their dairy intake on a daily basis in a dedicated log book. These
      logs will be collected and analyzed by the study dietitian. Dairy consumption will be
      calculated as the sum of servings per day of milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy foods.
