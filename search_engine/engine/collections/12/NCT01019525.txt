      projection, tension augment in scapular belt muscles and postural adaptations. Although
      thoracic shape and posture can influence ventilatory dynamics, we didn't find studies
      addressing pulmonary function of mouth-breathing children. This was a transversal study,
      designed to analyze the posture of mouth-breathing children, and verify the existence of
      correlation between posture and pulmonary volumes.
