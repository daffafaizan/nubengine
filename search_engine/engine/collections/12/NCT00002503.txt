      to progression, and survival of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer with painful
      osseous metastases treated with either strontium-89 or palliative local radiotherapy. II.
      Compare the quality of life achieved on these two regimens. III. Determine the toxicity and
      morbidity of treatment on these two regimens. IV. Compare the cost effectiveness of these two
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radioisotope therapy. Strontium-89 chloride, Strontium-89.
      Arm II: Radiotherapy. Involved-field irradiation (equipment unspecified).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 200 patients will be entered over 2 years.
