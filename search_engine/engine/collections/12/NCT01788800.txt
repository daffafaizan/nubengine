    
      Patients undergo cognitive behavioural therapy consisting of 8 group sessions within 1 month.
      All patients additionally complete a training of physical activity, which starts
      simultaneously to therapy and runs for 8 weeks (3 times/week, 30 minutes each). Half of the
      patients complete training on a treadmill while the other half completes a training programme
      of low intensity physical activity without cardiovascular activation.

      Flanking EEG (electroencephalogram) recordings shall help clarify biological processes
      underlying the therapeutical process.
