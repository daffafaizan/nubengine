    
      A phase 1, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double blind (neither physician nor
      patient knows if CNTO 3157 or placebo has been assigned), placebo controlled, single,
      ascending-dose study of CNTO 3157 in healthy volunteers and multiple dose study in patients
      with asthma. This study will compare the effects (both good and bad) of CNTO 3157 to those of
      placebo. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential side effects of
      CNTO 3157 given to healthy volunteers and patients with asthma. In addition, the
      investigators will measure how much study drug is in the blood following a dose of CNTO 3157,
      and determine if the body makes antibodies to it. (An antibody is a protein made by the body
      in response to a foreign substance). Safety assessments will be performed throughout the
      study and include obtaining and evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g., blood
      pressure), and the occurrence and severity of adverse events. There will be 2 parts to this
      study. The first part of this study will involve healthy volunteers, and the second part of
      the study will involve patients with asthma. About 56 healthy volunteers and 16 asthmatic
      patients will take part. Volunteers will be required to stay at the research center after
      study agent administration for an inpatient portion of the study and then return for required
      out-patient visits. Up to approximately 8 different dose levels will be studied. CNTO 3157
      will be administered by IV infusion. The duration of volunteer participation will be up to 21
      weeks in Part 1 and up to 24 weeks in Part 2.
