      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, overall response is only 30-40%, suggesting that
      a majority of the patients do not respond to platinum. Subsequently, those patients who
      experience treatment failure with platinum-based therapy typically received pemetrexed or
      docetaxel as second-line treatment, with response rate of approximately 7% to 10%. The
      primary objective of this randomized phase II study is to compare the Response Rate of each
      sequence of treatment approach in patients with advanced NSCLC. Additionally, development of
      gene expression profiles and genotypes that can predict response to commonly used
      chemotherapy may provide a unique opportunity to better utilize drugs shown to be effective
      in first- or second-line therapy. Here, we will conduct a pharmacogenomic study to provide
      rational approach to the treatment of NSCLC by developing predictors of cisplatin (first-line
      agent) and pemetrexed or docetaxel (second-line agents) sensitivity and demonstrating the
      clinical value of identifying the most appropriate drug on the basis of sensitivity profile
      for the treatment regimen of each individual patient. Such an approach is likely to maximize
      response to chemotherapy and may change the current empirical paradigm of NSCLC therapy.
