      after meeting all the inclusion criteria, not meeting any exclusion criteria, and signing the
      informed consent, could they be enrolled in the group to receive forceps biopsy combined with
      puncture biopsy to sample the target nodules. The primary endpoint is the combined diagnostic
      yield of forceps biopsy and puncture biopsy. The secondary endpoints include the success rate
      of biopsy, the operation time of the bronchoscope and so on.
