    
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of the conventional,
      paresthesia mapping-based burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) implantation strategy to a more
      novel, anatomic midline-based approach that has the potential to streamline the workflow
      associated with the SCS treatment continuum.
