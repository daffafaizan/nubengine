      antagonist. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that memantine can decrease the neuronal
      toxicity associated with excessive glutamate release and calcium overload in neurons. Results
      from clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have
      demonstrated memantine's efficacy and safety by showing positive treatment effects on
      cognitive, global and functional decline.

      The purpose of this 24-week open-label extension study was to collect additional long-term
      safety and tolerability data on memantine in patients who completed the lead-in double-blind
      placebo-controlled Study 10158.

      In agreement with Health Canada the study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment
      difficulties in the lead-in Study 10158. Patients ongoing in the study when the decision to
      terminate was taken were allowed to complete it.
