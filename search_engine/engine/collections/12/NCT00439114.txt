      haze not related to surgery. In this institutional based, prospective, controlled clinical
      trial subjects with corneal haze not related to surgery are included. Normal eyes are used as
      control group to calculate the customized acoustic factor. Corneal haze is graded with
      slit-lamp by a single examiner. Ultrasonic and Orbscan II pachymetry measurements are
      obtained by one technician each masked to the other measurement. Paired t and Kruskal-Wallis
      tests are used to evaluate the difference between ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry
      measurements. Correlation of the two methods and haze grade is determined with Kendall's
      tau-b correlation analysis. According to the results of the study, we will determine which
      method is accurate in subjects with corneal haze.
