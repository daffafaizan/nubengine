      normal saline infusion to sodium bicarbonate infusion. 220 adult patients scheduled for
      routine cardiac catheterization will be enrolled. They will stratified according to the
      presence or absence of DM, or an estimated GER of less than 60 ml/hr before being
      block-randomized to the two groups. The incidence of CIN will be determined based on the
      average of two measurements of creatinine level before and 48 hours after the procedure, and
      an increase of 25% or 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 umol/L) or more.
