      visits may be done by phone. Additional phone checks are scheduled at the beginning of each
      12 week part of the study. Participants will have a 50:50 chance of being on prazosin or
      placebo in the first 12 weeks of the study. For the second 12 weeks, all participants will
      take prazosin.

      Study visits include a physical and neurological exam; memory testing; interviews with the
      caregiver about behaviors; and vital signs.
