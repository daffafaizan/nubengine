        -  Determine the optimal criteria for determination of ototoxicity in younger cancer
           patients treated with cisplatin.

        -  Determine the feasibility of including ultrahigh frequency and evoked otoacoustic
           emission testing as adjunctive measures of ototoxicity.

        -  Determine the feasibility and necessity of central review of audiometry data.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective, cohort study.

      Patients undergo hearing tests (conventional, otoscopy, ultrahigh frequency, and otoacoustic
      emission testing) before the first course of planned cisplatin, before each subsequent course
      of cisplatin, and 4 weeks after the last dose of cisplatin.

      Patients who are scheduled to receive hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplantation
      undergo hearing tests before the transplantation and 4 weeks after transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 282 patients will be accrued for this study.
