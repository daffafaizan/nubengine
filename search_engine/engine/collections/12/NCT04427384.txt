    
      Patients (N=600) with surgically resected (R) brain tumors of any pathology who have
      undergone STaRT are eligible. Data collected will include local control, overall survival,
      QOL, neurocognition, functional decline, and surgical and radiation associated AE's. Data
      will be collected at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 18 and 24 months, then every 6 months through 5 years.
      RESULT: Data will be used to benchmark clinical outcomes of STaRT therapy and allow for
      comparisons to existing standard-of-care treatments. This will be the first observational
      registry study of R+STaRT, delivered by Cs-131 sources in permanently implanted resorbable
      collagen tile carriers. The outcome measures captured will allow for evaluation of the
      potential risks and benefits of this treatment approach for patients in a real-world setting.
