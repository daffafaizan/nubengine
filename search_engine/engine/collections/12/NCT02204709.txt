      reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. CVD is a major cause of death in the United
      States. The current obesity epidemic contributes significantly to elevated CVD risk by
      increasing inflammation and platelet dysfunction. Prevention of CVD is a public health goal
      and comprises several avenues of action, of which inclusion of LCn3-rich fish in the diet may
      be one of the most effective.

      Obese participants will participate in a double blind, randomized, cross-over designed trial
      in which they will consume twice-weekly a prepared meal containing diploid (2N) farmed
      rainbow trout, triploid (3N) farmed rainbow trout containing higher levels of LCn3, or
      tilapia, a low LCn3 fish.
