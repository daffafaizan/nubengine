    
      This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a regimen
      of moderate-dose (6000 mg per day) Vitamin C supplementation versus placebo for the treatment
      of patients presenting to the ICU with septic shock. Both groups will continue to receive all
      other standard of care measures for septic shock as clinically indicated. Groups will be
      enrolled and receive study drug/placebo for 4 days (96 hours) or until 24 hours post-last
      pressor dose, whichever is sooner.
