      are not on dialysis (Cohort 1), moderate renal impairment (Cohort 2), mild renal impairment
      (Cohort 3) and participants with normal renal function (Cohort 4). Following completion of
      Cohort 1 and Cohort 4, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data will be reviewed and a decision
      will be made whether to study unmatched participants with moderate and mild renal impairment
      (Cohorts 2 and 3, respectively).

      Participants will be screened up to 21 days before administration of study drug. Eligible
      participants will be admitted to the clinical unit either on the evening of Day -2 or on the
      morning of Day -1. Each participant will receive a single oral dose of the study drug under
      fasted conditions on Day 1. Participants will be required to remain resident in the clinical
      unit until the morning of Day 3 but, if they prefer, may also remain resident until all PK
      and other study procedures are completed on Day 7. This decision to extend residency will be
      made at the discretion of the principal investigator. If participants do check out on Day 3,
      they will then return to the unit, as scheduled, for collection of PK samples and safety
      assessments, with a final Follow-up Visit on Day 14.
