        -  Compare the 1-month incidence and severity of gefitinib-, cetuximab-, or other epidermal
           growth factor receptor inhibitor-induced skin rash development in patients with cancer
           treated with tetracycline vs placebo.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs who develop vs those
           who do not develop a rash.

        -  Determine whether patients who discontinue tetracycline at 1 month develop a rash.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior chemotherapy regimen (first-line therapy vs other),
      concurrent epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy (gefitinib vs cetuximab vs
      other), and concurrent corticosteroid therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tetracycline twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for
           4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then weekly for 8 weeks.

      Patients are followed at weeks 4 and 8.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 126 patients will be accrued for this study.
