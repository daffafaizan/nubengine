        -  Compare immune response in patients with stage IIB-IV melanoma treated with vaccination
           comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides and Montanide ISA-51 with vs without
           sargramostim (GM-CSF).

        -  Compare immune response in patients treated with these vaccinations administered at 1 vs
           2 sites.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides and
           Montanide ISA-51 at 1 injection site.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides and
           Montanide ISA-51 at 2 injection sites.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides,
           Montanide ISA-51, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) at 1 injection site.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive vaccination comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides,
           Montanide ISA-51, and GM-CSF at 2 injection sites.

      In all arms, treatment repeats once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients return for booster
      vaccinations at weeks 12, 26, 39, and 52.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 124 patients will be accrued for this study.
