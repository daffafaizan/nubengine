    
      Background:

      The NCI GMB/ETIB conducts clinical trials utilizing gene transfer. The current FDA
      requirements for long term follow up may be up to fifteen years for some products. As this
      time period is frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a protocol is
      necessary to ensure the necessary follow up of these subjects

      Objectives:

      To facilitate collection of long term follow up information on subjects who have participated
      in gene transfer studies as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other
      regulatory groups

      Eligibility:

      Enrollment on a NCI GMB or ETIB treatment protocol for gene therapy.

      Design:

      Patients will undergo physical exams, laboratory evaluations and/or phone follow up as
      required by the treatment protocol and/or as clinically indicated.
