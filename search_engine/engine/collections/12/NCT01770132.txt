      I. To determine the safety of increasing porfimer sodium (PHO) dose and total energy by
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) for locally advanced
      unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC) in humans.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify computed tomography (CT) detected volume of tumor necrosis produced by EUS-PDT.

      II. Quantify rates of tumor size stabilization or decrease by EUS PDT and determine objective
      response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      III. Determine surgical downstaging off of abdominal vessels and resectability. IV. Determine
      changes in serum cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 levels with treatment. V. Evaluate progression-free
      and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of EUS-PDT with porfimer sodium.

      Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) on day 1 and undergo EUS-PDT on days 1,
      3, 8, and 21. After completion of EUS-PDT, patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1 and 2 and on day 22 of courses 3 and 5. During
      courses 1-5, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After course 5, treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride repeats every
      2 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
