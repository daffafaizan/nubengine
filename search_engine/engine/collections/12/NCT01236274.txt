      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      The use of antipsychotics is associated with a rise in cardiovascular events. Previous
      studies investigating the effect of antipsychotic agents on the risk of Myocardial Infarction
      (MI) led to conflicting results with reports of either no association or a positive
      association. As patient populations for whom antipsychotic agents are indicated differ
      considerably from healthy comparison populations, confounding by indication could be
      substantial. Whilst confounding can be accounted for if known and measured, residual
      confounding remains a potential problem. This study aims to assess the relationship between
      the risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case
      series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the
      self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study
      using the same data to explore the role of confounding by indication.
