      effusion and undergoing diagnostic thoracentesis.The investigators plan to analyze the two
      bedside point-of-care fluid glucose testing methods (I- STAT device and finger stick
      glucometer) to measure pleural fluid glucose levels. The results obtained from these two
      methods will be compared to the traditionally in lab measured pleural fluid glucose levels.
