      less stressful and traumatic for children. However, for unpleasant procedures that require
      child cooperation, this task becomes difficult. Home-training in self-hypnotic relaxation may
      provide an inexpensive, yet systematic method for improving the overall medical care of
      children undergoing invasive medical procedures. The proposed study is designed to utilize a
      self-hypnosis DVD home-training program for parents to use with their children to teach
      self-hypnosis techniques for inducing relaxation and hypnotic analgesia. The study will
      examine the efficacy of this intervention for children undergoing urethral catheterization
      for VCUG procedures. Parents will be instructed to watch the DVD and practice the
      self-hypnosis exercises every day for a week with their child prior to the upcoming
      procedure. Parents are encouraged to practice self-hypnosis during their child's VCUG
      procedure. Both parents and children will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires
      before and following the procedure.
