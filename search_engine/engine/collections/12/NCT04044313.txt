      was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib
      in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated HAIC plus lenvatinib and toripalimab. Thus,
      the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find out it.
