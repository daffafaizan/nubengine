      dutasteride on the time to prostatic-specific antigen progression in patients aged 65 or
      older receiving this combination as first line treatment for systemic prostate cancer.

      To determine the safety and toxicities of the study drug combination.

      To determine the time to prostatic-specific antigen nadir from the start of study treatment
      and to evaluate the absolute prostatic-specific antigen nadir as a result of the study drug
      combination
