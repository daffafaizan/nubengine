      Widely known wet beri-beri is developed due to thiamine deficiency and characterized by
      vasodilatory shock and despaired oxygen extraction leading to kidney, heart and central
      nervous system dysfunction. Thiamine deficiency is often underestimated and even in primary
      absence of vitamin B1 deficiency, high-consumptive state of many critical illness and cardiac
      surgery itself can lead to its lack. Reported that in patients on chronic dialysis and
      patients with AKI requiring RRT thiamine deficiency is a usual finding. In cross-sectional
      observational study it has been shown that up to 33% of patients with a diagnosis of
      congestive heart failure (CHF) had thiamine deficiency due to chronic loop diuretic use. Also
      reported that 96% of patients (21 of 23) with heart failure receiving loop diuretic therapy
      (daily dose: 80-240 mg furosemide) developed thiamine deficiency. In prospective
      observational trial it has been shown that plasma thiamine levels were decreased after CABG
      surgery.

      In a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in
      septic patients, thiamine supplementation showed highly-promising renal protective effect.
      Need for RRT was 8 patients (21%) in placebo group and 1 patient (3%) in thiamine group
      (p=0.04).

      On the other hand it was unable to show any benefit of thiamine supplementation in patients
      undergoing CABG surgery. Although, postoperative oxygen consumption was significantly
      increased among patients receiving thiamine.

      Nevertheless, existing evidence suggests that thiamine supplementation might be an attractive
      strategy in counteracting organ dysfunction and thus morbidity and mortality in high-risk
      cardiac surgical patients.
