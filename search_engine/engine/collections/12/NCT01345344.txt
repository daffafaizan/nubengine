      processing during the anticipation and experience of acute pain in individuals with FM and
      healthy controls. Investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with FM as well as
      healthy controls. After the baseline visit, FM participants will be randomly assigned into
      the CBT or control condition (Education). Overall, FM Participants will attend 8 treatment
      visits, and 6 assessment visits (two at baseline, one at mid-treatment, two at the end of
      treatment, and one at 6 months post-treatment). These assessment visits include a total of 3
      fMRI sessions (at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment). Healthy Controls will
      undergo the same baseline procedures as the FM subjects but will not attend any of the
      treatment or follow up assessment visits. Findings from this research will provide important
      information about catastrophizing's CNS (Central Nervous System) correlates.
