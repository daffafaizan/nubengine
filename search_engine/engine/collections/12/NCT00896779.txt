      additional doses [re treatment as often as every 22 days] if the doctor determines that
      additional doses are required).

      In addition to study drug injections. Several eye examinations and procedures will be
      performed to evaluate response to treatment. These include: visual acuity testing (eye
      chart), contrast sensitivity testing, reading speed testing, measurement of time to complete
      typical daily activities, measurement of the thickness of the central retina, measurement of
      your central visual field.

      On the screening visit and two more times during the study fluorescein angiography will be

      exam,OCT,microperimetry,FA/Photos,VFQ,reading performance, contrast sensitivity and TIADL.
