      In a within subjects, randomized, cross-over design, 50 stable preterm infants born between
      30-36 weeks gestational age will be studied. Infants will be randomized to two interventions
      which will take place during two separate blood collections that are required for clinical
      management. For the standard care condition, infants will remain in their isolettes and will
      be positioned in prone and given a pacifier to suck on throughout the blood collection. For
      the feeding condition, infants will be held and then breast fed by their mother during the
      blood collection.
