      study in subjects with CUD. The study consisted of a 17-day screening period followed by a
      12-day baseline, a 98-day outpatient treatment period (14-day up-titration dose regimen
      followed by 84-day maintenance dose), and an End of Study evaluation visit approximately 14
      days after the last study drug administration. The total duration for each subject in the
      study was approximately 20 weeks including screening and baseline.
