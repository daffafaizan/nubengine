      week period. Dexamethasone 10 mg PO (or IV) will be given as premedication. On Days 1-5 of
      each treatment cycle, MRX34 will be given as a daily infusion followed by 16 days of rest. At
      screening a tumor biopsy sample will be required from all patients. Additional biopsies will
      be collected at Cycle 1 Day 3 and the end of Cycles 1 and 3 (Day 18 +/- 1 day)
