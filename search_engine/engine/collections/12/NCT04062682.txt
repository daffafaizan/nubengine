    
      This two arm randomized-controlled study includes the following groups: Controls and Healthy
      Diet group.

      The study will particularly address the following aspects:

        -  determine food literacy, perceived attitudes and barriers for the adoption of new
           dietary habits incorporating increased fruit and vegetable intake in adults.

        -  explore the effects of a randomized controlled intervention promoting healthy dietary
           patterns (increased intakes of fruit and vegetable, whole-grain, nuts and low fat dairy
           products and replacing saturated with unsaturated fats and decreased red meat and salt
           consumption) for a period of 4 months on components of the metabolic syndrome, a large
           panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and metabolomic profile in adults.

        -  assess the long-term adherence to healthy dietary patterns in adults.

        -  provide support for behavioural change and evaluate participants' perception of this
           support.
