    
      Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system which is
      accompanied by signs of autonomic imbalance (orthostatic hypotension, urinary problems and
      erectile dysfunction), Parkinson's symptoms (movement decreases and limb tremors) and
      cerebellar ataxia symptoms (grogginess and incorrect pronunciation). It shows signs similar
      to Parkinson's disease, however, it doesn't show improvement of symptoms by dopaminergic
      drugs and occurs at any age.

      The purpose is conducting follow-up surveillance for the incidence of adverse events and
      efficacy of subjects participated in phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CS10BR05) in subjects with Multiple
      System Atrophy until 60 months from administering investigational product (IP).

      Because it is the following observational study for subjects participated in phase 1 trial,
      there is no additional administration of the investigational product in the study.

      If the subjects who participated in phase 1 trial voluntarily consent in writing to take part
      in this observational study, the subjects visit the institution according to the protocol
      that designed the follow-up visits every 3 months (Visit 1, Visit 2) until 6 months from
      administration of investigational product and since then 6 months later (Visit 3), every 12
      months (Visit 4~7) to observe the incidence of adverse events and efficacy.

      As a result of evaluating severity of AE divided into subjective, objective in accordance
      with the CTCAE (Version 4.0) standards.
