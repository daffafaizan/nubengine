        -  Characterize the clinical, morphologic, immunologic, cytogenetic, and molecular
           heterogeneity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in infants
           and monoblastic variants of AML in young patients.

        -  Characterize the clinical, morphologic, immunologic, cytogenetic, and molecular
           heterogeneity of secondary AML in young patients.

        -  Compare secondary AML vs de novo AML at the level of Southern blot, breakpoint sequence,
           and DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Bone marrow or blood are collected and analyzed by Southern blot for chromosome 11q23
      breakpoints and translocations. Samples from patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia
      are also examined for MLL gene rearrangements.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.
