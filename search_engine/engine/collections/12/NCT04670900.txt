      treatment is therefore usually recommended. Tension band wiring (TBW) and plate fixation (PF)
      are the most common surgical treatment options. Both methods are associated with high
      complication and reoperation rates, especially in elderly patients. Only one randomized
      controlled trial has compared operative and non-operative treatment of olecranon fractures in
      the elderly, but the study was stopped prematurely due to high complication rates in the
      group treated operatively and remained underpowered for important outcome measures.A few
      small patient series with non-operatively treated fractures also exist and suggest that it
      may be a valid alternative to operative treatment
