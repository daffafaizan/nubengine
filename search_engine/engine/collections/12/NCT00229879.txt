    
      We excised an intrapericardial teratoma tumor out of a child approximately one month ago.

      This is a very uncommon tumor overall, and even more uncommon in children. The majority of
      reports in the literature are single case reports

      I would like to report ours, as well as do a literature review to combine all of the cases
      and see if some conclusions can be made about this rare tumor in children.
