      diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis Haemophilus influenzae vaccine manufactured by Aventis Pasteur)
      by IM injection in their right thigh at 8, 12, and 16 weeks; They will be randomized to
      receive either the candidate malaria vaccine, GSK 257049 vaccine (0.5 ml dose) or Engerix-B
      (a licensed hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by GSK Biologicals) by IM injection in their
      left thigh at 10, 14, 18 weeks. Infants will be followed-up daily for 7 days after each
      vaccine dose for evaluation of safety and reactogenicity. There will be a 14-day follow-up
      period after each dose of TETRActHib and after Dose 1 and Dose 2 of GSK 257049 vaccine or
      Engerix-B, and a one month follow-up period after Dose 3 of GSK 257049 vaccine or Engerix-B
      for reporting unsolicited symptoms. Serious adverse events will be recorded throughout the 14
      month study period. A small amount of blood (2 ml = 1/2 teaspoon) will be obtained at four
      different time points to measure the immune response elicited by the vaccines administered
      during this study period. Preliminary indication of vaccine efficacy in this age group will
      be established by actively monitoring for infection with Plasmodium falciparum.
