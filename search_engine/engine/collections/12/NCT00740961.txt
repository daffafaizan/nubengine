        -  Determine the correlation between the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) and the battery
           of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment tools among breast and colon cancer patients, 65
           years and older, in an outpatient setting.

        -  Assess and compare the abilities of the VES-13 and the battery of Comprehensive
           Geriatric Assessment tools to predict chemotherapy adherence among these patients.

        -  Examine the validity of the VES-13 screening tool to identify increased risk of death
           from all causes at one year after initial VES-13 screening in these patients.

        -  Examine the validity of the VES-13 screening tool to identify increased risk of
           functional decline at one year after initial VES-13 screening in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) and a Comprehensive
      Geriatric Assessment at baseline and 12 months later. Variables collected include
      sociodemographics; cognitive, nutritional, psychosocial, and emotional status; tumor
      characteristics; therapy; and mortality.

      Patients are followed for 1 year for chemotherapy adherence and survival.
