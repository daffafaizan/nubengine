      of levetiracetam for the treatment of childhood absence epilepsy. It consists of 1 phase. The
      treatment phase where the optimal medication dose will be defined. Absence seizures are often
      brief and subtle with no postictal manifestations. As a result, clinical observation alone is
      inadequate to assess the seizure Therefore, both subjective clinical response
      (parental/caregiver assessment) and EEG recordings are an important part of evaluation of
      treatment response. A 6 hour outpatient video-EEG study (including 3 minutes of
      hyperventilation), followed by an 18 hour ambulatory EEG recording - for total 24 hour EEG
      recording will be done before treatment and every 2 weeks after each dose plateau is reached
      )
