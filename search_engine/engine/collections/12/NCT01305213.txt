    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of bevacizumab
      and fosbretabulin tromethamine (CA4P) compared to bevacizumab alone in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of fosbretabulin tromethamine plus
      bevacizumab.

      II. To characterize and compare progression-free survival in patients with measurable disease
      (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) and patients with detectable
      (non-measurable) disease between regimens.

      III. To determine the overall survival for both regimens. IV. To estimate the proportion of
      patients with measurable disease who have objective tumor responses by treatment.

      V. To provide descriptive information about cancer antigen (CA)-125 responses by regimen and
      where possible by objective tumor responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and fosbretabulin tromethamine IV
      over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
