        -  to evaluate the concordance between left- and right-side measures: systolic pressure
           indices measured at the toe after a walking test (healthy volunteers)

        -  to evaluate the concordance between left- and right-side measures: systolic pressure
           indices measured at the ankle after a walking test (healthy volunteers)

        -  to evaluate the concordance of the variation in systolic pressure indices measured at
           the toe and ankle during the recuperation phase after a walking test (5 and 10 minutes
           after end of walking test) in healthy volunteers
