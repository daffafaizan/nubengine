      briefly explored. However, the causality of the relationship (i.e., do higher levels of SB
      cause changes in SWB, or vice-versa) has not been fully examined. Experimentally increasing
      SB and observing the potential subsequent effect on SWB, in otherwise non-sedentary
      individuals, may help to determine the causation between SB and SWB.

      An active sample of full-time university students attending Western University will be
      recruited. Upon obtaining consent, demographics will be taken. Baseline sedentary behavior
      levels will be confirmed objectively through inclinometer wear for 1-week. Upon confirmation
      of sufficient sedentary/non-sedentary time, participants will complete questionnaires
      assessing past-week: SWB, SB, physical activity, depression, and anxiety questionnaires.
      Participants will also be randomized to either a behavioral counseling intervention group, or
      a no-contact control group. Participants will then continue wearing the inclinometer for 1
      week. After the intervention week, participants will complete the questionnaires again, after
      which all participants will be told to continue daily behavior, and wear the inclinometer for
      another week. Upon completion of this follow-up week, participants will complete
      questionnaires again.
