      gaining informed consent, concentrations of high-sensitivity troponin on admission and on
      discharge are assessed. 6 months after discharged, the incidence of clinical endpoint
      (mortality of all cause and of cardiovascular cause, hospitalization) is assessed by
      telephone contact to the patient and/or the physician. The aim of the study is to investigate
      the prognostic value of high-sensitivity troponin concentration for predicting death and
      re-hospitalization.
