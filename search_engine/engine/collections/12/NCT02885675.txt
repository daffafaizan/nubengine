      cell(ARDS-VEC-miRNAs) and 2 biomarkers of scathing vascular endothelial.The ARDS-VEC-miRNAs
      include
      miR-15a-5p,miR-16-5p,miR-21-5p,miR-24-3p,miR-26a-5p,miR-27a-3p,miR-27b-3p,miR-126-3p,miR-150-
      5p,miR-146a-5p,miR-155-5p,miR-221-3p,miR-223-3p,miR-320a.The biomarkers of scathing vascular
      endothelial include vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1),von Willebrand factor(vWF).20
      healthy controls and 60 patients diagnose as ARDS in ICU were included in this study.we blood
      every participants within 24 hours after enrollment and obtain the plasma.Then, we detecte
      ARDS-VEC-miRNAs,VCAM-1,vWF levels in plasma by real-time quantitative PCR,record the severity
      of the illness and survival status within 28 days of every patients.Finally,we evaluate the
      correlation between the value of miRNA related to ARDS and vascular endothelial cell and ARDS
      severity, vascular endothelial cell damaging degreeï¼Œmortality in patients with ARDS.
