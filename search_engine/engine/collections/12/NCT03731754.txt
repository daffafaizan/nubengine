      in up to 25%ï½ž66% of patients,if the perineum does not heal primarily, the secondary wound
      healing may prolong hospital stay, may necessitate surgical reintervention, and often
      requires intensive wound care for several months. Great efforts have been taken to reduce the
      complications of perineal wound of APR, but the incidence of the perineal wound complications
      are not effectively decreased.

      It was reported that one of the most important factors to determine the primary healing of
      perineal wound is whether the anterior sacral drainage and perineal stump drainage are
      sufficient and effective or not, which is similar to the concept of closure of enterostomy.

      Previously, it was reported that "cross" closure is an effective method of skin closure for
      stoma reversal, which allows increased surgical exposure, reduces suture, smooth drainage,
      aesthetic healing simplifies wound care, and gives a neat cosmetic result.

      Therefore, because of the success use of "cross" closure in stoma reversal to reduce the
      complications of perineal wound, the investigator used the "cross" closure to reconstruct the
      perineal wound of APR, and it really can decrease the complications of perineal wound.
      However, more clinical trails are needed to confirm the conclusion.
