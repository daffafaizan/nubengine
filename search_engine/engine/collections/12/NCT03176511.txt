      of Balance (MOB) is one of the most commonly used community-based fall prevention
      interventions nationally, and is considered the 'fall prevention standard of care'. MOB
      programs are targeted to reduce the fear of falling and promote physical activity among all
      older community-dwelling adults. While evidence indicates that the MOB program leads to
      small, sustained decreases in older adults' perceived fear of falling, there is no evidence
      of objectively measured balance and gait. Despite its name, MOB focuses on cognitive
      restructuring to manage concerns about falling, and does not include a balance component.
      Among community-dwelling older adults, both intact balance and concomitant attention
      ("dual-tasking") are essential to prevent falls, and dual-task balance components are now
      requisite per evidence-based fall prevention intervention guidelines.
