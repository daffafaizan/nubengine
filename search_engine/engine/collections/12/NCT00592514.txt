      have been exposed to intraoperative oropharyngeal application with povidone-iodine 10%.
      Baseline serum and 24-hour urine iodine levels will be measured preoperatively. Serum iodine
      levels will be drawn at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month
      after exposure. A postoperative 24-hour urine iodine level will also be obtained. With the
      above measurements, the amount of iodine absorption as well as the time period of peak
      absorption and duration of elevated iodine levels will be elucidated.

      Thyroid hormone metabolism is highly dependent on serum levels of iodine. Thyroid function
      will be assessed by measuring serum levels of free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and
      thyroid stimulating hormone also at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and
      1 month after exposure. Measuring thyroid function is important since hypothyroidism has been
      known to have a major impact on postoperative wound healing.
