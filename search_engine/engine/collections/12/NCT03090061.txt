      evaluated by two diagnostic methods.

      Each examiner will record the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment
      method and the fluorescent-aided identification method. The visual-tactile assessment method
      includes the use of mirror, FDI probe under good illumination condition, while the
      fluorescent-aided identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence
      intraoral camera then the reliability of each diagnostic tool will be assessed.
