    
      This is a Phase 1b single-center, dose-escalating study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      effect of FeS in healthy volunteers and in subjects with stage 3-4 CKD. The following
      biomarkers will be used as surrogate measures of protective activity: Haptoglobin, Ferritin,
      Hemopexin, IL-10, and Heme Oxygenase-1. Additionally, the P21 biomarker will be monitored at
      various points of the study.

      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible to be enrolled into the
      study.

      The study is designed as follows:

        -  A screening period with baseline evaluations for study eligibility.

        -  If subjects meet eligibility criteria, they will receive FeS by IV infusion on study
           day1.

        -  Subjects will stay in the clinic for the initial 24 hours after administration of FeS
           and will be discharged at the end of Day 2 if no safety issues appear.

        -  The study will be dose-escalating in 3 groups of 6 subjects consisting of 3 healthy
           volunteers and 3 subjects with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease, evaluating doses of 120
           mg FeS, 240 mg FeS and 360 mg FeS.

        -  Subjects will be followed for 8 days after the dose of FeS. Response biomarkers will be
           assessed at baseline and 2,4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours after study drug
           administration.

        -  Total study duration will be 8 days for each subject, in addition to a screening period
           of up to 14 days.
