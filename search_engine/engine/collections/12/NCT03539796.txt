      1.3million of those births are via cesarean section (c-section). With this type of surgery,
      obstetric anesthesiology plays an important role. The main objective of this study will be to
      determine if the dural puncture epidural (DPE) provides superior analgesia and better patient
      satisfaction when compared to traditional epidurals for cesarean sections, and to also
      determine if patient satisfaction in the DPE group is comparable to that of the CSE
      technique.
