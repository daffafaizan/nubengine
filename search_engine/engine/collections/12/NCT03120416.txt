      endothelial function in general populations, but studies in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) are limited. The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a resistance exercise training program among individuals with CKD and its
      impact on endothelial and vascular function as measured by brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilation, pulse-wave velocity and carotid artery stiffness. To accomplish this goal the
      investigators propose to conduct a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial of twice a week
      resistance exercise training among 32 adults with CKD. The results of this study will inform
      the design and implementation of a larger trial evaluating the impact of resistance exercise
      training on adverse outcomes in patients with CKD including CKD progression.
