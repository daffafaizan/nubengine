      non-radiolabeled formulated drug product and will be reconstituted to become the finished
      radiopharmaceutical product Ga68-Dolacga Injection, a PET tracer specifically targeting to
      surface receptors of hepatocytes. The study aims to evaluate the safety of Ga68-Dolacga
      Injection in healthy volunteers and to assess the normal reference range and inter-individual
      variability of the Ga68-Dolacga Injection in estimating liver reserve in healthy volunteers.
