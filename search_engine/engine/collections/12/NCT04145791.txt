      additional form of pain control in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign
      gynecologic conditions through a randomized trial. The following aims will be pursued:

      Primary Aim: To determine if cryotherapy patients will have lower pain scores on VAS compared
      to standard pain management patients.

      Primary Hypothesis: Patients receiving cryotherapy will have lower VAS scores compared to
      patients receiving pain management.

      Secondary Aim 1: To determine if cryotherapy will reduce the number of morphine milligram
      equivalent (MME) compared to patients with standard pain management.

      Secondary Hypothesis 1: Patients receiving cryotherapy will have lower MME values compared to
      patients with standard pain management.

      Secondary Aim 2: To determine if cryotherapy will result in earlier return to baseline
      activity as measured by Quality of Recovery Questionnaire (QoR).

      Secondary Hypothesis 2: Patients receiving cryotherapy will return to baseline activity level
      sooner than those receiving standard pain management.

      Secondary Aim 3: To determine if cryotherapy will result in a faster time to discharge as
      determined by duration between admission to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and discharge
      home.

      Secondary Hypothesis 3: Patient receiving cryotherapy will be have a shorter stay in PACU.
