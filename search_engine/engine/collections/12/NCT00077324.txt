      Primary

        -  Determine, prospectively, whether serum proteomic profiling can predict the presence of
           primary non-small cell lung cancer in patients with clinically suspicious stage I lung
           lesions who are undergoing lung resection.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the serum proteomic profile with pathologic nodal status and histopathologic
           features of primary lung cancer in these patients.

        -  Correlate the initial and follow-up serum proteomic profile with overall and
           cancer-specific survival of these patients.

        -  Correlate changes in the proteomic profile (preoperative to postoperative) with overall
           and cancer-specific survival of these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  Determine whether novel molecular strategies can predict the presence of lung cancer
           and/or the biologic behavior of an individual cancer in these patients.
