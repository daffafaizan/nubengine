      and Be Fit." Participants will be asked to complete a chair-exercise program Monday through
      Friday. Each chair exercise session lasts approximately 30 minutes. Participants will receive
      a new DVD player, the exercise DVD, and the necessary exercise equipment to complete each
      session. The equipment includes a set of 1 pound hand weights, a 10" exercise ball, a small
      handball, a resistance band, an exercise log, and a satisfaction survey. Upon initial
      enrollment, both groups will receive a baseline health assessment that will include
      health-related quality of life, subjective well-being, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity,
      blood pressure, lower body extremity fitness, physical activity, and hand grip strength.
      Excluding health status, all other measures will be completed at post-assessment (the end of
      week 8 for Group A and Group B). The intervention group (Group A) will receive the equipment
      after completing eligibility screening, an informed consent, and health assessments. The
      waitlist control group (Group B) will receive the equipment at week 9 after the
      post-assessment. Group B will complete the program through week 16. The waitlist control
      group(Group B) will not receive an additional post assessment at the end of week 16.
