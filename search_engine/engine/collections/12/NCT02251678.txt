      Period. During the Screening Period subjects will sign informed consent and eligibility will
      be determined by reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria including history of plaque
      psoriasis. Demographics, medical history, medication history, height and weight will be
      recorded. A blood sample for pre-dose biomarker analysis will be collected. Subjects will
      take two Elimune capsules twice daily from Day 1 to Day 28. On Day 7 and Day 28 subjects will
      return to the site and provide a blood sample for biomarker analysis. Adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study. A Physician's Evaluation of
      Plaque Severity and Physician's Evaluation of Arthritis Severity will be performed on Day 1,
      Day 7, and Day 28.
