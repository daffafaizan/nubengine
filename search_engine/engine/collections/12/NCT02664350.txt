      Cancer Center in Gainesville, FL and in Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL. Each site will be
      responsible for overseeing patient care and research at their respective facility. This
      research will examine pain-related outcomes with CYP2D6-guided cancer pain management for
      study participants. In addition, the investigators will evaluate a prospective cohort study
      in the same population examining the effect of OPRM1 genetic variants on pain relief and
      adverse drug effects over time.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive CYP2D6 genotype-guided (n=50) or
      non-genotype-guided (traditional, n=50) selection of pain medication. Patients in the
      genotype arm will be genotyped at baseline for CYP2D6 variants. Participants will fill out
      the the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) and M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)
      questionnaires at baseline. Then, during the clinical visits the same questionnaires will be
      done during weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 or by telephone or electronic survey.
