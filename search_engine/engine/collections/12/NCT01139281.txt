      functions. The cisplatin (CDDP) is a potent antineoplastic agent used for the treatment of
      cancer in both adults and children although it has several side effects. Current opinion is
      that cisplatin ototoxicity occurs due to alterations in the antioxidant system of the outer
      hair cells (OHC) of the cochlea. The distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) has
      been showed to be a sensitive test for diagnosis of OHC injury and has been used for
      monitoring treatment with ototoxic drugs. Because of their antioxidant properties, the ginkgo
      biloba extract (GBE761) was evaluated in human beings as a possible ear protective against
      cisplatin induced hearing loss, using DPOAE test.
