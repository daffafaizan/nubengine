      randomized to either receive the standard post-surgical analgesic protocol (control group) or
      the standard post-surgical analgesic protocol plus scheduled ketorolac and surgical site ice
      packs. Usage of narcotic analgesics for breakthrough pain will be monitored and compared
      between cohorts. All care received by test subjects will be standard of care, with the only
      difference being the use of ice packs and scheduled ketorolac.
