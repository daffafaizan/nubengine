    
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the T2Lyme Panel on
      the T2Dx instrument. The assay will be compared to Borrelia culture from erythema migrans
      (EM) biopsy and/or detection of the C6 antigen in serum collected prospectively from patients
      suspected of early Lyme disease. The data from this study will be used to support a de novo
      application for the T2Lyme Panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product
      approval.

      The T2Lyme Panel is an investigational use in vitro diagnostic (IVD) designed to
      qualitatively detect and identify the major causative agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia
      burgdorferi, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, as well as an inclusive Borrelia spp.
      detection channel) from K2EDTA human whole blood samples.
