    
      This is a two-part, multi-center first in human study of ION251 in up to 80 participants.
      Part 1 will use a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme in sequential cohorts to determine the MTD and
      RP2D during repeated 28-day treatment cycles. MTD will be determined by the number of
      participants with AEs meeting the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria during Cycle 1. The
      MTD determined in Part 1 will be used with other variables to inform a RP2D for participants
      proceeding to Part 2 for further assessments in the safety, tolerability and anti-myeloma
      activity.
