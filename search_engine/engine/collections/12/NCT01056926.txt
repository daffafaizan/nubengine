      scanning at least 24 hours after each of the following conditions: 1) Nicotine Patch + Denic
      Smoking, 2) Placebo Patch + Denic Smoking, 3) Nicotine Patch + No Smoking, and 4) Placebo
      Patch+ No Smoking. During scanning, participants will complete a laboratory based measure of
      continuous working memory (n-back)-a measure of continuous working memory-and the
      cue-reactivity task (CR)-a measure of responses to smoking cues. Broadly, we hypothesize 1)
      abstinence from nicotine, regardless of smoking, will disrupt CWM performance and brain
      function, 2) abstinence from nicotine and denics will potentiate brain CR but differentially
      contribute to this effect and 3) that individual differences in smoking behavior and
      motivation will predict the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine factors on brain function.
