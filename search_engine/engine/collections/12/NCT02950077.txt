      stress, the use of a strategy such as mindfulness stress based reduction (MBSR) may similarly
      have a substantial impact as seen in other disease conditions. The proposed hypothesis is
      that undergoing MBSR has potential to benefit patients with autoimmune hepatitis in relation
      to decreased relapse rate and ultimately improved quality of life.

      The focus of this study is surrounding the possibility of psychosocial stress for relapse in
      AIH. The investigators, however, would like to also understand the role of serological
      testing at the time of these relapses and during states of psychosocial stress to demonstrate
      if the association can be found. During active disease activity or relapses of autoimmune
      hepatitis, there is an expected rise in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and immunoglobulin G
      (IgG) levels. Demonstrating the correlation of ALT and IgG with disease status and possible
      improvement with stress modifications is also key for this proposed study.
