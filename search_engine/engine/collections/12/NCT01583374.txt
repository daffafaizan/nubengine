      mg BID. The duration of the study was approximately 5 years. The double blind period (when
      patients nor the physician knew whether placebo or apremilast was taken) was 24 weeks. At
      Week 16, participants who did not have either a ≥ 20% improvement or a ≥ 1 unit improvement
      from baseline in at least two of the four SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)
      domains were entered in "early escape" from their current treatment in a double-blinded
      manner. However, such participants were permitted to continue in the study. At Week 24,
      participants may have entered a long-term extension phase for up to an additional 4.5 years
      (236 weeks). At "second escape" (at Week 24), apremilast 20 mg BID treated participants
      transitioned to receive double-blinded apremilast 30 mg BID and remained on double-blinded
      apremilast 30 mg BID because they continued to improve with a longer duration of treatment.
      After Week 24 and during the early portion of the long-term extension through Week 52, all
      participants continued on either double-blinded apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID treatment.
      After all participants had completed Week 52 or had terminated early from the study and the
      52-week data base was locked, apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID treatment was provided.
