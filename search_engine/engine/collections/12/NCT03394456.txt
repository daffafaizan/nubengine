      disproportionately higher prevalence and complication rates than other ethnicities. CHWs are
      a well-established and culturally sensitive means to bridge gaps in care to individuals with
      diabetes. However CHWs are often left unsupported, placing patients at risk of substandard
      care or harm. Telehealth is a term used to describe a range of technologies to support
      healthcare delivery via communication with the patient or a member of the healthcare delivery
      team. Though telehealth has been implemented into diabetes programs for many years, there is
      a paucity of data showing the use of telemedicine for CHW training and support.

      The primary study (n=89) compares clinical outcomes and treatment satisfaction of individuals
      who receive diabetes care in a 12-month telehealth supported, integrated CHW-led group visit
      program compared to those in usual care (wait list control). Group visits are 6-months and
      CHWs contact patients weekly to bimonthly (mobile health (mHealth)) for 12-months. This phase
      with have two cohort waves, separated by 6-months. The wait list control group for Cohort 2
      will explore telehealth, clinician-patient encounters. A secondary study (n=59) occurs at a
      new clinic and evaluates the ability to implement the program. In the first phase of the
      secondary study the research team will conduct a RCT of individuals randomized to the
      diabetes program (intervention) vs usual care (control) to assess clinic feasibility. The
      clinic team will observe this process and learn the project protocols during Phase 1. In the
      second phase, the clinic team will lead the group visits while the research team mentors them
      to conduct the project in-person at the group visits and via telehealth each week (ZOOM video
      conferencing).
