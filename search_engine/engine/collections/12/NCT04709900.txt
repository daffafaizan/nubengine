      The DYNAMITE trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised controlled, open-labelled trial
      conducted in the Capital Region of Copenhagen, Denmark

      The following hypothesis will be tested:

        -  First primary hypothesis: A treatment strategy guided by combined dynamic CT myocardial
           stress perfusion, FFR-CT and CT coronary angiography improves clinical outcome compared
           with a conventional management strategy in patients with chronic chest pain syndromes

        -  Second primary hypothesis: A treatment strategy guided by combined dynamic CT stress
           myocardial perfusion, FFR-CT and CT coronary angiography results in improved symptom
           relief compared with a conventional management strategy in patients with chronic chest
           pain syndromes
