      a recently licensed protease inhibitor for treatment of drug resistant HIV. Tipranavir
      affects the plasma concentration of some other drugs when they are used together with
      tipranavir. This study will examine whether the pharmacokinetics of apricitabine are changed
      when it is dosed together with tipranavir compared to apricitabine alone. Also, the
      pharmacokinetics of tipranavir will be examined at steady state when it is dosed alone and
      when it is dosed together with apricitabine. Information on the safety and tolerability of
      the two drugs when dosed together will also be obtained.
