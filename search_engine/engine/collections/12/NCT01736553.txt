      postnatal period. A longitudinal, natural history examination of physiological markers of
      muscle innervation will be performed in healthy and SMA infants. The first week of life is
      the ideal first time point, with visits occurring at scheduled visits up to the age two.
      Compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and electrical impedance myography (EIM)
      will be examined and will be correlated with motor function. Each of these is associated with
      muscle innervation and provides information on the number and function of lower motor neurons
      in the spinal cord, the cellular target of SMA therapeutic interventions. This trial will
      establish the natural history of these putative SMA biomarkers as the disease evolves in
      affected infants. Moreover, our approach will allow for measurements in pre-symptomatic and
      early symptomatic subjects and determine their predictive value.

      Aim 2. To establish the validity of putative molecular SMA biomarkers in the immediate
      postnatal period. Survival Motor Neuron (SMN2) copy number is a valid, predictive molecular
      SMA biomarker; however, it is fixed, and therefore not useful as a biomarker of clinical
      progression or response to therapy. SMN messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) ( and protein
      expression is variable in different cell types and, in mice, naturally decreases with age
      postnatally. In this study, SMN expression levels will be measured longitudinally in SMA
      patients and controls. Additional putative molecular SMA markers that have been identified to
      correlate with motor function will be determined in an effort to distinguish between
      predictive markers that change prior to development of weakness and those that change as a
      consequence of weakness.
