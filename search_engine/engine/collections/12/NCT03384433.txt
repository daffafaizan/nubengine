      remodeling and functional recovery after stroke. Animal study has shown that Exosome
      treatment markedly increased the number of newly formed doublecortin (a marker of
      neuroblasts) and von Willebrand factor (a marker of endothelial cells) cells. Based on
      previous literature, intravenous administration of MSC-generated exosomes post stroke
      improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis
      and represents a novel treatment for stroke. Also some studies have presented which
      miR-124-Loaded Exosomes ameliorate the brain Injury by promoting neurogenesis. So in present
      study we aim to assess improving patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MSC derived
      exosome
