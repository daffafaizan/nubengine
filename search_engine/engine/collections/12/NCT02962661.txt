    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered
      by intravenous infusion and transendocardial injection in patients with left ventricular (LV)
      dysfunction and heart failure secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion and
      transendocardial injection in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular
      ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%) and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on days 1, 14, 21, and 28
      and standard of care treatment for heart failure in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive hMSCs transendocardially for a total of 15 injections and standard
      of care treatment for heart failure in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive standard of care treatment for heart failure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
