      time a virus can be serologically detected, blood centers throughout the United States are
      implementing nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV and HCV. Early studies have shown that NAT
      testing can significantly narrow the infectious window, particularly for HCV. There is the
      potential that NAT testing could completely eradicate the transfusion risk of HIV and HCV.
      The test is thus likely to add substantially to the safety of blood transfusions and,
      although not licensed, has been implemented by all blood suppliers and transfusion services
      in the United States. NAT testing is currently being used under an IND mechanism. The IND
      stipulates that blood donors need to be informed through a supplemental information packet
      that such testing is being performed and that if found positive they may be recalled for
      additional testing. At the time of recall, an IRB approved study-specific informed consent is
      administered and additional tests are performed to verify the initial NAT result. The
      Department of Transfusion medicine is participating in this national validation of NAT
      testing and will provide donor samples for centralized testing and statistical reporting to
      FDA. The potential benefits of this testing for blood safety are great and the risk to donors
      is considered minimal. Not seeking subjects for enrollment.
