    
      VX-770, a compound being developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex) for the
      treatment of CF, is an orally bioavailable small molecule that targets the underlying defect
      in CF, the dysfunctional CFTR protein. In Phase 3 studies of VX-770 in patients with CF and a
      G551D CFTR mutation, improvements in CFTR function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride
      concentration) and improvements in lung function were observed.

      Patients who are interested in the VX-770 Expanded Access should contact their CF physician
      about participation.

      Physicians interested in participating as a site should contact 800-745-4484.
