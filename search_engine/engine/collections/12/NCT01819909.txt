      shoulder pain. The patient uses the trapezius musculature to superiorly elevate the upper
      extremity instead of using the deltoid and the rotator cuff for upper extremity elevation.
      Scapulothoracic substitution does not occur in healthy shoulders. Excessive scapular movement
      can be due to an attempt to substitute for poorly functioning shoulder musculature or
      tightness of the capsular structures of the glenohumeral joint.

      Pulleys have been used in postoperative shoulder rehabilitation to improve passive as well as
      active range of motion and develop strength. Jackins described a series of exercises that are
      used to improve active range of motion and develop strength without the use of pulleys. The
      use of pulleys in the post-operative care for patients who have had shoulder surgery is
      thought to contribute to excessive scapular motion. To date, there has not been any study
      that compares the use of pulleys and Jackins' exercises with respect to active range of
      motion, scapulothoracic substitution, and objective patient outcomes measures. Due to the
      lack of level 1 or 2 evidence postoperative rehabilitation studies, a prospective randomized
      study should be performed on patients that have underwent rotator cuff repair.
