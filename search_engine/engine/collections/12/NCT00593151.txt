      pharmacokinetics, and viral kinetics over four weeks of two doses of Locteron™ (230 ug and
      640 ug) given every two weeks in comparison with PegIntron® given weekly in
      treatment-experienced subjects with chronic hepatitis C of any genotype who were
      co-administered weight-based oral ribavirin. The two cohorts of 16 subjects each in Panels A
      and B consisted of subjects who had failed prior interferon therapy. In Panel A, 8 subjects
      were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 320 μg Locteron™ and 8 subjects
      were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 1.5 ug/kg PegIntron®. In Panel B,
      8 subjects were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 640 μg Locteron™ and 8
      subjects were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 1.5 ug/kg PegIntron®.
      When the results of Panel A and Panel B were known, conduct of Panel C for 12 weeks in
      treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype-1 HCV was considered unnecessary and
      cancelled, and an entirely new study was begun instead.
