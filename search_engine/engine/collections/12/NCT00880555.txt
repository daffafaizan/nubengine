      Dementia is considered to be present when a person can no longer handle complex activities of
      daily living, such as managing finances. This study will investigate the relationship between
      changes in the ability to manage finances and brain perfusion, which will be measured using
      continuous arterial spin-labeling (an experimental MRI). Subjects will also undergo
      neuropsychological tests focusing on several types of memory and thought process, with
      special emphasis on semantic memory. An important question to be addressed is whether changes
      in function are better predicted by the neuropsychological tests or by the brain scan.
      Participants will undergo a single MRI scan, baseline financial capacity instrument (FCI) and
      cognitive evaluation, and then will be followed approximately annually to repeat the
      functional and cognitive assessments. Linear mixed effects models will be used to fit a model
      predicting financial capacity based on baseline cognitive tests. Measures from the MRI scan
      will be added to the model to determine whether imaging improves the predictions.
