      place between Days -28 and -3. Subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -2, and discharged
      on Day 16. They return for an End of Study Visit (ESV) between 7 and 14 days after (early)
      discharge.

      Part 1 evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      ASP3652 following ascending multiple oral doses. The initially planned four dose levels or
      matching placebo are given to four separate groups. Thereafter two additional dosage levels
      are further investigated. All groups receive a single dose of ASP3652 administered in the
      morning of Day 1 and Day 14, and twice-daily doses administered from Day 2 to Day 13 under
      fasted conditions, except the last group which receives all dosages once daily from Day 1 to
      Day 14.

      Part 2 evaluates the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of ASP3652 following ascending multiple
      oral doses in healthy elderly male and female subjects. This part contains a single,
      placebo-controlled group. All subjects receive twice daily doses and administration is based
      on the results of Part 1.

      All subjects in both parts receive training for Neurocognitive Test Battery (NTB) and tests
      for monitoring of psychotropic effects.
