      study of NS-065/NCNP-01 administered by infusion once weekly for 24 weeks to ambulant boys
      ages 4-<10 years with DMD. Two dose level cohorts will be enrolled. Period 1 of this study
      will be conducted in a double-blind fashion. Randomized patients will receive weekly IV
      infusions of NS-065/NCNP-01 or placebo for the first 4 weeks of their participation (Period
      1) and NS-065/NCNP-01 by IV infusion for weeks 5-24 (20 weeks of active treatment - Period
      2). Analysis of safety data from Period 1 of the 40mg/kg dose cohort will be completed prior
      to enrolling patients in the 80mg/kg dose cohort.

      Patients completing the 24-week study will be eligible for an open-label extension study.

      Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional
      tests such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT), time to stand (TTSTAND), time to run/walk 10
      meters (TTRW), time to climb 4 stairs (TTCLIMB) and quantitative muscle testing (QMT). All
      patients will undergo a muscle biopsy of the bicep at baseline and a second muscle biopsy at
      Week 24.

      Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), blood and urine
      laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and physical examinations
      throughout the study.

      Serial blood samples will be taken at four of the study visits to assess the pharmacokinetics
      of the study drug.
