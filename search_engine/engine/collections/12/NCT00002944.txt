        -  Compare the event free survival as a result of treatment with carboplatin and
           vincristine versus thioguanine, procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine in children
           with progressive brain tumors.

        -  Estimate tumor response rates to each regimen of chemotherapy in these patients.

        -  Determine toxic effects and quality of life of children treated with each regimen of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Investigate biological and clinical factors which may predict tumor response and early
           progression (tumor size, location, pathologic subtype, cytogenetics, and proliferative
           index by MIB-1 (Ki67)) in these patients.

        -  Investigate factors contributing to neuropsychological and endocrine status of children
           with brain tumors treated without irradiation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to site of disease,
      status at entry, and pathology. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Patients with neurofibromatosis are nonrandomly assigned to arm II.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive induction with carboplatin and vincristine for 10 weeks followed
           by 2 weeks of rest. Induction is followed by 8 courses of maintenance beginning on day
           84 of induction or upon hematopoietic recovery. Each course consists of 4 weekly doses
           of carboplatin and 3 weekly doses of vincristine (given concurrently with the first 3
           weeks of carboplatin), followed by 2 weeks of rest.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral thioguanine, procarbazine, and lomustine on days 0-4,
           followed by vincristine IV on days 14 and 28. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a
           maximum of 8 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280-340 patients will be accrued over 4 years.
