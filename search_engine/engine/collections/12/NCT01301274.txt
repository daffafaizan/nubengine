      water. Since the original descriptions by Holliday and Segar, the recommended standard
      maintenance solutions are based on "physiological needs", containing 30-50 mEq/L of sodium.

      However hyponatremia has become increasingly recognized in hospitalized children suggesting
      that Holliday and Segar's recommendations are frequently inappropriately applied.

      It has been described augmented intersticial lung water in patients receiving hypotonic
      maintenance solutions. Also, hyponatremia has been demonstrated in post-surgery critically
      ill children receiving hypotonic maintenance solutions.

      More over, non-physiologic antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion has been described in the
      great majority of hospitalized children due to nausea, stress, pain, and/or surgical
      interventions.

      It has been suggested that isotonic 0.9% NaCl/dextrose 5% should be the standard maintenance
      intravenous (IV) solution, to avoid the development of hyponatremia.

      There are not studies in critically ill children evaluating the effect of isotonic solutions
      on sodium levels.
