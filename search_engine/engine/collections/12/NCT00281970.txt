    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy and safety of a new dosing schedule and dosing level of docetaxel
           and cisplatin with the chemotherapy regimens used in the International Adjuvant Lung
           Cancer Trial (IALT) in patients with completely resected stage IA-IIIB non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Explore the relationship of time to recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall
           survival of these patients with levels of circulating DNA and proteomic analysis of
           serum.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 8
      hours on day 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
