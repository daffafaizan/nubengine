      1. Use non-invasive cardiac electric imaging to provide information as to the sites of origin
      of arrhythmias and sequence of cardiac activation and repolarization.

      Methods and Procedures Approximately 8 patients with recorded Premature Ventricular
      Contractions (PVC), Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) or other ventricular tachycardia cases which
      need Ensite/Carto endocardial mapping and radiofrequency ablation treatment will be enrolled.

      One day before catheterization and ablation, patients will undergo approximately 30 minutes
      of Body Surface Potential Mapping (BSPM) recordings with about 200 surface electrodes
      arranged in 20 strips, attached on his/her front and back. BSPMs will be recorded in the
      baseline resting rhythm.

      On the day of ablation, before catheterization in the surgical room, the BSPM recording
      procedure will be carried out with the patient using the same technique used during the first
      BSPM study.

      Clinical endocardial mapping data may also be obtained concurrently with BSPM recordings
      before the ablation procedure.

      Another BSPM recording will be made 30-60 minutes after successful ablation with the patient
      still in normal sinus rhythm if possible. Patients will be followed up 1 month after ablation
      with the same method of BSPM recorded at the baseline resting rhythm.
