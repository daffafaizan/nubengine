      blood sample from an arterial catheter and analyse the sample using a point of care blood gas
      analyser. This technique has several disadvantages as causes considerable blood loss and does
      not produce a continuous blood glucose profile and it is labour intensive (multiple samples
      over time are needed to follow the changes in blood glucose concentration). The monitoring
      system (Continuous GlucoseMonitor) based on the microdialysis technique has the advantage
      that not blood, but a physiological fluid such as saline is used as test medium. In brief, a
      physiological fluid, called the perfusate is continuously perfused through the microdialysis
      probe. At the membrane of the probe, glucose (as other low-molecular weight molecules)
      diffuses from the surrounding sample into the perfusate, now called dialysate, and is
      transported outside the probe for ex vivo monitoring.
