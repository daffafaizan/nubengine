    
      1. Study design: An open-Label, randomized, 2-sequence, 4-period, fasting condition,
           single-dose, per oral, cross-over study

        2. Administration method:

           The subject should maintain a minimum of 10 hours of empty stomach before
           administration, and give an oral dose of 1 tablets (Dong-A Atorvastatin 80mg or Lipitor
           80mg) with 150 mL of water at around 8 a.m. on the day of the test. The subject should
           not chew or break the drug, but should swallow in whole with water. The difference in
           administration time between the test subjects is about one minute apart, considering the
           blood collection time.

        3. Wash out period: at least 7 days

        4. Blood collection time: Before the administration, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.33, 1.67,
           2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 hr after the administration (total 16 times)

        5. Analysis: Measurement of the concentration of an unchangeable substance of Atorvastatin
           in plasma
