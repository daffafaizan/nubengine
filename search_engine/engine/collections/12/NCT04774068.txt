      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of parsaclisib in combination with
      romidepsin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of parsaclisib in combination with romidepsin
      in patients with relapsed/refractory primary cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma / mature
      T-cell and NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (CTCL/PTCL).

      II. To determine the duration of response (DOR) to treatment. III. Disease control rate
      (DCR). IV. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of
      parsaclisib in combination with romidepsin in patients with relapsed/refractory CTCL/PTCL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of parsaclisib in the Induction Phase and fixed-dose
      in the Maintenance phase, and fixed-dose romidepsin in all Phases.

      PRE-PHASE: Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1,8, and 15 and
      parsaclisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      parsaclisib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 2 years.
