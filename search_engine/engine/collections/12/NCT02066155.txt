      sustainable approaches to provide ongoing DSMS in the context of the communities in which
      people live. In the African American community, the church plays a central role in community
      life and can serve as a powerful channel to deliver health promotion programs. Churches in
      the community are thus ideal venues to intervene to help people with diabetes achieve their
      self-management related goals. The objective of this proposal is to examine the relative
      effectiveness of three approaches to address DSMS compared to enhanced usual care within the
      context of the church-based setting. To accomplish this objective, a cluster randomized,
      modified stepped wedge, practical behavioral trial with three parallel DSMS approaches will
      be implemented. Twenty-one African American churches (23 African American participants per
      church) in metro-Detroit will be randomized to one of three DSMS approaches. Fourteen parish
      nurses who are volunteers at the churches, and 21 peer leaders will be trained to deliver
      DSMS. Measures will be collected at baseline, 6, 9, 15 and 27-month follow-up. The primary
      outcome will be changes in A1c at 9, 15 and 27-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include
      changes in weight, blood pressure, quality of life, and diabetes related distress at 9,15 and
      27-month follow-up. We hypothesize that 1) participants in both Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer
      Leader DSMS will have improved outcomes over enhanced usual care, and that 2) participants in
      Parish Nurse + Peer Leader DSMS will sustain improvements in outcomes achieved following DSME
      at significantly higher levels than participants in Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS
