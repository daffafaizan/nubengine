      metabolism, intracranial pressure, cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate, venous return)
      and respiratory system are known.It is thought that pneumoperitoneum causes hemodynamic
      changes in the body by increasing blood catecholamine, vasopressin and norepinephrine
      levels.Sensitivity to these hemodynamic changes has been shown to be higher rate in patients
      with advanced age, morbid obesity, and increased intracranial pressure, and it is emphasized
      in studies that more attention should be paid to pneumoperitoneum pressures used in
      laparoscopic procedures with these groups.

      In laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery, pneumoperitoneum pressures used for surgical field
      visualization may differ.As a consequences, these different pressures have different
      haemodynamic and intracranial effects.Studies have shown that high intraabdominal pressure
      values cause more hemodynamic fluctuations than low intraabdominal pressure values.Systemic
      side effects have been shown to be lower in operations with low pneumoperitoneum pressure; In
      relation to the concept of multiple compartment syndrome, it is thought that the
      relationships between intraabdominal, intrathoracic and intracranial compartments, and
      changes in one compartment may affect other compartments and cause negative physiological and
      hemodynamic results.

      There are studies in the literature on the hemodynamic effects of different pneumoperitoneum
      pressures.In our literature searches, we could not find any study comparing the effects of
      hemodynamic changes caused by two different pneumoperitoneum pressures, which can be
      classified as low and high, on cerebral oxygenation.We aimed to contribute to the literature
      by investigating the effects of different pneumoperitoneum pressure ranges on brain
      oxygenation.
