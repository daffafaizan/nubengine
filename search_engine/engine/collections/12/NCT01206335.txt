      advanced cancers like loss of appetite, decreased strength, fatigue, and change in mood. This
      Phase II, open label study with OHR/AVR118 will enable the Sponsor to gather data on safety
      and efficacy of OHR/AVR118 in the patient population with anorexia-cachexia. Patients aged
      18-85 with advanced cancers (excluding central nervous system [CNS] cancers) who may or may
      not be receiving chemotherapy, may be eligible to participate. The study drug, 4.0 mL, will
      be given subcutaneously each day for 28 days. Patients who respond to the trial period dosing
      will be eligible to continue on OHR/AVR118 if they and their physicians believe it would be
      beneficial, and if no safety concerns are raised.
