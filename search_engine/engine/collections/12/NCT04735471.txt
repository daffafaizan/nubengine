    
      ADI-001 is an investigational immunotherapy composed of allogeneic gamma delta T cells that
      is being evaluated as a potential treatment for patients diagnosed with B cell malignancies
      who have relapsed or are refractory to at least two prior regimens. This first-in-human study
      will assess the safety and tolerability of ADI-001 and is designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal dose. Patients will be administered a single infusion of
      ADI-001 cells. A combination of ADI-001 and interleukin (IL)-2 may also be evaluated after
      the MTD or optimal dose has been determined for the single agent.

      The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADI-001.
