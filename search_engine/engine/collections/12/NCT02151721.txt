    
      -  A cohort of three patients will be treated at each dose level for one cycle (28 days per
           cycle).

        -  Treatment will be continued if no DLTs are recorded, and three patients will be treated
           at the next higher dose level.

        -  If a patient of the cohort develops a DLT, however, another cohort of three patients
           will be treated for 1 cycle.

        -  If more DLTs do not develop, dose escalation continues.

        -  If more than one of three patients develop a DLT at any dose level, another cohort of
           three patients will be treated at the next lower dose level.

        -  If no DLTs are recorded in any of the cohorts, the number of patients per cohort will be
           increased from 3 to 6.

        -  Up to 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD.

        -  Therefore, the phase II dose for this combined therapy will be defined as the highest
           dose level at which six patients were treated and less than three DLTs developed.
