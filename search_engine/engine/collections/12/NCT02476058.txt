      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither the
      researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving) and
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study. This
      study will consist of an eligibility screening examination (between 28 days and 1 day prior
      to the first dose administration), a parallel group treatment phase of 10 days or 4 weeks,
      and a follow-up period of 2 weeks including 2 follow-up visits. The duration of study will be
      12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either JNJ-42847922,
      Diphenhydramine or Placebo. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
