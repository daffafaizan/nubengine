      mellitus, beyond measurement of (fasting) blood serum or plasma glucose levels, include
      extent of hemoglobin A1c glycation, concentration of fructosamines, insulin concentrations to
      calculate the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and other clinically putative
      biomarkers of glucose homoeostasis. HbA1c levels form now part of routine elucidation of
      metabolic disorders and are used for therapy monitoring. Initially used to monitor glucose
      levels in follow-up care of diabetics it is considered as a track marker of ups and downs of
      blood glucose concentrations. Its behavior under the 2 h period of oral glucose tolerance
      tests (OGTT) is ill known - most clinicians believe the glycation extent will not change.
      Since the dynamics of glycation is temperature dependent,non-febrile patients under OGTT
      likely keep their glycation extent between time zero and 120 min after glucose charge
      constant but this has not been investigated and with the sensitive lab assays for HbA1c now
      in use we postulate a significant increase in glycation. The Patient Registry includes
      recruited children and adults sick from diabetes, overweight or metabolic syndrome as a
      whole. Three medical offices will address their patients to the VidyMed lab to perform the
      OGTT framed by lab assays on venous blood samples
