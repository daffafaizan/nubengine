      (CE-BMRI) as per usual clinical practice within 30 days of breast cancer diagnosis. Up to 8
      weeks after the CE-BMRI exam, subjects will undergo a Dual Energy Contrast Enhanced Digital
      Mammograph (DE-CEDM). Maximum lesion size was compared between the two imaging types. Subject
      data from both scans was planned to be included in a multi-reader evaluation; however, due to
      premature stop of the study, multi-reader data was not collected.
