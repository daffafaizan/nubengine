        -  Determine the efficacy of docetaxel and ifosfamide as first-line chemotherapy in women
           with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure and survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour (beginning 1
      hour after docetaxel infusion) on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every month during study, and then every 3 months
      after completion of study.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
