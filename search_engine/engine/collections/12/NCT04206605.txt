    
      This study consists of non-histaminergic normal C1-INH angioedema population with 12 years of
      age and above. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated SC administrations of
      lanadelumab or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Randomization will be stratified based on
      baseline angioedema attack rate (1 to less than (<) 2 attacks/4 weeks, and greater than (>=)
      2 attacks/4 weeks), as well as subtype (known mutations, family history and unknown mutation,
      idiopathic).
