      benefits are not supported by well-controlled clinical trials. Prior studies have not
      addressed whether prayer itself or knowledge/certainty that prayer is being provided may
      influence outcome. We evaluated whether (1) receiving intercessory prayer or (2) being
      certain of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with uncomplicated recovery after
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
