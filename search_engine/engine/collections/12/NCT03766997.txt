      unknown etiology.Clinical presentation of IGM can be variable. Some findings may be confused
      with breast malignancy.

      Although IGM as a disease has been known for nearly four decades, no treatment consensus has
      been reached because of its rarity. Surgical treatment, antibiotics, oral steroids, topical
      steroids, immunosuppression (methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) and close follow up have
      all been reported to be effective.

      Currently,surgical treatment and systemic steroids treatment are most frequently employed.
      With the consideration of side effects of long term systemic (oral) steroid usage, topical
      steroids without systemic use were assessed and showed satisfactory curative effect. But
      there is no data concerning the use of local injection of steroids therapy on IGM.The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of steroids local injection on the basis of
      topical steroids for IGM treatment.
