    
      Design Multicentric randomized controlled simple blinded trial comparing the clamp crushing
      technique vs. the ultrasonic dissector. The trial will last 24 months with 21 month-inclusion
      time.

      Patients Patients will be enrolled in 5 university hospitals in Ile de France. Eligibility
      criteria include adults with Child A liver cirrhosis undergoing partial hepatectomy (≥ 1
      liver segment). Exclusion criteria include non cirrhotic patients, Child B or C cirrhosis,
      portal hypertension and laparoscopic hepatectomy.

      Sample size calculation was performed with the expectation of a 250 ml (one red cells pack)
      difference in blood loss during parenchyma transection with a level of statistical
      significance of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. These calculations indicated to include at least 60
      patients in each group.

      Secondary endpoints include blood loss standardized to the transection area (ml/cm²), free
      margins around the tumor, postoperative liver ischemia-reperfusion injury and postoperative
      complications.

      Course of the study An informed consent will be obtained from each patient prior to surgery.
      Each patient will be randomized the day prior to surgery. As usual, each patient will be
      followed daily until he will discharge (10 days) and for 2 months at the postoperative
      outcome patient clinic, which will end the study period for the patient.
