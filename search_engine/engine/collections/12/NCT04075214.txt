      brains regions associated with opioid use disorder and reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms.
      This is a double blind, randomized, controlled, multi-center study in which subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: 1) active transcutaneous auricular
      neurostimulation (tAN) or 2) delayed-active tAN to determine reduction of symptoms related to
      opioid withdrawal. Subjects in the active tAN group will receive tAN immediately whereas
      those in the delayed-active tAN will have their therapy turned on after a 30 minute delay
      (inactive period). All subjects will be informed of their group assignment at the conclusion
      of the randomized, double blind period (following initial 30 minutes of active or inactive
      therapy) and all will continue to receive active tAN throughout the five-day study. Each
      clinical site will have pre-determined and qualified clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS)
      accessor(s) that will be blind to the subjects group designation during the randomized,
      double blind period and will not be informed that all subjects receive active therapy
      throughout the remainder of the study. This will ensure a non-biased assessment of the COWS
      score and maintain single blinding throughout the duration of the study.
