      transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement to compare recovery of respiration under constant
      Transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement( ptcCO2) with continuous high frequency jet
      ventilation HFJV (study method) with recovery of respiration during rising and apnea (current
      standard).

      The investigators hypothesize that the prolonged abdominal expiration that we observed during
      recovery of breathing in prior studies will be unaffected by arterial carbon dioxide (CO2)
      levels.
