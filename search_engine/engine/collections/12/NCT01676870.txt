      that a 16-week program, with one year follow up of vigorously exercise defined from today's
      guidelines (performed as 4-AIT (4x4min aerobe interval training)) yields larger beneficial
      effects in reducing risk factors constituting the metabolic syndrome than continuously
      moderate intensity exercise (CME) defined from today's guidelines.

      Furthermore, the importance of the amount of aerobic interval training remains unclear and it
      is unknown how little "one can get away with" and still obtain substantial beneficial
      cardiovascular effects. Therefore, the investigators will also determine whether one bout of
      aerobe interval training (AIT) - 1-AIT = 1x4min aerobe interval training, can give beneficial
      effects compared to 4-AIT and CME.

      Evaluation criteria are risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome, aerobic capacity
      measured as peak oxygen uptake and compliance to intervention. Assessments will be made
      before and after the 16-week program, and at six month, and 1 and 3 years follow-up.
      According to estimates based on data from previously studies, 3, 4 a total number of 465
      patients randomized 1:1:1 to the three interventions gives 80% power to detect an effect of
      4-AIT compared to 1-AIT/CME of 51% recovery versus 37% recovery from metabolic syndrome at
      the 5% significance level.
