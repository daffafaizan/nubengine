      the population continuing to smoke. However, smoking is concentrated in disadvantaged
      populations where the prevalence of smoking may be as high as 70-80 %. Participants will
      receive a sampling experience (use of nicotine lozenges or NicoBloc during sessions) with
      counseling focused around their experience of using these interventions, including side
      effects and smoking cessation expectancies.
