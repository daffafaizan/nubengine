      the activation, proliferation, adhesion and maturity of vascular endothelial cells, which may
      also become the targets of vascular inhibitors. At present, Avastin, an anti-angiogenesis
      drug, has been marketed in Euopean and American countries, and another 30 kinds of vascular
      inhibitors are still in trails. Endostatin has been widely applied for the clinical treatment
      of partial primary and metastatic solid tumors. Endostatin combined with chemotherapy has
      achieved favorable progression in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      However, the research about the efficacy of Endostatin on breast cancer has just started.
      Breast cancer is a highly-differentiated solid tumor, indicating that it is also an indicator
      for Endostatin therapy. Additionally, after chemo- and radiotherapy, the primary nidi of
      patients with advanced breast cancer may also lead to rapid development of tumors in other
      locations. So Endostatin combined with chemotherapy can also improve the prognosis of
      patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer, but there is rare any report at home and
      abroad. To further explore the above research, this study designed a randomized, opened and
      controlled clinical study to observe the clinical efficacy of EndostarTM Injection combined
      with GP/NP/GX/NX in the treatment of recurrent metastatic breast cancer.
