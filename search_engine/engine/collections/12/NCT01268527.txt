    
      This is a single center, randomized, blinded, intra-individual comparison in two sequential
      cohorts of 15 subjects each (30 subjects in total) in an outpatient setting, in which each
      subject simultaneously receives five topical treatments (3 active, 1 vehicle, and 1 positive
      control) within one or two psoriatic plaques. Treatments consisted of 3 concentrations of
      E6201 gel, a negative control (gel vehicle), and a positive control (0.005% calcipotriene
      cream). The different concentrations of E6201 gel and vehicle control were double-blinded,
      while the calciprotriene cream was single-blinded. Cohort 2 participants were not dosed until
      all participants in Cohort 1 completed treatment and safety data were collected and
      evaluated.
