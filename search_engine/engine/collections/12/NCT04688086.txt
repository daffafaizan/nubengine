      women with dense breast tissue, who have a four fold high risk for developing breast cancer.
      Thermalytix is a novel automated breast cancer screening solution that uses artificial
      intelligence (AI) over thermal images to detect and localise breast cancer lesions in women.
      In this study the performance of Thermalytix over mammography is evaluated in women with
      dense and non-dense breast tissue who presented for a health check-up at a hospital. All
      women underwent Thermalytix and mammography, and participants who were reported as positive
      on either test were recommended for further investigations. Sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated across age-groups,
      menopausal status, and breast densities against the current standard-of-care diagnostic
      modalities.
