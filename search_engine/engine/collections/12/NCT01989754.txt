      receiving standard of care for hyperglycemia and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, who have
      either a history of a prior CV event or 2 or more risk factors for a CV event. Participants
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or matching placebo to be taken
      once daily. Canagliflozin will be provided at a dose of 100 mg/day through Week 13 and then
      increased at the discretion of the investigator to a dose of 300 mg/day, if the participant
      requires additional glycemic control and is tolerating the 100 mg dose.

      The study consists of a 2-week screening period and a double-blind treatment period lasting
      between 78 and 156 weeks; study completion is targeted for when the last subject randomized
      has approximately 78 weeks of follow-up or when 688 major adverse cardiovascular events are
      accumulated between CANVAS and CANVAS-R. A total of 5,700 participants are targeted to be
      recruited into the study. Participants can be either drug na√Øve to antihyperglycemic agents,
      using monotherapy, or using combination of antihyperglycemic therapy for the control of blood
      glucose levels.

      The completion target was reached in February 2017.
