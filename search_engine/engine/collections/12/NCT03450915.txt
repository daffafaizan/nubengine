      approximately 12,460 participants over two years. Participants will be immunized twice with
      the M-001 influenza vaccine candidate or placebo. Influenza incidence and illness severity
      will be evaluated throughout the follow-up period of up to two years. Participants will be 50
      years and older, with at least half over 65 years of age.

      The trial is expected to take place in eastern European countries and begin prior to the
      2018/19 Northern Hemisphere flu season.
