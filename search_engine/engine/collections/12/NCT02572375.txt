      two-treatment, two-period crossover design. During the course of the study, thirty eight (38)
      healthy adult volunteers will receive multiple doses of Codeine Phosphate/ Guaifenesin
      extended-release tablet 30 mg/600 mg and multiple doses of an IR Codeine Phosphate/
      Guaifenesin immediate-release tablet 20 mg/400 mg tablet in two separate treatment periods.

      Volunteers will enter the clinic the day prior [approximately 12 hours] to each dosing and
      will be confined in the clinic for 7 nights for each treatment period. The extended release
      tablet (test) will be administered as two tablets two times a day, 12 hours apart, and the
      immediate release tablet (reference) will be administered as one tablet six times a day, 4
      hours apart. Pre-dose blood samples will be collected prior to morning dose on Days 1, 2, 3,
      4, 5, 6 and 7. On Day 7, Two extended release tablets will be given once in the morning and
      the immediate release tablet will be given three times, in the morning and 4 and 8 hours
      later. Serial blood samples will be collected on Day 7 for up to 12 hours post morning dose.

      On Day 7 volunteers will be released from the study site after the 12-hour blood collection
      if clinically appropriate and will return to the study site to start the next treatment after
      a minimum of 7 days of wash-out period, which begins the morning after the last dose taken of
      the previous Period.
