      gastrointestinal disorder. While IBS has no direct mortality, it does compromise quality of
      life, incurs morbidity, and has a substantial economic impact on society. The gut microbiome
      may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IBS. Even though the exact mechanisms
      underlying this relationship have not been presented, it is suggested that certain
      microorganisms may increase gut permeability, activate the mucosal immune response, increase
      visceral sensitivity and alter intestinal motility via a bidirectional brain-gut interaction.
      Recent studies suggest that the salutary impact of the Mediterranean diet may be due to its
      effects on the composition of the gut microbiome. In a recent cohort study in Italy, subjects
      who adhered most closely to a classical Mediterranean diet had more favorable bacterial
      enterotypes (e.g., Prevotella) in their stool, as well as higher levels of short-chain fatty
      acids - which are essential for colonic function. Studies have also showed that diet alters
      the predominant microbiome enterotypes and that microbiome composition can change quickly,
      within 24 hours, after a dietary intervention. Therefore, consumption of a Mediterranean diet
      may ameliorate the gut dysbiosis associated with IBS-D.
