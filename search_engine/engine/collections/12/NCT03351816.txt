    
      This is a prospective, observational, multicentre study of patients with paroxystic or
      persistent atrial fibrillation scheduled to undergo cardioversion or ablation of AF in
      routine practice. Serum levels of MR proANP and ST2 pre-procedure will be measured to attempt
      to identify a threshold that carries prognostic value for procedural success (maintenance of
      sinus rhythm at one year).
