      currently managed conservatively, symptomatic cysts are treated with joint aspiration and
      Corticosteroid injection, which have shown according to literature a decrease of the cyst
      size in approximately two-thirds of patients within 2-7 days but only complete disappearance
      in approximately 7 %. Ultrasound guided cyst aspiration and Corticosteroid injection are also
      used with reduction of cyst's size with recurrence in 6 months of 19%. Surgical options to
      remove the cyst include, Open Resection with a recurrence of 50%, 25% of patients have motion
      limitation recurrence, 37% have wound healing problems or tense swelling of the calf and 75%
      of patients have joint pain lasting more than 2 days. Arthroscopic resection, with no
      recurrence in ultrasound performed 6 and 12 months after procedure, pain lasting more than 3
      days in 28% of patients, mild hematoma in 7% of patients and 7% where converted into an open
      procedure

      There is no study using ultrasound guided aspiration with platelet-rich-plasma injection
      (PRP). The rationale for the use of PRP is the belief that the additional platelets will
      exponentially increase the concentration and release of multiple growth and differentiation
      factors at the injury site to augment the natural healing process9. PRP does not have any
      described negative side effect due to the fact that is being prepared from subject's own
      blood, with no risk of allergy or cross infection, relatively easy for a practiced clinician,
      and reproducible.
