      stage melanomas have a much higher probability of survival than with later stages. The
      traditional method of early detection has been with serial total body skin exams where the
      health care provider examines all skin surfaces, including mucosa, for suspicious pigmented
      lesions. The diagnostic performance of dermatologists for melanoma depends on the level of
      dermatological training. More important than being able to make a diagnosis of melanoma on
      clinical impression is the ability to make an appropriate decision to excise the lesion. To
      aid dermatologists in the detection of early melanoma, MelaFind was developed, a non-invasive
      and objective multi-spectral computer vision system technology. It was designed to generate
      output - MelaFind Positive or MelaFind Negative- for consideration in the lesion management
      decisions.

      This survey study will determine and compare the average excision sensitivity to melanoma and
      specificity of dermatologists (in Germany) without MelaFind output to the average excision
      sensitivity to melanoma and specificity of dermatologists (in Germany) with MelaFind output.
      Another purpose is to determine and compare the sensitivity to melanoma and specificity of
      MelaFind to the average excision sensitivity to melanoma and specificity of dermatologists
      without MelaFind output.
