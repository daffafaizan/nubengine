      crossover study in approximately 20 adult subjects ≥ 40 years of age with COPD. The study is
      designed to evaluate the effect of a single dose of GIS on lung hyperinflation. The two study
      treatments, both administered using the Magnair device.

      The study will randomize 10 subjects per treatment sequence, for a total of 20 subjects. At
      the Sponsor's discretion, additional subjects may be enrolled in an effort to achieve at
      least 20 completers, with no more than 24 subjects randomize.

      The study will consist of a Screening period, a randomized 2-way cross-over treatment period
      during which subjects will receive two single-doses each separated by a 7-day washout period,
      and a follow-up 7 (± 2) days after the last study drug dose.

      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that in adults with COPD subjects as
      characterized by the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, after 2 cross-over periods of
      treatment, the primary null hypothesis for this study is that the mean change of RV from
      baseline at 6 hours postdose for a single dose of GIS is equal to the mean change of RV from
      baseline at 6 hours postdose for a single dose of placebo inhalation solution (PIS). The
      alternative hypothesis is that these means are different.
