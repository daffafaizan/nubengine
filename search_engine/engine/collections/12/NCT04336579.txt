    
      Study population: Patients (participants) undergoing total knee arthroplasty at Keck USC
      Hospital at HC3

      Study methodology: Patients (participants) will be taught with the aide of a handout and
      instructional videos preoperatively and in the recovery room on how to perform diaphragmatic
      breathing exercises for post-operative pain control. Patient (participant) pain levels will
      be assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). The investigators will then be comparing VAS
      scores and daily opioid doses (morphine equivalents) between the study group and a control
      group. The control group will include prior patients (participants) over the past year who
      underwent TKA at Keck Hospital and also had pain scores and opioid usage measured, but did
      not receive the breathing treatment.

      Study endpoints: Endpoints will include: pain levels via VAS scale, anxiety levels via VAS
      scale, and opioid usage (morphine equivalents).
