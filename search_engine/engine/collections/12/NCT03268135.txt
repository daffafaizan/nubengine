      The investigators will evaluate the expression of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs in patients
      affected by both end-stage and not end-stage HF as well as in patients affected by aortic
      stenosis and undergoing valve replacement and requiring cardiac myectomy. The tissue
      dysregulated RNAs will be next measured in plasma samples in order to clarify their potential
      as biomarkers.
