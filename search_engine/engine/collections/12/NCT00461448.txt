      symptom improvements after potassium supplementation (as KCl).

      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

      Medical history and physical examination. Measurements of weight and height. Blood sample
      collections for clinical and research purposes. Quality of life questionnaires.

      We therefore examined the hypothesis that examines effect of an orally administrated grape
      juice enriched (GJE) with 6000 mg potassium (as KCl) compared with that of a placebo grape
      juice (PGJ) on serum indices (cortisol, ACTH, aldosterone, creatinine, pH, Na, K), urinalysis
      (urea, uric acid, K, Na, creatinine, pH), GFR corrected by body surface area, ESR, CRP, RF,
      pain, quality of life, and disease activity in a case-controlled double-blind protocol in
      patients with RA with an established low dietary potassium intake to further investigate
      endogenous cortisol secretion and consequent possible relief.

      Clinical (like Disease Activity, Pain) variables, along with the Quality of Life, and
      Biochemical Indices will be compared in two groups of patients after 28 days of oral GJE and
      PJE administration.
