      perioperative period.1 Typically, this "stress response" is limited and goes unnoticed by the
      patient and health care team. However, physiologic insults that occur during major surgery
      may elicit a more pronounced response known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome
      (SIRS). Such a response is of great clinical consequence, as it is known to significantly
      worsen perioperative morbidity and mortality.1 HMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors (hereafter
      identified by the common name, "the statins") are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis,
      and their role in the treatment of atherosclerosis and prevention of coronary artery disease
      is well documented.2-5 Interestingly, data from animal studies have shown that statins have
      unique anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their lipid lowering effects.6
      Recently, statin therapy has been associated with a reduced incidence of perioperative
      cardiovascular and neurologic complications in major vascular and thoracic surgery patients
      as well as improved outcomes in patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS).7-13 In
      all ACS patient populations studied, improvement in outcome has been attributed to coronary
      plaque stabilization, presumably a result of statins mitigating the local inflammatory
      response at the level of the coronary plaque.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude of perioperative inflammation during
      major orthopedic spine surgery and determine whether statins alter this systemic physiologic
      response.
