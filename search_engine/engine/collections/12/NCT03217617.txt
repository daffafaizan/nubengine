      in the common cytokine receptor chain, normally on the surface of lymphocytes. Individuals
      with SCID-X1 lack the normal development of a functional immune system and so have difficulty
      fighting infections, which may lead to chronic or severe illness and death. X-SCID patients
      are normally rescued by a bone marrow transplant from a healthy donor. This trial aims to
      treat SCID-X1 using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying a functional gene to
      correct the genetic defect. By collecting an individual's stem cells and modifying them with
      a lentivirus, the gene-corrected cells can be returned into the blood to help produce normal
      healthy immune cells.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector
      TYF-IL-2Rg, the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of immune
      reconstitution in patients overcoming frequent infections present at the time of treatment,
      assessment of integration sites, and finally the long-term correction of immunodeficiency.
