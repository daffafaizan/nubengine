    
      Carbohydrate oxidation, glucose and insulin blood concentrations, isotopically measured rate
      of appearance of endogenous and exogenous glucose will be measured in 4 ocassions.

      Participants will undergo in a cross-over randomized fashion the following trials:

        1. Exercise pedalling during 50 min at 60% of their VO2max followed by an oral glucose
           tolerance test (OGTT).

        2. Exercise pedalling during 50 min in a hot environment (33ÂºC) at 60% of their VO2max
           followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

        3. Exercise pedalling during 50 min using intervalic bouts averaging 60% of VO2max followed
           by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

        4. No exercise, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
