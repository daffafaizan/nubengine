      metabolism, and the main organ of biotransformation and elimination of toxic substances and
      drugs, have many complex functions. Anesthetic drugs mostly through liver transformation and
      degradation.Liver cirrhosis, liver cancer patients due to abnormal liver dysfunction and
      liver metabolism, Most of the muscle relaxant prone to muscle relaxant accumulation and
      delayed recovery of patients with liver cirrhosis.

      Mivacurium is a new type of non depolarizing muscle relaxantsï¼Œhas the characteristics of
      rapid onset, short duration of action. Mivacurium can produce similar clinical effect of
      depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and rapidly be blood Che catabolism, Without
      liver metabolism. It can either as a single vein for medicinal endotracheal intubation, or as
      maintain continuous intravenous auxiliary anesthesia drug , is a muscle relaxant to shorten
      the clinical anesthesia recovery period ideal.
