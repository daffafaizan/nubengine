      analysis as International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee (IKDC), Knee injury
      and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), Lysholm-Tegner, and by objective measurements of
      laximetry and rotation.

      This study should include 2 groups of 296 patients with isolated ACL (antero crusader
      ligament) with clinical rotation :

        -  operated by a conventional patellar tendon technique (first group)

        -  operated by a technique combining a ALL (anterolateral ligament) and ACL plasty for the
           second group
