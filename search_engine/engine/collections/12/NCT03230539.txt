      (MirenaÂ®) are considered highly safe and effective long acting reversible methods of
      contraception (LARC). Nevertheless discontinuations are high due to user complaints of heavy
      bleeding during the first few months after insertion of IUDs or irregular bleeding in the
      first year of use of an IUS. To prevent these bleeding problems and enhance the overall
      safety profile, a new IUS is being developed that will deliver copper to provide its well
      described contraceptive efficacy in combination with UPA, a progesterone receptor modulator
      (PRM) that may decrease the amount of bleeding associated with use of a Cu IUD.

      Since results of human studies delivering antiovulatory doses of UPA orally or with vaginal
      rings have shown endometrial changes characterized as typical PAECs, the occurrence of these
      endometrial effects with lower doses of the PRM delivered in the endometrium via this
      investigational IUS requires evaluation with both histology assessments and measures of
      proliferation markers. We need to determine if small doses of UPA administered locally with a
      new Cu-IUS with UPA can result in reduced bleeding or amenorrhea, as observed in the monkey
      study, and whether or not endometrial modifications occur.
