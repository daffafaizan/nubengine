    
      Patients will be stratified for primary tumor location (right-sided or left sided) and
      numbers of liver metastases (<5 or â‰¥5).

      Patients with RAS mutated primary tumors will be randomized between mFOLFOXIRI plus
      bevacizumab (Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg in 15-30 minutes i.v., followed by irinotecan 165 mg/m^2
      i.v. in 60 minutes, followed by oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 i.v. together with leucovorin 400
      mg/m^2 i.v. in 120 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m^2 in
      46 hours, every 2 weeks) or mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg in 15-30 minutes
      i.v., followed by oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 i.v. together with leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 i.v. in 120
      minutes, followed by bolus 5FU 400 mg/m^2, all on day 1, followed by continuous infusion of
      5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m^2 in 46 hours, every 2 weeks).

      Patients will be evaluated every 8 weeks by MRI or CT scan for disease status. The assigned
      systemic treatment should be continued for at least 6 months or earlier in case of
      resectability, progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. If after 6
      months MDT concludes that the patient is still not resectable, it is highly unlikely that
      resectability will be achieved at all. Therefore the chemotherapy regimen may be reconsidered
      after 6 months of treatment. These patients will continue with bevacizumab plus
      fluoropyrimidine until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In patients who will become resectable and undergo secondary surgery of liver metastases, the
      total duration of preoperative and postoperative treatment together should be 6 months.
      However, in these patients mFOLFOXIRI should not be continued after surgery and replaced by
      mFOLFOX6. Bevacizumab will continued after surgery for both groups.
