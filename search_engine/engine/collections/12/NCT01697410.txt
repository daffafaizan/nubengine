      rate of 40 to 60%.Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support
      blood pressure in refractory septic shock.Recently small sample clinical study suggest that
      Terlipressin,a vasopressin analogues, was effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial
      hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements.But its effect on mortality is
      unknown.Invesgators hypothesized that Terlipressin as compared with norepinephrine would
      decrease mortality among patients with septic shock.
