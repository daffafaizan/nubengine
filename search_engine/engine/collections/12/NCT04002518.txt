    
      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow up study is to collect data
      confirming safety, performance, and clinical benefits of the Biomet Cannulated Bone Screw
      System (Implants and Instrumentation) when used according to the approved Indications for Use
      (IFU).

      Safety will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of complications and
      adverse events. Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be
      specified.

      Performance and clinical benefits will be assessed by analyzing fracture healing/fusion and
      the overall pain and functional performance of subjects who received the Biomet Cannulated
      Bone Screws by recording survey questions. Zimmer Biomet defines the expected performance
      rate for Cannulated Screws for long and small bone fractures to be a union rate of at least
      81% at 8-12 months.
