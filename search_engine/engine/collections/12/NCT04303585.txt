      administered in the immediate preoperative phase; both procedures are routinely used for
      analgesic purpose in the clinical practice of the three centers involved in the study and are
      performed under ultrasound guide. Using medical records, data collected by Acute Pain Service
      nurses and patients' interviews useful data will be collected: demographic and clinical
      characteristics (age, sex, weight, comorbidities), surgical data (type of procedure, surgical
      approach and duration of surgery) and anesthesia data (type of block, dose and type of local
      anesthetic with record of potential side effects), intraoperative and postoperative opioid
      and non-opioid analgesic consumption (and rescue if needed) with record of potential side
      effects, pain evaluation in the first 24 hours after surgery and after at 3 months.
