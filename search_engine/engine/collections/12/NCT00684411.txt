      Primary Objective To evaluate the overall response rate

      Secondary Objectives To assess the safety and tolerability To assess the duration of response
      To assess the progression free survival and overall survival

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This trial will use a single stage design to differentiate a >/= 25% response rate from a </=
      5% rate. If observed data is consistent with the alternative response rate of 25%, imatinib
      would be deemed clinically interesting and worthy of a larger phase II study.
