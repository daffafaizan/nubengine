      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma after
           chemotherapy comprising fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the incremental anatomical and molecular response rate in these patients during
           treatment with thalidomide.

        -  Determine the toxicity of treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by
           thalidomide.

        -  Assess the progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Develop a detailed pathological description of the disease at presentation and at
           relapse.

        -  Assess the number of circulating clonal T cells at presentation and during thalidomide
           treatment.

        -  Screen for possible etiological viruses at presentation.

        -  Evaluate the evolution of EBV viral load during follow-up.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral or IV fludarabine and oral or IV cyclophosphamide once daily on days
      1-3. Courses repeat every 28 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at least 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients
      who achieve at least stable disease receive oral thalidomide once daily for at least 6
      months.

      Lymph nodes, marrow, and peripheral blood will be collected periodically for research
      studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
