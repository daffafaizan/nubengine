    
      Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases with tau pathology. These tauopathies are the most
      common pathology in neurodegenerative diseases, and they are reaching epidemic proportions.
      The rates of tau kinetics are central to understanding normal and abnormal processing and
      production and clearance of tau kinetics in humans to help understand the causes of tauopathy
      and evaluate tau-targeted therapeutics.

      This study will utilize the Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK) method to elucidate tau
      kinetics in vivo in the human central nervous system (CNS) and its alteration in tauopathies.
      A total of ~34 participants from 3 different neurodegenerative diseases: Frontotemporal
      Dementia (FTD), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP),
      will be invited to enroll in the study.

      Participants will be labeled with stable isotopes via 16hr intravenous infusion and CSF
      samples collected during subsequent lumbar puncture visits over ~120 days. CSF will be
      analyzed over time for the quantitation of labeled tau.
