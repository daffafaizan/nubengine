      will lead to differences in glycemic outcomes when delivered by the insulin-only
      configuration of the bionic pancreas. Specifically, the investigators predict that insulin
      analogs that have faster absorption (numerically lower Tmax and/or TÂ½max) and insulin analogs
      that have faster clearance (numerically lower terminal half-life) will result in lower mean
      glucose and/or a lower percentage of time in the hypoglycemic range.

      Up to 30 subjects will participate in three 7-day study arms using insulin lispro, insulin
      aspart, and BC222 lispro in the bionic pancreas in random order. The co-primary outcomes will
      be mean CGMG and fraction of time spent with CGMG <54 mg/dl with comparisons made between
      arms for individual participants. Secondary analyses will include time in glycemic ranges
      (<50, <60, <70, 70-120, 70-180, >180, >250 mg/dl), coefficient of variation, mean
      postprandial excursion (difference in CGMG from the time of meal announcement to the peak
      CGMG in the first 4 hours after the meal announcement) for both mixed meal challenges, number
      of symptomatic hypoglycemic events, grams of carbohydrate consumed to treat hypoglycemia, and
      TDD of insulin, between arms for individual subjects.
