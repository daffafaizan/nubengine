      potential reduction in mortality that can be achieved will be higher than for any other
      interventions with sufficient evidence of effect. In the DRC >500,000 under-five deaths
      occurred in 2008. While >95% of children were breastfed at some point, 18% received something
      other than breast milk before initiation of breastfeeding, and half received something other
      than human milk by 1.4 months. Pre- and post-partum breastfeeding support has been shown to
      best improve the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). The global initiatives to improve
      breastfeeding practices have focused on maternity-level policies and procedures known as the
      Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, which served as the basis for the Baby-Friendly
      Hospital Initiative. These quality of care steps impact hospital breastfeeding rates as well
      as breastfeeding rates throughout the 6 months postpartum period. However, EBF rates fall off
      rapidly in the DRC. In the proposed cluster randomized controlled trial, we plan to evaluate
      the effect of breastfeeding support provided by well-child clinic staff including the use of
      culturally appropriate messages in addition to the implementation of BFHI steps 1-9 Steps in
      maternities on the rate of breastfeeding initiation within 1 hour of birth and EBF throughout
      6 months postpartum. If effective, this approach has great potential for scale up where most
      needed.
