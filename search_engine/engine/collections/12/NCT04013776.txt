      supplement for 5 days keeping a detailed diary of the foods eaten during this period. On the
      5th day, the participant will undergo a 24 hour urine collection. Participants will present
      after an overnight fast for baseline blood and urine measurements. Then they will consume
      water containing 500 mg of phosphorus. Urine and blood will be collected every hour for 3
      hours for measurement of phosphate and calcium and for measurement of hormones known to
      regulate phosphate and calcium including fibroblast growth factor-23, parathyroid hormone and
      vitamin D. One week later, participants will follow the same diet but will also receive a
      1250 mg phosphorus supplement for 5 days. On the 5th day, urine will be collected for 24
      hours. Participants will present again after an overnight fast and undergo the identical
      testing.
