      I. Determine the immune effects of single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with
      low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. Estimate the treatment response to single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined
      with low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with
      low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. Assess quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving single agent pembrolizumab and
      pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      III. Assess the association between immune response and clinical response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour
      and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 7 and 14.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days and then
      every 8 weeks thereafter.
