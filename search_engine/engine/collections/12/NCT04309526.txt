    
      This is a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending single oral
      dose study. NCO-48 Fumarate will be assessed in healthy subjects (6 groups of 8 subjects
      each). Subjects will receive a single oral dose of NCO-48 Fumarate or placebo capsules in 1
      or 2 periods, depending on the dose group, under fasting conditions (unless otherwise
      indicated) and will be followed for a 1-week observation period. Safety assessments will be
      performed and NCO-48 Fumarate and TFV PK will be assessed. The planned doses for this study
      are 2, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 mg. Each group of 8 subjects (Groups 1 to 6) will be
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either NCO-48 Fumarate or placebo (6 subjects to receive
      active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo) as a single dose on Day 1 of Period 1 in the
      fasted state. A preliminary assessment of food effect will be conducted in Group 3. Subjects
      in Group 3 will receive study drug in Period 1 under fasted conditions and return after a
      minimum of 14 days to receive study drug under fed conditions. There will be a Screening
      Period of up to 30 days. All subjects (Periods 1 and 2) will be observed through the morning
      of Day 3 (48-hour post-dose assessment). Safety assessments and NCO-48 Fumarate and TFV PK
      sample collection (blood and urine) will occur during this time. Subjects will be discharged
      from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to the study site on Days 5 and
      7 (final visit) for follow-up procedures. After the Day 7 follow-up procedures for each
      group, evaluation of all safety and tolerability data collected during the period, and
      evaluation of any available PK data, the dose for the next group of subjects will be
      determined by the Safety Monitoring Panel (SMP).
