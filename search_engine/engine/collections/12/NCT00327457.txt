    
      The investigators aim to use a randomized design to test the effects of 1) tailored physician
      recommendations, relative to non-specific recommendations, and 2) coordinated physician
      office management systems on patient adherence to colorectal cancer screening
      recommendations.

      To accomplish these aims, the investigators propose 1) to use existing physician
      practice-based computerized patient registration systems to define populations of 50 to 79
      year-old pri-mary care patients, 2) to use mailed questionnaires to determine colorectal
      cancer risk factor status and prior colorectal cancer screening history, 3) to use responses
      from mailed questionnaires to identify persons not adhering to colorectal cancer screening
      guidelines, 4) to use computer driven algorithms to help physicians prepare and deliver
      individually tailored and written colorectal cancer screening recommendations, and 5) to
      develop, implement, and evaluate a centralized service for delivering high quality screening
      flexible sigmoidoscopy.
