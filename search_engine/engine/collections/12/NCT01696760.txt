    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform a randomized prospective study to determine efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid
      (ASA)+pneumatic compression device (PCD) prophylaxis compared to low-molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH)+PCD in patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures for musculoskeletal neoplasms (MSN)
      of the pelvis and lower extremity.

      II. To prove that ASA+PCD is clinically equivalent to or better than LMWH+PCD in providing
      deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in this patient population and results in fewer major
      bleeding complications.

      III. To measure rates of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) as primary outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure secondary outcomes including rates of readmission, reoperation, bleeding
      complications (including hematoma formation and prolonged wound drainage), and death.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and wear PCD on
      days 1-28 after surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive enoxaparin subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) and wear PCD on days
      1-28 after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3
      months.
