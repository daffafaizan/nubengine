    
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and debilitating disease. However, the symptoms of RA
      show variation over the course of the day, with worsening symptoms in the morning. This
      worsening of symptoms in the morning is correlated with an increase in inflammation in the
      body.

      Biologic therapies, such as Enbrel (etanercept), appear to improve energy, pain and quality
      of life in patients with RA, and these changes may occur before a doctor is able to detect
      changes during the patient's physical examination. It is possible that a patient's response
      to biological agents can be rapidly determined by assessing circadian activity (also called
      "rest-activity circadian rhythms" or RAR).

      Currently, wrist actigraphy bands, which are worn for a period of time, can reliably provide
      information about RAR. Wrist actigraphy bands are small electronic devices worn on the wrist
      (similar to a watch) that records the subject's level of activity throughout the day. Studies
      in osteoarthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis have found subjects with joint pain to have
      significant differences in RAR, and disrupted RAR has been associated with disease activity.

      This study will provide information about 24-hour circadian activity rhythms before and after
      3-4 weeks of Enbrel treatment in study subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis. The study
      will assess patients who are starting on Enbrel that has been prescribed by their doctor.
