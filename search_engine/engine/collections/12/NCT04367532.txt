      muscle sourness. Tissue flossing is popular in athletic training and physical therapy, as an
      effective strategy for ankle range of motion or performance. However, there is a lack of
      knowledge about the use of foam rolling and tissue flossing during a 60 minutes
      post-intervention examination on the performance and soft tissue stiffness.

      The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of foam rolling and tissue flossing
      of the cuff on sprint performance, jump height and Achilles tendon stiffness at different
      time points. The second aim is to assess the effectiveness of those self-myofascial release
      methods (SMR).

      This study will include healthy, recreational active subjects aged between 20 and 25 years
      old.
