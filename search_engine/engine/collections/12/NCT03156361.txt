      dose safety, tolerability and efficacy study.

      The study will consist of three periods. Total duration will be approximately nine weeks,
      including a screening period of up to 14 days, a 7-day run-in period and two 21-day treatment
      periods.

      Subjects will be screened and then they will undergo a week of baseline CGM. They will then
      be randomized to one of two treatment sequences: three weeks of treatment with HDV-lispro
      followed by three weeks of treatment with insulin lispro diluted with sterile water to match
      the insulin concentration in HDV-lispro, or the same treatments in the reverse order.

      A test meal study (standardized liquid test meal) is to be conducted at the beginning of
      treatment (baseline study) and at the end of each three week treatment period. As noted
      above, frequent blood samples will be collected for glucose and insulin levels during the
      first (baseline study) test meal; during the two test meals performed after the two treatment
      periods the same sampling for glucose and insulin will be performed, with the addition of
      collecting samples for glucagon levels.

      Subjects will also perform blinded continuous glucose monitoring throughout the entirety of
      the study (7 weeks).

      Throughout study, subjects will be asked to perform frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose
      (SMBG), at least 6 times per day (before and 60-90 minutes after each meal) during 3 or more
      days of each week. This will serve as data for therapeutic decision-making as well as for
      data collection.
