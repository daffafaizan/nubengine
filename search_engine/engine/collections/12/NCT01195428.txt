      Simvastatin or placebo. Patients' management will be entirely left up to the primary team,
      including the need for daily laboratory and imaging. In addition, there will be no
      restriction on the use of any medications, as deemed necessary by the primary care physician.
      The primary endpoint will be the incidence of ALI/ARDS. Secondary efficacy variables will be
      the number of days without organ or system failure, in addition to the change in IL-6, IL-8,
      and TNF- Î±. Treatment will continue until the primary endpoint is reached, the patient
      discharged from the ICU or the maximum duration of 2 weeks, whichever occurs first. Patients
      will continued to be followed for a total of 28 days, or until discharged from the hospital,
      whichever occurs first.

      Patients randomized, in a ratio of 1:1 to either Simvastatin 40 mg PO once daily or placebo
      tablet once daily in a format identical to Simvastatin.

      The mortality from ALI/ARDS remains significant. In the absence of effective therapy,
      prophylaxis in patients at risk is an important goal to achieve. Therefore, if Simvastatin is
      found to decrease the incidence of ALI/ARDS, it would be a significant advance in the
      management of this deadly and frequent syndrome.

      We have set up a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will closely monitor the progress
      of the trial (DSMB Charter attached to this application). Any adverse event will be reported
      directly to the institutional review board (IRB) and DSMB. All adverse events will be
      reported in the annual review of the protocol.
