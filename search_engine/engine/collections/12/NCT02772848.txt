    
      The purpose of this study is to obtain sufficient specimens and correlating clinical data
      from a well-controlled prospective clinical trial collecting specimens from healthy,
      premenopausal subjects to support domestic and international regulatory submissions on
      fertility biomarker assays, and to establish a collection of specimens that will support
      future assay discovery and validation efforts.
