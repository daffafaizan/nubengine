      about 75% of Mullerian anomalies. Transcervical resection of septum (TCRS) has been shown in
      several cohort studies to improve outcome, although evidence from prospectively conducted
      randomized trial is lacking. TCRS is generally considered to be safe but there is a concern
      that it may be complicated by post-operative formation of intrauterine adhesions. Some
      investigators therefore recommend the use of postoperative adjuvant therapies with a view to
      preventing adhesion formation, as in the case of hysteroscopic surgery for Asherman syndrome.
      The adjuvant measures proposed include postoperative estrogen therapy, the placement of an
      intrauterine device (IUD) or Foley catheter in the uterine cavity. Unlike the case of
      Asherman syndrome in which these various adjuvant therapies are often used and appear to be
      of benefit, it is uncertain if any of these adjuvant measures are of benefit or necessary in
      the case TCRS. In this study, the investigators will compare the postoperative adhesion
      formation rates who will receive Foley catheter therapies „ÄÅpostoperative estrogen therapy and
      those who will not receive any therapies to determine the usefulness of Foley catheter
      therapies in reducing postoperative adhesion formation.
