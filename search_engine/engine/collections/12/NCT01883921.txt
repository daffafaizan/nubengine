    
      This is a prospective, observational evaluation of immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy in consenting
      PIDD adult and assenting pediatric subjects who receive infusion services from BriovaRx
      Infusion Services (formerly AxelaCare Health Solutions, LLC). Subjects meeting all inclusion
      criteria who have provided informed consent/assent for trial participation will have
      validated, physician-prescribed, standard-of-care outcome measures, and Ig administration
      information recorded during normal home infusion visits. There will also be standard-of-care
      questions captured within some outcome measures recorded during normal home infusion visits
      that may be at a frequency and/or combination which may not be considered routine clinical
      care by some physicians who treat for this medical condition. Collected data will be
      de-identified and aggregated into cohorts of like diagnosis for trend analysis.
