      (GST) genes that have been implicated in susceptibility to air pollutants. Outcome measures
      will include lung function, bronchial responsiveness to bronchodilator, exhaled nitric oxide,
      induced sputum for inflammatory markers (IL6 and IL8), and exhaled breath condensate for
      nitrite, 8-isoprostane, 20-HETE (20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid), nitrotyrosine and pH.

      In this pilot project, parallel studies are being carried out in the human exposure chambers
      at two NIEHS centers, the EOHSI-CEED (Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences
      Institute- Center for Environmental Exposure and Disease) and the Penn-CEET (University of
      Pennsylvania-Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology). The joint project will enable
      each center to validate research results in a second population and include new biomarkers of
      pulmonary inflammation. Each center will recruit, consent, and collect data on its own
      subjects. Only de-identified data will be shared between the centers.
