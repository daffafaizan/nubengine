      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy and feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising S-1 and
           cisplatin in patients with stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression and types of initial recurrence in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine mortality and morbidity related to treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral S-1 on days 1-21 and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Treatment
      repeats every 35 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then undergo gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy. Patients resume oral S-1
      after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
