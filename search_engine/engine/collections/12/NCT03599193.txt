      parallel-arm study in subjects with moderate acne vulgaris.

      Approximately 62 subjects were randomized, stratified by age (Adult subjects: 17 years or
      older; Pediatric subjects: 9 years to 16 years 11 months for the Test product and 12 years to
      16 years 11 months for the Reference product). The study was conducted in two parts, Part A
      and Part B in a sequential manner. Based on full PK profiles generated for adult subjects in
      Part A, the sparse PK sampling design in pediatric population was established in Part B.
