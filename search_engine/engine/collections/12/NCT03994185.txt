      follow-up visits at 4 weeks, 24, 36 and 52 weeks, and unscheduled visits as medically
      necessary,

      The primary study safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects free from a composite of
      device- or procedure-related death, myocardial infarction, or amputation above the
      metatarsals in the treated leg resulting from a vascular event, or device- or
      procedure-related serious adverse events within 4 weeks of the index procedure. The primary
      clinical effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a composite improvement of
      at least 1 Rutherford category and patency as evaluated by duplex ultrasound at 4 weeks after
      index procedure.
