      IV and promethazine 25 mg IV was given as PONV prophylaxis. After surgery, subjects were
      transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) or post anesthesia care unit as
      clinically indicated. Ondansetron 4 mg IV was administered as primary rescue medication to
      subjects with PONV symptoms. PONV was assessed and collected every 24 hours for 5 days via
      direct interview and/or medical charts review.
