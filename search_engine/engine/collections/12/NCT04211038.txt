      in studies of patien-tventilator interaction, where the level of assistance delivered by the
      ventilator is controlled by the patient's demand. Patient-ventilator asynchrony evaluated
      using the time lag between onset of the neural inspiratory time and the onset of a mechanical
      ventilation signal. The onset of neural inspiratory time can be determined in esophageal
      pressure, transdiaphragmatic pressure, and EMG signals. The investigator compare the onset
      measured by EMG, esophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure, and consider that the
      correlation between them is well in three different conditions.
