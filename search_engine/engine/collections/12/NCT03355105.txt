    
      This is a bicentric, prospective crossover, randomized, open label trial. The study will
      focus on 50 adult patients with stable neuromuscular conditions, outside the congestion
      period requiring cough help.

      Patients will be recruited from among the neuromuscular disease patients followed for their
      respiratory management in the home ventilation unit of the Raymond Poincar√© Hospital
      Intensive care Unit or in the Aincourt Neurological Rehabilitation Service attached to the
      Vexin Intercommunal Hospital Group.

      The cough help performed with the MI / E will be evaluated according to two conditions of
      adjustment of the exsufflation pressure: a subjective adjustment (modality S) and an
      objective adjustment (modality O), whose order will be randomized to control a phenomenon of
      tiredness causing confusion.

      A respiratory technician and two therapists will participate to the protocol. The therapist
      "clinician" and "evaluator" role will be defined by a draw.

      The protocol will take place during the same day of hospitalization in two stages:

        -  T0: validation of the eligibility criteria and inclusion of patients in the study.

        -  T1: evaluation of coughing performance according to the two modes of exsufflation
           pressure adjustment. Adjustment modality "S" according to the clinical impression of the
           "clinician" therapist and the patient, and the "Cough Peak Expiratory Flow" measured by
           the MI / E. Adjustment modality "O": according to the analysis of the flow / volume
           curve measured using a spirometer and a pneumotachograph.
