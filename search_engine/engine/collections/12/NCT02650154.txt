      Primary Objective: In otherwise healthy children between 3 and 48 months of age who present
      to a tertiary care emergency department and receive procedural sedation with ketamine, to
      determine if there is at least a 50% increase, compared to baseline in the serum
      concentration of any of the neurotoxicity biomarkers S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein
      (GFAP) or neuronal-specific enolase (NSE), 1 to 3 hours after intravenous ketamine
      administration. The cut-off of 50% is a benchmark value routinely quoted in both animal and
      human studies, which correlated neurotoxicity biomarker levels with functional outcomes.

      Secondary Objectives: In the aforementioned population:

        1. To determine if at least a 50% increase in the serum concentration of S100B, GFAP or NSE
           compared to baseline at 6 to 12 hours after intravenous ketamine administration.

        2. To explore if genotypes relevant to ketamine metabolism and disposition are associated
           with increased vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of ketamine.

        3. To determine the toxic effect of ketamine administration at the cellular level (evidence
           of sustainable cellular damage and mitochondrial DNA changes).
