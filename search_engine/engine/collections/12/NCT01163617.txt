      visits, each visit occurring 2 weeks apart from each other. Phase A (User Experience) was a
      randomized, 2-period, cross-over phase in which single subcutaneous (SC) dose injections were
      administered using either the Physiolis autoinjector and current autoinjector or the
      Physiolis syringe and current syringe in a 1:1 ratio. Phase B (Injection Time) was a
      randomized, single-visit, parallel-arm phase, with injection into a test tube, and one SC
      injection given to participants using the Physiolis autoinjector or current autoinjector
      administered at 2 different temperature ranges (2째 to 8째C [storage temperature] and 20째 to
      27째C [room temperature]). If a participant only completed Visit 1 and Visit 2, then the
      participant was to be replaced for Visit 3. If the participant only completed Visit 1, the
      participant was to be replaced for all study visits.
