        1. identify and describe upper limb amputees who would be appropriate candidates for home
           use of this advanced prosthesis as well as those who would not be appropriate.

        2. Compare the extent of use of the existing prosthesis to that of the DEKA Arm.and
           quantify the impact of home use of the DEKA Arm on device satisfaction, performance of
           functional activities and the user's quality of life.

        3. Compare the outcomes of users of pattern recognition to the outcomes of users without

        4. quantify the amount and type of technical support and repairs needed during the study,
           and estimate the number of home study days lost due to service/repair.

      All participating subjects will enroll in Part A of the study, which will involve supervised,
      in-laboratory training, as well as supervised community based outings. Based upon the
      findings from Part A, study staff will classify participants as appropriate or not
      appropriate for participation in Part B (the home usage portion of the study). Final
      determination of appropriateness for home use will be made after a home visit. The home use
      portion of the study will last for 13 weeks and involve regularly scheduled study visits.

      Measures of existing prosthetic activity will be compared with those of home use of the
      advanced upper limb prosthetic device to determine the extent of adoption. Changes in device
      satisfaction, performance of functional activities, and quality of life will be evaluated
      throughout the study. Data on technical support usage will also be gathered.
