    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover design with two 3-week
      interventions and a 5-week washout period in between. Thirty-six participants will be
      enrolled. With informed consent, the daily questionnaire will be administered and a baseline
      stool sample will be obtained during the week before the start of each intervention period.
      Blood and saliva will be collected on the first and last day of each intervention period to
      assess immune function. A final stool sample will be obtained in the last week of the
      intervention period. Nutritional status, which can impact immune function, will be assessed
      using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, Block Fiber Screen, and the Block 2005 Food Frequency
      Questionnaire. Daily questionnaires will record intake of the probiotic or placebo, level of
      stress, hours of sleep, visits to the physician, new medications, number of stools, etc. The
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Response Scale, which records gastrointestinal symptoms, such as
      bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation, over the past week will be completed at baseline
      and weekly during the interventions and the week following the interventions.
