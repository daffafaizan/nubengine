      clinics by poster and flyer advertisements.

      Primary research question: Among pregnant women, does introducing a structured and monitored
      nutrition and exercise program (treatment) in early pregnancy compared with Usual Prenatal
      Care (control) increase the likelihood of attaining gestational weight gain within the
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines over the pregnancy period?

      Experimental and Control groups: Both groups of mothers and their health care providers will
      be given the Health Canada materials on "Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy", "Eating Well
      with Canada's Food Guide" and the "Pregnancy Weight Gain Calculator". Baseline information
      will be recorded for eligible and consenting women after which they will be randomized to
      Experimental or Control group. Nutrition intake, physical measures and physical activity will
      be recorded at baseline, 26-28 weeks and 36-38 weeks of gestation and 6 months post partum in
      the same manner for both groups. All mothers will receive the study promotional materials and
      small incentives. Also, all mothers will be followed by their primary care provider and have
      usual access to Public Health.
