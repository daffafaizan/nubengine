      partner is HIV+ and the other is HIV-) are at substantial risk of acquiring HIV infection and
      that such transmission may play animportant role in heterosexual transmission of HIV in
      countries with high seroprevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this study is to
      conduct preparatory research needed to design and implement an HIV-prevention intervention
      trial aimed at decreasing the risk for HIV infection among HIV-discordant couples in Lesotho.

      Using both quantitative and qualitative research methods, the study aims to:

        -  Establish baseline characteristics of the proposed study population, speciÔ¨Åcally
           pregnant and recently postpartum women and of men in Lesotho

        -  Explore the types of sexual and social relationships that exist between men and women in
           Lesotho

        -  Assess individual knowledge, understanding and perceptions around different HIV
           prevention strategies, including HIV testing and treatment, couples counseling and male
           circumcision

        -  Identify interpersonal and individual-level barriers to accessing these types of HIV
           prevention interventions.

      There will be three study components including 1) quantitative survey 2) focus group
      discussions; and 3) in-depth individual interviews. A quantitative cross-sectional survey
      will be administered to 200 pregnant and recently postpartum women. Qualitative components
      will be based on open-ended iterative inquiry via focus group discussions and in-depth
      interviews with two groups: (1) pregnant and recently postpartum women; and (2) men. Data
      gathered during this study will inform the study design and intervention components of the
      proposed prevention intervention study.
