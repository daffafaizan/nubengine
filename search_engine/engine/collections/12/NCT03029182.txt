      compared to those without a history of cancer. Though exercise interventions in breast cancer
      survivors exist, a large portion of women (61%) exhibit some form of lower-body dysfunction
      that severely restricts participation in physical activity and exercise. Both physical and
      emotional well-being are negatively affected by the combination of increased adiposity,
      orthopedic problems and muscle weakness, thus reinforcing a cycle of physical inactivity.

      For these reasons, obese breast cancer survivors with walking limitations are faced with a
      barrier that greatly increases the difficulty of meeting prescribed exercise guidelines (â‰¥150
      weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise). Though previous investigations
      have demonstrated the safety and benefits of exercise+simulated altitude to improve body fat,
      physical endurance and insulin sensitivity, results have been limited to non-cancer
      participants only. Given the comorbidities common to breast cancer survivors, specifically,
      heart disease risk, lower body joint problems, low aerobic capacity, and fatigue, further
      research is needed.
