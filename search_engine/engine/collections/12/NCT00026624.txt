      the protective immune response to viral infection. Current HIV vaccines do not consistently
      elicit strong CTL responses. The limited immune response of current HIV vaccines could be
      attributed, in addition to other causes, to failure of the vaccine to reach the appropriate
      cells to initiate a robust immune response. DCs particularly are effective in stimulating
      primary T-cell-dependent immunity. Antigen-bearing DCs are used as adjuvants for active
      immunotherapy in humans, particularly to increase host resistance to tumors and certain viral
      infections. A5130 is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study that seeks to ensure adequate
      delivery of the vaccine to important antigen-presenting cells.

      Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 vaccination groups at entry. Group A: Patients receive an
      SC vaccination with DCs infected with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452. DC exposure to KLH occurs at Weeks 3
      and 7. Leukopheresis occurs at entry.

      Group B: Patients receive an SC vaccination with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 without DCs. KLH
      injections are administered at Weeks 3 and 7.

      Patients in both groups receive their vaccinations at Weeks 3, 7, and 15. This study consists
      of 4 steps but not all patients necessarily qualify to enter Step II, Step III, or Step IV.

      Step I: vaccination phase. Step II: withdrawal of potent ART. Step III: optional
      discontinuation of ART. Step IV: reinitiation of ART. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/10/02: Step V:
      follow-up period off potent ART.]
