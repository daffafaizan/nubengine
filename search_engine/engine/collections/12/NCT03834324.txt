      to neuroplastic changes following incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Our hypothesis is that
      greater neuroplastic effects occur when electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves is
      combined with voluntary drive. In this pilot study, we will investigate the effects of a
      one-month training programme using a novel device, the iCycle, in which voluntary effort
      (cortical drive) is encouraged by virtual reality biofeedback during FES cycling.

      Methods: Eleven participants (C1-T12) with incomplete SCI (5 sub-acute; 6 chronic) will be
      recruited and undergo 12-sessions of iCycle training. Function will be assessed before and
      after training using the bilateral ISNC-SCI motor score neurological (motor) function, Oxford
      power grading, Modified Ashworth Score, Spinal Cord Independence Measure, the Walking Index
      for Spinal Cord Injury and 10m-walk test. Power output will be measured during training.
