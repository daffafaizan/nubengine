      conditions in which muscle function is significantly impaired. Due to progress in NMD
      management over recent decades, particularly the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to
      treat chronic respiratory failure, many individuals are surviving into adulthood and even
      middle age. However, older individuals are developing potentially fatal complications related
      to the heart e.g. sudden cardiac death, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and increasing dependence
      on NIV.

      Previous studies largely in children and adolescents suggest individuals with NMD may develop
      problems of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), a network of nerves vital to controlling the
      body's short-term responses to internal and external stimuli. It is likely some complications
      of NMD are related to ANS abnormalities.

      This will be an exploratory observational study using a cross-sectional design in which
      non-invasive tools will be used to evaluate autonomic function during wake and sleep.
      Individuals over 16 years of age with a confirmed NMD diagnosis will be recruited. Derived
      parameters of autonomic function including heart rate variability will be compared to values
      from an exploratory reference group of age- and sex-matched healthy adults. Autonomic
      function will also be correlated to measures of symptom burden, complications, quality of
      life and disease severity. Qualitative methods will be used to further evaluate the
      experience and perceptions of adults with NMD in making decisions about their personal and
      medical care, which become more complex with increasing age and disease severity.
