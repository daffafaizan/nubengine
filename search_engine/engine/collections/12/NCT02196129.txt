      The experimental group was treated with sinbaro-3 pharmacoacupuncture and the control group
      was treated with Hwangryun pharmacoacupuncture. All administrations were limited to 1
      session, and comparisons of measurements were made before and after treatment. Primary
      outcomes were measured using the VAS scale. Post-treatment follow-up will be performed to
      measure primary outcomes at 30 minutes, 2hours, 4hours, and 6 hours after treatment. Before
      and after each measurement, the patients are asked to stand up and rotate their torso. At
      termination of the study, satisfaction levels of the patient's current status will also be
      collected.
