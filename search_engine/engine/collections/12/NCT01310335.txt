      bone stimulates the osteocytes.

      Sclerostin, the protein product of the SOST gene, is an osteocyte-specific cysteine
      knot-secreted glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Sost/sclerostin
      levels have been reported to be reduced by mechanical stimulation.

      The aim of this study is to investigate effect of whole-body vibration on plasma sclerostin
      level in healthy young adult women.
