      of oral antimicrobial agents. If bacteriuria persists women are retreated with the same of
      different agent for a second course of 7 to 14 days and they may be subsequently placed on
      prophylaxis.

      In nonpregnant women, an uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection may be treated with a
      short course regimen from 1 to 3 days. This approach has similar rates of persistent
      bacteriuria or symptoms following treatment when compared to women treated with a more
      conventional approach. If the infection recurs or persists, the patient may then be treated
      with the more traditional 7 to 14 day course. The advantages of single-dose regimens are cost
      and patient compliance, but a major disadvantage is the failure to eradicate uropathogens
      from the vaginal reservoir, which results in more frequent early recurrences.

      The three-day regimen is advocated to maintain the advantages of lower costs and patient
      compliance but improving cure rates. Multiple studies have shown the advantage of even a
      short course of antibiotics as opposed to no treatment.
