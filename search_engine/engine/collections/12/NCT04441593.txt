      telehealth intervention for heavy drinking PLWH with chronic pain to a control condition.
      Forty-eight heavy drinking patients in HIV-care with moderate or greater pain will be
      recruited for the study. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomly
      assigned to either intervention or control conditions. Participants will complete assessment
      measures of heavy drinking and pain interference/severity at 3 and 6 months post-baseline.
      Secondary alcohol outcomes will include alcohol-related consequences
