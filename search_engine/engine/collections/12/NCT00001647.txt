      of repeated infusions of syngeneic lymphocytes obtained from HIV-1 seronegative identical
      twins given in the setting of maximum anti-retroviral therapy. Unfractionated lymphocytes
      from each seronegative twin will be obtained by lymphocytapheresis and directly transferred
      to the HIV-1 seropositive twin. Four separate lymphocytaphereses and transfers will be
      performed over one week, and this cycle may be repeated as frequently as every 8 weeks for a
      total of up to 6 cycles. The recipient twin will be monitored for general health status,
      immunologic improvement, depletions within the CD4+ T-cell repertoire, and HIV-1 viral load.
