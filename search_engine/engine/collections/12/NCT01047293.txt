      each cohort. Additional 3 patients on the tolerable cohort. Total patient number: Minimum 6,
      Maximum: 12 Phase II portion: Metastatic colorectal cancer: A total of 33 patients will be
      treated in this portion. This will include the patients treated on the tolerable dose level
      from the phase I trial. The statistical justification is indicated in the Statistics section
      7.

      Overall study design Phase I Study: A three cohort dose escalation will be used. Cycle length
      will be 28 days.

      Phase II Study:

      For the Phase II portion the primary endpoint is Progression Free Survival at 6 months.

      Study Objectives Primary

        1. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) for a combination of FOLFOX+ Bevacizumab
           + RAD001 in previously untreated metastatic or advanced colorectal cancers

        2. To evaluate the safety of the combination at a daily dosing of 2.5mg RAD001, 5 mg RAD001
           or 10 mg RAD001 (Phase 1 part) Secondary

      1. To study the toxicity profile of the combination 2. To study the Response Rate (RR) of the
      combination 3. To determine the serum proteomic profiles of patients treated with combination
      therapy (Both phase I and II portions)

      Dose selection for RAD001 In phase 1 clinical studies of RAD001 as a monotherapy agent in
      oncology patients, the side-effect profile is essentially mild to moderate adverse events
      with a low frequency of DLT at the daily dose of 10 mg/d. Based on the PK/PD model, a daily
      dose of 10mg RAD001 is assumed to provide a persistently high degree of target inhibition in
      the tumor [Investigators' Brochure-Section 4.1.1.3]. In addition, preliminary data from phase
      1 studies, in which changes in molecular characteristics of tumor induced by treatment with
      RAD001 at the doses of 5 and 10 mg/d were investigated, confirm the pharmacodynamic activity
      predicted previously by PK/PD modeling [Investigators' Brochure-Section 4.1.1.3]. Therefore,
      a dose of 10 mg/d should ensure adequate drug target inhibition for most patients, taking
      into consideration the known inter-patient variability in drug levels (CV of approx 50%). In
      this study, we will begin with a RAD001 dose of 2.5 mg which is the lowest dose that can be
      administered on a daily basis. If the dose is tolerable (<1/6 DLTs), we will escalate to the
      dose of RAD001 (5 mg) and a third cohort of 10 mg. If cohort 1 is intolerable, study will be
      closed without any further expansion. On any dose level, 3 patients would be enrolled. If
      there are 0/3 DLTs, we would be able to escalate the dose level. If 1/3 DLTs are observed, 3
      additional patients will be enrolled on the same dose level. The intent is to escalate dose
      levels only if < 1/6 DLTs are observed. In case 2 or more DLTs are observed on a particular
      dose level, no further dose escalation is possible. This dose level would be deemed
      intolerable and the lower dose level would be expanded. The definition of the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) is the highest dose level at which RAD001 can be combined with FOLFOX/
      Bevacizumab with < 1/6 DLTs.

      FOLFOX/ Bevacizumab: FOLFOX6 and Bevacizumab will be given as previously described 28.
      mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV with LV 350 mg IV over 2 hours plus FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus
      and 2,400 mg/m2continuous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks) will be combined with
      Bevacizumab given at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Dose modifications will be carried out for
      chemotherapy as per the label for oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and bevacizumab.
