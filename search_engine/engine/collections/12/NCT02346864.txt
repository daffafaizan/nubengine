      prematurity. Recurrent apnea may lead to brain damage caused by hypoxia, affecting the
      nervous system, even threatening life (1, 2). Therefore, choosing an intervention which can
      prevent and reduce occurrence of AOP with fewer side effects is an important issue that
      should be closely watched by neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) health care.

      Prone position is the forefront treatment due to its simple, economic and non-invasive. In
      clinic, it includes horizontal prone position (HPP), Head elevated tilt 15 Â° prone position
      (HETP) and three-step-prone position (TSP)(3).Many studies have shown that HETP can allow
      thoracic volume increased and make abdominal movement more coordinated in preterm children,
      and then it is more favorable than the HPP on improving respiratory function. So HETP has
      been a routine position in NICU instead of HPP (4, 5). HETP, however, always make the babies
      slide to the foot of the bed resulting in airway obstruction. Therefore, scholars have
      proposed TSP which should prevent this phenomenon (6). In the study, the effectiveness of TSP
      on improvement of AOP will be evaluated trying to find a more suitable position for preterm
      infants.
