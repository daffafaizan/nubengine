    
      ORCA-2 is a phase I trial in patients with locally advanced, with or without metastatic nodal
      disease.

      Patients will receive olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) in combination with standard
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

      Olaparib, cisplatin and radiotherapy will be given in combination every week for a maximum of
      7 weeks. Prior to starting combination treatment, olaparib will be started 7 days before the
      first week of combination treatment. Olaparib will be given twice daily on days 1-3 of each
      week of treatment (either alone during week 0 or in combination with chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy during weeks 1-7). Cisplatin will be started on day 1 of each week, and given
      once a week during radiotherapy treatment for a total of 7 weeks. Radiotherapy will be
      delivered on days 1-5 of each week using IMRT, for a total of 7 weeks.

      The phase I trial aims to determine the recommended phase II dose of olaparib (50mg, 100mg,
      150mg or 200mg bd) - the dose of olaparib patients receive will depend on the dose under
      investigation at the time of patient registration.

      Dose escalation will be guided by the two-dimensional dose escalation design called Product
      of Independent Beta Probabilities escalation (PIPE). It will recommend the choice of
      dose/duration combination cohort of olaparib for subsequent patients by estimating the
      contour that divides dose/duration combination cohorts to be those above the target toxicity
      rate (equal to 33%) and those below. The recommended phase II cohort(s) are those that have
      been experimented on during the trial and are also closest to (but not above) the estimated
      contour calculated using all trial data.
