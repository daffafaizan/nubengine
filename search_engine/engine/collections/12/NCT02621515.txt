    
      This study is an open label, single arm, phase II clinical trial of prospectively collected
      data evaluating efficacy and safety of nivolumab in metastatic melanoma patients with
      symptomatic brain metastases. It will be conducted in several study centers in the
      Netherlands.

      Patients with radiologic evidence of brain metastases and who are eligible for treatment with
      nivolumab will be screened for inclusion.

      All patients in this trial will receive treatment with nivolumab for 24 months. Treatment
      will be discontinued if confirmed disease progression has been demonstrated, if unacceptable
      toxicity or intercurrent illness prevents further treatment, and when informed consent is
      withdrawn. After discontinuation of treatment, follow-up will start. Duration of follow-up
      depends on survival of patients, with a maximum of 24 months. Therefore the end of this study
      is determined as 24 months after the last patient in this trial has started follow-up, has
      died, withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up for a different reason.
