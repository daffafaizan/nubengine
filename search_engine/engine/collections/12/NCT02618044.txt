      The investigators performed clinical evaluation with GERD-HRQoL and GIS questionnaire, upper
      endoscopy, esophageal manometry and 24h-impedance pH monitoring (24h-MII-pH) preoperatively
      and at 12 and 60 months after surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the
      presence of GER at preoperative 24h-MII-pH.
