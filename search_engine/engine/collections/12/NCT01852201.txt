      and effective for treatment of AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset, and newer evidence has
      shown potential benefit out to 4.5 hours. Mechanical thrombectomy for AIS patients has been
      shown in clinical trials to be safe up to 8 hours after symptom onset. The rapid progression
      of thrombectomy devices over the last several years has resulted in faster recanalization
      times while maintaining a high degree of safety. This has resulted in improved patient
      outcomes, similar to prior randomized trial data showing improved outcomes over medical
      therapy or earlier devices. Data from the MERCI trial suggests that patients > 85 as well as
      those with a baseline NIHSS score > 30 are unlikely to benefit from thrombectomy. Patients
      with rapidly improving neurologic deficits likely will have an excellent recovery with
      conventional care, precluding the ability to detect a beneficial treatment effect of
      thrombectomy.

      Pilot data incorporating physiologic imaging has shown that appropriate patients can be
      selected for thrombectomy. This selection methodology has shown the ability to maintain the
      same level of safety and efficacy as those patients treated in the highly selective
      environment of a clinical trial, despite presenting far beyond accepted time based standards.
      Vertebrobasilar occlusion patients are excluded to maintain a homogenous study population,
      particularly since no data currently is available addressing the comparability of imaging
      penumbral patterns in the anterior vs. posterior circulation. This has also been shown to be
      reproducible at multiple centers and with different imaging modalities. However, all
      prospective interventional stroke studies performed to date have been restricted by the
      8-hour time window.
