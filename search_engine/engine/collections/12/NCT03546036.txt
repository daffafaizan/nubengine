      study is to evaluate the effect of weighted chain blankets on insomnia and other
      sleep-related symptoms for patients with Major depressive disorder, Bipolar disorder,
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or ADHD. Potential participants are asked to
      participate in a study comparing two different types of chain blankets, not mentioning the
      difference in weight. After signing a informed consent, participants were randomly assigned
      on a 50/50 basis to a weighted blanket containing metal chains weighing 8 kg or a control
      blanket containing plastic chains weighing 1,5 kg. Insomnia severity is assessed before and
      weekly until endpoint at four weeks use of the blanket by a rater blind to treatment
      allocation. Participants sleep will also be monitored by actigraphy. The controlled phase of
      the study is followed by a one year open follow up study where all participants are offered
      to use a weighted blanket of any type.
