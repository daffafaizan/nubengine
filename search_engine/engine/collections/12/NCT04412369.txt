      28% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with
      an increased mortality risk. However, the predominant aetiology of myocardial injury relating
      to COVID-19 remains unclear. The Troponin leak could either signify direct cardiac
      involvement in COVID-19 or serve as a non-specific marker of a severe systemic insult.
      Cardiac myocyte and endothelial angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor may provide a portal
      for viral infection in these cells.

      There have been numerous reports of acute myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. Other
      contributory mechanisms of cardiac Troponin elevation in patients with COVID-19 that are also
      driven by a proinflammatory state include acute myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic
      plaque rupture (type 1) or demand ischemia (type 2), endothelial and microvascular
      dysfunction, immune-mediated activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, and possibly
      stress cardiomyopathy.

      We aim to identify disease-specific patterns of myocardial injury in COVID-19 using
      non-invasive multi-modality cardiac imaging, paired with cytokine/chemokine testing,
      immunophenotyping of peripheral blood cells and coagulation profiles.

      A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the excess mortality risk attributable to
      myocardial injury in COVID-19 is needed and may help to improve patient care.
