      and partners' experiences of intimacy. Research with men in post-radical prostatectomy
      recovery indicates 25%-75% experience sexual dysfunction. Many patients experience anxiety
      and distress related to sexual difficulties. These experiences may progress and result in
      long-term problems in the relationship between patients and their partners. Despite apparent
      levels of effectiveness, up to half of the patients who turn to sexually assistive aids after
      surgical removal of the prostate discontinue use of the aids within one year. Additionally,
      difficulties in communicating about sexual impairments can significantly interfere with the
      couples' ability to achieve successful adaptation. We are interested in studying patient and
      partner experiences with sexual dysfunction in order to understand its effects on sexual and
      non-sexual intimacy.

      Participation in this study will involve completing 6 confidential face-to-face interviews on
      three separate occasions (3-6 months, 12-15 months, and 21-24 months post-surgery). On each
      occasion, participants will be required to take part in a "couple's" interview with his/her
      partner, as well as an individual interview. The interviews will provide participants with
      the opportunity to discuss the impact of sexual dysfunction on mood, thoughts, and
      communication with their partners. Demographic information will be collected at the initial
      interview. As well, at each of the 3 time points, participants will also be asked to complete
      a questionnaire package containing 6 psychological questionnaires. All questionnaires and
      interview material will be kept strictly confidential.
