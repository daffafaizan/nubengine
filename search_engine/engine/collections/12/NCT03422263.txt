    
      SGLT-2-Inhibitors have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type II
      diabetes mellitus. Present evidence shows this effect to be not directly related to better
      serum glucose levels because the effect was measurable within several days of initiation of
      the treatment.

      In a prospective single-centre double-blinded comparative observational study, other aspects
      of the effect of SGLT-2-Inhibitors shall be analyzed from patient registry, particularly the
      physical performance of patients under new treatment with SGLT-2-Inhibitors. Patient consent
      will be sort for the analysis of clinical data during the duration of stay.

      Patients included in the registry suitable for analysis shall be divided into 3 groups: I -
      Patients with type II diabetes mellitus under new treatment with an SGLT2-Inhibitor. II -
      Patients with type II diabetes mellitus without SGLT-2- Inhibitor medication. III - Patients
      without type II diabetes mellitus but with similar comorbidities to the previous groups.
