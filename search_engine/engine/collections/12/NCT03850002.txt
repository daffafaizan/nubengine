        1. Characterisation of the Zurich lung transplant cohort regarding CLAD status and
           pulmonary function impairment (cross-sectional, study part I)

        2. Evaluation of test-retest reliability of LCI in 20 clinically stable lung transplant
           recipients during three consecutive study visits (study part II)

        3. Prospective cohort study to test the ability of LCI to detect early CLAD in patients
           without prior CLAD (study part III)
