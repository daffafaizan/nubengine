      chronic renal failure, to clarify the correlation between the changes of Nailfold
      Microcirculation and renal function, and to explore whether nailfold microcirculation can be
      used as an indicator of renal microcirculation in patients with chronic renal failure, and to
      provide a noninvasive method for the clinical evaluation of renal microcirculation in
      patients with chronic renal failure.
