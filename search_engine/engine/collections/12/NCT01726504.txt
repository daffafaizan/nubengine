      on chronic functional constipation. Systematic reviews indicate that acupuncture is probably
      effective for the disease, but the evidence is limited. Recently, we have finished a
      multi-center clinical trial of individualized deep electro-acupuncture (EA) for chronic
      functional constipation (n=460, Registration ID: NCT00508482) which preliminarily showed EA
      was effective.

      This multi-center large-sample randomized controlled clinical trial of acupuncture for severe
      functional constipation is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of EA.

      This project is conducted by Chinese experts, supported by the Chinese Government. The
      research result is expected to provide high quality evidence of EA for chronic functional
      constipation.
