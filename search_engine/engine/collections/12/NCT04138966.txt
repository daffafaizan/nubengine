      detecting insufficient analgesia during general anesthesia, but they have not been
      investigated in patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgery. In this study, we will
      compare skin conductance (Medstorm, Norway) and nol-index (Medasense, Israel) w during
      noxious and non-noxious stimuli. This study is carried out on patients included in another
      study (Nol-Index Guided Remifentanil Analgesia Versus Standard Analgesia During
      Moderate-to-High Risk Cardiovascular Surgery).
