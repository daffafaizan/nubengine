      of using home telemonitoring technology in managing hypertension among patients with minor
      stroke/TIA (NIH Stroke Scale Score <5) at the VGH Stroke Prevention Clinic (SPC). The
      Vancouver Stroke Program SPC receives 1200 referrals per year for assessment of patients with
      strokes or TIAs. Of the total number of patients referred to the SPC, 45% were deemed as
      hypertensive patients through any one of: (1) medical history of hypertension, (2) on
      antihypertensive medications or (3) having blood pressure measurements above 140/90 mm Hg
      during their assessment at the clinic.

      This project, which includes baseline assessments of home supports and cognition, will assess
      the specific needs of the post-stroke population in determining feasibility of HBPTM and
      nurse-led hypertension treatment. Previous studies of aggressive hypertensive control
      regimens have shown that it takes approximately six months to consistently achieve target
      pressures (SPRINT, SPS3). Thus in this feasibility study, participants will be monitored for
      6 months using home telemonitoring technology.
