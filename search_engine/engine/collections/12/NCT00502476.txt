    
      This is a cluster randomized, crossover-controlled trial with wards as the units of
      randomization. The trial will predominantly take place in ICU's but may include any acute
      care ward that has active surveillance for MRSA and or VRE in place (i.e., Bone Marrow
      transplant units, Oncology wards, etc.) Units will be randomly assigned to utilize two
      bathing routines in a random order. Each bathing routine will be utilized on all admitted
      patients to the unit for a six month study period for a total study duration of 12 months.
      The two bathing routines will include either the use of the Comfort® Bath Washcloth System
      (control) or the use of 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloth. Randomized units will either start
      with 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloth for six months and then switch to Comfort™ Bath
      Washcloth for the remaining six month period or the reverse order. Data collection will
      include all surveillance and clinical cultures for MRSA and or VRE and all bloodstream
      infections.
