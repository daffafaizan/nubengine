      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium
      with or without irinotecan in patients with advanced malignancy.

      II. Assess the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine the clinical
      response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This a dose-escalation study of flavopiridol (FLAVO), fluorouracil (5-FU), and
      irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Groups I and II are conducted
      sequentially.

      Group I: Patients receive FLAVO IV over 24 hours on day 1 and leucovorin calcium (CF) IV and
      5-FU IV over 1.5 hours daily on days 2-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of FLAVO and 5-FU until the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) are determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      Group II: Once the MTDs for FLAVO and 5-FU are determined, patients receive FLAVO, CF, and
      5-FU as in group I plus irinotecan IV over 1.5 hours on day 1. Courses repeat as in group I.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the MTD is determined.
      The MTD is defined as in group I.

      Patients are followed at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 57-90 patients will be accrued for this study within 18
      months.
