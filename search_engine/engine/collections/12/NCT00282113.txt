      immaturity of their intestines and immune system. Probiotics are bacteria with healthful
      qualities that are taken by mouth to improve the number of healthy bacteria in the
      intestines. Probiotics have been shown in several studies outside the U.S. to decrease the
      risk of serious intestinal infection and in one small study to improve the rate of weight
      gain in premature infants. Prebiotics are food supplements that stimulate the growth of
      healthy bacteria and suppress the growth of unhealthy bacteria. Prebiotics have been shown to
      improve the numbers of healthy bacteria in the stool of premature babies. Our study is
      designed to compare two over the counter probiotic/prebiotic combinations to each other and
      to a control group. Infants less than 35 weeks with a birthweight of 750-2000 gm are eligible
      and must be enrolled in the study within the first week of life. The babies are randomly
      assigned to either a control group (no probiotic/prebiotic, just a placebo), a group which
      receives Culturelle (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG plus fructo-oligosaccharide, ConAgra), or a
      group which receives ProBioPlus (three strains of Bifidobacteria plus Lactobacillus
      acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharide, UAS Laboratories). The babies receive the study
      product by mouth twice daily for 28 days or until discharge (whichever comes first). Weekly
      measurements (weight, length, head size) and stool cultures are performed. Clinical progress
      is closely monitored and any episodes of infection are recorded.
