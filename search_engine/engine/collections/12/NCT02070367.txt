    
      We will test four groups: persons with CRPS of one upper extremity, persons with recent hand
      fractures (<12 weeks) or peripheral nerve injuries with residual sensory deficits at the time
      of the study, and healthy normal volunteers with a battery of assessments for CRPS, including
      a technique to precisely localize and quantify static mechanical allodynia.
