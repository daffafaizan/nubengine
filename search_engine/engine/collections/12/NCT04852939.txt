      treatment for the better, improved, and innovative noninvasive management of Adhesive
      Capsulitis. This study will help the physiotherapists in overcoming the challenges and
      barriers in the treatment. It will also help researchers in acquiring sufficient knowledge
      for further research on the Bowen technique and its various applications as this technique is
      not widely applied in the field of physical therapy treatment.
