    
      Female pregnant patients in their 2nd trimester will be evaluated for vaginal elasticity
      using vaginal tactile imaging. Vaginal elasticity will also be evaluated during the 3rd
      trimester and 6 weeks postpartum.

      Patients will be recruited and sign a consent form. Assessment of vaginal elasticity via
      vaginal tactile imaging will be performed at 3 different points:

        -  During the 2nd trimester.

        -  During the 3rd trimester.

        -  6 weeks postpartum. Every patient will serve as her own control. Demographic,
           gynecologic and obstetric history will be obtained from patients' electronic files.
