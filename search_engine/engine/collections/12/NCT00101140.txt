      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and antileukemia activity of haploidentical allogeneic peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation in patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia in
           first remission.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the early treatment-related mortality (before day 100) of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate a mismatch in the expression of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptors
           CD158a and CD158b with engraftment and disease recurrence in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive a preparative regimen comprising total-body irradiation twice on day -8;
      fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3; thiotepa IV over 2 hours twice on day -7;
      and antithymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -5 to -2. Patients undergo
      haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed at day 100, at least monthly for 2 years, and then periodically for 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.2 years.
