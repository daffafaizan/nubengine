      efficacy in achieving anesthesia for diagnostic and operative arthroscopy and for providing
      postoperative analgesia .although the knee joint has been examined most commonly, arthroscopy
      of other joints such as shoulder, ankle, wrist, metatarsophalangeal and temporomandibular
      joints is being increasingly used.

      Intra-articular installation of local anesthesia during arthroscopic procedures has been used
      by many orthopedic surgeons to provide pain relief after surgery.The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the analgesic efficacy of intra-articular dexamethasone versus fentanyl added as an
      adjuvant to bupivacaine in patients undergoing knee arthroscopic surgery
