    
      Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited ocular disorder
      associated with a mutation in mtDNA .The disease is a common cause of teenaged blindness in
      both eyes for which there is currently no effective treatment.

      In 2008, the investigators recognized that gene therapy for LHON could be performed not only
      theoretically but technically. The investigators have been carring out a series of basic and
      clinical studies from constructing the vectors to identifying and mitigating safety issues .
      After performing several animal experiments, the investigators had moved into clinical
      trials. In 2011, the investigators performed the first LHON gene therapy trial in the world,
      which was registered in December 2010 at ClinicalTrials.gov (Registration number: CT01267422)
      and was a preliminary study to verify the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for LHON . In
      the 36-month follow-up, the investigators found that six out of nine patients have vision
      improvement obviously and no adverse events were observed.

      This is a multi - center , prospective study of 120 patients with the G11778A mutation in
      Mt-DNA.This clinical trial recruited 20 patients with the 11778 mutation of MT-DNA onset
      within three months,20 between 3 to 6 months,20 between 6 to 12 months,20 between 12 to 24
      months,20 between 24 to 60 months,and 20 over 60 months.. All patients will be treated with a
      Single vitreous cavity injection of recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus-NADH dehydrogenase,
      subunit 4 (complex I)（rAAV2-ND4)（0.05ml), with dose 1 × 10^10 vg/0.05 mL .The eye of
      treatment is up to the time of onset.

      The visual acuity, visual field,visual evoked potential （VEP）,optical coherence tomography（
      OCT）, electroretinograms(ERG), retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL)and Liver and kidney function
      in plasma were compared after treatment at 1,2,3,6and 12 months interval.
