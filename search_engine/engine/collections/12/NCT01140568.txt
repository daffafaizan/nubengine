      most common primary brain tumor. Standard of care (surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide at
      initial diagnosis) results in a median survival of only 14 months. For patients with
      recurrent disease, conventional chemotherapy is generally ineffective with response rates
      <20%. Clearly there is need for improved treatments. Recent genome-wide studies have
      confirmed that GBM is a heterogeneous group of diseases that can be subclassified by shared
      genetic aberrations. The implication is that, in part, the underlying genetics may determine
      responsiveness to treatments and thus allow us to personalize therapy.

      This is an, open-label, non-randomized, phase II study with oral nilotinib in adult patients
      with biomarker-enriched, recurrent malignant gliomas who have developed tumor progression
      after standard therapy. Patients will be treated with oral nilotinib (starting with the
      labeled dose of 400 mg) daily until disease progression or intolerance. One cycle is defined
      as 28 days.

      Approximately 50 evaluable patients will be enrolled in this study, with 32 (grade IV) and 18
      (grade III) in separate arms.

      All patients will undergo clinical evaluation after each 28-day cycle. Neuroimaging studies
      (MRI) will be performed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and then after every 2 cycles (8
      weeks). If a contraindication for MRI's exists, patients will undergo contrast-enhanced CT
      scans. Laboratory tests will be obtained weekly during the first 4 weeks, and then on days 1
      and 15 of all subsequent cycles. Patients will remain on study medication unless they develop
      tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity.
