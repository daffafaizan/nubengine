      I. To assess the platelet count response to administration of weekly romiplostim patients
      with HCV infection whose initial platelet count is < 70,000/L.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of romiplostim the treatment of patients with HCV
      infection and thrombocytopenia; including physical symptoms and findings, hematologic, serum
      chemistries and liver function tests and adverse events.

      II. To assess the ability of romiplostim to enable subjects to achieve a platelet count
      sufficient to start antiviral therapy.

      III. To assess the ability of romiplostim to maintain platelet counts greater than 50,000/L
      while receiving antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks. Patients failing to
      achieve a platelet count of > 100,000/L cross over to arm I.

      Patients achieving a platelet count of > 100,000/L at 8 weeks receive PEG-interferon alfa-2a
      subcutaneously once weekly and oral ribavirin once daily. Treatment repeats every 7 days for
      24-48 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 and 36 weeks.
