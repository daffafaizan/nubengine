      of motor learning on the patients with brain damage caused by traumatic brain injury or
      stroke. Both anodal and cathodal tDCS will be used to test whether the increase of motor
      cortical activity by anodal tDCS over lesional side or the decrease of brain activity by
      cathodal tDCS on healthy side will improve the learning skill (SRTT: serial reaction time
      task). The result could help to understand the mechanism of motor and cognitive recovery
      after brain damage, and further rationalize the application of non-invasive brain stimulation
      such as tDCS for patient rehabilitation.
