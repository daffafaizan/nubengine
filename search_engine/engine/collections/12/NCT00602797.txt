      paclitaxel administered weekly to elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
      II. To assess the response rate of a combination of vinorelbine and paclitaxel administered
      weekly to elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. III. To assess the
      quality of life of elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer during
      administration of weekly paclitaxel and vinorelbine. OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine
      tartrate intravenously (IV) over 6-10 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6
      weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 5 years.
