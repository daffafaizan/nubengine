    
      The main aim of this study is to validate the [18F]FDG on PET/CT for the diagnosis of
      metastatic ganglions at the mediastinum in SUS patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma
      considering sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      accuracy. Other specific aims are:

        -  Analyze the diagnosis performance of the [18F]FDG on PET/CT in two timepoints (1 and 2
           hours after exam), in relation to the staging of the non-small cell lung carcinoma

        -  Evaluate the addition of the iodinated contrast in the [18F]FDG to improve the images
           obtained from the PET/CT in the staging of the non-small cell lung carcinoma
