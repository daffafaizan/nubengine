    
      This Clinical Experience Program is being initiated to expand the surgical and clinical
      practice knowledge about the use of STARflo for reducing intraocular pression (IOP) in
      patients suffering from open angle glaucoma in a real world population of patients.

      This program is designed to be an international multicenter observational study.

      Patient data may be collected retrospectively and/or prospectively for up to 5 years after
      surgery.

      The aim of this program is to document the patient's benefit following implantation of the
      STARflo implant in a real-word patient population, to learn about surgical practices and to
      collect data to support future cost-effectiveness analysis.
