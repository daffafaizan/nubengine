        -  Evaluate aberrant methylation patterns in tissue and serum samples from patients with
           early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to validate the Johns Hopkins single
           institutional study.

        -  Attempt to define subgroups of patients at greater risk for recurrent or metastatic
           disease who may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant therapeutic regimens.

        -  Develop prognostic indicators for disease-specific and overall survival.

        -  Define new potential molecular targets for therapy.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor and intrathoracic lymph node tissue samples are analyzed for aberrant
      DNA methylation (p16/CDKN2A, DAP kinase, H-cadherin, APC, and RASSF1A) by
      methylation-specific PCR. Analyses are then compared with the preliminary data from the Johns
      Hopkins institutional study.
