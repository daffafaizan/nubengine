      can be used to normalize insufficient vitamin d status and reduce atherosclerotic risk
      factors such as hypertension, inflammation and hyperlipidemia. The research question is
      whether Vitamin D3 reduces the level of systemic inflammation and whether Vitamin D3 has an
      effect on blood lipids.
