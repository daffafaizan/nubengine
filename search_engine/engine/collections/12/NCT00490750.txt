      requires surgical intervention. Although there are several controversial aspects of therapy
      for achalasia, laparoscopic myotomy is emerging as the procedure of choice. Several studies
      report having good to excellent outcomes following a laparoscopic procedure in approximately
      90% of patients. However, a main deterrent to long-term success is the development of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) despite the use of an antireflux procedure. For this
      reason, most surgeons add a partial fundoplication to the myotomy. The gastric fundus can
      either be wrapped anterior to the esophagus (Dor fundoplication), or posterior to the
      esophagus (Toupet fundoplication). Currently, the type of fundoplication is determined by
      surgeon's choice. There exists no systematic comparison of the two procedures. This
      multicenter, randomized study aims to evaluate patient outcomes following myotomy and Dor
      versus Toupet fundoplication.
