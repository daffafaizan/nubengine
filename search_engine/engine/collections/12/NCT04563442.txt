      human infection designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Bats and birds serve
      as the typical coronavirus hosts, with zoonotic spread and a long-documented history of
      animal-animal-human transmission. [1] Since November 2019, the rapid outbreak of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has recently become a public health emergency of international
      concern [2]. COVID-19 has contributed to an enormous adverse impact globally.

      As of 10 March 2020 there have been 113702 laboratory confirmed cases and 4012 deaths
      globally [3].

      According to the latest reports, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are heterogeneous
      [4-6]. On admission, 20-51% of patients were reported as having at least one comorbidity,
      with diabetes (10-20%), hypertension (10-15%) and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      diseases (7-40%) being most common [4, 5, 7]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
      presence of any comorbidity has been associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of developing
      acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with H7N9 infection [8]. As with influenza
      [9, 10], SARS-CoV [11] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [12],
      COVID-19 is more readily predisposed to respiratory failure and death in susceptible patients
      [5, 6].

      Although it is well documented that COVID-19 is primarily manifested as a respiratory tract
      infection, emerging data indicate that it should be regarded as a systemic disease involving
      multiple systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological,
      hematopoietic and immune system. [13] Mortality rates of COVID-19 are lower than SARS and
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [14]; however, COVID-19 is more lethal than seasonal
      flu.

      Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, but
      younger people without major underlying diseases may also present with potentially lethal
      complications such as fulminant myocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)
      [15].
