    
      1- To evaluate the effect of sildenafil on pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular
      function in hemodialysis patients with pulmonary hypertension.

        1. Primary outcome:

           ‚óè Reduction in estimated Pulmonary Artery pressure value (ePAP) in mmHg via
           transthoracic Doppler Echocardiography.

        2. Secondary outcomes:

             -  Detection of safety of sildenafil in hemodialysis patients.

             -  Finding out sildenafil's optimum dose for hemodialysis patients with pulmonary
                hypertension.
