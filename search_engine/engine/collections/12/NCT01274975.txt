    
      Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) represent an attractive and ethical cell
      source for stem cell therapy.

      With the recent demonstration of MSC homing properties, intravenous aplications of MSCs to
      cell-damaged diseases have increased.

      In a human clinical trial, eight male patients who had suffered a spinal cord injury were
      intravenously administered autologous hAdMSCs (4Ã—10e8 cells) one time.
