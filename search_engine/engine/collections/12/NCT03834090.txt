      various mechanisms that showed therapeutic efficacy. Owing to its positive outcomes,
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has recently been used in the treatment of
      musculoskeletal system diseases such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, calcific
      rotator cuff tendinopathies, and patellar tendinopathy
