      improved treatment strategies the focus of investigations is now on the medical, social, and
      economic sequelae of intensive multimodal treatment. This study aims to assess the functional
      outcome, quality of life and late sequelae in a representative sample of long-term survivors
      of Ewing sarcoma. The data recorded combined with standardized treatment data covering a
      30-year period will produce a data pool that is unique for its magnitude and will be used for
      the development of guidelines for further improvements of future bone sarcoma treatment.

      Working plan: The working plan provides for the assessment of functional outcome and quality
      of life by means of validated tools (TESS, SF36, PEDQOL) and objectively measuring daily
      activity patterns by using the Step Activity Monitor (SAM) in 600 long-term Ewing sarcoma
      survivors and a control group of 300 matched healthy subjects. Information on sarcoma
      treatment and follow-up is obtained by re-structuring and complementing the database of the
      relevant patient cohort (n=3000) from four consecutive nationwide and international clinical
      trials between 1980 and 2008. Procedures of local treatment will be evaluated regarding
      functional outcome, quality of life, and survival probability and prognostic factors
      predicting long-term outcome will be identified.

      Exploitation of results: The results will be presented at scientific meetings and will be
      published in international journals. Guidelines will be developed regarding improvements in
      the treatment, rehabilitation, and social integration of bone sarcoma patients to be utilized
      in guiding patients and in the decision process of medical professionals regarding their
      treatment. In the long run, the evidence based guidelines on treatment and follow-up are to
      be transferred into the health system.
