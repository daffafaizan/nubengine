      (micro-electro-mechanical system) hybrid motion sensor (three-axis accelerometer and
      three-axis gyroscope). The SNUMAP device consists of a wrist module and finger module, which
      attaches to an patients's finger and transmits three dimensional motions to a wrist module
      for storage and further analysis. The aims of this study is to assess tremor severity using
      tri-axial accelerometry and gyroscope to determine the reliability and the correlation with
      clinical measurements.
