      30-50 % within just a couple of years of stoma creation. Surgical parastomal hernia repair is
      a morbid and complicated procedure, with a 30-day reoperation rate of 13 % and 30-day
      mortality rate of 6 % in population-based surveys. There is no established gold standard
      diagnostic modality. Routinely, patients are examined clinically in various positions with
      and without increased intra-abdominal pressure. It has been shown in previous studies that
      clinical examination has a very low inter-observer reliability. Computerized tomography is
      often performed in addition to clinical examination, but is not ideal in diagnosing PSH
      either, not only beacause of insufficient test characteristics but also since the
      examinations should ideally be performed with specific protocols, prone position and be
      reviewed by a dedicated radiologist. The risk of incorrectly diagnosing a PSH (false
      positive) is that patients might subsequently be exposed to complex and dangerous surgical
      interventions without any health benefit, while incorrectly ruling out a PSH (false negative)
      can cause the patient to have to live with potentially treatable symptoms, life-threatening
      bowel incarceration being the most severe potential complication.

      Thus, improved diagnostic accuracy is required. A method that has been developed within our
      research group is endostomal tree-dimensional ultrasonography, which has preliminarily proven
      to be approximately as sensitive as CT, with a markedly higher specificity. A larger and less
      selected study needs to be conducted in order to reliably calculate test characteristics,
      predictive values and likelihood ratio.
