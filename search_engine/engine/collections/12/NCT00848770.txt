      of the two strategies:1) infusion of 500 to 1000ml of saline solution and/or norepinephrine
      solution to increase de systolic pressure or 2) infusion of esmolol or nitroprussiate
      solution to decrease de pressure. Every patient will have a transcranial doppler study in the
      first 24h to measure the mean velocity of cerebral arteries.
