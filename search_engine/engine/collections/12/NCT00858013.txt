      Previous treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (metformin, a-glucosidase inhibitor,
      nateglinide or sulfonylurea) will be discontinued. After a 1 month wash-out period (if 6.5 ≤
      HbA1c ≤ 8.5), patients will take randomly assigned drugs for 24 months.

      Patients will be met by the trial investigator every 3 months following randomization. At
      each visit, patients whose HbA1c is > 8.0% will be retested 2 weeks later, and if the
      retested HbA1c is also above 8.0%, those patients will be withdrawn considering monotherapy
      failure. We will evaluate the durability of nateglinide in comparison with that of
      glimepiride based on the withdrawal rate.
