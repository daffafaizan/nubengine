      occupational exposure of yardmen at poultry farms.

      As three uptake-routes, oral, inhalation and dermal, are conceivable all three cases will be
      investigated. After administration blood and urine samples will be analysed for enrofloxacin
      and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin at several time points. The objective of this
      exemplarily study is to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics of the different uptake
      routes. If different exposure routes are characterized by different pharmacokinetics, such
      studies can be used to obtain a better understanding of general routes of exposure in
      occupational environments. On the basis of the results mitigation strategies can be
      developed, reducing the risk of exposure.
