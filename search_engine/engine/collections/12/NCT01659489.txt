    
      Adnexal torsion, is a severe, though uncommon gynecological emergency, with a prevalence of
      2.7-3% (Taskin 1998; Hibbard1985;Burnett 1988). Torsion commonly occurs in children and women
      of childbearing age (Haskins 1986).

      The need for prompt diagnosis and treatment in order to save ovarian tissue has been realized
      a long time ago (Ben-Arie 1995). The accuracy of clinical diagnosis is low, with a false
      negative rate of up to 56% (Cohen 2001, Bar-On 2010,Mashiach 2010). Doppler ultrasound tests,
      do not "necessarily exclude an ovarian torsion; in fact, "the diagnosis of" torsion is missed
      in 60% of cases, and time to diagnosis in these cases is delayed" (Pena 2001).

      Therefore there is a need for a marker that will aid in the diagnosis of torsion and prevent
      missed diagnosis and unecessary loss of ovarian tissue, while not increasing the rate of
      unecessary laparoscopic interventions, which are often performed in an emergency setup, by
      unqualified personnel.

      To our knowledge, such marker has not been found. The purpose of this study is to find a
      marker, or marker combination, using blood/serum from patients undergoing laparoscopy for
      suspected ovarian torsion study type: a prospective, controlled, blind study study
      population: 200 women undergoing laparoscopy for ovarian torsion
