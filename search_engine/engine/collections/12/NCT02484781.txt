    
      A group of 58 patients, part of a ungoing randomized trial comparing resurfacing hip
      arthroplasty to metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty, will be invited to a single gait
      analysis on a trendmill. All patients have reached a follow up of five years. Patient 's gait
      will be assessed during two walking sessions, in both sessions spatio-temporal, kinetic and
      kinematic parameters will be recorded.

        -  At first when flat walking with increasing speeds to their top walking speed.

        -  Secondly: when walking at a fixed speed with an increasing incline to their top walking
           incline.
