      epidural space in the form of DepoDur® either alone or following a dose of lidocaine also
      given in the epidural space. Specifically, we are looking at pregnant women undergoing
      cesarean delivery who will be receiving these medications. A secondary objective is to
      evaluate how well DepoDur® works for pain control, as well as its safety, when it is given
      either alone or following a dose of epidural lidocaine.
