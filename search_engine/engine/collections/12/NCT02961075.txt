    
      Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is the essential procedures for diagnosis and treatment of
      respiratory diseasesã€‚ Fever following FOB has been frequently reported. Fever is usually
      caused by patient discomfort and delay recovery from illness, or even worse. The reported
      frequency of this complication ranges from 1 to 20%. According to previous reports,
      postbronchoscopy fever is associated with advanced age, the presence of abnormal
      bronchoscopic findings,documented endobronchial obstruction, bronchoscopic intervention for
      malignancy, BAL, bronchial brushing, endotoxin contamination during bronchoscopy,
      instillation of topical anesthetic through the bronchoscope, abnormal differential cell
      counts in the BAL fluid (BALF), bacterial growth in the BALF culture,and the severity of
      bleeding. At present, guidelines recommend sedation and analgesia combined with airway
      surface anesthesia for Fiberoptic bronchoscopy. laryngeal spray and cricothyroid anesthesia
      often used in clinical.Cricothyroid local anesthesia has a good effect, but it is an invasive
      operation, this is risk factors for fever after bronchoscopy.Therefore, to compare fever in
      the two kinds of airway anesthesia on Bronchoscopy . So as to provide the local anesthesia
      method with little influence on the patient.
