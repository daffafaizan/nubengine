    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      - To determine the progression-free survival rate in participants with relapsed or refractory
      small cell lung cancer who have received one prior regimen of systemic chemotherapy at 8
      weeks

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate (as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria and changes in blood
           flow/perfusion as measured by perfusion CT)

        -  To determine median and overall survival

        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of pazopanib in this patient population.

      Exploratory

        -  To analyze levels of circulating biomarkers from blood and urine samples obtained
           serially throughout the study and assess the utility of individual or subsets of these
           proteins to serve as a surrogate marker for treatment effect, treatment efficacy, and
           for tumor progression

        -  To measure and investigate the use of monocytes as surrogate markers of angiogenesis
           inhibition

        -  To analyze the subject population by identification of intra-tumoral biomarkers (such as
           c-kit, VEGF receptors, and microvessel density measured in available tumor biopsies)
           associated with the efficacy, safety and resistance to pazopanib

        -  To assess the utility of perfusion CT scan in evaluating changes in anti-angiogenic
           activity as a measure of treatment efficacy

      STATISTICAL DESIGN: This study uses a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of cetuximab
      based on progression-free rate (PFR) at week 8 defined as complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. The null and alternative PFR
      are 30% and 50%. If fewer than 4 patients enrolled in the stage one cohort (n=15 patients)
      achieve SD or better than accrual would not proceed to stage two (n=15 patients). If 13 or
      more patients are progression-free of the 30 patients then the null hypothesis will be
      rejected. The probability that the treatment will be considered promising if the true PFR
      rate was 30% is 8.4% and 82% if the true PFR rate was 50%.
