      is to evaluate and observe Anlotinib (12mg,QD, PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle) combined with
      Pemetrexed(500mg/m2,IV,d15-21,21 days per cycle)and Carboplatin(AUC5,IV,d15-21,21 days per
      cycle,4 cycles) as the first-line treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC
      .After four cycles of induction,patients continued to receive Anlotinib and Pemetrexed.As the
      report,The median PFS of advanced NSCLC treated by Pemetrexed and Carboplatin was 6 months.We
      expect the median PFS of Anlotinib combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin as the first-line
      treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC was 10 months.Using PASS15, we
      calculated the sample size of this study was 34(α=0.05、β=0.2), according to 20% censoring,the
      expected sample size is 43.
