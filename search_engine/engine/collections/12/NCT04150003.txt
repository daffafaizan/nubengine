    
      An experimental multicenter study is proposed , randomized according to parallel assignation
      and blinded to third ones to evaluate the effect of a 10-weeks structured exercise-based
      intervention protocol on the restoration of lung blood flow after an acute PE.

      Main objective is to compare the efficacy and safety in terms of quantitative measures from
      lung scintigraphy, of lung perfusion versus usual care in patients with PE. Additionally the
      study is aimed to identify bio-markers of response to treatment (mRNAs, MPs and proteomic
      approach) and to analyze the effects of training on exercise capacity, quality of life
      parameters and anxiety depression scores.
