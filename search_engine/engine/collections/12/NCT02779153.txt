    
      Acthar is currently labeled for use during an exacerbation or for maintenance therapy in
      selected SLE cases, however data from prospective trials on hematologic manifestations of SLE
      are not available. Due to the potential effect of lowering or eliminating autoantibodies, the
      absence of bone marrow suppression, and a steroid sparing effect, Acthar may represent a
      novel therapeutic option in recalcitrant cases of hematologic SLE.
