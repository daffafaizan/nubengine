      I. Determine whether infertility and/or biomarkers of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis
      differ in male osteosarcoma survivors treated with cisplatin with or without ifosfamide
      compared to male controls without a history of cancer.

      II. Evaluate whether cisplatin with or without ifosfamide for the treatment of osteosarcoma
      alters sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the role of genetic susceptibility in the development of impairments in
      spermatogenesis or steroidogenesis with contemporary regimens for the treatment of
      osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a health questionnaire over 30-45 minutes. Patients also provide saliva
      and semen samples and undergo collection of blood.
