      I. To assess baseline knowledge and risk perceptions about the use of conventional and new
      and emerging tobacco products among a subset of community college students from the two
      participating Houston Community College (HCC) campuses (Central and Coleman campuses). (Phase
      1.1) II. Test the text messages with university students enrolled in the health
      communications academic programs. (Phase 1.2) III. Assess the awareness, attitudes,
      receptivity, and comprehension of the harmful effects of conventional and new and emerging
      tobacco products among young adults. (Phase 2) IV. Identify the most effective combinations
      of text message framing for communicating information about the potential harmful effects of
      tobacco products to young adults. (Phase 2) V. To obtain an objective measure of the
      psychological (i.e., emotional and cognitive) effect of the messages on young adults. (Phase
      3)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define and analyze key moderators of young adult awareness, attitudes, receptivity, and
      understanding of the harmful risks and constituents of conventional, new and emerging tobacco
      products. (Phase 2)

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Participants attend focus group over 2 hours.

      PHASE II: Participants receive 2 text messages per day for 30 days at baseline and after 3
      months.

      PHASE III: Participants read 64 computer messages with or without images over 30 minutes and
      have their facial expressions assessed.
