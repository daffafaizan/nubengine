      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with topotecan hydrochloride and bevacizumab who have failed prior
           systemic chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Measure time-to-event efficacy variables, including time to objective tumor response
           (for responding patients), duration of response (for responding patients), time to
           treatment failure, and overall survival.

        -  Characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15 and Avastin (bevacizumab) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months from
      registration.
