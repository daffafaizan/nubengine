      condition is associated with life and limb-threatening complications. Symptoms of PAD range
      from intermittent claudication-defined as fatigue or discomfort in calf, buttock, or thigh
      muscles on exertion that is relieved by rest-to critical limb ischemia-defined as distal leg
      pain at rest with or without ischemic ulcers Despite many advances in endovascular surgery,
      amputations of digits and limbs are not uncommon. Thus, the present-day approach is to
      prevent the disorder in the first place. There are many evidences that support changes in
      lifestyle can significantly decrease the rate of progression of the disease and improve the
      quality of life in addition to aerobic training exercise and manual therapy .
