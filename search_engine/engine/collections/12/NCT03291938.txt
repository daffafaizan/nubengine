    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of IACS-010759, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in subjects with any advanced solid tumor and lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate IACS-010759 pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity (including
      overall response rate and duration of response).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pharmacodynamic and exploratory predictive biomarkers of activity of
      IACS-010759.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 orally (PO)
      once daily (QD) on days 1-7 of cycle 1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 PO QD on
      days 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and then on days 1, 8, and 15 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 2 years.
