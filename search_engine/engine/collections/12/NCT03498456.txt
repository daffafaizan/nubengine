      demonstrate the non-inferiority of tegoprazan triple therapy (TAC) to lansoprazole triple
      therapy (LAC) in terms of H. pylori eradication rate and to evaluate the safety of tegoprazan
      in H. pylori positive patients after oral administration of therapy for 7 days, twice daily.
      After the treatment, UBT test will be conducted to confirm the Helicobacter pylori
      eradication.
