        -  Compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed
           tomography (CT), and clinical FIGO staging in patients with invasive cervical cancer.

        -  Compare the accuracy of MRI, CT, and clinical FIGO staging in the evaluation of
           morphologic tumor prognostic factors in FIGO stage IB1 and stage IB2 and greater in
           these patients.

        -  Examine the value of imaging assessment of tumor prognostic factors (alone or in
           combination) as predictors of recurrence within 2 years of surgery in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life in the 12-month period after staging and treatment to
           potentially change staging accuracy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo a computed tomography scan with iodinated contrast dye followed by a
      magnetic resonance imaging scan with or without contrast comprising gadopentetate dimeglumine
      or vice versa.

      Within 6 weeks of first protocol imaging study, patients undergo one of the following
      surgeries:

        -  Laparoscopic, transabdominal, or transvaginal hysterectomy

        -  Extrafascial total abdominal hysterectomy

        -  Trachelectomy Quality of life is assessed at 1 and 12 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 465 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
