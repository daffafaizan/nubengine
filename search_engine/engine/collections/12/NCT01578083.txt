      especially in the domains of executive function (planning and problem solving), attention,
      learning, and information processing. The etiology of these chemotherapy-associated
      impairments remains unknown, although recent neuroimaging studies suggest that disruption of
      white matter integrity may play a role. With continued use of chemotherapy in breast cancer
      patients, this study's novel use of functional neuroimaging will be significant to better
      inform practitioners and patients of potential consequences to anticipate and serve as a
      starting point in the development of therapeutic interventions.
