      phase was a prospective evaluation of the effect of a well known "statin" drug (Lipitor) on
      different biochemical factors measured in the blood. The eligible study participants had
      blood work done upon enrollment and if criteria was met(according to the Adult Treatment
      Panel III), they were given dietary counseling (NYHA - New York Heart Association Step 1
      diet) as a lead in phase. Lab work was repeated at 3 weeks to evaluate the impact of the diet
      and if participant's profile still met criteria for MBS,randomization for either atorvastatin
      (Lipitor) 80mg or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks took place.
