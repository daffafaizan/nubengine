      balance to favor an effective T-cell mediated antitumor response resulting to an enhanced
      response in conjunction with pembrolizumab. Bavituximab is a chimeric (human/mouse)
      monoclonal antibody that targets phosphatidylserine (PS). PS facilitates the recognition and
      clearance of dying cells, triggering the release of immunosuppressive cytokines and
      inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Within the tumor microenvironment, PS
      polarizes macrophages toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Bavituximab upregulates the
      adaptive T cell-mediated response through crosslinking FCRÎ³ and dampening of signaling
      between PS and PS receptors on immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

      Thus, the investigators are doing this phase II single arm study to determine if bavituximab
      could potentially synergize with PD-1 inhibitor therapy to generate an effective anti-tumor
      immune response in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer
      (HNSCC) who progressed on a PD-1 inhibitor.
