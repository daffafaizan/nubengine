      study of the curative effect of extended thymectomy performed through the subxiphoid-right
      video-thoracoscopic approach with double elevation of the sternum versus intercostal
      video-thoracoscopic approach, divided into subxiphoid and intercostal groups. Communicating
      with the surgeon and patients who meet the inclusion criteria, decide whether to enter the
      subxiphoid or intercostal group. Subxiphoid group with subxiphoid-right video-thoracoscopic
      approach under double elevation of the sternum in extended thymectomy , intercostal group
      with traditional intercostal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in extended thymectomy. By
      collecting personal information of two groups of patients and the corresponding observation
      indicators to analyze whether the subxiphoid-right VATS approach with double elevation of the
      sternum is the least invasive and the most complete technique of VATS thymectomy.
