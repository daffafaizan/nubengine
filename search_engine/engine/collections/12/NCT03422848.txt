      independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease
      and premature death. The main physiological role of vasopressin is to maintain constant
      plasma osmolality. Previous studies in rats and mendelian randomization studies in humans
      suggest causality between elevated vasopressin concentration and elevated plasma glucose
      concentration. As vasopressin can be suppressed by increasing water intake, we hypothesize
      that water supplementation in individuals with high vasopressin can lower plasma glucose and
      prevent diabetes.

      The aim of this project is to test in a single-centre randomized clinical trial (RCT), if
      water supplementation in subjects with high plasma levels of vasopressin (measured by a
      stable vasopressin marker of its precursor hormone called copeptin) can reduce fasting levels
      of glucose (primary outcome measure), risk of new-onset diabetes and other cardiometabolic
      risk factors (secondary outcome measures).
