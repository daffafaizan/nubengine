      assessed on the same night than the main outcome, that is the difference in PtcO2 between
      5:00 AM and 12:00AM. Microvascularisation will be assessed by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging
      Analysis (LASCA).

      Sample size is estimated at 60 patients based on previous revascularisation studies having
      PtcO2 as main outcome.

      An intermediary analysis is planned after 40 inclusions.
