    
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of two dose-schedule arms(s) of pacritinib
      (pooled once-daily [QD] and twice-daily [BID] dosing arms) with that of best available
      therapy (BAT) in patients with thrombocytopenia and primary myelofibrosis (PMF),
      post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF), or post-essential thrombocythemia
      myelofibrosis (PET-MF). The efficacy co-endpoints for this analysis are the proportion of
      patients achieving a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to Week 24, as measured
      by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan and the proportion of
      patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in total symptom score (TSS) from baseline to Week 24 as
      measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form 2.0 (MPN-SAF TSS 2.0).
