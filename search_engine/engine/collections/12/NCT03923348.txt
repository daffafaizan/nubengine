      may provide subjects with a more accessible, private method of undergoing pelvic floor muscle
      training (PFMT) with real-time biofeedback on performance. The leva® Pelvic Digital Health
      System by Renovia Inc is a novel tool for subjects with urinary incontinence to train and
      strengthen pelvic floor muscles via directional mechano-transductive feedback on performance
      in the privacy of their own homes. We hypothesize that women using the leva® System will
      experience significant improvements in subjective urge-related incontinence symptoms. In
      addition, changes in incontinence-related quality of life and UUI episode frequency will be
      determined.
