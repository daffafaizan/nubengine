      mass index (BMI), including obese group (O group, n=8, 25≤BMI≤39.9kg/m²) and morbidly obese
      group (M group, n=8, BMI≥40kg/m²).

      Vecuronium was continuous infusing to maintain moderate neuromuscular blockade during the
      laparoscopic surgery and stopped infusing after the laparoscopic procedure. A single dose
      administration of sugammadex (Sug) 2.0mg/kg according to ideal body weight (IBW) was given at
      the reappearance of the second twitch of the train-of-four (TOF) response.

      On one hand, venous blood samples were obtained before administration of Sug and at 2, 3, 5,
      10, 15, 20, 30, 60 minutes and 2, 4, 6, 8 hours after administration of Sug to determine
      plasma concentration of Sug using HPLC-MS. On the other hand, time from start of
      administration of Sug to recovery of TOF ratio to 0.9 and other clinical indicators were also
      recorded.
