    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      tegavivint administered as an IV infusion over 4 hours, once weekly for 3 weeks, followed by
      a 1 week rest, in a 28-day cycle to pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory solid
      tumors, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and desmoid tumors. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II. To
      preliminarily define antitumor activity of tegavivint in pediatric patients with recurrent or
      refractory Ewing sarcoma, liver tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and hepatoblastoma),
      osteosarcoma, Wilms tumor, desmoid tumors, and tumors with Wnt pathway aberrations. (Phase 2)
      III. To define and describe the toxicities of tegavivint administered on this schedule.
      (Phase I) IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of tegavivint in pediatric patients with
      recurrent or refractory cancer. (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of tegavivint for pediatric patients with
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors, including lymphoma and desmoid tumors within the confines
      of a Phase 1 study.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test whether baseline activity of the WNT/beta catenin pathway correlates with clinical
      response using archived tumor tissue.

      II. To characterize pharmacodynamic changes in tumor tissue to examine target engagement by
      tegavivint.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tegavivint intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12
      months, every 6 months for 24 months, and then annually for 60 months.
