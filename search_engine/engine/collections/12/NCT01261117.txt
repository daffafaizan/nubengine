      tolerance in closure of patent ductus arteriosis in extremely-low-birth-weight preterm
      infants.Seventy ELBW preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosis will be enrolled in this
      prospective-randomized study. Patients will receive either intravenous or oral ibuprofen at
      an initial dose of 10 mg/kg, followed by 5 mg/kg at 24 and 48 h.

      One of the following echocardiographic criteria of a duct size >1.5 mm, a left
      atrium-to-aorta ratio >1.5, left-to-right shunting of blood, end diastolic reversal of blood
      flow in the aorta, or poor cardiac function in addition signs of patent ductus arteriosis
      determined the need of ibuprofen treatment.
