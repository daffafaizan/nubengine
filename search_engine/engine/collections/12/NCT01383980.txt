      care for patients with prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) who cannot eat food
      on their own. Tube feeding means that a tube has been placed in a patient's stomach or small
      intestine to provide nutrition.

      When a patient is scheduled for an elective surgery, he/she usually has nothing to eat after
      midnight prior to the operation. A fasting period before surgery is done to avoid possible
      side effects during the placement of a breathing tube. Having an empty stomach is thought to
      decrease the chances of vomiting or aspiration while a breathing tube is placed. (Aspiration
      occurs when a substance, such as food provided by a tube feed, enters the airway.) However,
      some patients already have a breathing tube in place. The investigators do not know which is
      better for patients who already have a breathing tube in place: continuing feedings up until
      surgery or stopping them the night before.

      The investigators hypothesize intubated surgical patients randomized to a protocol of feeding
      up until the point of surgery will have the safe delivery of more calories as compared to a
      group whose feeding is held at midnight prior to surgery.
