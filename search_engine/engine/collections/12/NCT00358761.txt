    
      Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI) is a rash similar to the rash of Lyme disease
      that occurs in persons residing in southeastern and south-central states and is associated
      with the bite of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum. The cause of the rash is unknown,
      as it is the natural course of the disease. This protocol aims to investigate the cause of
      STARI, in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Skin biopsies
      and blood samples will be taken from patients with suspected STARI and will be used to search
      for an infectious agent and to develop diagnostic tests for the disease.
