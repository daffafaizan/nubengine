      In January 2018, investigators have introduced The French Ambulatory C section (FAUCS) in the
      study unit. It is an innovative approach for CS. combining a left paramedian incision , an
      extra peritoneal access to the uterus and a purse-string double-layer closure of the uterus.
      Since that date, two doctors practice it regularly. However, the diffusion of this technique
      requires its integration into the curriculum of residency. Currently, there is no study on
      the learning procedure of FAUCS.

      In our study, investigators will determine the mean number of procedures needed for trainees
      to master FAUCS.

      Once the resident will master the procedure, investigators will study his skills evolution
      every 5 surgeries performed alone.
