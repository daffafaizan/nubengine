      (called a mutation) in a gene called FLT3. The presence of a FLT3 mutation can be used to
      direct treatment options.

      This is an open-label phase II study. Patients will receive standard chemotherapy of
      daunorubicin and cytarabine during Induction and high-dose cytarabine during Consolidation.
      Patients will be randomized to gilteritinib or midostaurin. After approximately 90 patient's
      complete treatment, a review of the effectiveness of gliteritinib compared to midostaurin
      will be done. If gilteritinib is not as effective as midostaurin, the study may be stopped.

      Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be done on Day 21 after start of Induction and after
      Induction to assess response. Patients with a complete response may proceed to consolidation
      chemotherapy. Another bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be done after the first cycle of
      consolidation is complete.

      Mandatory prescreening bone marrow and/or blood samples are required for FLT3 testing. Any
      left-over samples will be requested for future research (optional).

      Mandatory bone marrow samples for research are required after Induction and Consolidation.
