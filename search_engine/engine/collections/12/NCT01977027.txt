      strategy' to facilitate adaptation, repetition and relearning to restore hand function after
      stroke. The three aims are: to restore adaptation (Aim 1), facilitate grasp efficiency and
      normal directional biases during repetition (Aim 2), and enhance the rate of learning to
      improve hand function and quality of life post stroke (Aim 3).

      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that alternate hand training will increase the rate of learning
      and lead to greater improvement in hand function. The results will inform dosing of therapy
      for optimal relearning.
