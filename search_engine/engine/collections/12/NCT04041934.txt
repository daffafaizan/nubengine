      Three measurement sessions will be performed for each teenager. Each session will be
      conducted over a week. Each teenager will participate in three protein enrichment sessions:
      PROT1 session, PROT2 session, and Tryptophan ratio (Trp) / neutral amino acids (AAN)
      reference session (PROT REF) (PROT1: ratio = 0.07, PROT2 session: ratio = 0.11 and PROT REF
      session: ratio = 0.04). During these sessions the protein intake will be doubled with regard
      to recommended dietary intakes through the consumption of protein shakes (from 0.8 g per kg
      of body weight to 1.6 g per kg).

      At each session:

        -  2 EEG sleep assessments

        -  2 evaluations of the biological profile from fasting blood samples

        -  2 evaluations of melatonin peak from salivary specimens

        -  1 assessment of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle

        -  1 evaluation of the metabolic response to submaximal exercise

        -  1 assessment of muscle strength and fatigue

        -  1 assessment of cognitive performance Control of food intake (3 days at RDI + 3 days
           with doubled protein intake) will be achieved by preparing meals and weighing food. An
           evaluation of the ad libitum food intake of the 7th day will be carried out by the
           weighing method.
