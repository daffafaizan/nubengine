      Patients with IMR >30 will be randomised to 20 mg alteplase or placebo (NaCl) administered in
      the culprit vessel through a microcatheter. Magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the myocardium
      will be performed early (2-6 days) and late (3 months) to estimate the primary endpoint
      (infarct size).

      10 non-randomised patients, with IMR <30, will undergo the same follow-up as the randomised
      patients.

      Clinical events for all randomised and non-randomised patients will be collected from Swedish
      national registries and by telephone at 3 and 12 months.
