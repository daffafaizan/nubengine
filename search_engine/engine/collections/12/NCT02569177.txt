        1. To obtain an estimate of the association between a new very early marker of
           postoperative myocardial injury H-FABP and postoperative myocardial infarction.

        2. To obtain an estimate of the association between cTn-I and postoperative myocardial
           infarction.

        3. To obtain an estimate of the correlation between H-FABP elevation and cTn-I elevation in
           patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
