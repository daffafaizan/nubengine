      method for MSSA/MRSA-proof (cobas®LIAT®-System, Roche Molecular Systems Inc.) is technically
      established and integrated in Emergency Department procedures. After evaluation of processes
      and sample handling the second phase of this study assesses the prevalence of positive
      MSSA/MRSA-POC-testing in the general ED-population and in different risk groups. Based on the
      results of the previous study phases, the final phase comprises an interventional
      pre-post-comparison study. The interventional study assesses the impact of POC-result guided
      early decolonisation of MSSA/MRSA-colonized patients on in-hospital infection rates with
      MSSA/MRSA.
