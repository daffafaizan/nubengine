      design. In this study, ST36 (Zusanli) and ST37 (Shangjuxu) were selected for
      electroacupuncture treatment, accompanied with evaluating the effects on intestinal function
      in septic patients. Meanwhile, the blood biochemical indexes such as heme oxygenase-1(HO-1),
      PTEN induced putative kinase 1(PINK1), polo-like kinase 1(PLK1) and interleukin-6 are
      detected. To clarify the effect of electroacupuncture on sepsis-induced intestinal
      dysfunction is of great significance to the clinical applications and popularization of
      traditional acupuncture treatment across the world.
