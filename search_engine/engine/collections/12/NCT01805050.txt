      arthroscopically intervention to correct the anterior instability in the shoulder joint with
      one primary parameter (WOSI-Score) and several secondary parameters, which are used in the
      daily clinical routine (e.g.clinical examination, several questionnaires). The results of
      these parameters will be used to document the mid-term results (> 1 year after surgery).
