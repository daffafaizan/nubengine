      models account for 90% of the mouthguards of the sporting population. But a majority of these
      devices do not appear to comply with the European Directive 89/686 / European Economic
      Community.

      A previous work consisted of the production of prototypes of mouthguards meeting the
      essential requirements of the directive. These prototypes were the subject of a patent filed
      by the Bordeaux University and the Bordeaux University Hospital.

      The aim of this study is to the validate the prototypes for a future launch on the market.
