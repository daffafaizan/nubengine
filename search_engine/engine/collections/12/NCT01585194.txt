      I. Overall response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival. II. Median overall survival. III. One-year overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Tissue and blood correlates to define immune infiltration and signatures as a result of
      treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab
      IV over 90 minutes during weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients not experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxicity by
      week 12 of the induction phase receive nivolumab IV every 2 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 60 days.
