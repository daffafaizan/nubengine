    
      This is a VA-based study to evaluate serum and nasal wash antibody responses to seasonal LAIV
      of healthy Veterans and VA employees between the ages of 20 and 49 years old.

      Specific Aims

        1. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether people with high mucosal IgA
           antibodies against flu have a lower immune response to the seasonal LAIV.

        2. The secondary objective is to determine whether the nasal wash viral neutralization data
           predicts LAIV immunization failures.
