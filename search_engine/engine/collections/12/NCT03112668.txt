      I. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of couples' acceptance and commitment therapy
      (ACT) (C-ACT).

      II. To collect pilot data on the impact of C-ACT on patients' and partners' anxiety,
      depression, and quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and their partners attend 6 weekly ACT sessions over 60-75 minutes. Couples learn
      skills of acceptance, avoidance, awareness, values and committed action, mindfulness and
      values in relationships, and handling persistent worries and concerns. Patients and their
      partners also do homework assignment after each session.

      After completion of the study, patients and their partners are followed up at 1 week.
