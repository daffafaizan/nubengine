    
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, placebo controlled, parallel group study.
      The study treatment period is approximately 6 months and observation period is approximately
      7 months. There are three parallel treatment groups: in-person nutritional counseling,
      nutritional counseling using an e-Health App, and standard care. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization scheme. Subjects in the
      two intervention arms will be given caloric recommendations designed to cause weight
      stability or modest weight gain, depending on their current BMI and weight loss history. All
      participants in the intervention arms will receive counseling either in-person or remotely
      through the App by registered dietitians (RD) working in the Bionutrition department of the
      Clinical Research Center at MGH. At MGH, approximately 150 ALS subjects (50 per treatment
      group) will be enrolled. Approximately 75-150 PD and HD subjects will enroll.
