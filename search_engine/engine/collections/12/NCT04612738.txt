      diverse communities is to determine whether playing a serious conversation game called Hello
      is more effective than other advance care planning (ACP) approaches, or usual care (i.e.,
      simply distributing an advance directive [AD]). The investigators will randomize 75
      underserved communities across the US. The primary outcome is completion of a visually
      verified AD; secondary outcomes include performance of other ACP behaviors.

      Many Black/African Americans and Latina/Latino patients are more likely to receive low
      quality end-of- life medical care than White individuals- in fact, they are 3 times more
      likely than white Americans to die after a lengthy intensive care unit stay. Advance care
      planning (ACP)- the process of discussing one's wishes with loved ones and clinicians, and
      then documenting them in an advance directive (AD)- can help reduce these health inequities
      by preventing costly/burdensome treatments that are unlikely to reduce suffering or improve
      quality of life. Though ~60% of Americans engage in ACP, <25% of underserved populations have
      done so- in large part due to distrust of the healthcare system/clinicians, and reluctance to
      discuss death and dying.

      This study leverages underserved communities' existing, trusted social networks to deploy two
      community-based ACP interventions and study their mechanisms of action. By identifying which
      interventions increase engagement in ACP in underserved communities (and why), this project
      will help improve quality of end-of-life care, reduce unnecessary suffering, and end-of-life
      healthcare costs which conserves public health resources.
