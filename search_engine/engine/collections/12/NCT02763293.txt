      Association of Enfermos de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa (ACCU) The participants were allocated to
      two different groups depending on their possibility of participation in the therapeutic
      sessions. The group that received the therapy was called experimental group (EG) and the
      group, who did not, control group (CG). The participants were allocated independently of
      their disease status (outbreak or remission).

      An experimental study carried out during a period of four weeks in order to explore the
      effect of the specific treatment on the following outcomes: global quality of life, quality
      of life in CD and pain.

      The participants, in the EG were treated in three sessions, that lasted 45 minutes, during
      the study duration (1 session each 9-10 days). The physiotherapist who applied the treatment
      had an extensive experience in manual therapy.

      Both groups come to laboratory two times for the assessment, one at the beginning of the
      study and the other one at the end. In each session several questionnaires were administered
      by a physiotherapist who was blinded to the group assignment.
