      Primary:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CDP1 in patients with advanced solid tumor, to
      explore the dose limited toxicity (DLT), and to determine the recommended dose (RP2D) for
      phase II clinical trial.

      Secondary:

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CDP1 in patients with advanced solid tumor.

      To evaluate the immunogenicity of CDP1 in patients with advanced solid tumor.

      To evaluate the initial efficacy of CDP1 in patients with advanced solid tumor.
