      dopamine, serotonin, and histamine receptors, thus allowing to assume its wide therapeutic
      potential. At Screening, the patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      included into one-week single-blind Placebo Run-in period. At Week 0 the patients will be
      randomized to receive CD-008-0045 60 mg daily, CD-008-0045 40 mg daily or Placebo for 8
      weeks. The potential withdrawal syndrome will be assessed during one-week Follow-up Period.
