      fluorescence spectroscopical techniques. In brief, light (restricted wavelengths: 407 /
      425nm) will be used to excite ZnPP molecules within the blood of the oral mucosa by means of
      an optical fibre prob. The outgoing fluorescence emission of the excited molecules will be
      analyzed using a spectrometer and converted to a ZnPP value [unit: Âµmol/mol heme] using
      mathematical transformations as well as spectral fitting.

      This study compares the diagnostic performance of iron deficiency based on non-invasive
      measurements of Zinc protoporphyrin with results based on standard laboratory procedure (i.e.
      ZnPP measured in whole blood sample using HPLC) and blood values assessed during clinical
      routine, respectively.

      If results of non-invasive and reference measurement techniques yield coinciding results, the
      non-invasive method could provide an improved mean to detect iron deficiency and thereby to
      improve treatment of patients suffering from iron deficiency anemia.
