    
      Subjects with Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that did not respond to treatment or have
      disease that has returned after responding to previous treatment, and are in need of a stem
      cell transplant will be eligible for this pilot study. Thirty subjects will be enrolled, with
      15 subjects assigned to the autologous transplant cohort (according to disease status and
      eligibility) and 15 subjects to the allogeneic transplant cohort (according to diseases
      status and eligibility).

      Subjects will undergo the following a number of screening procedures to determine
      eligibility. All eligible subjects will receive bendamustine at a dose of 200 mg/ m2/ day for
      two days on Days - 24 and Day - 23 followed by a short break of 10 - 14 days. Subjects will
      then receive the conditioning regimen, BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine arabinoside,
      and Melphalan) and alemtuzumab for 6 days (Day -6 to Day -1) followed by an autologous or
      allogeneic transplant.

      Subjects with pathological confirmed B-cell malignancies will also receive rituximab 375
      mg/m2 on Days + 1 and +8 post-transplant. Subjects with T-cell lymphoma will be enrolled in
      the study but will not receive rituximab.

      After the transplantation all subjects will receive medication to prevent graft vs host
      disease and supportive care to prevent infections. To speed up the recovery of stem cells,
      subjects will receive post-transplant filgrastim (G-CSF).

      After discharge from the hospital, subjects will be seen regularly in the clinic for an exam
      and assessments. All these tests are considered standard of care.
