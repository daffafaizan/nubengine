        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fluorouracil when given in combination with
           UCN-01 and leucovorin calcium in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

        -  Determine the clinical toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Correlate, if possible, the pharmacokinetics of these drugs with clinical toxicity in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Assess any clinical activity of this regimen in patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil (5-FU).

      Patients receive leucovorin calcium (CF) IV over 2 hours and 5-FU IV (at the midpoint of CF
      administration) on day 1, followed by UCN-01 IV over 36-72 hours, on weeks 1-3. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPIID)
      is defined as the dose preceding the MTD. At least 6 additional patients are treated at the
      RPIID.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.
