      forms of Multiple Sclerosis taking interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. The duration will
      be 3-6 weeks (1-2 weeks of baseline observation followed by 2-4 weeks of on-drug
      observation), depending on which Multiple Sclerosis drug product is being studied. The study
      will include down-titration from 60 to 30 minutes of application to assess for any difference
      in responses. We define one primary outcome measure,"pain upon injection" by visual analog
      scale (VAS). Secondary measures will include 24-hour ratings of pain by VAS and 24-hour local
      injection site reaction (LISR) scale score.
