      in the age of damage control orthopaedics most of these fractures are fixed definitively
      within 24 hours. The historical method of temporizing these fractures has been to place a
      distal femoral or proximal tibial skeletal traction pin. However, in the pediatric population
      skeletal traction is not utilized due to concern for physeal injury and cutaneous traction
      has been the gold standard for decades. Reasons for skeletal traction in adults are not well
      defined and there are no clinical studies showing that skeletal traction provides better
      outcomes in time of reduction in the operating theater or better pain control than cutaneous
      traction. With the ever increasing amount of high energy trauma seen by junior residents in
      the emergency department time constraints have become a large factor in patient care. Long
      delays for sedation and equipment procurement make stabilizing a diaphyseal femur fracture a
      time consuming experience. The purpose of this study is to determine whether differences
      exist between skeletal and cutaneous femoral traction in terms of: 1) time in patient
      consultation and fracture stabilization; 2) cost and risk to the patient due to lack of
      conscious sedation; 3) pain scores prior to surgery; 4) time of reduction of the diaphyseal
      femur fraction during surgical fixation; and 5) pain relief after traction application.
