      predicate system when using either capillary and venous blood specimens. Furthermore, there
      are three alternative methods of capillary blood sampling for the iMOST and all have direct
      applicability to the iMOST system. As has been published in the peer reviewed literature,
      different fingerstick sample collection methods yield slightly different CBC results,
      specifically the WBC and the WBC Differential. The iMOST employs an integrated software
      algorithm with which the use can employ site specific calibration constants to correctly
      match the selected capillary blood specimen to the venous specimen for the WBC test results.
      All three methods of blood collection are thus described in the "Instructions for Use".
