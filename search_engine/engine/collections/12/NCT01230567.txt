      clinical diagnosis (such as pale granulation, raised lesions and more) will undergo biopsy of
      the wound.

      Another 25 patients suffering from non healing wounds with typical features for the clinical
      diagnosis will undergo biopsy of the wound.

      The hypothesis is that non healing wounds harbor undiagnosed etiologic factors such as BCC,
      SCC, vasculitis etc. and that some clinical features should raise our suspicion for these
      occult etiologies.
