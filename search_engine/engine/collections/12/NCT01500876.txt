      lung strain using four dimensional CT (4D-CT) treatment planning scans. Patients with newly
      diagnosed lung cancer will be planned using 4D-CT to assess lung and tumor motion. Standard
      radiation treatment plans will to delivered based on tumor stage. Patients will be reassessed
      both clinically and radiographically using 4D-CT imaging at 3 months and 6 months
      post-treatment. Following the initial imaging time points, standard surveillance will be
      employed with clinical assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years
      post-treatment.
