      most relevant cardiovascular diseases contributing to overall morbidity and mortality each
      itself and in particular in case of their coexistence. Several new therapies have been
      introduced in randomized controlled trials but confirmation data of treatment effects in
      real-world cohorts using a standardized methodology is scarce. The International Consortium
      for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) defined standard variable sets for all three diseases
      in order to objectively monitor the course of disease.

      To evaluate current health care utilization and interactions between diseases and treatments
      in patients with HF, CAD and AF as well as patient-oriented values study initiator will build
      a prospective, observational, multicenter cardiovascular registry using standardized patient
      variables and endpoints based on the ICHOM recommendations.
