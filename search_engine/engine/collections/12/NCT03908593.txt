    
      A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of 12 months
      and 1 month of pantoprazole treatment for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal mucosal
      injury in patients on DAPT after CABG. 13C urea breath testing (UBT) is used to detect
      Helicobacter pylori infection before CABG and 12 months after CABG, respectively.
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is performed to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal mucosal
      injury at 6 and 12 months after CABG, respectively.

      Two subgroup analyses will be performed in this study, including: (1) Helicobacter pylori
      infection: negative and positive; (2) DAPT: aspirin + clopidogrel and aspirin + ticagrelor.

      To our knowledge, no published data or reference is available for the presence and severity
      of upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury evaluated by EGD in patients on DAPT (ticagrelor +
      aspirin). DACAB-GI-1 study, a single-center endoscopic observational study, was conducted
      with the DACAB randomized clinical trial (NCT 02201771, n=500). Briefly, patients aged 18 to
      80 years with indications for elective CABG surgery were randomized to 1 year of open-label
      antiplatelet therapy comprised of ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) + aspirin (100 mg once
      daily), ticagrelor alone (90 mg twice daily), or aspirin alone (100 mg once daily). Upper
      gastrointestinal mucosal lesions and use of PPIs were assessed in 231 patients enrolled in
      Ruijin Hospital at 1 year post-CABG. According to the results of DACAB-GI-1, the minimum
      sample size of this study is determined to be 208 cases.
