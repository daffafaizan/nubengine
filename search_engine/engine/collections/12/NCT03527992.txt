      infection. Moreover, these complications themselves lead to an extension of the length of
      stay. This has an impact on the cost of care: several studies have shown that hospitalization
      is the most costly factor in the management of pneumonia, and that even a small amount of
      hospital stay, led to significant financial savings. Automated oxygen therapy is a device
      that automatically adjusts with the saturation the amount of oxygen administered.
      Investigator hypothesis is that automated oxygen therapy could shorten the length of stay of
      patients hospitalized for hypoxemic pneumonia. One group of patients will receive the
      automated oxygen therapy and the other group will receive the standard Oxygen therapy. The
      investigator will compare in each group the average length of stay, the duration of oxygen
      therapy, the time spent outside of the target saturation, the cost on the medical-economic
      level and the patient's experience.
