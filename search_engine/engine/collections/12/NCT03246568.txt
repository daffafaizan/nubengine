    
      This prospective randomized study aimed to evaluate the effect of RDN added to PVI for
      persistent AF. Study will be performed in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki.

      Study Hypothesis: Catheter based RDN can prevent recurrence of AF in patient with persistent
      AF undergoing PVI by mechanism not related to hypertension control.

      Primary outcome measure: Freedom from documented AF episodes post PVI as defined by longer
      than 30 seconds of AF recorded by implantable loop recorder 2 to 18 months after procedure
      with or without antiarrhythmic medication.

      Sample Size:

      This is an exploratory study, the sample size calculation will not be applied and arbitrary
      assign 20 subjects to each arm will be adopted.

      Randomization Arms:

      Patients are randomized in 1:1 fraction to one of the following arms:

        1. PVI by cryo-balloon ablation without linear ablation;

        2. PVI by cryo-balloon ablation without linear ablation plus bilateral RND using a
           multi-electrode renal denervation catheter.
