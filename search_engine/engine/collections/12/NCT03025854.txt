      Primary: Evaluation of failure-free survival after three years of patients of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.

      Secondary: Evaluation of overall survival after three years of patients of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.

      Outline: This is a multicenter observational study. Tumor tissue specimens are obtained from
      the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical
      University. The samples are analyzed for biomarkers. The biomarkers are correlated with
      clinical outcomes (failure-free survival, overall survival, tumor response to treatment,
      distant metastasis, recurrence and death).

      The aim of the analysis is to explore potential biomarkers and validate the predictive and
      prognostic value of molecular signature in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This will lead to the
      definition of risk groups and stratification of patients and will help to precision medicine
      of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
