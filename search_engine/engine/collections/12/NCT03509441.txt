      is also detectable in diabetic patients, but does not appear to closely track with insulin
      sensitivity. Hence, fibrosis may be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in IR and
      diabetic patients. As a result, a critical need exists to develop a non-invasive tool to
      identify and treat the highest-risk patients. Early detection of cardiac fibrosis and other
      CMR- detectable abnormalities in IR patients may help to 'stage' a patient's disease process
      and future risk of events, ultimately leading to an adjustment in the aggressiveness of their
      medical management and long-term monitoring accordingly. This project is aimed at reducing
      the mortality and morbidity associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, and the
      investigators believe this project could have a transformative impact on long-term diabetic
      care and shed new light upon the biology of diffuse cardiac fibrosis in insulin resistance
      and diabetes and its role in shaping the long-term cardiovascular risk for these patients.
