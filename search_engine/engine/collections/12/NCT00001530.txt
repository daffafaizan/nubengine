      patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Notably, when pacing is temporarily
      discontinued, the beneficial effects of pacing are evident in sinus rhythm. The long term
      results of this novel therapy are, however, uncertain. We propose (1) to record the
      hemodynamic changes following >4 years of pacing; and (2) to determine whether DDD pacing
      continues to be necessary in patients who have had a substantial relief of their LVOT
      obstruction. Patients who have had >50% reduction in LVOT pressure gradients will be
      randomized to two pacing modalities: DDD at 70 beats per minute and AAI pacing at 70 beats
      per minute (DDD switched off), and reevaluated after a six-month period.
