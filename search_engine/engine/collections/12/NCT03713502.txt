      patients using a cross-sectional study design. To implement it cost-efficiently,
      investigators will nest it to an ongoing cohort study which investigates risk factors for
      diabetes and other chronic diseases among HIV patients in Tanzania (the CICADA study)
      (NCT03106480).

      The CICADA study recruited 1947 participants during 2016/2017. These will be followed- up
      during 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 by which point it is expected that about 1550 participants
      will be retained in the cohort. Data collection for the current study will coincide with the
      final CICADA study follow-up. Data on demography, socio-economic status, conventional
      non-communicable disease risk factors, HIV and TB status, antiretroviral therapy use history,
      anthropometry, body composition, lipid profile, CD4 count, C-reactive protein, alpha-1-acid
      glycoprotein, insulin, and diabetes status will be retrieved from CICADA study. Data on gut
      enteropathy biomarkers i.e plasma citrulline, GLP-1, glucagon like peptide-2 (GLP-2),
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO), neopterin,
      and alpha-1-antitrypsin, intestinal permeability (by 4-sugar test), lipopolysaccharide
      binding protein, tumor necrosis factor-Î± receptor, interleukin 6, and fecal elastase (as an
      indicator of pancreatic function) will be collected solely for this study to investigate the
      study hypothesis.

      Data will be entered in Cspro and managed and analysed in STATA. Both linear and logistic
      regression will be used to assess the associations between exposure variables (markers of
      enteropathy) and outcome (diabetes). In addition, causal inference techniques will be used to
      investigate associations between enteropathy biomarkers and diabetes.
