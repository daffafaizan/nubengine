      in the first phase, and during the second phase from the colposcopy clinic population
      (approximately 300) based on their referral abnormal Pap cytology conducted within 120-days
      in order to achieve a statistically viable number of normal women, women with Cervical
      Intra-epithelial Neoplasia (CIN1/2) and women with CIN3+, as described in Section 6.1,
      "Cervical Cytology Enrollment Targets". After the Cervical Neoplasia Detection System (CNDS)
      test, a sample for Hybrid Capture 2 Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and liquid cytology
      will be collected in addition to colposcopy and biopsy, if indicated.

      A key component of effective screening studies designed to evaluate new detection modalities
      is verification of the gold standard comparison by which estimates of sensitivity and
      specificity are generated. In the case of screening studies in general and studies of
      cervical disease detection in particular, the avoidance of verification bias is a priority.
      For the purposes of the proposed study, CIN3 or cancer (CIN3+) must be verified or
      adjudicated by multiple histopathologists. Results for women with CIN1 or CIN2 will be
      confirmed histopathologically and analyzed as a separate subgroup because these lesions often
      regress to normal in certain populations and tend to cause disagreement among
      histopathologists. In order to verify absence of disease (i.e., CIN1 or less severe), the
      investigators will not rely on histopathology, as it would not be ethical to perform multiple
      biopsies or excisional procedures to obtain a tissue sample for histopathology. Instead,
      women will be considered normal if they have negative referral cytology, are free of high
      risk HPV and are colposcopically normal.
