      target-organ damages. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and abdominal and neck
      circumference) will be registered. Daytime sleepiness, quality of sleep and quality of life
      wiill be evaluated through the respective questionnaires: Epworth sleepiness scale,
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and SF-36. In order to evaluate the airway, the
      Mallampati grade will be used in addition to the adapted assessment protocol from Guimar√£es
      (2009). The differences between the final score and the baseline score will be calculated and
      adjusted by the baseline value found in each of the questionnaires applied. Finally, the
      analysis excluding the patients with suboptimal adherence to speech therapy treatment (less
      than 85%) compared to the control group will be redone. If there are benefits of treatment
      with speech therapy, it will also be offered to the control group after the end of the
      clinical trial. Statistical analysis will be done in the statistical package SPSS version
      19.0 package (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). Data obtained may be of benefit to future
      patients and will be used only for statistical purposes. The confidentiality of the
      information collected will be guaranteed, thus ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of
      the information. In addition, the data obtained will not be used for other purposes not
      foreseen in the protocol.
