      inappropriate drug regimens before dose modifications can be made. Although the importance of
      TDM cannot be over emphasized, it entails trial and error and does not allow for pre-
      treatment dose optimization. This study, which provides an integration of genetic and
      pharmacokinetic data analysis of patients preconditioned for HSCT with high dose oral BU,
      aims to define biomarkers predictive of poor BU metabolism and clearance to prevent potential
      drug toxicity.This study is not an interventional study, only investigates the GST and MDR-1
      genes in correlation with the "routine" Busulfan AUC done during the preparative regimen in
      HSCT for AML patients.
