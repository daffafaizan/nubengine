    
      The study is a randomized controlled study to compare standard of care (control) to DPS
      (diaphragm stimulator named The NeuRx® Diaphragm Pacing System™). Although it remains
      uncertain if DPS is efficacious for the ALS subject, given the preliminary studies performed
      by the device manufacturer, it has received FDA humanitarian device exemption (HDE) approval
      as a humanitarian use device (HUD). This study will utilize a 2:1 randomization schedule such
      that eligible ALS subjects will have a 2/3 chance of receiving DPS and 1/3 chance of standard
      of care (control) treatment.

      The NeuRx® Diaphragm Pacing System™ (DPS) is a four channel, implanted percutaneous diaphragm
      muscle stimulation system. Under general anesthesia, the intramuscular electrodes are
      laparoscopically implanted in the diaphragm. The ends of the implanted electrodes are
      tunneled subcutaneously to an exit site on the chest or abdominal wall and connected to an
      external stimulator.
