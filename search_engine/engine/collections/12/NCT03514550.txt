      surgical stress. A series of experimental and clinical studies indicate a different effect of
      certain types of anesthesia on immunity. It is believed that surgical stress itself opens an
      opportunity for the recurrence of oncological diseases precisely due to the immunosuppressive
      effect. The aim of present pilot clinical study is to test a hypothesis that total
      intravenous anesthesia as superior to inhalational anesthesia in term of its effects on cell
      immunity among patients with kidney cancer.
