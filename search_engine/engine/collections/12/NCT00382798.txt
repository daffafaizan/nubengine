      (have not been treated for HCV) will be enrolled. Up to 75 patients (3 groups of 25) will be
      dosed for 28 days with RO5024048, PEG-IFN, and RBV. The first dose of RO5024048 to be given
      in Part 3 will be 500 mg BID, the second dose will be 1500 mg BID, and the third group will
      be 1000 mg BID. Standard doses of PEG-IFN and RBV will be used during Part 3. Doses of
      PEG-IFN and RBV will be modified if necessary.

      An 4th group of 25 HCV genotype 2 or 3-infected patients who have been previously treated
      with interferon but who did not respond will also be enrolle in part 3. The dose given to
      this 4th group will be 1500 mg BID, in combination with standard doses of PEG-IFN and RBV.

      Following 28 days of combination dosing with RO5024048, PEG-IFN, and RBV, patients will be
      dosed an additional 28 days (through Day 56 of the study) with just PEG-IFN, and RBV. After
      completing 56 days under this study, patients who participate in Part 3 will be optionally
      enrolled into a standard of care protocol with PEG-IFN and RBV, to be conducted by Roche.
      Patients who opt to enroll into the standard of care protocol will be given up to 40 weeks of
      PEG-IFN and RBV.

      The primary objective for Part 3 is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of RO5024048 in treatment-naive HCV Genotype 1-infected patients, and in non-responder HCV
      Genotype 2/3-infected patients, after once or twice daily dosing in combination wtih PEG-IFN
      and RBV for 28 days on an outpatient basis. The secondary objective of Part 3 (COMBO) is to
      evaluate the short-term decrease in viral load in treatment-naive HCV Genotype 1-infected
      patients, and in non-responder HCV Genotype 2/3-infected patients, after once or twice daily
      dosing of RO5024048 in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV for 28 days.

      Part 1 (closed for enrollment): Single ascending dose study

      During Part 1, 5 escalating single oral doses of RO5024048 or placebo were given to 40
      healthy volunteers, when fasted (have not eaten any food for at least 10 hours). The doses
      given were 500 mg, 1500 mg, 4500 mg, 6000 mg, and 9000 mg. Another group of 6 volunteers was
      given 1500 mg with food.

      The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (amount of drug in the blood) of RO5024048 under fasting conditions. The secondary objective
      of Part 1 was to explore the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of RO5024048.

      Part 2: (Closed for enrollment) Multiple ascending dose study

      During Part 2 of the study, 40 HCV-genotype 1-infected patients were given multiple-ascending
      oral doses of RO5024048 or placebo for 14 days. The doses given were 750 mg once daily, 1500
      mg once daily, 750 mg twice daily, and 1500 mg twice daily.

      The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of RO5024048 in HCV Genotype 1-infected patients after daily or twice daily dosing for 14
      days. The secondary objective was to evaluate the decrease in viral load in HCV Genotype
      1-infected patients after daily or twice daily dosing of RO5024048 for 14 days
