      date of randomization until documentation of any of the following failures (whichever occurs
      first): -local or distant recurrence of disease;-death from any cause or completion of
      follow-up.

      Secondary:

      To compare OS (Overall Survival), defined as the time interval between the date of
      randomization and the date of death from any cause or the last known alive date;路 To compare
      quality of life measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30路 To compare toxicity, graded according to the
      NCI-CTG criteria;路 To compare DFS and OS in patients who achieve or not serum mitotane
      concentrations > 14 mg/L;路 To compare DFS and OS between the 2 arms in patients subgroups
      stratified according to: type of hormone secretion, stage of disease, histopathologic
      characteristics.
