      Telepsychiatry is a novel means of providing expert psychiatric treatment to patients who
      live far from a source of care. If it can be demonstrated that treatment via telepsychiatry
      is as effective as in-person treatment, then many individuals with psychiatric illness will
      have easy access to psychiatric care, even if they live in geographically remote areas.

      Objectives:

      The major goal of this study was to determine whether treatment of depressive disorders via
      telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person treatment. In addition, this study was designed
      to determine if depressed patients are as compliant and as satisfied with telepsychiatry as
      with in-person treatment. Another goal was to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of
      remote treatment via telepsychiatry to in-person treatment.

      Methods:

      In this randomized controlled trial, veterans who presented with depression to any of three
      VA Maryland Health Care facilities with a SCID-IV depression diagnosis and a Hamilton Rating
      Scale for Depression (Ham-D) score of 16 or above were eligible for participation. Eligible
      veterans were randomized to either "in-person" treatment or "remote" treatment. Treatment
      occurred over six months and consisted of psychotropic medication and psycho-education
      concerning the disease, medications, and side effects. The major outcome variables included
      changes in Ham-D depression ratings and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) self-reported
      depression ratings.

      Status:

      Completed.
