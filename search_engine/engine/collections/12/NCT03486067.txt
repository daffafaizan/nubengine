    
      The dose escalation parts (Part A with CC-93269 administered intravenous (IV) and Part C
      subcutaneous (SC)) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses
      of CC-93269, administered IV or SC, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      non-tolerated dose (NTD) of CC-93269. The expansion parts (Part B and D) will further
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-93269 administered IV or SC at or below the MTD in
      selected expansion cohorts of up to approximately 20 evaluable subjects each in order to
      determine the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).One or more dosing regimens may be selected for
      cohort expansion. All treatments will be administered in 28-day cycles for up to 2 years or
      extended up to 5 years for subjects maintaining clinical benefit at the discretion of the
      Safety Review Committee, until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      subject/investigator decision to withdraw.
