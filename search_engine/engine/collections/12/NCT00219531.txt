      function and pain syndromes such at irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, recent studies
      indicate a difference in the CNS processing of rectal stimulation in normal subjects and
      patients with IBS. This study will determine the differences in the perception of rectal
      balloon distention in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, in control
      subjects with no bowel symptoms and volunteers with IBS, and will compare the CNS processing
      of this signal using functional MRI , again in the two phases of the menstrual cycle.

      Comparisons: between control subjects without GI symptoms and those with irritable bowel
      syndrome.
