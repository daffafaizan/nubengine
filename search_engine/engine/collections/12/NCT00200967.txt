      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a long-acting beta agonist in patients
      with asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids who express two distinct polymorphisms of the
      beta-2 adrenergic receptor.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Participants were homozygous for arginine or glycine at the 16th amino-acid position of the
      β-2 adrenergic receptor (B16 Arg/Arg or B16 Gly/Gly). Individuals were matched against their
      opposite genotype by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and race. Matched
      participants entered an 8-week run-in period. This is a 62-week crossover design where
      subjects receive the following therapies:

        -  Beclomethasone HFA (240 µg twice a day (BID)) + as-needed (PRN) albuterol: 8-week run-in

        -  Beclomethasone HFA (240 µg BID) + salmeterol (50 µg BID) + PRN ipratropium bromide + PRN
           albuterol: 18-week treatment period

        -  Beclomethasone HFA (240 µg BID) + PRN albuterol: 8-week run-out

        -  Beclomethasone HFA (240 µg BID) + placebo salmeterol + PRN ipratropium bromide + PRN
           albuterol: 18-week treatment period

        -  Beclomethasone HFA (240 µg BID) + PRN albuterol: 10-week run-out

      The order of treatments received during the two treatment periods is randomized.
