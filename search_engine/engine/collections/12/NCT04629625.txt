      worldwide. Although many mechanisms may contribute to knee pain severity, the
      patient-reported hyperalgesia can be attributed to peripheral and central sensitivity in knee
      OA. Amongst quantitative sensory testing methods, pressure pain threshold (PPT) measurement
      is a simple and commonly applied method for measuring somatosensory function in
      musculoskeletal disorders, just as in knee OA. Many trials have presented lower PPT in knee
      OA compared to healthy controls underlining the presence of peripheral and central
      sensitivity.

      The different joint-based mobilization techniques may not only alleviate pain, but also
      increase pain tolerance to the locally applied mechanical pressure. Positive results of these
      techniques on increase of PPT has been reported in knee OA; however, the time curve of PPT
      has not evaluated so far in knee OA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the
      effect of end-range mobilization on the time curve of PPT and some function-related measures
      in knee OA.
