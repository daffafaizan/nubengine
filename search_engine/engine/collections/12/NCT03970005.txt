      a specialized clinical program to serve individuals ages 12-25 who meet clinical high risk
      criteria for a psychosis (CHR-P). The purpose of this project is to evaluate (i) correlates
      of baseline characteristics among clinic participants; (ii) outcomes among individuals
      participating in this clinical service; and (iii) predictors and mediators of longitudinal
      outcomes among individuals participating in this clinical service.
