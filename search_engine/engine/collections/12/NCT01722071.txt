      prosocial effects in humans including enhancing trust and generosity, improving positive
      communication, increasing eye gaze, and reducing anxiety. Oxytocin is hypothesized to
      facilitate social behaviors via its modulation of motivational networks. With this study, we
      will characterize oxytocin's effects on the neural processing of salient stimuli. We will
      utilize a noninvasive brain imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      to assess brain activity while participants perform tests designed to engage neural circuits
      associated with the processing of social and non-social stimuli.
