      scoliosis patients detected LLD, aged 10-18 years, between 2018 and 2020. The scoliosis
      patients with a diagnosis of structural LLD were divided into two groups according to whether
      there was a concurrent AIS diagnosis or not. Demographic data were recorded. Limb length was
      clinically measured by direct, indirect evaluation method and new LLD-Scoliometer Test. Cobb
      degree, axial rotation, internal/external pelvic obliquity and LLD were obtained from
      posteroanterior spine radiographs measured by two blinded orthopaedic spine surgeons.
