      ventilation. Clinicians taking care of these patients are surprised by the scant respiratory
      sensations and emotional responses described by patients. This attenuation of respiratory
      interoception deprives clinicians of the usual warning signs during respiratory
      decompensation of dyspnea and its aggravation. It may be the result of central nerve damage.
      This hypothesis is bolstered by the observation that within the multiple clinical forms of
      COVID-19 infection there are some "neurological" forms (headache, anosmia, agueusia,
      dizziness, without respiratory signs and with little or no fever), that are most likely the
      consequence of olfactory penetration of the virus into the central nervous system (mechanism
      described for SARS CoV-1).
