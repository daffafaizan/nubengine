      reduce TV stenosis. This study will evaluate the hemodynamic efficacy of the Contour 3D速 and
      Tri-Ad速 ring and characterize the effect of the TV repair through assessment of right atrial
      size and right ventricular function. Additionally, this study will characterize the patient
      population for whom a Contour 3D速 or Tri-Ad速 ring is chosen to repair TV insufficiency.
      Health status and adverse events (AE) will be assessed.
