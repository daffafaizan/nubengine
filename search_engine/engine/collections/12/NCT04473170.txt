      the standard care, while Group B (No investigational intervention arm) received only the UAE
      approved standard care. The primary endpoints were the safety and efficacy assessment,
      measured as Adverse Reactions (ARs) incidence [according to World Health Organization -
      Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) causality assessment system], rate of mortality within
      28-days, and the time to clinical improvement of 2 points on a seven-category ordinal scale
      or discharge from the Hospital, whichever came first. Immune response profile, acute-phase
      serum markers, and coagulation testing profile were evaluated as well, before treatment
      (baseline - Day 0), at Day 14, and Day 21 (in patients with early response, defined as 2
      points of difference in the clinical critical treatment index within 7 days of treatment, the
      assessment will be performed at Day 7). The trial was approved by the institutional ADSCC
      Research Ethics Committees (REC), and the Emirates Institutional Review Board (IRB) for
      COVID-19 Research and the written informed consent was obtained from all patients or from the
      patient's legal representative if the patient was too unwell to provide consent. SENTAD-COVID
      Study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
      Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization
      (ICH). The authors were responsible for designing the trial and for compiling and analyzing
      the data.
