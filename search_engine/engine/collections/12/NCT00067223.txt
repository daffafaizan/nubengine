      plasticity (UDP) in the contralateral primary motor cortex, M1, in normal volunteers. It is
      conceivable that motor training in one hand, in addition to changes in the contralateral M1,
      could elicit plastic changes in the ipsilateral M1. The purpose of this study is to test this
      hypothesis: Training consisting of repetition of a unilateral finger movement elicits plastic
      changes in the cortical representation of the homonymous untrained finger in the ipsilateral
      M1. The study will be performed on normal volunteers and will consist of three to five
      separate training sessions. The endpoint measure will be, for each session, the change in the
      direction of the movements evoked by TMS in the untrained index finger as a function of the
      opposite index finger.
