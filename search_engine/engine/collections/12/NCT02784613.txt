      and dyspareunia. While ospemifene clinically significantly reduces pain associated with
      dyspareunia, there has been little prospective documentation using vulvoscopy with detailed
      photography of the visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vaginal region with daily
      administration of 60 mg ospemifene in post-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia. This
      study will include a total of 6 prospective photographic sessions of the vulva, vestibule and
      vagina over the 20 weeks administration of 60 mg ospemifene in the study. Comparisons will be
      made of baseline photography (vulvoscopy session 0) with photography at 4 weeks (vulvoscopy
      session 1), 8 weeks (vulvoscopy session 2), 12 weeks (vulvoscopy session 3), 16 weeks
      (vulvoscopy session 4) and 20 weeks (vulvoscopy session 5).

      Currently there have been limited prospective studies using vulvoscopy with detailed
      photography demonstrating visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vagina following oral
      administration of 60 mg ospemifene in post-menopausal women with VVA and dyspareunia.
      Information regarding visible changes to the vulva, vestibule and vagina may be very
      important to the patient and to the health care provider to best understand the beneficial
      effects of ospemifene and to ensure patient compliance with treatment.
