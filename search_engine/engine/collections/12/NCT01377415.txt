      associated with intense, occasionally severe postoperative pain and hence considerable use of
      opioids. Also arthroscopic shoulder surgery, especially rotator cuff procedures, may cause
      significant pain resulting sometimes in inpatient admission. Subacromial local anaesthetic
      infusion as a part of a multimodal approach is one commonly used modality to pain relief
      after shoulder surgery. Nevertheless, it has been criticized recently for its poor benefits
      and possible adverse effects. On the whole, the scientific evidence of the advantages of
      local anaesthetic infusions is inconclusive.
