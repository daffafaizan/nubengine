    
      The two most common causative pathogens of septicemia (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
      aureus) as well as cases of fungemia (Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and others) will be
      included in the first study group. At our hospital the estimated yearly cases of
      bacteremia/fungemia (230 for Escherichia coli, 150 for Staphylococcus aureus, and 50 for
      fungi) will be included in the first study group. Furthermore, the two biomarkers will be
      determined in 70 cases of septicemia with other bacterial pathogens and sepsis due to viral
      pathogens or viremia for evaluation of further clinical impact of these two biomarkers.
