      for the formation of one or more autogenous vein valves constructed from the vein wall of the
      femoral and/or popliteal vein, in subjects with CVI and who meet the specified eligibility
      criteria. In particular, the safety and technical feasibility of the procedure will be
      validated in patients in the United States, including the procedural steps, operator
      technique, and subject characteristics. The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of
      the study device acutely and through 5 years.
