      battlefield traumas. Infrascanner uses near infrared spectroscopy to measure cerebral blood
      flow non-invasively. This is achieved by putting the device against the scalp in 4 different
      areas (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital) on the left and right side and by comparing
      both sides.This allows for the detection of intracranial hemorrhages with a volume upwards of
      3.5ml and to a depth of 2.5cm. However, little is known about the influence of other
      intracranial conditions that could confound the measurements of the Infrascanner (e.g.
      ischemic stroke, brain surgery, brain tumors,...).

      Therefore, the investigators prospectively want to use the Infrascanner in patients with
      ischemic stroke, patients with brain surgery, patients with brain tumors, patients with
      intracranial hemorrhage and patients with a normal CT scan of the brain as part of a
      diagnostic work-up after head trauma or headache to determine the positive and negative
      predictive value of the Infrascanner in these different settings.
