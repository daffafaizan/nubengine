      in the circulation will improve systemic (muscle) inflammation and glucose metabolism in
      insulin resistant (obese and T2DM) subjects by protecting the intestinal barrier with a
      synbiotic (Bifidobacterium longum R0175 and oligofructose) or by sequestering LPS in the
      gastrointestinal lumen with sevelamer.
