      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of Akt inhibitor MK2206 (MK2206) in terms of objective
      response rate (ORR) at 4 months (complete response [CR], and partial response [PR]) as per
      the 2007 International Cheson response criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of MK2206 in terms of ORR at 4 months (CR, unconfirmed
      complete response [CRu], and PR) as per the 1999 International Cheson response criteria.

      II. To determine the duration of response, defined as the time from the date of the best
      response to the date of progression.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

      IV. To determine the safety of MK2206. V. To identify predictive biomarkers for treatment
      outcome. (exploratory) VI. To conduct a pharmacodynamic study using FDG-PET scans.
      (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This a multicenter study.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
