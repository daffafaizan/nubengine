      which will include data relating to general information, the complete clinical examination
      and the paraclinical examination. They are distributed randomly into three parallel groups,
      each arm having a different treatment modality. A balanced randomization by permutation block
      of 5 will be applied using the "Randomizer for Clinical Trial" application developed by the
      company Medsharing). Laboratory examinations are carried out according to the procedures and
      method by laboratories accredited in Guinea for the diagnosis of COVID19. Data is encoded,
      entered and processed using statistical software.

      The comparison between the three cohorts will be made using either the Anova test for
      continuous variables or the chi-square test for categorical variables. The rate of change
      over time of virologic clearance, fever and other symptoms values as well as the differences
      for these rates between treatment arms will be tested using mixed-effects modeling.

      The biological samples will be stored at the biobank of the National Institute of Public
      Health of Guinea.
