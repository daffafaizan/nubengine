      products or nonmobilized peripheral blood apheresis collectings were stimulated with CMV/EBV
      specific peptides covering most HLA alleles among Chinese populations. Once the investigators
      made sufficient numbers of T cells, they tested their ex vivo properties.Then a fraction of
      CTLs were separated for immediate infusion and the others were frozen for further infusion.

      If the donor was available, the donor derived CTLs were started to produce when CMV
      reactivation was detected by qPCR in recipients peripheral blood. Otherwise, autologous CTLs
      were used. For patients at high risk of developing CMV/EBV infections after stem cell
      transplantation, a small part of G-HPC products was extracted for CTLs generation.
