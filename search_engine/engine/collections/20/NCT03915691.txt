      identify areas that require ablation in order to treat the arrhythmia. There are numerous
      methods by which to map atrial tachycardia. Ripple Mapping is one such method, and has
      recently been demonstrated to improve diagnostic accuracy of mapping and therefore improve
      acute procedural outcomes (termination of the tachycardia).

      However, it is not known if improved acute procedural outcomes translate into long-term
      benefits for patients. At present, the recurrence rate following atrial tachycardia ablation
      is near 30%. We hypothesise that Ripple Mapping can reduce long-term recurrence following
      ablation as improved diagnostic accuracy of mapping can lead to more targeted, less
      extensive, ablation.

      Patients referred for catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia will be randomised to undergo
      the procedure by Ripple Mapping or conventional mapping (local activation time). Otherwise,
      the catheters used to perform the mapping and ablation will be the same in both groups. After
      the procedure, follow up will occur at 3 monthly intervals for a year. All patients will
      undergo an ECG at each follow up, whilst patients with symptoms of atrial tachycardia will
      undergo a 24 hour ECG. Recurrence will be compared
