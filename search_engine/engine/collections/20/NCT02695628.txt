      I. Determine the variability of 18F FMISO uptake in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors
      compared to normal liver after transcatheter arterial embolization by determining the
      difference in the mean of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and tumor-to-liver
      ratio (TLR) of a region of normal liver and of up to 5 index tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if areas of tumor recurrence as determined by CT or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) within a 6 month period after transcatheter arterial embolization show evidence of
      increased 18F FMISO labeling on the initial post treatment 18F FMISO PET/CT.

      II. Determine the variability in SUVmax and TLR of untreated (non embolized) HCC lesions
      compared to normal liver by determining the difference in the mean of the SUVmax and TLR of
      normal liver and tumor.

      III. Determine any toxicities related to [18F]FMISO use for PET/CT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transcatheter arterial embolization. Patients also receive
      18F-fluoromisonidazole intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scans within 4 weeks prior to
      embolization treatment and in the 20 hours following completion of treatment.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 3 months.
