      genome sequencing in the past few years. Since usually there are no common antigens expressed
      on the surfaces of different kinds of tumors, neoantigens which expressed specifically in the
      individual tumor are chosen to establish tumor-specific vaccines.

      30 patients with refractory lung cancer would be enrolled and undergo tumor resection if all
      requirements are met. The whole-exome sequencing and the bioinformatic analysis of the
      resected specimens would be performed to identify the neoantigens. Then, candidate
      neoantigens would be synthesized to pulse the matured DC cells. Neoantigen-primed DC vaccines
      are provided to the corresponding patients. Each patient would be vaccinated 6 times in
      total, one shot per week.

      Patients enrolled would undergo the schemed follow-up, one time per three months. The side
      effects, overall survival, and progress-free survival would be recorded. At the end of the
      research, the safety and efficacy of neoantigen DC vaccines for refractory lung cancer would
      be evaluated.
