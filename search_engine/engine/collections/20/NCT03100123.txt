      randomized full trial evaluating antepartum prophylaxis with ASA versus LMWH/ASA in women
      with confirmed APS and a history of late or recurrent early pregnancy loss.

      Given the large sample size needed to adequately power a large multicenter trial that
      assesses the efficacy of ASA alone versus LMWH/ASA, the investigators first need to determine
      if it is possible to meet minimum recruitment rates needed for a full multicenter trial. If
      the pilot feasibility trial is successful, then the secondary outcomes collected will be used
      in the analysis of the full multicenter trial.
