      factors and strain factors on mycobacterial killing. If performed in parallel with PK
      measurements, the method can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing
      cycle. This study aims to compare different doses of rifampicin in the WBA model, compare
      activity of rifampicin on WBA by different mycobacterium tuberculosis strain types and assess
      the host immune response following drug administration.
