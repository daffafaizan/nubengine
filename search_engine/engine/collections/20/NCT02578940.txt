      performance of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT in BCR, our primary aim is to assess its clinical
      impact on treatment decisions in a multi-centre study in patients with BCR being considered
      for radical salvage treatment (with curative intent). In addition, we aim to further
      characterise its diagnostic performance, afforded by larger numbers of patients from
      multi-centre recruitment. We also aim to assess the effect of PSA level on probability of
      lesion detection by 18F-fluciclovine.
