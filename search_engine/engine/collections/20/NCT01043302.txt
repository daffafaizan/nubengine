      Thus, small and large Intestine account for approximately 30-40% of primary gastrointestinal
      tract lymphoma. More than 70% of intestinal lymphoma presents as localized disease, and
      surgery such as bowel resection is performed in many patients with intestinal lymphoma for
      diagnosis and treatment. However, it is still unclear whether surgical resection followed by
      chemotherapy is superior to systemic chemotherapy alone in terms of treatment outcome and
      quality of life (QOL). Thus, we analyze the clinical features and treatment outcome of
      patients with NHL of intestine, and at the same time perform a multicenter cross-sectional
      study about the QOL in survivors of intestine NHL. We evaluates the treatment outcomes of
      patients with intestine NHL from hospitals affiliated with the Consortium for Improving
      Survival of Lymphoma (CISL) in Korea. We assess the QOL of survivors who completed their
      treatment using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.
