      pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibition and sargramostim (GMCSF) in people with unresectable stage III
      or IV melanoma who have not received prior immunotherapy in the metastatic setting.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sargramostim as a treatment
      option for people with stage III or IV melanoma who have not received prior immunotherapy in
      the metastatic setting.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab as a treatment option
      for people with stage III or IV melanoma who have not received prior immunotherapy in the
      metastatic setting.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive the study drug(s) for as long as they do not have serious side
      effects and their disease does not get worse and will be followed for safety 30 days after
      the last dose of study drug(s). Participants may also be followed for long term follow-up
      every 12 weeks from the last dose of study drug(s).

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.
