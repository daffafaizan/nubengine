      practices, including sexual behavior. The first part of the NuvaRing ® Acceptability study is
      an online survey, developed in conjunction with the University of Illinois's Survey Research
      Laboratory, which examines women's attitudes and beliefs regarding various methods of birth
      control. The second part of the study is a comparison trial in which the women are randomized
      to either the NuvaRing ® vaginal contraceptive ring or a low dose oral contraceptive. The
      women are followed for three months to assess compliance, side effects, overall acceptability
      and intent to continue use of the method. Ultimately, we would like college women to be well
      informed about various methods of contraception available to them and to choose the
      contraceptive method that best suits their lifestyle.
