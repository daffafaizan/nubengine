      constant (ke0) links the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) for a given drug and
      it is used to predict the course of the effect and to calculate a theoretical drug
      concentration at the effect site. The PK model for propofol recently published by White et
      al. (derived from the Marsh model used by the DiprifusorÂ®) include covariate as age and
      gender to describe the pharmacokinetics but does not incorporate a ke0.

      Methods: 45 healthy adult patients will be scheduled for elective surgery with standard
      monitoring and BIS XP (Aspect) will received a White PK model-driven plasma target controlled
      infusion of propofol ( 12 ugml-1 or 10 ugml-1 over 65 years) to be reached in 4 min. After
      reaching the target, the infusion will be stopped obtaining a complete effect curve upon
      patient awakening. Calculated plasma concentration and EEG data were stored every one second.
      Loss (LOC) and recovery (ROC) of consciousness were assessed and recorded. The dynamic
      relationship between propofol Ce and its effect as measured by BIS will be modeled with an
      inhibitory Emax model using a population PK/PD approach with NONMEM V.

      the Study take around 12 min.
