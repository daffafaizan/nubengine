      diabetes mellitus involving insulin administration via electronic pump. CSII has been shown
      to reduce HbA1c levels and improve blood sugar control and the continuous, unobtrusive
      insulin delivery may potentially allow patients increased dietary flexibility and quality of
      life. However, despite these claims longitudinal investigatory literature is sparse. This
      study will clarify whether adult CSII patients experience eating behaviour and quality of
      life alterations over time after commencement of the therapy. This is important as changes
      may be associated with cardiometabolic risk variations; which will also be investigated.

      Participants will comprise of a convenience sample of adults with Type-1 diabetes invited
      from diabetes clinics at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital who are due to commence
      CSII.

      Following ethical consent the participants who are due to commence CSII will be observed at 5
      time points (every three months) over a year. It should be noted that the recruitment period
      for the longitudinal arm of the study will be 9 months starting from the date the first
      participant is recruited. At each time point each participant will be asked to complete a 5
      day food diary, a food intake questionnaire (FIQ), a quality of life (QOL) questionnaire, a
      semi-structured interview and give a 20ml sample of blood. This will be taken at the same
      time and in addition to their regular diagnostic sample, however where this is unfeasible
      extra occasional appointments may be needed. Results will be compared with existing patient
      medical records, which will also be analysed during the study.
