      cancerous. Doctors use colonoscopy to look inside the colon and rectum and find adenomas and
      remove them. Removing adenomas is known to reduce the chances of a person developing
      colorectal cancers. The ability of colonoscopists finding adenomas varies, and there is a lot
      of researches into how to improve "adenoma detection rates".

      A new AI system, called the CSK endoscopic diagnosis and treatment system has been designed
      to improve the rate of polyp detection at colonoscopy. Previous tests have shown that there
      is a significant improvement in detection of adenomas when the system is used. This study
      will randomize patients coming for colonoscopy to have their procedure performed as usual or
      as an AI-assisted colonoscopy. The investigators will record polyp and adenoma detection
      rates, duration of procedure, participant comfort levels, and complications. All patients
      referred for colonoscopy will be invited in 4 centers, recruiting a total of 800
      participants.
