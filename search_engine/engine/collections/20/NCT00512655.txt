      Relatedness: The outcome of this study may have important reflections on protocols to prevent
      falling among elders and on health care decision makers to stimulate starting new fall
      clinics and implement these protocols. Through this study, the well-being and functionality
      of frail elders and their caregivers could be improved. As falling has an enormous economic
      burden, a new effective fall prevention intervention could reduce health care costs
      substantially. The tests consisting of questionnaires and gait and balance measurement are
      non-invasive and safe. Taking blood samples is an invasive procedure, although no serious
      adverse effects are expected. There are no foreseeable risks associated with participation in
      this study. However, a burden will be placed on participating individuals because the
      training sessions and measurements are time-consuming.
