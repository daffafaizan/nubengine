      hypercholesterolemia will be recruited into the study. They will undergo a screening
      evaluation, including a medical history, physical examination, ECG, and limited
      echocardiogram to evaluate for exclusion criteria. Before the apheresis procedure, blood
      samples will be obtained for plasma markers of inflammation, erythrocyte deformability, and
      plasma viscosity. Contrast enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging will be performed to
      evaluate blood flow in the myocardium at rest, as well as in the forearm skeletal muscle
      before and after mild isometric exercise (50% maximal grip, 0.2 Hz). Flow mediated
      vasodilation will be performed. The subjects will then undergo their planned apheresis
      procedure. Within 2 hours of completion of apheresis, blood collection and CEU will be
      repeated. Plasma lipids will be available as part of the standard apharesis protocol.
