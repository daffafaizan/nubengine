           hardening of the contrast mixture).

        -  In a second step, we will inject the mixture in human pancreas: into the duct tree, the
           vein and arteries. After hardening, the human pancreas will be removed from cadavers
           following the organ donation technique. The anatomic specimens will be scanned in the
           laboratory UMR CNRS 7369 MEDyC, Reims (Pr X. MAQUART, Dr J. DEVY).

        -  The images obtained (Dicom format) are very big in term of file size. Analysis of the
           images will be performed using a supercomputer of the laboratory CReSTIC - ROMEO EA
           3804, Reims (Dr A. RENARD, Pr M. KRAJEKI). 3D reconstructions will be performed.
