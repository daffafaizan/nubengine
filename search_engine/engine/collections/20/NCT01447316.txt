    
      This is a prospective, exploratory, short term study of the effects of bariatric surgery on
      body composition, gait parameters during walking, lower extremity joint pain and quality of
      life (QOL) in morbidly obese patients. All patients who enroll have already agreed to undergo
      the bariatric procedure with their respective surgeon; the study team will simply follow
      specific outcome measures in addition to their normal clinical care at two time points after
      the surgery (week 4 and month 3).
