    
      We proposed a randomized controlled trial, including 180 patients, in 3 groups: Olanzapine,
      Tetrabenazine and Tiapride, followed during 12 months. These treatments have been selected
      according their profile and their frequency of use.

      The principal criteria is the Independence scale, one of the functional scales of the Unified
      Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, the only validated scale in HD.

      Secondary criteria will assess motor,functional, psychiatric and cognitive functions,
      metabolic parameters, tolerance and cost.
