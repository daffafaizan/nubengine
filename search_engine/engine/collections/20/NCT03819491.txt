    
      The study will include 24 healthy subjects who will test the CoQ10 formulation. All 24
      subjects will test a single dose of 100mg CoQ10 in 1 day to assess bioavailability, which
      will be followed by a one week wash-out period and then by a 4 week period of continuous
      administration of COQUN ORAL FORMULATION in parallel groups (1:1): patients will be divided
      in the continuous treatment period into two groups, one group of 12 patients with intake of
      100mg OD, the other one group of 12 patients with intake of 100mg BID, in order to assess
      multiple-dose profile of COQUN ORAL FORMULATION.

      Patients will have to fast the night before enrolment, for at least 10 hours. Patients will
      be requested to fill in a short diary in the multidose phase, on a daily basis, for
      confirming the product correct intake, and informing on any experienced adverse event and
      eventual medication taken for its solving.
