      multimodal treatment which is designed to promote adaptation to stress and promotion of
      resiliency. The program is an 8 session, 1 hour a week multi modal intervention that
      incorporates relaxation techniques, stress awareness discussion, and adaptive strategies for
      coping with stress. This study will refine an 8-session group virtual-delivered resiliency
      treatment program consisting of 8 virtual group 1-1 Â½ hour sessions. The goal of this study
      would be to advance our ultimate objective to implement a national sibling resiliency
      program.
