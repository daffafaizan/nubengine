      the combination is not expected to increase toxicity seen when given as a single agent.
      Abnormal tumor microenvironments, tumor progression, and metastatic spread are major factors
      contributing to treatment failures in radiotherapy. Anti-VEGF agents (e.g. bevacizumab) can
      help overcome these factors through several different mechanisims.

      Studies also demonstrate prolonged use of anti-VEGF agents with radiation therapy was more
      effective at preventing metastases from irradiated tumors compared to a short course.
      Patients generally start hormonal therapy and daily radiotherapy at the same time. This study
      will delay the start of radiotherapy until 8 weeks after the start of hormonal therapy and
      bevacizumab.
