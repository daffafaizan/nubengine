      each. Patients will be randomized to placebo, tranexamic acid (TXA) 500 mg, tranexamic acid
      (TXA) 1000 mg, tranexamic acid (TXA) 1500 mg or tranexamic acid (TXA) 3000mg. In addition a
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study will be performed to identify the contribution of
      tranexamic acid (TXA) plasma concentration as a predictor of intra and postoperative D-Dimer
      values.
