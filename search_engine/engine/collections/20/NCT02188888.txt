      rate > of 95 bpm and requiring norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)
      between 65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation,will receive a continuous
      esmolol infusion to maintain heart rate between 94 and 80 bpm. Norepinephrine will be
      titrated to achieve a MAP between 65 and 75 mmHg. To investigate myocardial performance, we
      will simultaneously assess LV ejection fraction (LVEF), tricuspidal annular plane solid
      excursion (TAPSE) by echocardiography, the dP/dt MAX and the cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE)
      both estimated from the arterial pressure waveform. Finally we will analyze changes in static
      arterial elastance. Data will be obtained at baseline and after four hours once achieved the
      predefined heart rate threshold.
