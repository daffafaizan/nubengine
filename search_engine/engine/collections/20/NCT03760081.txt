    
      The study consists of 2 phases: Safety Lead-in phase and phase 2. The Safety Lead-in phase of
      this study is to establish the tolerability of RP2D. Nine to 18 participants will be enrolled
      in the Safety Lead-in phase. The RP2D determination will be based on at least 6 evaluable
      participants at the RP2D as determined by the Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC).

      Once RP2D has been established as tolerable, up to 34 participants including participants
      from the RP2D cohort of the Safety Lead-in phase will be enrolled in phase 2 to receive
      ASP1650 for up to a maximum of 12 cycles or until a study discontinuation criteria has been
      met, whichever occurs earlier.
