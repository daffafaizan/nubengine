    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of adoptively transferred SLC45A2-specific
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) for the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the anti-tumor efficacy as measured by immune-related response criteria
      (irRC) and duration of response in metastatic uveal melanoma patients receiving autologous
      CD8+ T cells against SLC45A2.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of adoptively transferred SLC45A2-specific CTL in
      combination with immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic uveal melanoma patients.

      III. To quantify in vivo numeric and functional persistence of transferred CTL, and
      development of antigen spreading in metastatic uveal melanoma patients.

      IV. To assess overall survival and progression-free survival in metastatic uveal melanoma
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of autologous CD8+ SLC45A2-specific T lymphocytes.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes
      on day -2.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous CD8+ SLC45A2-specific T lymphocytes via hepatic
      arterial infusion via central catheter over 60 minutes on day 0. Within 6 hours of T-cell
      infusion, patients also receive aldesleukin twice daily (BID) subcutaneously (SC) for 14 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      POST T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 22, 43, and
      64 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 84 and 168, and then
      every 3 months for up to 5 years.
