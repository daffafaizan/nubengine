    
      The trial is a 1:1 randomized, interventional, multi-national, multi-center, safety/efficacy,
      parallel assignment, open-label treatment study and will use the RRCT methodology. A RRCT
      study utilizes existing health care registry platforms to conduct a pragmatic prospective
      randomized trial.

      After the CABG, eligible patients that have consented to the study, will be randomized to
      either treatment arms. In the intervention arm, patients will be treated with ticagrelor 90
      mg twice daily and ASA 75-100 mg daily for 12 months and patients in the control arm will get
      ASA only (75-160 mg daily according to local guidelines) during the same time period.

      The patients will be followed by telephone interviews at 30 days and 365 days after
      inclusion. After the treatment period patients will be followed during an observation period
      by collection of outcome data from registries or medical records, 24, 36, 60 and 120 months
      after inclusion of the patient. No other data but the registry data or data from medical
      records will be collected.
