      epicardial/endocardial ablation approach consisting of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), LAA
      exclusion, isolation of the left atrial (LA) posterior wall and cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)
      line (Hybrid Sub-X MAZE) to (1) demonstrate that the hybrid procedure does not result in an
      unacceptable risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) in persistent or longstanding persistent
      atrial fibrillation (AF) subjects for whom an ablation procedure is planned; and (2) assess
      freedom from episodes of persistent AF > 30 seconds duration during the observation period
      through 12 months post PVI.
