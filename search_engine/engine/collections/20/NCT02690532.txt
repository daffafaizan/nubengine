      at high risk for celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) patients. This study
      will assess the gut permeability in three groups of patients 1) children who are at high risk
      for developing celiac disease (CD) (siblings of patients with celiac disease), 2) Children
      who are self-diagnosed with NCGS and 3) control group of patients matched for age and gender.
      Patients will undergo celiac serologic and genetic testing, after which the rhamnose test
      will be performed to assess the presence of increased gut permeability.
