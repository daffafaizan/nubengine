      mortality and is frequent in patients with acute cerebrovascular events. In this study the
      investigators observe the association between sleep disordered breathing, hypertension,
      stroke and the evolution of blood markers for atherosclerosis as well as the efficacy of
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment in patients with acute or subacute
      cerebrovascular events.

      The SAS CARE 1 study is planned to verify whether or not sleep disordered breathing has a
      detrimental 3 months effect on cardiovascular functions and markers after acute
      cerebrovascular events. The SAS CARE 2 study is designed to address whether or not the
      treatment of sleep disordered breathing with CPAP reduces the combined rate of mortality,
      stroke, cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction/revascularisation/instable angina/
      hospitalisation for heart insufficiency) over a 24 months period in patients after acute
      cerebrovascular events.
