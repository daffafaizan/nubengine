      neonates. Studies have shown that early reversal of the signs associated with severe disease
      is an important prognostic factor during acute illness. Vitamin A deficiency is widespread
      among children, including neonates, in developing countries. Vitamin A plays an important
      role in mediating immune responses and in maintaining epithelial integrity. For this reason
      vitamin A supplementation during the acute phase of neonatal infection could work
      synergistically with present antibiotic regimens in promoting early reversal of signs
      associated with adverse outcome and shorten the total duration of clinical illness. The
      purpose of the proposed hospital-based clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin
      A supplementation on reducing the morbidity and mortality among neonates hospitalized with
      sepsis (n=366) and NEC(n=150). Enrolled subjects will be randomized at the time of
      hospitalization to receive one dose of either 50,000 IU of vitamin A or placebo at
      enrollment, in addition to standard antibiotic therapy. We will compare the proportion of
      treatment failures in sepsis patients, the frequency of disease progression and mortality in
      NEC patients, and the time to clinical recovery and discharge between treatment groups. In
      addition, the study will determine whether vitamin A reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine
      levels; elevated host inflammatory cytokines are thought to contribute to the severity of
      both conditions. If vitamin A is found to be efficacious in the treatment of sepsis and NEC
      it could present a needed cost-effective approach to decreasing the global morbidity,
      mortality and the economic cost associated with neonatal sepsis and NEC in the developing
      world.
