      These data will be retrieved in the patient records. In particular the clinical (mouth) exam
      and the radiographic images ('RX-bite-wings'), which are routinely taken during these
      check-up consultations, will be used for the evaluation of recurrent caries. Information
      regarding medical background, oral hygiene, sugar eating habits and possible parafunctional
      activities will also be gathered from the patient files. In addition, caries risk of the
      patients will be assessed using commercial kits for analysis of their saliva (Saliva-Check
      Buffer, GC, Tokyo, Japan) and dental plaque (Tri Plaque ID Gel, GC, Tokyo, Japan), which are
      a part of the routine care of the patients at the clinic.
