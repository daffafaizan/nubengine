      different surfaces:

        -  Control group: stable surface.

        -  Experimental group - vibratory platform, make / model Nissan Fisio; orbital amplitude: 6
           mm; frequency: 30 Hz The exercises consisted of unipodal support on the non-dominant
           lower limb with the contralateral limb in a knee flexion near 90ยบ. This exercise is a
           proprioceptive test that requires more than all joints and musculature of the lower
           limb, and is widely used in studies, for providing obvious clinical signs in the
           presence of dysfunctions.

      Activities were performed with the individual standing without using any type of footwear,
      remaining without support of the hands and with the upper limbs abducted to 90ยบ with the
      fixed eye on the horizon line. Both groups performed 4 sets of 60s of sustained posture. In
      the intervals between the series there was the rest of 60s, remaining in orthostasis with
      support of the upper limbs.
