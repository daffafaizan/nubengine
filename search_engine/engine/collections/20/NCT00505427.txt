      be responsible for many of the long term complications of PCOS. Patients with PCOS are at
      increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (hypertension,
      dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease). Data suggest that oxidative stress contributes to
      insulin resistance and thus inhibitors of oxidative stress improve insulin action. Alpha
      Lipoic Acid (LA) is synthesized in the liver and other tissues and is a key component of
      several mitochondrial enzyme complexes responsible for oxidative glucose metabolism and
      cellular energy production. When used pharmacologically, LA functions as a safe and effective
      antioxidant, recycling vitamins C and E,elevating glutathione levels,and lowering reactive
      oxygen species. Cell culture studies reveal that LA reverses the effects of oxidative stress
      and improving insulin action. Preliminary clinical data indicate that antioxidants may
      improve insulin resistance in PCOS patients. We propose, therefore, to study LA's effects on
      insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (insulin clamp) in a well characterized population of
      insulin resistant PCOS patients. Because these patients usually present in the adolescent and
      teenage years, the development of safe, long-term, treatment strategies are needed.
