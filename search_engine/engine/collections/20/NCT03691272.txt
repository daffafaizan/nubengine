      age, sex, education, headache history, concussion history, past medical history, medication
      use, and family medical history. Headache history will be collected including frequency,
      severity, medication-use, type of headache, associated symptoms (i.e. neck pain, photophobia,
      phonophobia, nausea, vomiting) and headache triggers. Baseline questionnaires will be
      completed including headache intensity scale - 6 (HIT-6), Rivermead PPCS questionnaire,
      British Columbia post-concussion symptom inventory (BC-PSI), Montreal cognitive assessment
      (MoCA), quality of life after brain injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI), patient health
      questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder scale-7 (GADS-7) and the post traumatic
      stress disorder checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Patients will keep a two-week baseline headache
      diary before treatment, 2 weeks during treatment, 2 weeks following rTMS, and for 2 weeks at
      the 1, 3, and 6 month follow up assessments (total of 12 weeks). Patients will be reassessed
      at the completion of their rTMS treatment (day 14), and at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment.
      The questionnaires including: HIT-6, Rivermead PPCS questionnaire, PC-PSI, QOLIBRI, PHQ-9 and
      GAD-7 will be completed at all follow up visits.
