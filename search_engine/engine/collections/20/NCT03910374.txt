      patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery that the use of L-PRF is
      non-inferior to classical fibrin sealants.

      Approximately 220 patients undergoing cranial surgery will be enrolled in this randomized,
      controlled, single-blinded multicenter study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      autologous blood-derived products (L-PRF and fibrinogen) compared to the fibrin sealants as
      an adjunct for dural repair.
