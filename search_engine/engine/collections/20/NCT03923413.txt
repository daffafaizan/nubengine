      option in end stage heart failure not merely as bridge-to transplant but also as destination
      therapy. LVADs are associated with impaired endothelial function as well as with a dysbalance
      of coagulation leading to both, excessive bleeding and thromboembolic events, respectively.
      Microparticles (MPs) are shed membrane particles budded into the circulation and considered
      as a marker of compromised endothelial integrity and enhanced procoagulation levels. In
      addition, MPs have been suggested to play an active role in the induction of endothelial
      dysfunction and coagulation. First studies demonstrated increased level of MPs in patients
      with LVAD. Whether circulating MPs contribute to impaired endothelial function and enhanced
      coagulation in patients with LVAD and thereby promote thrombotic complications is unknown.

      The aims of this project are 1) to evaluate whether circulating MPs in patients with LVAD
      impair endothelial function and 2) to assess the procoagulative activity of circulating MPs
      in patients with LVAD in a prospective longitudinal study of patients undergoing LVAD
      implantation, 3) to analyze these parameters in the context of thromboembolic events.
