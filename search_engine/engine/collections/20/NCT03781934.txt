      subjects and include a total of one dose escalation per patient. All patients will receive an
      initial probe dose before entering the actual treatment cycles. Once pre-defined criteria for
      starting phase 1b has been met among the enrolled patients in phase 1a, the next phase of the
      study will be initiated. Phase 1b will enroll up to 30 patients in a 3+3 design with
      interpatient dose escalations. All dose escalation decisions will be made by an independent
      safety review committee that will meet regularly during the study conduct. As the MTD has
      been met, the SRC will provide a RP2D which will initiate phase 2a of the study. In phase 2a
      only HCC and iCCA patients will be recruited into two expansion cohorts.
