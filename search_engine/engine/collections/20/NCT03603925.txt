      analysis methods for MR-AC, PET SUVs in lesions and normal tissues can be measured using
      PET/MR and be within 5% agreement of those measured using PET/CT.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate visual and quantitative agreement between
      synthesized CT images generated from MR data and the reference, measured CT images.

      Study Design This study would like to enroll patients receiving a clinically indicated PET/CT
      scan. The patients will be asked to agree to a receive research PET/MR scan within the study
      which requires additional time and potential MR risks for the patient. It does not entail
      extra injections or radiation exposure. Research acquisition and processing will be performed
      on the PET/MR data to create PET images that are expected to have quantitatively accurate
      SUVs. These will be compared to SUVs from the clinical PET/CT which will serve as the
      reference standard.

      Outcome By bringing together cutting-edge advances in both MR acquisition and image analyses,
      the successful completion of these aims will achieve SUVs that are within 5% of those
      obtained with PET/CT (reference standard) with clinically appropriate acquisition time, image
      quality, and diagnostic accuracy, so that PET/MR systems meet SUV accuracy requirements
      needed to qualify for cooperative group clinical trials.
