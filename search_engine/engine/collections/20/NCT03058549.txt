      (FE) targets the transition to parenthood as a critical time to help couples focus on family
      success. Regardless of whether couples are married or unmarried, the goal of FE is to
      strengthen relationships and advance the well-being of economically disadvantaged couples who
      are expecting a baby or who are new parents, and to improve the lives of their children. The
      FE program, including the Becoming Parents (BP) curriculum and supplemental services, is
      designed to address specific risk factors that affect individual family members and the
      relationships among them, and to build protective factors that help families avoid, minimize,
      or manage risks (e.g., individual maladaptation [mother, father, child], couple relationship
      difficulties, parenting difficulties, and economic insufficiency).

      A total of 1,355 couples will be randomly assigned to either Family Expectations (n = 813;
      60%) or an untreated control group (n = 542; 40%). Once assigned, participants in the study
      will complete baseline questions by survey. Those assigned to the FE track will be scheduled
      for services with the FE intervention team and the control group will not receive the FE
      intervention. Members of the intervention and control groups will be surveyed both before
      they are randomly assigned and 12 months later. The study will examine if the Family
      Expectations program is associated with improved outcomes on relationship quality, stability,
      parenting quality, father involvement, child wellbeing, and hopefulness about employment.
