      panretinal photocoagulation. However, it is a treatment that results in significant
      discomfort to the patient, causes reduction of visual acuity and visual field impairment.
      Intravitreal bevacizumab is a novel treatment that reduces intraocular VEGF concentration and
      therefore inhibits neovascular proliferation, without causing significant disconfort to the
      patient, nor affecting visual acuity or visual fields (although with other risks associated
      with intravitreal injection). Making a comparison between both treatments in different
      patients is difficult because there are other variables that influence the progression of the
      disease (such as glycemic control or renal insufficiency). Therefore this study is designed
      using both treatments in the same patient: intravitreal bevacizumab in one eye, compared to
      panretinal photocoagulation in the contralateral eye, and evaluating visual acuity, visual
      fields, fluorescein angiography, optic coherence tomography of the macula, and patient
      discomfort, in a one-year follow-up.
