      bacterial colonization,inflammation and progressive tissue destruction.Patients with
      bronchiectasis frequently developed acute exacerbations characterised by acute worsening
      requiring changes in concomitant use of medication,with attendant adverse effects on their
      morbidity and health-related quality of life. The detailed pathogenesis of exacerbations of
      bronchiectasis, however, remains poorly understood.

      Recent data suggested that airway infection and inflammation are important drivers of
      exacerbations,therefore the imbalance between chronic bacterial infection and host immune
      response may result in bronchiectasis exacerbations. Viral infection may be an important
      factor that leads to this events.It has been established that respiratory viruses are mainly
      responsible for the exacerbations of other chronic respiratory diseases, i.e. asthma, COPD
      and cystic fibosis. However, the data regarding prospective studies that sought to
      investigate the roles of viruses in acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis are lacking.
      Furthermore,the associations between viruses and bacteria during exacerbation need to be
      assessed. This study targets at indentifying the frenquency of common viral infections in
      adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and may shed light on the effects they have on
      clinical parameters,i.e. the length of exacerbated symptom to recovery,lung function,
      pulmonary inflammation, bacterial load and quality of life.
