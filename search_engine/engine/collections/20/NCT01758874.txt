      include 20 patients divided into 2 groups on the basis of a randomized controlled trial: 10
      patients in the control group receiving conventional treatment and 10 patients receiving
      therapeutic phlebotomy to lower blood viscosity. The objective is to evaluate the effect of
      controlled phlebotomy in patients with Grade 3, Category 5 or 6 chronic critical limb
      ischemia having tissue loss on Rutherford classification (Fontaine stage IV), end-stage
      peripheral vascular disease resistant to maximal medical therapy and where revascularization
      therapy (both percutaneous and surgical) has either proved insufficient or is
      contra-indicated or declined by the patient, usually resulting in amputation.

      The primary outcome parameters will be: the salvage rate of the limb as compared with the
      salvage rate of the limb with conventional therapy.

      Objective classification of improvement in perfusion of the distal extremities using
      ankle-brachial index (ABI), visual analogue pain scale, and photos.

      Subjective classification of improvement in pain scale on critical limbs.

      The relationship between alteration in outcome parameters (i.e., the end point is a reduced
      amputation rate) and blood viscosity will be evaluated as measured by the home-made rheologic
      methods.
