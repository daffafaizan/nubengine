      and cardiometabolic health has increased over the last 20 years, more than 60% of older
      adults remain sedentary for greater than 8 hours per day. Moreover, 80% to 90% of adults 60
      years of age or older do not meet the current public health guidelines for aerobic exercise
      (AE) or resistance exercise (RE) based physical activity (PA). Collectively, these adverse
      health behaviors contribute to the development of multiple chronic medical conditions
      commonly afflicting older adults, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
      sarco/dynapenia, frailty, and premature mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that breaking
      up sedentary time with light intensity PA (LPA) improves muscle and cardiometabolic health.
      Recent data also suggest that RE combined with moderate intensity AE effectively improves
      muscle and cardiometabolic health in older adults. However, the impact that RE combined with
      LPA breaks in sedentary time has on muscle and cardiometabolic health in older adults remains
      unknown. The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine the effect of 16 weeks of
      RE alone or RE combined with LPA breaks in sedentary time on muscle and cardiometabolic
      health.
