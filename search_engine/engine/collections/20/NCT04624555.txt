    
      Participants who were diagnosed with Stage I-III colorectal cancer will undergo testing with
      mt-sDNA followed by a questionnaire about satisfaction with mt-sDNA (multitarget stool DNA
      panel), prior to their scheduled colonoscopies at years 1 and 4 after diagnosis.

      Participants will be asked to provide a stool sample for mt-sDNA (Cologuard) testing that
      will be collected within 90 days before their scheduled colonoscopy. The kit will be given to
      the participant by study personnel and mailed back directly to Exact Science.
