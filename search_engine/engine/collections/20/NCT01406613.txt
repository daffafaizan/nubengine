      medication on bone quantity and quality, in patients who have previously taken bisphosphonate
      drugs for a duration of two years.

      This study will recruit participants who have previously completed the TRIO study. The TRIO
      study aimed to compare the effects of three licensed bisphosphonates on bone quantity and
      quality. Participants in the treatment group of the TRIO study were randomised to treatment
      with one of three licensed bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate) for a
      duration of two years.

      Measurements taken at the final TRIO study visit will be used as 'baseline' values for this
      study. The postmenopausal group will have an informed consent visit, followed by further
      study visits at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks after stopping medication.

      Study visit procedures for the postmenopausal group will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks off
      treatment.

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks off
      treatment Height and weight at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment. Bone Mineral Density of the
      whole body, spine, hip, forearm (DXA) and heel (DXL) at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment
      Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment. Quantitative Ultrasound
      of Bone (QUS) of the heel at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment.

      Participants will be given a diary at their first study visit, to record any newly prescribed
      medications, hospitalisations, etc. The diary will be reviewed at each study visit to record
      any adverse events or concomitant medications. Participants will also be asked to complete
      the standard Metabolic Bone Centre questionnaire at their first and final study visit, so
      that any changes in lifestyle can be captured. We will maintain the patients on treatment
      with calcium and vitamin D supplements throughout the study as this would be consistent with
      standard clinical practice.

      The TRIO study recruited a group of premenopausal women in order to collect data to act as a
      reference range for the physical measurements and also to act as internal controls for the
      study. This study plans to recruit these control participants to continue to act as a
      reference range in this study.

      The premenopausal group will have a single study visit, scheduled 96 weeks after completing
      the TRIO study. Study visit procedures for the premenopausal (reference) group will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers Urine based pregnancy test Height
      and weight Bone Mineral Density of the hip and spine (DXA).

      A subgroup of 50 premenopausal (reference) women will also have the following:

      Bone Mineral Density of the whole body, forearm (DXA) and heel (DXL) Quantitative Ultrasound
      of Bone (QUS) of the heel Participants will be asked to complete the standard Metabolic Bone
      Centre questionnaire, so that any changes in lifestyle can be captured. Participants will
      also be asked about any hospitalisations, newly prescribed medications, etc to capture any
      adverse events and concomitant medications.
