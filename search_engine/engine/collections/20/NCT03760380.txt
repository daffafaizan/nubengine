      may help reduce knee pain and improve function. This is a 2-phase study designed to evaluate
      knee pain and function in healthy participants with a history of medial knee arthritis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate: 1. how using the shoe device will affect a person's
      walking gait and balance over a single day; and 2. how using the shoe device over the course
      of a 12-week period will affect a person's walking gait and balance.
