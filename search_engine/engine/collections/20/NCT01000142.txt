    
      This study will randomly assign 36 nursing home patients from two Kirksville nursing homes
      into three groups of twelve subjects: 1) treatment as usual (TAU) control group; 2) light
      touch (LT) group, and 3) standard OMT group.

      This study will begin with rolling admission of volunteer nursing home patients starting in
      October 2009. Subjects in the LT and OMT group would receive focused musculoskeletal
      evaluations twice a month for 5 months (10 visits). The OMT group would also receive an OMT
      protocol each visit that would specifically address optimization of homeostatic mechanisms -
      balancing autonomic nervous system and improving lymphatic drainage- along with OMT that
      would specifically target somatic dysfunction found on that day's evaluation. The LT group
      subjects would receive a light touch protocol meant to simulate OMT. The TAU group will
      receive no intervention. The protocol period will end for all subjects by March 2010. All
      osteopathic examinations, assessments, and treatments will be performed at the participating
      nursing homes.

      Throughout the protocol period, at the end of the winter (March 2010), and three months later
      (June 2010), retrospective chart reviews will be conducted on all subjects. All cause
      morbidity and mortality for all subjects will be assessed by monitoring their medications,
      health history changes, and hospitalizations.
