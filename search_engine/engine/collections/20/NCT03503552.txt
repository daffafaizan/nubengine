      demonstrated and is amplified by increased weight gain. Relative to Malay and Caucasian
      populations, the prevalence of obesity increased sharply in people of Chinese and Indian
      ethnicity and diabetes risk is prevalent at a BMI of 21 (equivalent to a BMI >25 in Caucasian
      populations). It was also speculated that Chinese Singaporean women are prone to metabolic
      syndrome at a lower BMI. This study will recruit two groups of postmenopausal women with
      different BMI's and to measure markers for metabolic syndrome. These participants will visit
      Clinical Nutrition Research Centre for a single session and will undergo a whole body scan
      and a regional scan of the lumbar spine and femoral neck with a bone densitometer and fasting
      baseline blood and urine samples collected. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan will
      provide percentage fat mass, fat in gram, whole body bone mineral content and total body lean
      mass. From these, gynoid and android fat distribution will be derived and appendicular lean
      mass will be calculated and an index calculated using kg/m2 to give an indication of relative
      muscle mass. In addition blood and urine samples will be collected for metabolic risk
      analysis. Participants will be also be undergoing a Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT)
      scan which will allow true volumetric measurements of the lumbar spine and proximal femur
      independent of the body size. Volumetric density values will be measured in Hounsfield units
      transformed into Bone Mineral Density measurements using a calibration phantom underneath the
      patient. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the 3rd lumbar vertebra and the right hip will also be
      performed.
