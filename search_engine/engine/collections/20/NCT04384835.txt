      females after puberty suggesting a protective action of male sex hormones. ILC2 have recently
      emerged as critical players in the initiation of allergic responses. Pr Guery's team
      established that androgens, signaling through the nuclear receptor 3 C4 (NR3C4) androgen
      receptor (AR), negatively control ILC2 at steady state and during lung inflammation. Relevant
      to this application, females with asthma have more circulating ILC2 than males. The present
      hypothesis is that harnessing AR signaling in ILC2 may provide a new therapeutic approach to
      down regulate tissue resident ILC2. This project will analyze the sex bias in circulating
      ILC2 in female and male patients with moderate to severe asthma. In females with asthma, the
      team will purify circulating ILC2 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and expand
      them in vitro using cytokines and stromal cells in the presence of AR antagonist or agonist
      ligands. Bulk ILC2 cultures at day 7 will used to measure the expression profile of various
      gene, including AR.
