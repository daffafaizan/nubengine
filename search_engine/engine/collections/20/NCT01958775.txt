      mathematical modelling will be utilised to measure lipoprotein production and clearance. The
      lipoproteins assessed will be apoB-100 from the liver and apoB-48 from the intestine.

      StudyB: Volunteers will be given a liquid meal with retinyl palmitate (vitamin A) to label
      chylomicrons made from the meal. 7 hours later they will be given GLP-2 or placebo.
      Measurements of plasma and TRL(triglyceride rich lipoprotein) triglyceride and TRL retinyl
      palmitate will be carried out to see whether GLP-2 increases these parameters.
