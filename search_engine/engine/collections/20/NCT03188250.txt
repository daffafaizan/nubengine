      participation, membership retention, and continuation of the groups beyond the one year. To
      evaluate the effect of chamas, the investigators compared data from a prospective cohort of
      women in chamas with a group of controls who did not belong to a chama, matched for age,
      parity, and location of prenatal care. To evaluate the acceptability of chamas, FGDs were
      carried out with chama and non-chama participants, health providers and community health
      workers.
