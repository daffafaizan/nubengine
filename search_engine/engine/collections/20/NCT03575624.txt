      in the inequities of health, wellness, and quality of life experienced by African American
      breast cancer survivors (AABCS) living in urban Milwaukee. AABCS outcomes in Milwaukee are
      significantly worse (OR=1.55) than those of Caucasian survivors.

      The American Diabetes Association/American Cancer Society expert committee recommends the
      promotion of a healthy diet, physical activity, and weight management with low waist
      circumference to prevent diabetes, cancer, and obesity and to extend life expectancy.
      According to the National Health Interview Survey, 56% of African Americans are inactive.
      Yoga is one way to increase physical activity while improving wellness and health in AABCS.

      The investigator's goal was to facilitate improved self-care efficacy through evidence-based
      integrative health and wellness strategies to help families overcome the effects of multiple
      negative, deep-rooted social determinants.
