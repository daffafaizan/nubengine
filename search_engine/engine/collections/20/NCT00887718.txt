      However, clinicians are increasingly using the FDG-PET result, where obtained, in deciding
      management. Consequently, it would be premature to mandate PET-based treatment modifications
      in this protocol. Patients will be treated with existing protocols at the discretion of their
      treating oncologists, based on available information. Oncologists will be surveyed as to
      whether FDG-PET scan results could have (or affect patient management, and the intervention
      will be recorded).
