      will serve as the CBRN intervention sites. The investigators will also enroll 30
      independently living community dwelling subjects who are prescribed at least 1 cardiovascular
      medication for HF and 3 additional chronic medications after discharge from Newport Hospital
      for an MTM consultation at a CBRN pharmacy. The investigators will assess the implementation
      of our community intervention based on the REAIM framework. The specific aims are:

      Specific Aim 1 (Efficacy): To investigate whether pharmacists who receive the CBRN MTM
      empowerment training will experience improvement in (aim 1a) self-efficacy and (aim 1b)
      empowerment from baseline to 180-days.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess over the 180-day period, 2a) the reach, 2b) adoption, 2c)
      implementation (consistency, time spent in lieu of cost and adaptation) including barriers
      and facilitators.

      Specific Aim 3 Exploratory: To determine whether HF patients who receive an MTM intervention
      from a CBRN community pharmacist experience improvement in HF Self-care behaviors and
      medication adherence from baseline to 180 days.

      Specific Aim 4: To establish a CBRN registry of HF patients to track community pharmacy
      practices in MTM, hard events such as rehospitalization and death and to evaluate the
      feasibility of collecting HF outcomes from EPIC electronic health record compared to patient
      self-report and physician adjudication.
