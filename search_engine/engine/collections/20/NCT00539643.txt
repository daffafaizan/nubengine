      soft, deformable microspheres that may be loaded with doxorubicin and used to occlude blood
      flow to a cancerous tumour. LC Bead microspheres consist of a macromere derived from PVA. The
      fully polymerized microsphere is approximately 90% water and is compressible to approximately
      30% by diameter. The microspheres can be delivered through conventional catheters (4-5Fr) or
      micro-catheters in the 2-3Fr range. These microspheres, like all agents used for arterial
      embolization, are mixed with radiographic contrast prior to administration in order to allow
      for fluoroscopic control of the embolization procedure.
