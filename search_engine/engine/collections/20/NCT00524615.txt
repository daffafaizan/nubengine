      antihypertensive drugs is common. At present there are is no standard therapy for resistant
      hypertension based on randomised clinical trials, neither data to guide addition of further
      drugs to therapy. Recently some observational and retrospective trials reported good effect
      of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension, but these data were not validated
      by prospective randomised clinical trials.

      This is a multicentric, randomised, double blind clinical trial, which will evaluate the
      effect of addition of 25 mg spironolactone to current medication compared to placebo. The
      study will enroll patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg during a clinical
      examination, which are using at least three antihypertensive drugs, one of them being a
      diuretic. Average daytime systolic and diastolic blodd pressure will be evaluated by ABPM
      (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring).
