      and neck cancers. This has led radiation oncologists to investigate novel approaches offering
      better therapeutic indexes. Modification of dose fractionation schedules can improve the
      therapeutic outcome by using accelerated or hyperfractionated regimes -Ang, 1990; Ang, 1998;
      Fu, 2000; Gwozdz, 1997-. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) technique allows the
      planning and irradiation of different targets at different dose levels in a single treatment
      session, instead of successive treatment plans. With conventional 2D radiotherapy, both
      normal tissues and tumors are irradiated with a similar dose per fraction of 1.8-2 Gy,
      whereas with IMRT dose gradients are introduced in such a manner that normal tissues receive
      a much lower dose per fraction.
