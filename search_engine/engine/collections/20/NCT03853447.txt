    
      Chronic pancreatitis (CP) represents the end-stage of a continuous disease process evolving
      from acute pancreatitis (AP), over recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP). Due to the
      irreversible nature of CP, early detection and prevention is key. The study uses
      state-of-the-art imaging modalities as well as biochemical markers of to evaluate fibrosis
      progression in patients with pancreatitis.

      The included participants have either first time AP, RAP, early CP with preserved pancreatic
      exocrine and endocrine function or end-stage CP with exocrine insufficiency. Included
      patients will be followed prospectively for 15 years with advanced MRI and contrast enhanced
      EUS with elastography, assessment of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function, biochemical
      and nutritional assessment, and evaluation of pain processing using quantitative sensory
      testing. Blood for a biobank will be obtained. The purpose of the biobank is to allow
      analyses of potential biomarkers for the progression of disease eventually leading to CP.
