      generally assumed that a multidisciplinary approach, combining both pharmacologic and
      non-pharmacologic measures, is probably the optimal treatment approach for most fibromyalgia
      patients. As these patients are usually physically deconditioned, low-intensity exercise has
      been recommended at least as initial treatment. At this respect, exercise in warm water is
      considered a good option as both temperature and water buoyancy minimize body weight's stress
      and help patients to minimize pain. In a previous study comparing short term physiotherapy
      with stretching and Ai Chi we found that Ai Chi was at least as effective as stretching and
      induced a significant reduction in fibromyalgia core symptomatology and in sleep parameters.
      The objective of the present randomized controlled study is to compare both physiotherapy
      techniques in a long term basis.
