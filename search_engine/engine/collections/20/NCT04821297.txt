      I. To evaluate the feasibility of CervixChat intervention in a mix method design, through
      participants consent rate and the study completion rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the acceptability of CervixChat intervention using a validated Likert-scale
      participant satisfaction questionnaire, as well as participant's interview data.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary impact of CervixChat intervention, by comparing the colposcopy
      appointment adherence rate in the study cohort against a 1:1 matched control sample selected
      based on matching age, race and ethnicity, from participants at Jefferson Obstetrics and
      Gynecology (Ob-Gyn) colposcopy clinic in 2019.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive text messages for 1-2 months before scheduled appointment. Patients also
      complete a survey at baseline and after standard of care colposcopy and an interview after
      standard of care colposcopy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
