      PubMed and Google Scholar as search engines and the key words used were lumbar manipulation,
      hypo-mobility, spinal stiffness, non-thrust manipulation, lumbar mobilizations,
      segmentalstiffness.The purpose of the literature review is to find out the pre-existing
      literature regarding the Lumbar mobilizations and TJM interventions for Lumbar Hypomobility.

      In 2019 a systematic review conducted by Aoyagi et al on effectiveness of spinal mobilization
      stated that there is a moderate to high quality evidence on Spinal mobilizations as effective
      intervention in low back pain as it decreases pain and improve Range of motion In 2019,a
      systematic review conducted by Hofstetter et al on Instrumented measurement of spinal
      stiffness stated that mechanical devices revealed excellent reliability tool to measure
      Spinal stiffness especially in prone position.

      In 2019, a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by a chi Ngai Lo et al on Spinal
      manipulation stated that HVLAT is highly effective as an treatment protocol then no
      intervention or sham manipulation because it improves muscle strength in healthy population
