    
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of:

        1. high-dose furosemide (HDF, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion
           of 20 mg/h for a total of 8 hours),

        2. low-dose furosemide (LDF, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion
           of 5 mg/h furosemide for a total of 8 hours), and

        3. low-dose furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine (LDFD, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV,
           followed by continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/h furosemide plus 5Î¼g/kg/min dopamine for a
           total of 8 hours) on diuresis, perceived dyspnea, renal function, electrolyte balance,
           total length of stay, and 60-day post-discharge outcomes in patients hospitalized with
           ADHF.
