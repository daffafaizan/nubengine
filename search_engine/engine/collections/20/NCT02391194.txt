      to women with primary, non-recurrent breast cancer undergoing surgery. The study will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of AVB-620 in this subject population and determine the
      dose of AVB-620 needed to generate a fluorescence signal in tumor and lymph node tissue to
      enable fluorescence recordings and image analysis with an imaging system. The study will also
      evaluate the effect of timing of AVB-620 administration, relative to surgery, on fluorescence
      characteristics.
