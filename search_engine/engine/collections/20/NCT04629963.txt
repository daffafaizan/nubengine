      in torture survivors. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data from 25
      subjects from the Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights, is that the novel application in
      torture survivors of a validated pain screen, the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPISF),
      can supplement the United Nations Istanbul Protocol (UNIP) and improve its sensitivity for
      pain from 15% to 90%, as compared to the gold standard (a pain specialist). The rationale for
      the investigation is to improve the diagnosis of pain in torture survivors, leading to
      targeted treatment.

      The objectives of this study are to improve the diagnosis of pain in torture survivors with
      the novel utilization in this population of a pain screen. The findings of this study also
      have implications for other populations that experience complex trauma such as veterans,
      prisoners of war, and sexual violence survivors.
