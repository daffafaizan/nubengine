      development of the lymphatic system. They typically present in children under 2 years of age
      and in almost 50% of the cases, are diagnosed at birth. There is neither a racial nor a
      sexual tendency. The malformations can occur anywhere on the body, but typically they are in
      the head/neck area.

      Morbidity can be significant. Besides the obvious cosmetic deformity caused by these tumors,
      there is risk of infection and airway compromise and even obstruction. However, effective
      therapeutic options are limited. Small lesions can be observed, although spontaneous
      resolution is unlikely. For larger lesions, surgery has been the traditional form of therapy.
      In the head and neck, in particular, lymphangiomas typically wrap themselves around major
      neurovascular structures, making total excision removal difficult, if not impossible, and
      thus the likelihood of recurrence is quite high.

      Because of these surgical limitations, alternate therapies have been considered; including
      cryotherapy, diathermy, and chemical sclerotherapy.

      The investigators experience with using the drug for macrocystic disease(large cysts) since
      1992 in the United States has been very promising compared to traditional surgery. Recurrence
      rate to date, has been very minimal as well. (<2%)
