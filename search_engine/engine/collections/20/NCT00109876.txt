      I. To assess the overall 2-year survival rate after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess freedom from regional or distant recurrence. II. To assess freedom from local
      recurrence in the ablated lobe. III. To estimate the number of procedures deemed technical
      successes. IV. To evaluate procedure-specific morbidity and mortality. V. To explore the
      utility of immediate (within 96 hours) post-RFA positron emission tomography (PET) in
      predicting overall survival and local control.

      VI. To explore the effect of RFA on both short-term (3 months post-RFA) and long-term (24
      months post-RFA) pulmonary function.

      OUTLINE:

      A radiofrequency electrode is placed by CT guidance into the target tumor. Patients undergo
      RFA directly to the tumor for up to 12 minutes to obtain an intratumoral temperature > 60Â°
      Celsius (C). Patients may receive 3 RFA treatments (a total of 36 minutes) to obtain the
      target temperature.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
