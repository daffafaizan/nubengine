      anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor actions by blocking endothelial and tumor cell invasion and
      matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. Based on this data, we have started a phase II trial
      for the treatment of HIV-negative patients with CKS with the HIV-PI Indinavir. Indinavir was
      well tolerated and induced KS regression/improvement in early-stage disease, and prolonged
      stabilization in late-stage KS. Response required high plasma drug concentrations indicating
      a "therapeutic" drug threshold, and was associated with a decrease of circulating endothelial
      cells (CEC), basic fibroblast growth factor and MMP2 plasma levels. However, large, confluent
      tumor masses were generally not responsive (Monini et al, AIDS 2009). Thus, advanced KS may
      benefit at best by treatment with IND upon tumor debulking by conventional chemotherapy.
