      chronic gastritis, gastric cancer, and increasing antibiotic resistance. Eradication of H.
      pylori reduces morbidity in patients with chronic gastritis and can prevent gastric cancer in
      the high-risk population. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin-based triple
      therapy and non-bismuth based quadruple therapy for eradicating H. pylori in patients with
      chronic gastritis in Kuwait. We enrolled treatment-naive dyspeptic patients with gastric
      biopsy-proven chronic gastritis secondary to H. pylori in a prospective, open-label,
      randomized study conducted at the gastroenterology outpatient clinics of Haya Habeeb
      gastroenterology center in Kuwait. Patients were randomized into two groups: the first group
      received the standard triple therapy (omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) for 14
      days; and the second group received quadruple therapy (omeprazole, amoxicillin,
      clarithromycin, and metronidazole) for 14 days. All patients were tested for the eradication
      of H. pylori by carbon-13 urea breath test (13C-UBT) one month after completion of
      eradication therapy.
