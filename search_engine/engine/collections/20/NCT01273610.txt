      trastuzumab and lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) in adults age 60 or older with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the full toxicity
      profile including all grades; to estimate the rate of all grades of cardiac toxicity; to
      estimate the rate of all grades of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. II. To describe the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of lapatinib in older adults. III. To estimate objective response
      rate and clinical benefit rate as defined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria. IV. To estimate median progression-free and overall survival. V. To
      explore factors other than chronological age that can affect toxicity rates as identified
      using a cancer-specific geriatric assessment. VI. To estimate rates of adherence to lapatinib
      in older adults.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and trastuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once weekly OR once every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of
      study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then periodically thereafter.
