    
      This trial is the extension of a core study: Phase 1 Trial of a Fully Human Monoclonal
      Antibody of Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor-Îº B Ligand (RNAKL, TK006) Safety,
      Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics in Patients With Breast Cancer-related Bone Metastases
      (NCT 03239756). It's an open labelled study, aimed at evaluating the safety of repeated
      administration of TK006 in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases. The qualified
      subjects would be those completed the entire observation in either 60 mg, 120 mg or 180 mg
      single dose arm at the core study. Also, these patients should be well-tolerated with TK006
      at the core study and are deemed to further benefit from this extension phase estimated by
      the researcher and sponsor. The subjects would receive 120 mg TK006 every 4-week over a
      period of 84 days.

      Only safety profile and immunogenicity assessment would be assessed in this extension stage,
      and no further study on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics would be done.
