      significance of oncogenic PI3K/AKT (phophatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine-threonine kinase,
      also known as protein kinase B [PKB]) pathway. PI3K(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT
      pathway phosphorylates and activates AKT as phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and plays a critical
      role promoting malignant phenotype and has prognostic significance in various solid cancers.

      However, a systematic approach on the impact of p-AKT overexpression on clinical outcomes has
      not been performed in malignant lymphoma.
