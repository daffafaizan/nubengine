    
      A comprehensive echocardiographic study of the heart will be conducted in the first, second
      and third trimesters of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum.

      Determination of left ventricular dimensions, transvalvular Doppler flow, ejection fraction,
      stroke volume, cardiac output, pulmonary vein flow, tissue Doppler, flow propagation, global
      and segmental strain parameters, timing of peak strain and various parameters of diastolic
      function will be obtained.

      From these data normal values for various stages of pregnancy will be determined as well as
      range for changes expected during longitudinal follow-up will be determined.
