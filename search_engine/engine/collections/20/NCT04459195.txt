      groups. Static stretching was administered to the gastrocnemius muscle. Stretching
      applications will be applied to the first group for 2 minutes and to the second group for 5
      minutes. Muscle vascularization will be evaluated by a new method, superb microvascular
      imaging (SMI). SMI is a recently developed ultrasound imaging technique that aims to
      visualize low velocity and small diameter blood vessel flow.
