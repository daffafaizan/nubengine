      orthopedic pathology (congenital, coxarthrosis) and non-efficient organisation of clinical
      work-flow are still very high (especially in rural areas). Standard telemedicine work
      stations (with special protocols and manuals for original approach to telemedicine activity
      organisation and management) will be placed into small municipal and rural hospitals.
      Telemedicine links will be established between 3rd level Trauma&Ortho center and remote
      sites. Synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultations will be perform for help in
      evidence-based timely clinical decisions, continual support of clinical wor-flow and
      treatment process.
