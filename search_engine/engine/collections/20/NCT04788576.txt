    
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a clinical syndrome in patients
      with current or prior symptoms of HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¥ 50
      percent and evidence of cardiac dysfunction as a cause of symptoms (abnormal LV filling and
      elevated filling pressures). Previous studies have reported that HFpEF is related to various
      clinical risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney
      disease, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia with or without significant epicardial
      coronary artery stenosis, or myocardial infiltrative disease. Although its pathophysiology
      remains incompletely understood, findings from clinical and pre-clinical studies have
      suggested systemic endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and coronary microvascular
      dysfunction (CMD) could be important pathophysiologic mechanisms for HFpEF.

      In this regard, recent studies evaluated non-invasively measured coronary flow reserve (CFR)
      from positron emission tomography (PET), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or Doppler
      echocardiography, and presented the association of depressed global CFR with cardiac
      diastolic dysfunction and higher risk of clinical events. The presence of CMD can be also
      evaluated by invasive physiologic assessment using both CFR and index of microcirculatory
      resistance (IMR). Nevertheless, there has been limited study which evaluated the association
      between HFpEF and CMD using invasive physiologic indices and their prognostic implications,
      especially in patients without significant coronary artery stenosis. Therefore, we sought to
      evaluate the incidence of CMD and its' prognostic implication in patients who have diagnosed
      as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) confirmed by HFA-PEFF scoring
      system without functionally significant coronary artery disease.
