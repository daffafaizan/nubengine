      exercises involved in the training are labor-intensive, highly repetitious leading to
      monotonicity and decreased motivation levels. Therefore, many health care researchers are
      involved in identifying various methods to reduce the risk of falls addressing the barriers
      in conventional training methods while having the potential to translate it at home. A pilot
      study identified that supplementary cognitive training along with Wii-fit balance training
      resulted in improving dual-task volitional balance control post-stroke. Based on this
      preliminary finding, this current pilot study aimed to identify:

        1. The efficacy of cognitive-motor exergaming (with Wii-fit) compared to conventional
           balance training among people with chronic stroke

        2. Exergaming (with Kinect) on domains of balance control and cognition among people with
           chronic stroke

        3. The efficacy of Exergaming (with Kinect) compared to conventional balance training
           method on domains of balance control and cognition among healthy older adults

      This pilot study used Wii-fit Nintendo/ Microsoft Kinect, an off the shelf, commercially
      available and a cost-effective device that provides similar benefits of exergaming.
      Community-dwelling people with chronic stroke and healthy older adults involved in the study
      underwent 6 weeks of exergaming or conventional balance training in a tapering manner in a
      laboratory setting. Participants were assessed for motor and cognitive performance in the
      laboratory during volitional and reactive balance control while performing a secondary
      cognitive task. The performance outcome determined the effect on cognitive-motor interference
      during dual-tasking.
