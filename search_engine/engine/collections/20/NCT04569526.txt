      specially deep intra cerebral lesions. Stereotaxy and neuronavigator played a major role in
      preoperative and intraoperative evaluation of exact location of intra cerebral lesions, the
      main drawbacks of using steriotaxy and neuronavigator that they are time consuming,
      complicated and expensive.(1) Nowadays we use MRI Tractography as preoperative imaging to
      localize lesions and there relation to neural tracts specially in eloquent brain areas, and
      also intraoperative ultrasonography Which act as a real-time, unexpansive and relatively
      simple tool for intraoperative visualization of the lesion's location, size, extent and its
      relationship with the surrounding tissue, also it can reveal the lesion's blood supply, it
      can measure the rate and direction of arterial blood flow.(2,3,4) Intraoperative ultrasonic
      imaging was first applied as a real-time navigation system in neurosurgery in 1980. (5) In
      this research we will combine the use of preoperative MRI tractography with intra operative
      ultrasonography in accurate localization of brain lesions and its relation with important
      tracts and if this combination will be beneficial and add to the safety of excision of
      lesions or not.
