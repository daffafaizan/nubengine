      may play a role in glioblastoma recurrence. Retrospective studies in humans suggest
      potentially improved survival in patients who received high doses of radiation to the
      subventricular zone when compared with patients who received lower radiation doses to this
      area. The purpose of this study is to prospectively examine progression free survival in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with adjuvant temozolomide plus a
      radiation treatment plan which intentionally prescribes radiation dose to both the tumor and
      the subventricular zone compared to patients treated with standard radiation therapy. 3
      patients out of every 4 will be treated with the modified study radiation treatment and 1
      patient out of every 4 will received a more standard radiation treatment plan.
