      state of exaggerated systemic inflammation and remains a leading direct cause of maternal
      morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Standardization of antenatal and postnatal assessment and
      surveillance of pre-eclampsia with protocols that recognize the systemic inflammatory model
      of preeclampsia have been associated with reduced maternal morbidity.2 To quantitatively
      asses electroencephalography (EEG) mental involvement in Pre-eclampsia is still time
      consuming and not always readily available. PIERS was developed and internally validate as a
      pre-eclampsia outcome prediction model- (Preeclampsia Integrated Estimate of RiSk) model.3
      The purpose of our study was to evaluate the discriminative power of the Bispectral Index
      (BIS), biomarkers sFIT (soluble FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase): PIGF (Placental Growth Factor)
      ratio,4 and adrenomedullin mortality risk stratifier,5 to classify the degree and progression
      of pre-eclampsia.

      Methods: In 24 patients with Eclampsia or pre-eclampsia investigators will use an
      artefact-free 20-min mean BIS value, as well as biomarkers sFIT (soluble FMS-like Tyrosine
      Kinase): PIGF (Placental Growth Factor) ratio and adrenomedullin mortality risk stratifier to
      classify the degree of pre-eclampsia correlated the PIERS Pre-eclampsia risk assessment PIERS
      percentage (http://piers.cfri.ca/PIERSCalculatorH.aspx) will be calculated from patients'
      clinical and laboratory findings documented in their charts, compared with 24 pregnant
      patients without Eclampsia or pre-eclampsia.
