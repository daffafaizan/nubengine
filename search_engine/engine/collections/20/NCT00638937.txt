      I. Assess the rate of disease control (i.e., lack of disease progression, a combined rate of
      objective complete and partial response, and stable disease) for at least 4 cycles of therapy
      in patients with AZD0530 (saracatinib) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      that had previously been treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (complete and partial response), stable disease
      rate, duration of response or stable disease, progression-free, median and 6 month overall
      survival rates, safety and tolerability of this treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential predictive markers by assessing pretreatment intratumoral levels of
      src, Y419 phospho-src (P-Src) and c-terminal src kinase (Csk) in archival tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and at 2 weeks after beginning treatment and
      are analyzed for c-Src protein expression and activity by immunofluorescence staining.
      P-glycoprotein levels and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, caveolin,
      and Stat-3 are also measured using tumor tissue samples. Blood samples are also used to
      measure levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 weeks.
