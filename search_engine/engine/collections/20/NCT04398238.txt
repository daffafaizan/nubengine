    
      A Patient Blood Management (PBM) program was implemented in year 2019 in our institution:
      patient scheduled for elective total hip replacement underwent pre-operative screening about
      one month before surgery, and those with pre-operative hemoglobin < 13 g/dl were screened for
      possible causes and treatment of anemia.

      Data from two different time frames, before and after the implementation of the program, were
      collected to study the change in clinical outcomes such as transfusion rates, length of stay,
      etc.
