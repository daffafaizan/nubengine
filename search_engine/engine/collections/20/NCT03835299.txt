      donation-related fears prior to their donation. Among those who report donation fear, half
      will be randomly assigned to receive a brief presentation of coping strategies administered
      via a computer tablet. The investigators will compare reaction rates and return behavior for
      the donors and high school drives where the study was conducted to the reaction and retention
      rates from similar blood drives where no data was collected. The investigators will also
      examine whether asking about the specific types of fear improves the prediction of syncopal
      or presyncopal reactions beyond the predictive value of a single fear question. Finally, the
      investigators will examine whether providing coping information to help manage the fear
      improves syncopal reaction rates and/or donor retention rates among fearful donors.
