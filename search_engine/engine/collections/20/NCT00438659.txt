      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of mometasone furoate vs placebo, in terms of decreased maximal
           severity of radiation dermatitis, in patients undergoing primary or adjuvant
           radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall for invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma
           in situ.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the incidence of severe (grade â‰¥ 3) radiation dermatitis in patients treated
           with these drugs.

        -  Compare the time to onset and duration of severe radiation dermatitis in these patients.

        -  Assess skin toxicity and quality of life of these patients.

        -  Assess the adverse event profile of mometasone furoate in these patients.

        -  Compare skin toxicity data, in terms of provider-completed and patient-reported
           assessments, of patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to radiation field (breast [post-lumpectomy] vs chest wall
      [post-mastectomy]), regional lymph nodes (treated vs not treated), and planned total
      radiation dose (including boost) (50-55 Gy vs > 55 Gy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients apply mometasone furoate cream once daily to the treatment area (breast
           or chest wall) for the duration of planned radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients apply an identical-appearing placebo cream to the treatment area as in
           arm I.

      Patients complete questionnaires and a symptom experience diary at baseline and periodically
      during study for quality of life, skin toxicity, and adverse event assessment.

      After completion of radiotherapy, patients are followed for 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 148 patients will be accrued for this study.
