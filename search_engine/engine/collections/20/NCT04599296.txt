      reshaping of the osseous sources of impingement ("osteoplasty") and treatment of
      impingement-associated labral tears with labral repair. The hip joint is subluxated with
      traction to accomplish this procedure. The diagnoses of FAIS and the incidence of hip
      arthroscopy have both increased dramatically in the last 20 years in the US -- in a recent
      study using IBM Marketscan to evaluate rates of hip arthroscopic treatment of FAIS, the
      investigators found this incidence doubled from 1.2 to 2.1 per 100,000 person-years in just a
      3-year period. Despite the increasing incidence of hip arthroscopy in the US, on a recent
      review the investigators have found few evidence-based studies on postoperative care. A
      particular area of debate is the use of postoperative hip braces. Postoperative hip braces
      are advocated to decrease postoperative pain by offloading hip musculature. They may also
      prevent overuse of the hip flexors by supporting the hip during gait. However there are no
      studies looking at efficacy of hip braces after hip arthroscopy, and on average 50% of
      high-volume hip arthroscopists use bracing. The utility of bracing is important because hip
      braces are expensive (averaging $350-$600): if there are over 7000 hip arthroscopies
      performed nationwide and 50% of surgeons use hip braces, this amounts to over $2,000,000. The
      investigator's overall objective is to use a randomized controlled trial to test the cited
      benefits of postoperative hip bracing on short term patient reported pain scores, validated
      hip-specific pain scores, and physical exam findings of hip flexor tendonitis.
