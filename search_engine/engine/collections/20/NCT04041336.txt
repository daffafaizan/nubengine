      tissues. It is often used in ophthalmology and also has application in dermatology,
      cardiology and other specialities. Usually, in adults, a table-top device is used
      necessitating the transfer of patients to the location of the device. In children a hand held
      device is used meaning the device can be taken to the patients' location. To facilitate/ help
      design a future study, this study's aim is to assess the feasibility of achieving retinal
      imaging in older people who are recovering from hip fracture surgery using a hand held
      device.
