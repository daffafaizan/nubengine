      with standard methotrexate/cyclosporine prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
      patients with hematologic disorders who have received a bone marrow transplant from a related
      donor who is mismatched for 1 HLA-A, -B, or -DR antigen in the GVHD direction.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Groups of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of
      rapamycin until the maximum tolerated dose of rapamycin given in combination with
      methotrexate/cyclosporine is determined. All patients receive cyclosporine from the day prior
      to transplant until day 50 post-transplant; the dose is then tapered over 130 days.
      Methotrexate is given on days 1, 3, and 6 post-transplant. Rapamycin is given every other
      day, days 7-59. Bone marrow transplantation occurs on day 0. Patients may not receive
      concurrent therapy with agents that could interfere with rapamycin metabolism, intravenous
      lipids, FK506 or other immunosuppressive agents (prednisone allowed), NSAIDs, or other
      cytotoxic agents. Patients are followed at 6 months for 2 years, then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 12-36 patients will be accrued over 1-2.5 years.
