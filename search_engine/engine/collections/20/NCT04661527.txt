    
      Phase II, one-arm, open label, multicentric study, to evaluate treatment of severe COVID-19
      with sarilumab prior to entry into the intensive care unit (ICU).

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the impact of sarilumab on the progression
      of COVID 19-associated respiratory failure as measured by the change in a severity rating on
      a 7-point severity index. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of safety of the drug
      and the assessment of the impact of Sarilumab on markers of systemic inflammation and the
      coagulation cascade, on mortality, and on oxygenation.

      The trial has two phases. Firstly, patients with pneumonia in the setting of COVID-19 who
      meet inclusion criteria and have no exclusion criteria will be treated with 2 doses of 200 mg
      IV of Sarilumab in 24 hours. After internal review, if no AE are detected and if there is no
      significant improvement, the next 55 patients will be treated with two doses of 400 mg IV in
      24 hours.
