      combination chemotherapy with a platinum derivative (cisplatin or carboplatin) and a taxane
      are effective in causing remission in 60 - 80 % of cases, yet recurrences are frequent and
      5-year survival is only 20%. Current therapies for second line treatment of recurrence in
      patients who have platinum refractory (who experienced progression of the disease during
      first line platinum based therapy) or platinum resistant (who experienced a recurrence of the
      disease within 6 months of completing platinum based therapy)ovarian cancer are limited.
      Capecitabine, an oral chemotherapy already used in colon and breast cancers, has shown some
      promise in early clinical trials for treating recurrent ovarian cancer.

      Patients entered into this trial will receive oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 on days 1-14 every
      21 days for up to 6 cycles, depending on response.
