    
      The present study consists of an initial cross-sectional evaluation of VD status and specific
      health biomarkers in inhabitants of Chilean Antarctica, followed by a randomized controlled
      trial evaluating two acceptable approaches of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol 600
      IU daily vs. 25000 IU weekly) in Antarctic inhabitants.
