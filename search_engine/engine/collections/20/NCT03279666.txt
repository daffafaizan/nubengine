      various causes. The first arm is used tenaculum and performed intracervical blockage. The
      second arm is not used tenaculum and performed intracervical blockage. The third arm is used
      tenaculum and not performed intracervical blockage. The fourth arm is not used tenaculum and
      not performed intracervical blockage and then we will study patients pain and biopsy size
      during colposcopic biopsy. Pain reduce and biopsy size are very important for patient and
      diagnose of the cervix cancer.
