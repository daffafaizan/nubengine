      resistance against injury. Critically ill patients are at greatest risk of developing
      stress-related gastric mucosal lesions. Although the levels of prostaglandins in gastric
      mucosa in patients with stressed animal has been studied, prostaglandin levels in the gastric
      mucosa in patients with stress ulcer have not been studied and the effect of Prevacid on
      prostaglandin levels in gastric mucosa from patients with stress ulcer is unknown.

      We hypothesize that prostaglandin levels are low in the gastric mucosa in patients with
      stress ulcer, and Prevacid is an effective agents in increasing prostaglandin levels in the
      gastric mucosa in stress stress ulcer.

      Comparison(s): The prostaglandin levels in patients who treated with Prevacid for stress
      ulcer, compared to the prostaglandin levels in patients who treated with H2 blocker for
      stress ulcer.
