      recruited . Written informed consent will be taken prior to inclusion of study. Study will be
      conducted in Medical ICU (C2 ICU) of AIIMS. Based on medical history and physical
      examination, radiology, biochemical and microbiological investigations etiology of ARDS will
      be decided.Sample will be taken at te eime of admission for estimation of inflammatory
      markers hsCRP,IL-1.IL-6,TNF ,Procalcitonin.From the available variables APACHE II, Sequential
      organ failure assessment score (SOFA), Simplified acute physiological score (SAPS)II and 3
      will be calculated to assess the severity of ARDS.All patients will be given mechanical
      ventilation using the protocol followed by the ARDS Network low-tidal volume ventilation
      strategy.The data will be registered on ICU admission and there after every 24 hr. Day 0 will
      be defined as the interval from the time of ICU admission to 8:00 am the next day .Every day
      data will be recorded at a fixed time at 9 am. It will include Tidal volume Vt
      (ml/kg),respiratory rate/min, Minute ventilation(l/min),FiO2,PaO2/FiO2,Inspiratory flow(I:E),
      Ppeak (cm of H2O),Static respiratory compliance(ml/cm of water).Plateau pressure (Pplat),
      Peak end expiratory pressure (PEEP).Patient will be monitored throughout the course of
      illness and the outcome of ARDS will be assessed.
