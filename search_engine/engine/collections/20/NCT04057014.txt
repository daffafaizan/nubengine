    
      This is a prospective partially randomized clinical trial. Patients 2-11 years old who have a
      vestibular swelling associated with an odontogenic infection are being studied. Subjects will
      self-select into the control or study group. All subjects will be offered to have the tooth
      extracted on the day of diagnosis, and if this treatment is chosen they will join the control
      group (group 1). Subjects who defer treatment will be placed on amoxicillin and will be
      placed into the study group. The study group will be randomized into two parallel study
      groups that either have average dose antibiotics for 10 days (group 2), or maximum dose
      antibiotics for 5 days (group 3).
