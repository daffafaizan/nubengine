      post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with Stratticeâ„¢ TM, otherwise referred to as DTI as
      compared to immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction where the initially
      placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of a
      reinforcement. The objective will be achieved by prospectively assessing the number of
      planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions within 12 months of the
      mastectomy.

      Two-stage breast reconstruction will include the initial placement of a tissue expander in a
      total or partial submuscular position. In the case of partial muscle coverage, this will be
      without the support of any mesh or autologous flap to reinforce the lower pole. The expander
      will be inflated over approximately the next one to six months, and then replaced with an
      implant.
