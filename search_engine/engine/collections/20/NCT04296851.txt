    
      This clinical trial is a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      niclosamide on polyps of colorectum and duodenum in FAP patients. FAP patients, satisfied an
      enrollment criteria, will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive niclosamide (650 mg)
      or placebo tablets orally once a day for 6 months. The base-line and six-month endoscopic
      examination (colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy) will be
      recorded, and photographs will be taken at the tattoo-marked area. The number and size of
      polyps, and a qualitative assessment of the total extent of polyposis will be measured. If
      there is no significant improvement in any of the 12 initial cases (niclosamide 8: placebo
      4), this trial will be discontinued.
