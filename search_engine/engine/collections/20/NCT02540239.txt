      colonoscopy were randomized into two groups. Group A patients (n = 300) used only 2 L PEG
      before colonoscopy. Patients in group B (n = 300) were additionally advised to simeticone
      plus 2 L PEG, The overall quality of colonoscopy cleaning was evaluated using the Boston
      Bowel Preparation Scale by a single endoscopist who was blinded to the intervention.
      Visibility was blindly assessed for the amount of air bubbles and adenoma detection rate
      (ADR). Difficulty of procedure, and adverse events were also evaluated.
