      pain-relieving interventions are rarely employed to manage this pain.

      There are many non-pharmacological methods that can be used to reduce immunization pain.
      These include: sugar water, fast injection without aspiration, holding infants during the
      procedure, and non-procedural related parental behaviours such as distraction. At present,
      there are no studies of tactile stimulation during noxious procedures in infants and its
      effectiveness, therefore, is unclear. Light rubbing of the skin near the injection site that
      is administered by a parent immediately before, during and immediately after immunization is
      an easily learned, cost neutral intervention that could offer improved pain management.
