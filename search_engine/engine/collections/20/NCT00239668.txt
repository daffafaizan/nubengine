      sustain massive burn injuries. The purpose of this study is to establish an expected recovery
      trajectory (recovery model) in terms of the physical and psychological function for pediatric
      burn patients by assessing prospectively the outcomes of burn children who are treated at the
      four Shriners Hospitals for Children (SHC) burns hospitals. The study hopes to develop valid
      benchmarking of outcomes between the four hospitals and therefore, best practices will be
      utilized. This recovery trajectory will be used as a benchmark for functional and
      psychosocial outcomes following burn injury.

        -  Participants in the study complete a series of self reporting questionnaires over a
           forty-eight month period. There are a total of nine time points during the forty-eight
           month commitment when questionnaires are given to parent and/or guardian and patients if
           they are 11 years or older.

        -  Patients who undergo a reconstructive surgical procedure during their enrollment will
           fill a set of questionnaires related to the effects of the surgical procedure on their
           long-term recovery. The surgical procedure is not an intervention because of the study,
           it is part of their long-term follow-up care after their acute phase. There will be a
           pre-op and a six and twelve month post-op questionnaire.

        -  The aim of this study is to develop an expected trajectory recovery model in terms of
           physical and psychological functioning. Analysis of the data using validated burn
           specific questionnaires will allow benchmarking of outcomes between the four Shriners
           Burns Hospitals. We aim to determine predictors of positive outcomes and focus on them
           as a standard of practice.
