      (PMN) that are associated with persistent inflammation in the wound bed 5-9. We propose to
      test the efficacy of an oral, nutrient intervention containing the bioactive components of
      fish oil to assuage PMN activity and promote healing of CVLU. If this systemic, nutrient
      intervention is found to alter the microenvironment of CVLU, the science of wound healing and
      care of patients with CVLU will be vastly improved.

      The purpose of this study is to test three fundamental corollaries of our organizing
      hypothesis in a 2-group, double-blind, randomized, experimental design on CVLU patients. The
      findings from the proposed experiments will increase our understanding of lipid mediators
      that influence wound healing and PMN function, and may lead to an innovative approach to
      reduce the physical and emotional burdens of nonhealing or recurrent CVLU.
