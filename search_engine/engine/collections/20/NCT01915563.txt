      the risk of mortality of intensive care patients. So, we always look for an early extubation
      when patients are recovered for the trigger disease. In spite of standardized manoeuvres to
      decided readiness for extubation these are not quite good because it has been described a
      failure extubation rate of 5% and a reintubation rate of 15%. Furthermore several risk
      factors has been associated with a major failure rate:>65 years old, congestive cardiac
      insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, APACHE II >12 the extubation day, BMI
      >30, ineffective cough, a lot of bronchial secretions (as the need for >2 endotracheal
      suctioning in the last 8h before extubation), failure of a previous SBT,alterations of high
      respiratory tract or intubation for more than 7 days.Patients without any of these factors
      risk has an extubation failure rate of 10% while if any of these are present extubation
      failure increase to 30%.

      The most used technique as a weaning trial is named spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Some
      physiological aspects suggest that breathing through an endotracheal tube could be a really
      effort trial. So our hypothesis is that a period of rest after SBT and before extubation
      could reduce the extubation failure rate.
