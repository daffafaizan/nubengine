        -  to assess symptoms of anxiety (HADS ≥ 8) and depression (HADS ≥ 8) among relatives of
           ICU patients three months after discharge

        -  to assess what relatives felt vis-à-vis the information process

        -  describe the number and duration of interviews with participants

        -  to compare variables between the groups "spouses" and "other relatives".

             -  satisfaction

             -  number and duration of interviews

             -  HADS questionnaire

             -  The scale Edmunton

             -  level of mental well-being: WEMWBS

        -  to describe the completeness of the study

        -  to test the hypothesis that the development of symptoms related to physical
           manifestations of anxiety and depression predicts the development of post-traumatic
           stress at 3 months.

        -  to assess the impact of the various forms of stress during hospitalization.
