    
      This study is a retrospective chart review of all patients over the age of 18 who are seen by
      the co-investigator during one initial, or routine follow up visit, with the diagnosis of
      chronic migraine, chronic tension type headache, new daily persistent headache, or chronic
      post traumatic headache(per International Headache Classification II guidelines6). Patients
      with the above diagnosis during their routine care are asked five standard questions about
      their headaches by the co-investigator, and the responses are recorded in the patient's
      medical record (see question sheet attached). These questions pertain to the patients' health
      care, and are asked of most patients at the Jefferson Headache center with chronic headache
      routinely during office visits.
