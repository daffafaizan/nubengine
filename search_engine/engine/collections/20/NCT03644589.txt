      every 3 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Both drugs are given by vein (Intravenous(IV)) on day
      1. Participants that are responding to the study treatment will continue to receive
      pembrolizumab alone for up to 24 months until disease gets worse, having bad side effects, no
      longer wish to be in the study, or have become pregnant (whichever comes first).

      In addition to study drug administration visits, participants will be asked to have physical
      exams, blood draws every three weeks and tumor evaluation using MRI or CT scans every 9
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for safety within at 30
      days of last dose of study treatment and then every 12 weeks until study completion.
