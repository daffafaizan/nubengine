      cornerstone of the highly-effective cervical cancer screening in the countries that initially
      implemented population-based programs in the 60s and the 70s, alternative staining techniques
      were implemented in the Soviet Union. The tradition to apply other staining techniques than
      conventional Pap test remained unchanged in the national screening program implemented in the
      2010s in Russia. As a new alternative option HPV testing showed effectiveness in screening
      women older than 30. The acceptable sensitivity and specificity of a screening test are
      crucial in population-based screening, that is why validation against "the gold standard"
      should be the first step in the process of program implementation. The objective of this
      study is to evaluate alternative techniques and tests for primary cervical cancer screening
      programs in Russia, particularly: local cytology staining techniques, local HPV tests in the
      population of 25-65 yo women without prior history of malignancy referred to colposcopy
      enriched with a population sample of women from several primary healthcare facilities
      referred to a primary screening test.
