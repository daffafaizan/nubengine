      been implicated in multiple other disease states and is currently a topic of much discussion
      in the pediatric and adult medical literature. Individuals with gastrointestinal or
      hepatobiliary diseases that limit the absorption of dietary vitamin D and those individuals
      with limited sunlight exposure or darker skin color are at risk for suboptimal vitamin D
      status. Recent joint guidelines from the North American and European Societies of Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN, respectively) have
      recommended routine surveillance and treatment for vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in
      children affected by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), namely Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Current recommendations are for prolonged daily dosing of oral
      vitamin D, but studies in children with other chronic diseases have demonstrated the benefit
      of improved compliance with less frequent, higher doses of vitamin D. The primary goal of
      this pilot study is to establish whether weekly dosing of vitamin D can correct suboptimal
      vitamin D status in children with inflammatory bowel disease. A secondary goal is to evaluate
      whether pediatric IBD patients with darker skin respond differently to vitamin D therapy than
      do their lighter-skinned counterparts.
