      distress and can be a painful procedure. Distraction has considerable efficacy among mild
      psychological methods for reducing pain perception. Virtual Reality is the most advanced
      technology of distraction, with the highest level of immersion in virtual worlds and
      effective results as a non-pharmacological measure in pain perception. However, audiovisual
      resources related to nature have not yet been investigated in this clinical setting.

      This clinical trial aims to verify the impact of the virtual reality intervention on the
      experience of pain, physical and psychological discomfort, well-being and anxiety of women
      during breast biopsy; its influence on the time of the examination; the degree of
      recommendation of the intervention; and if the connection with nature interferes in the
      results obtained on the studied variables. The Immersive Reality intervention will be
      provided during the breast biopsy and the variables will be evaluated using Likert-type
      scales and pain using the Analog Virtual Scale. Our study hypothesis is that this
      intervention reduce the perception of pain / discomfort during the biopsy by connecting with
      nature, reducing anxiety, exam time, and increasing the sense of well-being.
