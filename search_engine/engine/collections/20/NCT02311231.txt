      up of primary endpoints and stroke will also be performed by telephone contacts with the
      patients or first degree relatives by a nurse phone call after 7 days and 180 days. The
      nurses will also accumulate hospital record information on these endpoints.

      A central adjudication will be performed for all reported primary endpoints for the first 180
      days follow up. Every site will prepare source documents for the event and send it to UCR for
      central adjudication by an independent committee.
