      old. Alarmingly, approximately 25-36% of teen mothers experience postpartum depression (PPD),
      a condition associated with significant social and health morbidity. PPD places teen mothers
      and their children at great risk during an already challenging time in their lives.
      Preventing PPD in this vulnerable population is essential to improving overall health.

      Project REACH is a randomized controlled trial, to evaluate whether our novel preventive
      intervention compared to a didactic attention control reduces the risk of PPD in adolescent
      mothers. The intervention, REACH (Relax, Encourage, Appreciate, Communicate, Help), is based
      on Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) and targets those factors that may play a significant
      role in the development of PPD in adolescent mothers (i.e., poor social support, role
      transitions and life stressors). The control condition includes didactic prenatal education
      sessions.

      Project REACH builds on the foundation of our NIMH-funded treatment development project and
      pilot study (R34 MH077588). The pilot study demonstrated feasibility, acceptability and
      initial efficacy in a small sample. The current R01 proposal aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      the Project REACH intervention in reducing the risk of PPD.
