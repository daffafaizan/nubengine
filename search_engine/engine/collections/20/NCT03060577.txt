    
      ORION-3 is an open label, long term extension study with two arms: Group 1 (inclisiran only
      arm) will receive inclisiran only and Group 2 (switching arm) will receive an active
      comparator (evolocumab) followed by inclisiran.

      ORION-3 will be conducted in subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or
      ASCVD-risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C
      despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering therapies who have completed study
      MDCO-PCS-15-01 (ORION-1) [NCT02597127], to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      long-term dosing of inclisiran.
