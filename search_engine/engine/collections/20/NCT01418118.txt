      of free flap circulation remains unknown. This study examined the effects of four agents
      (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dobutamine and dopexamine) on free flaps following resection of
      head and neck cancer.

      Twenty five patients were recruited to the study. Each patient received an infusion of the
      four drugs in a random order with an intervening washout period between drugs, at four
      infusion rates. Continuous free flap skin blood flow monitoring was performed using laser
      Doppler velocimetry, with a second sensor on normal skin acting as a control. Global
      cardiovascular variables were monitored using the LiDCO Rapid pulse contour analysis system.
