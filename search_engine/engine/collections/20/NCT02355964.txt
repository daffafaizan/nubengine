      will be randomized to one of four groups: 1) control group (no intervention), 2) physical
      exercise intervention, 3) diet intervention (a diet with an overall high content of protein
      and a low glycemic index) or 4) exercise plus diet intervention.

      Asthma is defined as respiratory symptoms and at least one positive asthma test. Patients
      will continue their regular doses of anti-asthma treatment unchanged throughout the study
      period. Type of anti-inflammatory medicine will be recorded and the adherence to the therapy
      will be assessed before the intervention period and at follow-up using questionnaires
