    
      This is a pilot randomised control trial to assess the efficacy of a neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation device to improve venous blood flow and patients' symptoms in patients with
      chronic venous insufficiency. The Revitive IX device is a neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation device that gives wide pulse pattern electrical stimulation via foot pads. A
      cycle of treatment consists of a 30 minute programme of 15 varying waveforms that last a
      minute each.

      Twenty patients with venous insufficiency will be screened according the eligibility
      criteria. Patients will be randomised to either treatment or control (sham device) group.
      Patients are advised to use the device 30 minutes a day, everyday, for 6 weeks. Compliance
      will be monitored with a data logger and diary card.

      Primary outcome measure:

      a) improvement in venous haemodynamics.

      Secondary outcome measures:

        1. improvement in lower limb oedema

        2. improvement in clinical symptoms

        3. reduction in lower limb pain and discomfort

        4. improvement in quality of life measures

        5. device satisfaction.
