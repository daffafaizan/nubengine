      education for providers using existing materials from Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention's (CDC) GetSmart campaign adapted for the acute care setting led by a physician
      champion at each site (the adapted intervention), to a more intensive intervention that
      incorporates adapted GetSmart materials enhanced with individualized audit and feedback, peer
      comparisons, and behavioral nudges (the enhanced intervention). The comparative effectiveness
      of the enhanced intervention will be evaluated in a multicenter cluster randomized trial
      nested within a quasi-experimental study of acute care stewardship. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that both interventions will reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for
      antibiotic nonresponsive acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in emergency departments and
      urgent care centers, but that the enhanced one will be more effective. The investigators will
      use an interrupted time series study design to measure the impact of their interventions
      against the baseline period of usual care as well as against seasonally-adjusted historical
      controls. The cluster randomized design for the two types of acute care stewardship
      interventions will allow measurement of the difference- in-differences in antibiotic
      prescribing rates for acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, viral pharyngitis, influenza,
      and nonspecific upper respiratory infection (URI). Translation of proven behavioral
      techniques is a new and innovative approach to improving prescribing decisions. This project
      will expand stewardship to a new setting using innovative and effective approaches including
      the adaptation of behavioral techniques for emergency department (ED) and urgent care
      settings. The investigators will also further establish their research group as a network for
      developing novel tools, measuring outcomes for antimicrobial stewardship, and disseminating
      research findings through acute care setting-specific toolkits.
