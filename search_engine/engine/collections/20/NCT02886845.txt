      global rates. Chinese patients are responsible for 12.2% of all newly diagnosed breast
      cancers and 9.6% of all deaths to world breast cancers. Breast cancer is now the second
      frequently diagnosed cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-related death in Chinese
      women.

      Two of the most prevalent breast cancer susceptibility genes are BRCA1and BRCA2.
      Howeverï¼Œbecause of population based Genetic heterogeneity, the frequency of BRCA1/BRCA2
      mutation is not as high in Caucasian population as in China. Anyway, the mean age at
      diagnosis of breast cancer in China is almost 10 years younger and more cases are diagnosed
      before 40 than those in Caucasians. Therefore, it is believed that there are certain specific
      susceptibility loci in Chinese breast cancers.

      In preliminary experiments, investigators found two germline mutations may associate with
      Chinese breast cancers.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of two germline mutations by
      sanger-sequencing in a larger sample of Chinese breast cancers
