    
      Study 205013 is a Phase 1 FTIH study of GSK3145095 alone and in combination with other
      anticancer agents including pembrolizumab in subjects with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      (PDAC) and other selected tumors. The study includes up to 4 parts: Part 1 dose escalation
      will be conducted in approximately 30 adult subjects with advanced or metastatic PDAC using
      escalating doses of GSK3145095 as monotherapy only. Part 2 will combine escalating doses of
      GSK3145095 with 200 milligram (mg) pembrolizumab. Dose escalation of GSK3145095 will begin at
      least one level below the highest dose shown to have an acceptable toxicity profile in at
      least 3 subjects in Part 1. Part 2 may be conducted in a broader population of selected solid
      tumors using a combination of escalating doses of GSK3145095 and 200 mg pembrolizumab. Part 3
      will enroll subjects treated with one or more dose levels of GSK3145095 in combination with
      200 mg pembrolizumab. Part 4 will investigate the combination of additional anticancer agents
      with one or more doses of GSK3145095 identified as safe in Part 1. Up to approximately 220
      subjects will be treated in the study. Parts 1 and 2 will each treat up to approximately 30
      subjects. Parts 3 and 4 will treat up to approximately 160 subjects (up to 80 subjects in
      each Part). The total duration of the study is expected to last up to 2 years.
