    
      Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) has become an effective and reliable treatment for arthritis of
      the knee (1). TKA is associated with low morbidity and mortality, and its effectiveness in
      reducing joint pain and improving range of motion is well established. In 2014, over 750,000
      knee replacements were performed in the US (2).

      A significant innovation in TKA has been the introduction of computer navigation and
      robotic-assisted surgery (3). One such technology is the Navio™ Robotic-assisted Surgical
      System. This system is a semi-autonomous image-free system. During the surgery, the surgeon
      maps the condylar landmarks and determines alignment indices to define the volume and
      orientation of bone to be removed. The tools to remove the bone and place the implants are
      controlled and manipulated by the surgeon with the guidance of a 3-dimensional digital map of
      the surgical surface.

      Originally the Navio™ system was launched for use in unicondylar knee replacement only. To
      date, there have been over 1000 unicondylar knee replacement surgeries using the system. In
      2017, Smith & Nephew Inc. expanded the indications for the Navio™ system to include TKA. The
      purpose of this multicenter, prospective study is to evaluate outcomes associated with this
      new indication.
