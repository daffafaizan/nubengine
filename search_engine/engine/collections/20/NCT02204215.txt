      invigorate the circulation, promote tissue regeneration, relieve pain, enhance the immune
      function, etc. And electric acupuncture can stimulate bioelectricity activities at acupoints,
      out of reach for ordinary acupuncture effect, especially in the fields of nerve/muscle
      recovery and regeneration.
