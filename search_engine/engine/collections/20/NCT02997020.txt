      difference (EDSPD) assay as an endpoint for therapy of sinus disease. This assay provides a
      means to measure Cl- secretion across the sinus epithelium in human subjects with chronic
      rhinosinusitis (CRS) and test the relationship between this data and endoscopic findings of
      inflammation. The technique is appropriate for investigating acquired CFTR dysfunction in
      sinus epithelium and examining the therapeutic potential of CFTR potentiators for CRS.
