    
      Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH) is a rare genetic disorder of ectodermal dysplasia caused by
      mutation in the Porcupine Homolog (Drosophila) (PORCN) gene which results in skin, hair, limb
      and eye abnormalities. Short stature and underweight have been noted in the majority of these
      patients. Since the pituitary gland arises from ectodermal tissue, the investigators suspect
      that pituitary deficiencies may contribute to poor linear growth. This study will examine the
      nutritional, gastrointestinal and endocrine mechanisms that may account for linear growth
      stunting and low weight that is observed in FDH. The investigators will utilize standard
      clinical tools including a bone age xray, glucagon stimulation test to evaluate growth
      hormone status, baseline laboratory analysis of hormone and nutritional/gastrointestinal
      markers, food diaries, symptom diaries, and growth charts.
