    
      BioThrax® (also called Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed or AVA) is the only FDA-licensed vaccine for
      the prevention of anthrax infection. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the
      vaccine using a post-exposure vaccination schedule. Correlations will be drawn to
      immunogenicity and survival data from animal models to demonstrate that BioThrax® can elicit
      a protective immune response for PEP.
