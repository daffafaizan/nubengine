      receptor blockers and anti-acids are common drugs for treating dyspepsia in emergency
      department. However there is no study in the emergency department comparing the effectiveness
      of these drugs. So the investigators planned this study which drug is effective in these
      patients in order to provide a cost-effective treatment in dyspeptic patients.
