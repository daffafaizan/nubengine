      expected to be high in children as well, but little is still known. 24 hour urine collection
      is the golden standard to assess sodium consumption. However, this method is logistically
      difficult, especially for children. Therefore, alternatives are needed. Urinary spots have
      been used as a proxy to estimate sodium excretion over 24 hour in adults, but not in
      children. This study will assess whether urinary spots can be used to estimate sodium
      consumption in children in comparison to 24 hour urine collections.

      Caffeine consumption has risen in children over the past years, mainly before of the increase
      in consumption of soda drinks. A precise way to measure caffeine consumption is by assessing
      the concentration of caffeine and its metabolites in 24 hour urine samples. An alternative to
      24 hour urine collection is using questionnaires, however this remains difficult due to the
      multiples food sources of caffeine. This study will compare caffeine consumption estimated by
      24 hour urine collection and by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire targeting
      caffeine containing products.
