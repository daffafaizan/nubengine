    
      This is an exploratory prospective study (a study in which the patients are identified and
      then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study). The study will consist of two
      phases: a screening phase (Day 1) and an assessment phase (Day 2 to Day 7). During screening
      phase, in pediatric patients hospitalized with LRTI and from whom the informed consent form
      was obtained, diagnosis of RSV infection will be performed within 24h from the hospital
      admission, using a SOFIA POC test on nasal specimens. During the assessment phase the
      collection of nasal specimens will be done daily for a maximum of 6 days (Day 2 to Day 7 of
      hospitalization) or until patient discharge from hospital. Approximately 50 patients will be
      enrolled in this study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be
      approximately 7 days. The study duration will extend during 1-3 RSV epidemic seasons, or
      until the targeted number of 50 RSV hospitalized children have completed the study.
