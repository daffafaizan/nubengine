      cell. Bevacizumab blocks receptors that help cancer cells develop blood supplies so that the
      cancer can grow. These specific receptors are found in greater numbers in kidney cancer. In
      that regard bevacizumab will be tested in 2 doses that are higher than non-kidney cancer
      treatments with bevacizumab.

      One group of patients will receive bevacizumab at 15 mg per kg by vein every 2 weeks. A total
      of 75 patients will be treated with this dose.

      If this dose is well tolerated a second group of patients will receive bevacizumab at 15mg
      per kg by vein weekly.
