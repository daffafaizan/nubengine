      b-wave amplitude as measured by electroretinography (ERG)) in response to consuming a highly
      reinforcing food (chocolate). The investigators hypothesize that orosensory stimulation with
      chocolates with increasing sugar content will increase the beta wave (b-wave) amplitude and
      the increase in the b-wave amplitude will correlate with score changes on the Psychophysical
      Effects Questionnaire (PEQ). This will be accomplished by testing different chocolates
      (extreme dark (90% cocoa), dark (70% cocoa), milk (38% cocoa), and white (0% cocoa)) on
      different days using 1.0 cdâˆ™s/m2 flash luminance energy.
