    
      A double blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed in a split-mouth
      design. Eighty primary molars in forty subjects were randomly allocated that each subject had
      one tooth treated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and MTA (experimental group), and the other
      tooth treated with only MTA (control group).

      The study was held at King Abdulaziz University Dental Hospital (KAUDH), Jeddah. Forty
      healthy children with the age range 4- to 8-year-old were included. Each patient had at least
      two first primary molars or two second primary molars with deep occlusal or proximal caries
      not approaching the pulp indicated for IPT.

      Preoperative periapical radiographs of the teeth considered for treatment in the study were
      made using extension cone paralleling technique in the x ray machine.

      The procedure was performed in two visits by one operator to allow for the setting of MTA.
      Stainless steel crowns were used as final restorations.
