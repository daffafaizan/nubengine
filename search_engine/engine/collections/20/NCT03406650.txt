      cancer (MIUC) is unfavorable with 5-year overall survival of around 45%.

      According to international guidelines the use of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is
      considered standard of care in all patients with localized MIUC with planned curative local
      treatment.

      However, the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited and there is a clear medical need
      for improvement for this patient population.

      Durvalumab has been tested in a phase I/II open-label study including patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).

      The results demonstrated an overall response rate (RR) of 31% in 42 response-evaluable
      patients. The side effect profile was favorable with most common grade 1/2 AE representing
      fatigue (13%), diarrhea (10%) and decreased appetite (8%). Three patients (4.9%) had
      treatment related grade 3 AE's, no grade 4/5 events were noted.

      The combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy with modern immune-checkpoint
      inhibition has been demonstrated to be feasible with demonstration of favorable
      immunomodulatory effects.

      In view of these data it appears a logical step to apply these novel agents in the curative
      setting of neoadjuvant treatment.

      The expected benefit of combining chemotherapy with durvalumab and to continue durvaluamb
      postoperatively might be twofold:

        -  to increase the response rate in the pre-operative setting and subsequently to increase
           the rate of pathologic complete remission (pT0) and to reduce risk of local recurrence

        -  to evoke durable systemic anti-cancer responses and subsequently to increase disease
           free- and overall survival and furthermore to induce antitumor immune response.
