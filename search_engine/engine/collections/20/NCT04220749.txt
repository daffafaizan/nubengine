    
      This study is designed as a randomized phase II study. Patients will be randomized between
      current standard of care treatment (Arm 1) vs. TOS (Arm 2) in a 1:1 ratio. Additionally,
      patients will be stratified according to T stage (T1 vs. T2); N stage (N0/1 vs. N2/3)

      The randomized phase II design is required for three reasons:

        1. The randomization will provide an appropriate control group to serve as a comparator for
           the experimental arm. Historical or contemporaneous non-randomized controls would not be
           appropriate due to the multitude of biases that could be introduced by patient selection
           and other confounders.

        2. A small sample size will allow for adequate power to assess for progression-free
           survival, and also an assessment of quality of life, overall survival and toxicity.

        3. The results will allow for a decision as to whether a multi-institutional phase III
           trial is warranted, and inform the design of such a trial.
