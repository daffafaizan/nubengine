      population may facilitate the procedure with a single needle pass and decrease the incidence
      of adverse effects by minimizing additional needle passes. This study will compare the use of
      ultrasound-only guidance with the Clear Guide SCENERGY guidance in terms of successful
      first-attempt vessel cannulations such as internal jugular and fermoral artery access. The
      question is whether it is possible to make ultrasound-guided pediatric vascular access less
      technically challenging in order to improve adoption and utilization leading to decreased
      iatrogenic complications and improved patient safety.
