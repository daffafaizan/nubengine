      physiotherapeutic interventions referred to healthy controls.

      MS patients were examined by fMRI (primary outcomes) and clinical tests (secondary outcomes)
      at the beginning of study. Then, they were randomly divided into two groups (by drawing lots
      in a 1:1 ratio). The first group underwent Vojta reflex locomotion (VRL), and the second
      Motor Program Activating Physiotherapy (MPAT). The length and intensity of treatment was the
      same in both groups (two months, one hour twice a week). After the treatment, a clinical and
      fMRI examination was performed. Healthy volunteers underwent an fMRI examination that was
      considered to be a control.
