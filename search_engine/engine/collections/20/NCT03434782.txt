    
      The objective of this double blind, randomized and controlled clinical study, was to evaluate
      the efficacy of potassium nitrate / sodium fluoride (KNO3 / KF) gel associated with LLLT (Low
      Level Light Therapy) on teeth that were exposed to 35% hydrogen peroxide during 3 weeks of
      bleaching treatment. Methods: 50 volunteers were evaluated through the split-mouth model,
      where the hemiarcates were randomized and later allocated in one of the experimental groups:
      G1 (negative control)- group with no desensitizing treatment, only bleached; G2 (positive
      control)- group treated with LLLT + placebo gel; G3- group treated with placebo laser
      application + 5% KNO3 / 2% KF gel; and G4- group treated with LLLT + 5% KNO3 / 2% KF gel.
