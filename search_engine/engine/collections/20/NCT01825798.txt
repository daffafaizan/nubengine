      fixed dose metformin (RiometÂ®) in decreasing weight or weight gain in children ages 6-17
      years, 4 months with ASD who are currently taking atypical antipsychotic medication. A
      16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of metformin with dose guided by
      age will be conducted. A secondary study aim will be to assess the long-term safety and
      efficacy of metformin by conducting a 16-week open label continuation.
