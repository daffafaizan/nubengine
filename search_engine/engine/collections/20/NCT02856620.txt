    
      Part I: This part will be an observational exploratory analysis to collate available data
      from Treatment of preserved cardiac function heart failure with an aldosterone antagonist
      trial (TOPCAT) cohort regarding the potential role of clinical phenotype, structural
      alterations and biomarkers profiles that can help determine symptom severity in a AS and
      HFpEF, and offer insights into which patients with AS may suffer from HFpEF after aortic
      valve replacement (AVR).

      Part II: This part will be a prospective cohort study to create an AS functional capacity
      score that will include phenotypic classification, structural alterations using novel
      echocardiographic parameters such as cardiac mechanics, biomarkers profiles and frailty
      evaluation in order to more accurately predict functional capacity before (Segment A) and
      after aortic valve intervention (Segment B) and to compare with healthy control group
      (Segment C).
