      cerebral injury. Sixty-six patients undergoing elective shoulder arthroscopic surgery are
      randomized to receive either phenylephrine low dose (0.5 mcg/kg/hr), phenylephrine high dose
      (1.0 mcg/kg/min), or normal saline 5 minute before being placed in the beach chair position.

      General anesthesia is induced with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) and the
      trachea intubated. Anesthesia is maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil targeting for a
      BIS value 40-60. After hemodynamic stabilization, patients received on infusion of either
      phenylephrine high dose (1.0 mcg/kg/min), phenylephrine low dose (0.5 mcg/kg/hr) or normal
      saline 5 minute before being placed in the beach chair position. Following 15 minutes of
      infusion study drugs, measurements of mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac function
      (stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, and cardiac index) using Vigileo/Flotrac
      system were made.
