      risedronate 75 mg tablets as monthly dose forms is primarily based on the similarity of in
      vitro dissolution and an in vivo study, which showed risedronate absorption is not
      dissolution rate limited. These results suggest that monthly dosing of risedronate may be
      accomplished by administration of either one risedronate 150 mg tablet or two risedronate 75
      mg tablets. The purpose of this study is to provide additional clinical data to support the
      interchangeability of these 2 dose regimens.
