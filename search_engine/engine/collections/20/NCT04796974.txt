      45 patients). The patients will be informed about the study and ask to sign the Informed
      Consent. After having the initial radiographs and images, the preperation will be performed
      by standard procedures. As the cavity preparation is finished the measurement of the cavity
      dimensions will be performed by using a periodontal probe. After having the cavity images the
      cavity will be restored by Cention according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following
      the occlusal adjustment final image of the restoration will be taken.

      After 2 weeks the patient will be recalled in order to asses the baseline FDI criteria by two
      observers. This recall appointment will be done annually up to 3 years.
