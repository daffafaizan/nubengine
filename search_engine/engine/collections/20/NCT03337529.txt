      adult patients at Makassed general hospital dialysis center and around 150 patients at Sahel
      general hospital and Zahraa hospital will be assessed according to the international RLS
      criteria. The data on individual, clinical and laboratory indices will be obtained from
      patients' recorded files and interviews. The investigators will compare the RLS group versus
      the non RLS group according to these factors to find the independently associated factors for
      RLS in dialysis patients.

      Those who fulfill all four diagnostic criteria for RLS (confirmed independently by 2
      neurologists) will be classified as "RLS positive" and will be asked to answer 10 questions
      on the international RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. The IRLSSG rating scale was also
      used to evaluate the severity of RLS symptoms. These patients will be randomly allocated to
      two parallel groups to receive vitamin C (200 mg) or placebo for eight weeks.
