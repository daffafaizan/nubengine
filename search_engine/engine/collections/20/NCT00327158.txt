      treatment of these fractures. Pressurization of the femoral canal during reaming leads to
      extra vasations of fat emboli into the systemic circulation, resulting in deposition of fat
      droplets in the pulmonary vasculature. This phenomenon has been well documented by use of
      Transesophageal Echocardiography. A novel reaming system has recently become available that
      may limit this phenomenon. The new reamer system incorporates irrigation and aspiration
      during reaming, theoretically minimizing pressurization and fat emboli. Additionally, this
      reamer system allows for one pass reaming as compared to the current system which requires
      multiple reaming passes.

      The objective of this study is to determine effectiveness of reaming in diminishing fat
      emboli to the lungs as evidenced by decreased numbers of large fat droplets entering the
      right heart as measured by transesophageal echocardiography during the reaming process. This
      will determine if there is a benefit to aspiration during reaming as would be expected.

      During the reaming process a transesophageal echo cardiogram will be performed to analyze the
      presence or absence of emboli and the mean regarding the total time that each of the embolic
      grades is present during each of the intervals across the patient groups
