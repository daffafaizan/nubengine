      transitional state between the cognition of normal aging and dementia such AD. To date,
      therapeutic approaches to AD are symptomatic and of modest efficacy. Nontheless, recent
      studies in animal models or healthy subjects, have shown that aerobic exercise affect brain
      plasticity. The current proposal aims at exploring the brain mechanisms mediating the
      cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise in patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI),in compare to a
      control group of subjects with aMCI receiving stretching exercise. More specifically, we aim
      to perform two fMRI experiments, that will advance our knowledge about the nature of
      mechanism of the cognitive benefit resulting of aerobic exercise. Our preleminary results
      suggest that subjects with aMCI show different hierarchy of reliable responses when
      processing long time scales in auditory task. Therefore, in the first experiment, we will
      evaluate how these patterns of temporal hierarchy of language processing are affected by
      aerobic exercise. Next, we will explore whether aerobic exercise affect memory enocoding
      task, which rely on areas in the medial temporal lobe who bear a heavy neuropathological
      burden in MCI. The insights gained from the study may have important clinical implications
      for patients who are at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease
