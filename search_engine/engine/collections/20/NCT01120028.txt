      reductions in the rate of acute rejection. The commonest cause of late graft loss is chronic
      allograft nephropathy which is frequently caused by calcineurin inhibitor toxicity.
      Therefore, it may be possible to improve long-term graft outcomes by reducing the amount of
      calcineurin inhibitor exposure.

      Two possible strategies to do this were tested. Firstly, Campath-1H (a monoclonal
      lymphocyte-depleting antibody) was compared to standard basiliximab-based induction. All
      patients then received tacrolimus-based maintenance therapy for 6-months (using lower doses
      in the Campath-1H arm).

      At six months, patients were re-randomized between remaining on tacrolimus and converting to
      sirolimus (and therefore no longer taking calcineurin inhibitors). Patients were then
      followed-up in clinic and through routine NHS registries to collect information on relevant
      outcomes (including graft function, survival, hospitalisations and death).
