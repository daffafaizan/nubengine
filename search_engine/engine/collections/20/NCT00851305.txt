      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), a new diagnostic modality, has been shown to be valuable
      in increasing the diagnostic yield of colorectal neoplasias, but it is not clear whether CLE
      is helpful to find out early gastric cancer (EGC).The aim of the study is to investigate the
      value of CLE in improving the detection of EGCs.
