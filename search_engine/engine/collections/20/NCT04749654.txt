      the early loss of teeth, there are concerns regarding the impact of fixed and removable
      appliances on factors that can lead to dental caries. All space maintainer appliances are
      plaque retentive since bands and brackets increase the retention of plaque and food on tooth
      surfaces, reduce the clearance of plaque by saliva and make conventional oral hygiene for
      plaque removal more difficult, therefore, they may cause caries development.Space maintainers
      can favor caries formation by changing the oral microflora. patients aged between 4-10 years,
      each of whom had an indication for a fixed (n=19) or removable space maintainer (n=19), were
      enrolled in this research. The salivary pH, saliva flow rate, Streptococcus mutans and
      Lactobacillus counts in saliva were measured just prior to the application of space
      maintainers (baseline-T0) and in the course of the follow-up; at the 1st (T1), 3rd (T2), and
      6th (T3) months. The Wilcoxon, Mann-Whithney U test and Friedman tests were used for
      statistical analyses.
