      Although not fully proved, it is commonly accepted that the morbidity and mortality and
      proportional to the extent of intracranial bleeds (i.e. - larger hemorrhages cause more
      injury than smaller ones).

      Aspirin is a commonly used antiaggregate drug that interferes with the clotting system. The
      antiaggregate effect may be neutralized by administration of platelets. Thus, potentially,
      patients receiving Aspirin and undergoing TBI, are at a higher risk for increasing an
      intracranial bleed.

      In this prospective study, we randomize patients receiving aspirin that have a traumatic
      intracranial bleed to two groups, one - that will receive platelets, and the other that will
      not receive platelets.

      The primary end point of the study is to evaluate the effect of platelet administration of
      the enlargement of traumatic intracranial bleeds, and try and evaluate any clinical outcome
      differences between the two groups.
