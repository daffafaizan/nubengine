        -  Determine if extreme bias can be observed between 3 candidate products for user
           accuracy.

        -  Assess the offset between venous blood samples versus capillary blood samples.

        -  Determine if there are measurable donor factors which influence the product bias.

        -  Assess any offset between YSI 2300 reference instruments and hospital laboratory
           analyser and impact on bias difference between BGM product types.
