    
      The proposed study is an open label, prospective Phase I safety and feasibility study of the
      intrathecal injection of autologous culture-expanded AD-MSCs in patients with severe
      traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). All subjects will receive the same dosage of stem cells
      via intrathecal injection. Enrolled subjects will first undergo a minor surgical procedure in
      which a sample of the patient's adipose tissue will be harvested from a small incision in the
      patient's abdomen or thigh. The subject's adipose tissue will then be used to derive and
      culture-expand AD-MSCs for 4-6 weeks. Autologous AD-MSCs will be transplanted through
      intrathecal injection at the level of L4-5 under fluoroscopic guidance at a single dose of
      100 million cells. Patients will be evaluated at set intervals following the injection: day
      2, day 3, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 24, weeks 48, week 72 and week 96.
