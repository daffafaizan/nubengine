      basal insulin dose, given as once or twice daily long-acting insulin, to a continuous basal
      infusion regimen. This conversion may be based on basal insulin dose only, or total daily
      insulin dose, and may result in a flat basal insulin profile or an initial variable basal
      rate.

      Initial variable basal rates aim to replicate circadian changes in insulin requirements and
      are derived from total basal insulin in adults over 24 years old, and from weight in adults
      aged 18 to 24 years. Initial rates were developed from 63 well-controlled people with type 1
      diabetes over 14 years of age and have been assessed against a flat basal rate in a small
      randomised controlled trial with 12 participants. Mean glucose was lower in the circadian
      basal rate group with particular differences noted in the early morning when glucose rises
      were more pronounced in the flat basal rate group1.

      In 50 people with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy, HbA1c was lower in those
      with lower basal rates at midnight, and in those with higher basal rates in the afternoon,
      suggesting a benefit of circadian patterns2. In 33 people with type 1 diabetes over 16 years
      of age basal rate distribution established at commencement of pump therapy did not alter over
      6 months3. However, a 6 month cross-over study of circadian rates and oligophasic basal rates
      showed no difference in HbA1c4.

      Following initiation on insulin pump therapy basal rates are personalised to capillary blood
      and continuous interstitial fluid glucose monitoring.

      In adults with type 1 diabetes starting insulin pump therapy there are limited data to guide
      the optimal insulin profile to rapidly achieve target glucose and minimise healthcare
      professional input.
