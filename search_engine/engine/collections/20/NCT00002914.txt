      survival of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma previously treated with systemic
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the toxicity of piritrexim in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive piritrexim by mouth 3 times daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks
      followed by 1 week of rest. Patients with responding or stable disease continue treatment
      every 4 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or progression intervenes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be entered over 5-6 months if at least 1
      response is observed in the first 14 evaluable patients.
