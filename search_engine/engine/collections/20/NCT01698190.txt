      the gastrointestinal tract in close detail. Once the mass is visualized, we use endoscopic
      ultrasound to obtain a tissue sample, which the pathologist can examine in order to provide a
      diagnosis.

      The conventional method for obtaining a sample of tissue with endoscopic ultrasound is called
      fine needle aspiration (FNA). This involves the insertion of a thin needle into the mass and
      obtaining a small sample of tissue which the pathologist can examine. An alternative
      technique is called fine needle biopsy (FNB), and involves the insertion of a thin
      double-edged needle into the mass. This double-edged needle may potentially provide a larger
      sample of tissue to examine.

      Both of these techniques are commonly used, and both methods are equally safe. However, it is
      not known if one of these techniques is more effective at obtaining a sample of tissue or if
      one of these techniques is more cost-effective than the other. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if one method is more efficacious and cost-effective than the other while
      maintaining diagnostic accuracy. The results of this study may alter the way
      gastroenterologists obtain tissue samples during endoscopic ultrasound, improving the utility
      of the exam and reducing unnecessary healthcare costs.
