      ingredients in components of US Military Garrison diet can significantly change blood
      profiles of n-3 HUFAs (highly unsaturated fatty acids) from baseline with 10 weeks of a 7-day
      menu in men and women (18-40 years old), and its effect on a person's response to cognitive
      measures, satiety and physical fitness (Adjunct Studies). The Department of Defense is
      interested in strategies to improve body composition of n-3 HUFAs and whether such strategies
      help people respond better emotionally. It is felt that low omega-6 and moderate omega-3
      fatty acid diets may improve the regulation of emotional responses, and may accelerate return
      of muscle strength and lower limb range of motion after fatiguing exercise such as walking
      while carrying a heavy load. We plan to test the effects of improving overall fatty acids on
      cognitive response, satiety, and physical fitness levels by substituting all chicken meat,
      eggs, beef, oil and other ingredients in 7 days of 3 meals plus snacks with like products
      that have low omega-6 PUFA (and/or enhanced omega-3 PUFA) in comparison with a control diet
      in which the ingredients have not been replaced.
