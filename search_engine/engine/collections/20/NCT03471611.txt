      treatment and management of CED and early atherosclerosis. Coronary endothelial function will
      be assessed in all patients by the administration of intracoronary acetylcholine. Patients
      with endothelial dysfunction who meet study inclusion criteria will receive granulocyte cell
      stimulating factor (G-CSF), followed by apheresis. The mobilized peripheral cell product will
      be processed for selection of CD34+ stem cells, and the purified CD34+ cells will be
      administered intracoronary during cardiac catheterization. The patients will undergo repeat
      endothelial function assessment 6 months post-procedure, as well as clinical assessments as
      described below either via in-person assessment by a nurse or physician, or via phone-call
      using a standardized questionnaire at 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up visits. At one month, the
      patient will undergo basic laboratory testing including troponin levels, complete blood count
      (CBC), electrolyte panel, liver function testing and ECG. At 3 months, the patients will
      receive a phone follow-up by the study coordinator who will assess the patient for any
      clinical deterioration or significant worsening in symptoms. At 6 months, the patients will
      return for a clinical visit, which will include physical examination, basic laboratory
      testing and follow-up acetylcholine study with angiography to assess for change in
      endothelial function. The first three patients will be sequentially enrolled, and subsequent
      enrollment will be held until one month follow-up. Provided there are no safety concerns at
      this time, enrollment will continue.
