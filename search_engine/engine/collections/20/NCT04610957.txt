      the physiology of the reproductive tract.

      The aim of Prospective randomized clinical trial study is to evaluate effect of adding
      isoflavonoids to clomiphene citrate during ovulation induction in women with PCOS on the
      endometrial thickness which has an impact on pregnancy rate.

      This study included 160 infertile women seeking pregnancy and they were divided into two
      groups. Clomiphene is given orally at dose, one tablet twice per day (tablet 50 mg), from day
      3 to day 7 for all patients (group I and group II),while phytoestrogens are given at dose,
      two tablets two times per day (tablet 800mg), from day 3 to day 12 only for group I, followed
