      from a clinical trial (double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover), on the beneficial effects
      of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left inferior frontal gyrus
      (L_IFG) in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder
      affecting primarily language functions. The investigators' previous studies, although it
      established the augmentative effects of tDCS in PPA and shed light into its possible
      mechanisms, the investigators also revealed a fundamental gap in the investigators'
      knowledge, namely the effect of patient heterogeneity on tDCS effects; the individuals who
      improved the most had atrophy at the area of stimulation (i.e., epicenter of atrophy at the
      L_IFG). In this present Phase 1/Phase 2 study, the investigators will directly address this
      knowledge gap by stimulating another major area of atrophy in PPA, the parietal cortex, to
      optimize the tDCS effects in PPA, uncover the mechanisms, and estimate tDCS predictors.
