      with dementia through external aids to assist with remembering. The primary goal of the
      Smartwatch Reminder (SR) is to facilitate social interaction for Persons with Memory Concern
      (PWMC) by providing facial recognition of family, friends, and other key people. The SR will
      be evaluated using an embedded experimental mixed methods design that combines the collection
      and analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial design. To
      do so, researchers will enroll 100 PWMC and their care partners to participate in initial,
      3-month, and 6-month surveys. Half of the PWMCs will be randomly assigned to the intervention
      group (i.e. receive the SR) and the other half randomly assigned to the attention control
      group. Each participant will take part in the study for a total of 6 months. All study
      procedures and data analysis are anticipated to be completed within 24 months.
