        -  Determine the safety of ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine and chemotherapy, with or without tetanus
           toxoid, vs chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine whether tetanus toxoid enhances the immune response in patients treated with
           the vaccine and chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a priming dose of tetanus toxoid. Beginning 2 weeks later,
           patients receive tetanus toxoid and ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once
           weekly for 3 weeks.

      Two weeks after the third vaccine administration, patients receive tetanus toxoid and
      ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine SC on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV,
      and fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine and chemotherapy as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I. After completion of chemotherapy,
           patients with partial or complete response may receive ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine SC once
           weekly on weeks 1-3 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
