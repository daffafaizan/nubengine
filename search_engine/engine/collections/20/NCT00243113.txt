      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response of the primary tumor in patients with stage II or III
           squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx treated with docetaxel and
           radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the local relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the larynx-preservation survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the protocol completion rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the adverse effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and undergo
      radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
