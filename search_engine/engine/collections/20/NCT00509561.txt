      Primary

        -  To determine whether the addition of cetuximab to definitive chemoradiotherapy
           comprising cisplatin, capecitabine, and radiotherapy shows evidence of enhanced overall
           survival in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.

        -  To determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-84. Beginning in week 7 patients also undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks (weeks 7-11). Treatment continues in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin and capecitabine and undergo radiotherapy as in arm
           I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 in weeks 1-12. Treatment
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life and health economics are assessed at baseline, during treatment, and at
      pre-specified time points during follow-up.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, and then annually for a minimum of 5 years.
