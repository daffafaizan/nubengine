    
      In the present study, in critically ill patients with suspected infection undergoing
      application of antibiotics, CD64 and inflammatory plasma markers will be determined on days 1
      to 4.

      CD64 expression on the surface of neutrophils will be determined by fluorescence activated
      cell sorter (FACS) and with a new bedside test (LeukoDx).

      The purpose of the study is to clarify:

        1. Is CD64 expression on neutrophils associated with effective antibiotic therapy in
           critically ill adult patients at risk of sepsis?

        2. Is CD64 expression associated with distinct plasma parameters of inflammation?

        3. Do the results of the gold standard CD64 determination by FACS correlate with those of a
           new bedside test (LeukoDx)?
