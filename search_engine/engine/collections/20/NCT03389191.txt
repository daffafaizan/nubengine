      determine efficacy, and an additional 30 days for safety reports. Descriptive statistics will
      be gathered on participant demographics, uveitis characteristics, change in immunosuppressive
      medications, number of responders, ophthalmologic measures and change in corticosteroid dose
      during the study period.
