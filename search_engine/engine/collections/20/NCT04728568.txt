      of all intracranial tumors. Although most meningiomas are benign tumors and can be cured by
      surgical resection, more than 20% of WHO II (atypical) and about 3% of WHO III meningiomas
      are more likely to have local recurrence after initial treatment , And the lifetime is poor.
      The immunotherapy represented by PD-1 has achieved remarkable efficacy in the treatment of
      solid tumors, but the application of PD-1 in recurrent meningioma is rarely reported. The
      study found that the expression of PD-L1 mRNA and protein in high-grade meningioma cells
      increased, and the total number of T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, was significantly
      reduced, suggesting an inhibitory tumor immune microenvironment. Recent studies have shown
      that giving patients anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy prior to conventional treatment can
      improve the pathological response, enable the body to produce an enhanced and sustained
      anti-tumor immune response, and form a tumor microenvironment conducive to immunotherapy.
      Therefore, giving PD-1 antibody before surgery is a new idea for the treatment of
      meningiomas. This project aims to investigate whether patients with recurrent meningioma will
      change their immune function and prolong survival after preoperative PD-1 antibody treatment.
      It is planned to use flow cytometry, multiple immunofluorescence histochemistry technology, T
      cell receptor sequencing, etc to detect the changes in the patient's immune function before
      and after treatment, observe the pathological remission rate of PD-1 monoclonal antibody
      neoadjuvant treatment of recurrent meningioma, and identify potential response biomarkers,
      and conduct in-depth discussions on this treatment plan to further determine the treatment
      mode Clinical value and specific mechanism of action in order to improve the clinical
      treatment level of patients with recurrent meningioma.
