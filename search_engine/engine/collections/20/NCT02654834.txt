      oxidative stress status in two groups.

      Subjects in two groups will be matched for gender, age, smoking habit and employment duration
      and will be randomized into one of the two groups of:

        1. Pediatric OR Staff, and

        2. control (e.g; ICU staff)

      Biomarkers of oxidative stress will be measured in two different time points in each subject,
      (Monday Morning and, Friday afternoon of that same week->40 hours in Operating room or
      Intensive Care Unit).

      The relationship between oxidative stress and psychological stress will also be assessed by
      validated psychometric measures.
