      patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors who have undergone high-dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Evaluate the hematologic and
      immunologic effects of IL-12 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV as a
      single test dose followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients then receive IL-12 IV daily for 5 days
      followed by 16 days of rest for up to 6 courses. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating
      doses of IL-12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients
      are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
