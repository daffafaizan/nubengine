      strategies to increase their activity have had disappointing long-term results. The
      intervention tested in this study seeks to test an innovative intervention that targets older
      womens' perceptions of enjoyment and their personal identity and values. The investigators
      will test the efficacy of a 12-month social media-based physical activity intervention for
      sedentary older adult women. Participants will be randomized to receive a standard
      Fitbit-only intervention or to an enhanced Fitbit + weekly social challenges intervention.
      The investigators hypothesize that participants in the enhanced intervention will demonstrate
      greater increases in autonomous regulation and objectively-measured steps as compared to
      those in the standard intervention. The investigators will also measure outcomes after a 6
      month maintenance period (18 months after beginning the intervention). Additional outcomes
      will include engagement with the social network and self-reported playful experiences.
