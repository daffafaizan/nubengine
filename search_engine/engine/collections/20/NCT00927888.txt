      and headache of various etiologies and has been widely used during functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery (FESS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether preemptive SPGB
      may positively impact postoperative pain and functional outcomes after FESS.

      A prospective, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study was performed. 60 patients
      (18 to 70 yrs), undergoing general anesthesia for bilateral FESS, were randomly assigned to
      receive SPGB with either 2 ml 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 (BP, treatment
      group) or normal saline (NS, control group). SPGB was performed preemptively 10 min before
      the start of surgery. Pre- and post operative (day#0, day#7, day#30) visual analogue pain
      scale, SNOT-20, CT & Endoscopic scores were compared between the two groups.
