      over 50 % of all arthroscopies, where 25 % of these are of focal character and the majority
      are found in the medial femoral condyle. The quality of life of patients with focal cartilage
      defects is significantly affected and it has been shown that the quality of life is affected
      to the same extend as in patients scheduled for knee replacement. Arthroscopy lavage and
      debridement micro fracturing, mosaic plasticity as well as osteochondral autograft
      transplantation (OATS) are methods used for treatment of the lesions. Some have shown to help
      the patients but there is an ongoing treatment gap especially for patients with knee lesions
      and early osteoarthritis.

      Episurf Medical has developed a Focal Knee Resurfacing (FKR) implant, the EpisealerÂ® implant.
      The implant is used for treatment of focal cartilage lesions of the lateral or medial femoral
      condyle in order to alleviate pain and improve range of motion. The implant and surgical
      instruments are customized to each patient's joint anatomy, position, and size of injury,
      based on patient-specific images (MRI).

      In this study, the investigators aims to establish if this implant is a viable option for
      focal cartilage lesions of the distal femur not responding, or not eligible for, biological
      treatment options (eg. microfracturing).
