    
      EDU.RE.DRUG project is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, parallel-arm, controlled,
      pragmatic trial directed to general practitioners (GPs) and their patients from two Italian
      regions (Campania and Lombardy), with the objective of investigating the practice of
      prescribing among GPs to highlight the most frequent events of inappropriateness and to
      implement ad hoc interventions for GPs and patients.

      Appropriateness of prescribing in general practice will be assessed by evaluating selected
      prescribing, consumption and adherence indicators, using Regional administrative
      pharmaceutical prescription databases.

      Primary care physicians and their patients will be assigned to four trial arms: informative
      intervention (leaflets and posters for patients), educational intervention (feedback reports
      and online CME courses for GPs), combined interventions, or no intervention. Intervention
      effectiveness will be assessed measuring the variation in rates of inappropriate prescription
      indicators after 1-year of follow-up.

      EDU.RE.DRUG project will provide with improvements in the prescribing performance of GPs and
      in patients' adherence to treatment, with relevant clinical implications in terms of rational
      and safe use of drugs and optimized patient care, and with economic benefits (optimization of
      available resources use and savings in direct and indirect health costs).
