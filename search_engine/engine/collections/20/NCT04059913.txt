    
      Approximately 102 ESA-naïve subjects and 204 ESA-treated subjects will be enrolled and
      randomized respectively in a 1:1 ratio to receive roxadustat at one of two starting doses as
      below:

        -  Low weight-based dosing: 70 mg TIW for body weight < 60 kg or 100 mg TIW for body weight
           ≥ 60 kg

        -  Standard weight-based dosing: 100 mg TIW for body weight < 60 kg or 120 mg TIW for body
           weight ≥ 60 kg

      After 20 weeks of treatment, all eligible subjects whose last two Hb levels ≥ 10.5 g/dL AND
      change in Hb over most recent 4 weeks is > - 10 g/dL will switch to receive roxadustat for
      another 16 weeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new dosing regimens.

      At end of Week 36, all subjects will discontinue roxadustat and enter a 4-week Follow-up
      Period.
