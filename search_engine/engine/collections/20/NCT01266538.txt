      (UC), undefined IBD and pouchitis (in patients who required IPAA for their colitis) affects
      about two million people in the world. At this time there is no definitive cure and current
      treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and inflammation that accompany these diseases.
      These diseases are predominantly chronic, and patients may experience various
      gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the location, nature, and extent of their disease.
      Both genetic and environmental factors play etiological roles. The overall goal of our
      research is to understand the etiology and course of these diseases in order to prevent and
      to manage cases more effectively. In order to do so we are aiming at building a comprehensive
      database that will include detailed clinical data conjoined with dedicated research
      information and collection of biological specimens that will target the gut epithelium immune
      system, the microbiota and specific genetic risk factors.
