    
      VA106483 is intended to be used as a treatment for patients suffering from nocturia (defined
      as waking to urinate at least once per night between periods of sleep). Nocturia is a
      condition that often worsens as sufferers get older. This may be due to an over-active
      bladder muscle, the bladder being able to hold less urine at night-time or over production of
      urine in the bladder at night. Some of the treatments available for nocturia have
      side-effects which make them unsuitable for elderly patients. These side-effects have not
      been seen in studies with VA106483, which makes it potentially suitable for treating elderly
      patients.

      Nocturia is commonly associated with Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (or BPH, a non-cancerous
      enlargement of the prostate gland, which often results in problems passing water). Of the
      patients who suffer from BPH, an estimated 40-85% experience the symptoms of waking at night
      to pass water.

      Treatments which are commonly prescribed for BPH include alpha-blockers which work by
      improving urine flow by a muscle relaxant effect. Alpha-blockers are known to cause
      hypotension (lowering of blood pressure which can cause dizziness in some patients) . Since
      it is likely that subjects may be co-prescribed VA106483 and alpha-blockers, the purpose of
      this study is to determine that giving VA106483 does not increase the hypotensive effects of
      alpha-blockers
