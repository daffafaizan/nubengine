      treated with ustekinumab that show an objective secondary loss of response to ustekinumab
      after induction treatment (>Week 16). Patients can be screened during a four week period. The
      screening includes a clinical, biochemical and endoscopic assessment. Patients will be
      randomized 8 weeks after the last subcutaneous injection with ustekinumab. All patient will
      receive an intravenous re-induction with ustekinumab â‰ˆ6mg/kg at baseline (8 weeks after last
      subcutaneous administration). After the intravenous re-induction, the patients receive either
      ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous Q4W or Q8W (altered with q8w placebo to mimic Q4W injections)
      till week 48. Clinical and biochemical evaluation will be planned every 8 weeks until week36
      with a final evaluation at week48. Primary endpoint will be assessed at week 48. Final
      assessment at week 48 will include clinical, biochemical and endoscopic evaluation.
