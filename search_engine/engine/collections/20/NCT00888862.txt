      and changes in key brain areas. Studies have shown that antidepressant use may promote the
      normalization of these areas. Moreover, midlife men and women appear to be at greater risk
      for developing major depressive episodes. In women, this period of life has been associated
      with significant functional impairment due to the presence/severity of vasomotor symptoms
      (hot flashes, night sweats), cognitive complaints, and poorer quality of life. Desvenlafaxine
      succinate (DVS) has been developed for the treatment of MDD. To date, the effects of DVS on
      brain structure and functioning in midlife men and women with MDD, as well as on depression
      related to menopause, has not been explored. The present study aims to investigate the
      effects of DVS on brain structure and functioning when used for the treatment of a major
      depressive episode in midlife men and women, using MRI and functional MRI. In addition, the
      investigators will examine whether the impact of treatment with DVS on vasomotor symptoms,
      cognition, and quality of life modulate the putative changes in brain structure and
      functioning.
