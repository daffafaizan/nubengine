    
      This ia a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in three groups of
      healthy adult males or sterile females who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no
      evidence of tuberculosis infection.

      Sixty-four subjects assigned to one of eight treatment groups to receive one of four
      different antigen/adjuvant combinations of study vaccine, or placebo control. Within each
      study group, subjects will be randomized to receive either a single-dose antigen/adjuvant
      regimen of study vaccine (vaccination with study vaccine on Study Day 0 followed by
      vaccination with placebo control on Study Day 56) or a two-dose antigen/adjuvant regimen of
      study vaccine (vaccination with study vaccine on Study Days 0 and 56).

      All subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days.

      The sample sizes specified for each study group were selected because they are judged to be
      adequate for preliminary safety and immunogenicity evaluations for a Phase I study rather
      than for statistical reasons. If no SAE are observed among 56 subjects receiving active study
      vaccine, an approximation to the upper 95% confidence bound on the rate of SAE occurrence
      would be 5.4%.
