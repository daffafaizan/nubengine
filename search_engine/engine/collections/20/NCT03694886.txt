      perception of drug efficacy; that is, how well a drug is likely to work. The goal of this
      study is to assess the effects tablet size may have on participant's performance on cognitive
      testing since research has found differences between preparation methods. Method: 120
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) 90 mg caffeine with a 1 mm
      diameter sucrose pillule; 2) no caffeine with the small sucrose pillule; 3) 90 mg caffeine
      with a 5 mm sucrose pillule; 4) no caffeine with the large sucrose pillule. Participants will
      consume the designated placebo tablet with water (caffeinated or non-caffeinated); then,
      participants will provide weekly caffeine intake and complete the neutral portion of Velten's
      Mood Induction Procedure until 30 minutes have passed to allow for caffeine activation.
      Participants will complete the Stroop test, Trial Making Tests A and B, and the Rey Auditory
      Verbal Learning Test. Previous literature, as far as the author knows, relied on evaluating
      drug efficacy based on appearance alone. This study aims to assess if tablet size, due to
      placebo effect, alters participants' performance on cognitive tests after consuming caffeine.
