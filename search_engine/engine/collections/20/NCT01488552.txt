      the tumor compartment and the stromal compartment of pancreatic cancer and induces complete
      responses in a small percentage of patients with advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer.

      The gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel regimen had outstanding activity in a 67 patient phase I/II
      trial with all patients at the recommended phase II doses (n=44) having a decrease in CA19-9,
      some complete responses and a median survival of 12.2 months. The proposed regimen that is
      devised for this study is a bold, innovative approach with the specific aim of utilizing a
      relentless pursuit approach to try to make the complete response rate >70% and have this
      response be durable (which the PCRT has defined as lasting at least 6 months) and to
      dramatically enhance the percent of patients who survive one year (try to make the rate
      >70%).

      The induction regimen the investigators propose collapses the stroma (gemcitabine +
      nab-paclitaxel) and addresses the use of a non-cross resistant active regimen (FOLFIRINOX) as
      a consolidation regimen. Both should improve the chance of driving tumor markers down
      dramatically. The investigators think that FOLFIRINOX with the stromal collapse induced by
      the initial regimen, plus the totally non-cross resistant shot against the disease
      (consolidation), will maximize the chance of achieving a complete response with an attendant
      improvement in survival.

      After the consolidation, the patient will be maintained on a less toxic targeted therapy
      selected by molecular profiling plus the use of the antimetabolomic agent metformin which has
      consistently been associated with better survival in multiple retrospective studies
      (Jiralerspong et al., 2009).
