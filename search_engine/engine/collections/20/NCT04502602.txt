      and niraparib when given in combination to patients with advanced solid tumors. The RP2D will
      be identified during the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study using a modified 3+3
      design and evaluated in a phase 1b dose expansion cohort of up to 12 patients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
