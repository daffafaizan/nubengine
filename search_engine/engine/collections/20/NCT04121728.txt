      extracts versus placebo on event related potential ERP registration measurements in
      Electroencephalography (EEG) during neuropsychological tasks. The Hold-Release (HR)
      neuropsychological test allows the study of behavioral and neurofunctional correlates using
      several different techniques for online recording of brain activity. This test measures the
      engagement of focused attention and the loading of information into working memory, as
      opposed to the disengagement of attention.

      The study will be carried out in a randomized cross-over design, with "Ginkgo" vs. Placebo",
      or inversely, for 170 days each (approximately 6 months), separated by an 8-weeks wash-out
      period. A follow-up visit will be held 3 months after the last treatment of the study.

      The cross-over design uses each patient as its own control, which allows an easy comparison
      between the 2 groups "Placebo" vs. "Ginkgo" by limiting inter-patient variations. In
      addition, by doubling the number of patients per treatment compared to a classic study design
      in 2 groups, cross-over reduces the number of patients to be recruited, which facilitates
      recruitment on a single site.

      The study requires the recruitment of thirty-two (32) informative participants with cognitive
      complaints.
