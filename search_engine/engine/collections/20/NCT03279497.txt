      activity self-efficacy and physical activity behavior among early 10 to 13 years old
      adolescents. Participants allocated to the Health game intervention group will use a game
      called Movenator, during a four week intervention and participants allocated to the Sport and
      fitness-intervention group will use a commercially available Sport and fitness application
      for running, cycling and every-day training, during a four week intervention period.
