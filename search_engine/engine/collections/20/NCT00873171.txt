      symptoms of frequency, urgency, and pain.In addition to Osteopathic manipulation Other
      conservative treatments frequently include dietary modification, pharmaceuticals, bladder
      training, neuromodulation, and stress reduction. The goal of Osteopathic manipulation is to
      relax the pelvic muscles used by the bladder and improve the flow of blood and lymph fluid to
      this region, which may result in easing pain and discomfort associated with cystitis.Some
      physicians have found that Osteopathic Manipulation works for some people as an alternative
      to surgery. A secondary objective will be to determine if the increased attention and power
      of touch are as effective as OMT in treating patients with interstitial cystitis based on the
      results of using attention control treatment in some patients.Thus, this is a pilot study
      comparing OMT to an attention control arm and standard of care arm of treatment.We will
      review palpatory visceromatic reflex changes as documented by tissue texture changes,
      asymmetry, restriction of motion and tenderness pre and post treatment.Physical examination
      including detailed musculoskeletal examination of the lumbosacral region will be performed
      pre and post and then compared the results.
