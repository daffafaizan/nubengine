    
      Phase I Design A standard, 3+3, dose escalation schedule to determine the MTD of temsirolimus
      in combination with neratinib with no intrapatient dose escalation and a starting dose of
      temsirolimus 8 mg administered intravenously (IV) weekly (dose level 1) and three patients
      enrolled in each cohort.

      Phase II Design The phase II portion of this trial is comprised of three cohorts. Two of the
      cohorts utilized a Simon two-stage design to determine the sample size to assess the efficacy
      of temsirolimus when administered in combination with neratinib: HER2-amplified and triple
      negative breast cancer. The third cohort was a single stage design with HER2-amplified
      patients and dose escalation.
