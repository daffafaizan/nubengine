      orthodontics. For adults, the ideal treatment option for Class III malocclusion is
      accomplished either by camouflage treatment in mild to moderate cases or orthognathic surgery
      in severe cases. Camouflage treatment for Class III malocclusion comprises three main
      techniques; Class III elastics, mandibular first molar distalization, or extraction of
      mandibular first premolars. Mandibular first molar distalization via the use of skeletal
      anchorage has the problem of increased failure rate of the inter-radicular temporary
      anchorage devices (TADs). Accordingly, a randomized clinical trial using extra radicular TADs
      in the Mandibular buccal shelf area was designed in the current research aiming to test the
      efficacy of such a technique in inducing mandibular molar distalization with decreased
      failure rate, and whether the presence of unerupted mandibular third molars will affect the
      distalization movement or not.
