      into three arms following a 1:1:1 ratio. During the intraoperative course one of three
      combinations of wound infiltration will be administered to subjects prior to the closure of
      the surgical incision. Subjects in Group I will receive a placebo of normal saline. Subjects
      in Group II will receive bupivacaine alone. Subjects in Group III will receive both
      bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine.
