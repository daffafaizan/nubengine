    
      Scleroderma is a chronic skin-hardening disease. There are two types of scleroderma. The
      first type is called limited cutaneous scleroderma, where disrupted blood flow causes skin
      discoloration and sometimes patients experience high blood pressure in their arteries. The
      second type is called diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and it is much more aggressive, affecting
      a larger area of skin causing organ damage. This study will determine if the disease is
      associated with an elevated expression of LOXL2 levels in tissue samples from patients.
