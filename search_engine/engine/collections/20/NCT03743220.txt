      based on immunological recognition (cross-hypersensitivity reactions [CRs]) .They are almost
      mandatory in a human life and therefore, the drug allergy work-up goes up until a DPT in
      order to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Although the overall prevalence of NSAID
      hypersensitivity has been reported between 0.6 and 7% of the general population .

      The NSAIDs-induced hypersensitivity reactions involve different mechanisms and present a wide
      range of clinical manifestations from anaphylaxis or severe bronchospasm developing within
      minutes after drug ingestion to non-immediate responses appearing after days and weeks This
      data-driven approach in designing the DPT protocol is the second step in improving DPT
      standardization, after BL antibiotics.
