      of this study has been made into lozenges and named RCP006. Anatabine, the only active
      ingredient of RCP006, occurs throughout the world in the human food chain. Anatabine has been
      in the human food supply and in human use for centuries. Humans are exposed to anatabine in
      tobacco products and common and widely consumed food crops such as potatoes, peppers,
      eggplants and tomatoes. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of this
      dietary supplement on normal human inflammatory function. Compounds that are chemically
      similar to anatabine have been shown to reduce inflammatory responses, and laboratory studies
      show anti-inflammatory properties for anatabine. The investigators want to explore this
      further in human studies to see if anatabine can maintain normal levels of inflammatory
      function. The investigators will see this effect more easily if the investigators look at the
      effects of anatabine in volunteers who have markers of higher levels of inflammation to begin
      with. The investigators anticipate that anatabine will reduce markers of inflammation. To
      look for inflammation the investigators will test blood levels of a protein called C-reactive
      protein. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein found in the blood, the levels of which rise
      in response to inflammation. Therefore the investigators are looking for volunteers with high
      blood levels of CRP and will monitor the blood CRP levels at several timepoints throughout
      the study. The investigators will also collect blood samples to measure other indicators of
      inflammation, and to measure blood levels of anatabine.
