      tolerated as replacement therapy for hypogammaglobulinemia in patients that have undergone
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Secondary objective is to perform a
      financial analysis comparing the cost of ScIG with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The
      study hypothesis is that home based SCIG treatment is applicable and tolerated well for
      replacement treatment in alloHCT patients. This will be examined in two sets of patients
      recruited: A) Patients already on IVIG replacement therapy and B) Newly diagnosed patients
      with hypogammaglobulinemia. Economic analysis will be performed by comparing the cost with an
      equal number of patients retrospectively determined to have undergone treatment with IVIG.
