      low work thresholds, breathlessness, and other debilitating conditions. These patients have
      often been through several "re-do" coronary bypass procedures and multiple percutaneous
      coronary interventions.

      Surgical and interventional options for these patients typically have been exhausted or will
      result in only partial revascularization. Therefore, therapy remains limited to the use of
      multiple anti-anginal medications, reduced activity, exertion, and stress level, and
      significant alteration and limitation of lifestyle.

      The goal of this emerging approach is to therapeutically induce the growth and development of
      new vasculature in zones of severe ischemia in the myocardium, with the hope that new
      capillaries and arterioles generated will connect to remnant existing vasculature. These
      neovessels are viewed to act as collaterals, perfusing ischemic territories unapproachable by
      macro procedures such as PCI and/or CABG.
