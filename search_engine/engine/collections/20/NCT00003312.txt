      radioactive implantation of the prostate in patients with confined adenocarcinoma of the
      prostate. II. Assess the overall survival, disease specific survival, clinical relapse (local
      or distant), PSA levels, and genitourinary and gastrointestinal morbidity in these implant
      patients. III. Assess the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive transrectal ultrasound guided
      radioactive I-125 seeds implanted into the prostate. At least one week prior to implant,
      patients undergo transurethral ultrasound study to determine the volume of prostate.
      Following implantation, seeds that have extruded into the bladder or lodged in the urethral
      wall are retrieved, and extra seeds may be implanted into identified "cold spots" for uniform
      seed distribution. Prostate rebiopsy is required before starting hormonal therapy for local
      progression or biochemical failure without clear focus of progression. Quality of life is
      assessed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3
      years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 95 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
