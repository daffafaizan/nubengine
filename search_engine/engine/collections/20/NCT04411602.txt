      individuals (â‰¥14 days post-resolution). Dosing of single or double plasma units (weight based
      < and > 90Kg) will be administered on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (based on plasma availability),
      or until futility (if either occurs before day 8) is determined by the ICU. Doses can be
      omitted at the discretion of the treating clinician (e.g., TRALI events are 100%
      donor-dependent and do not prohibit future transfusions).

      The study drug is the investigational product, anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma obtained
      from the American Red Cross or local plasma supply (medicDal center or city/region-wide
      shared blood bank) from patients identified as having recovered from COVID-19. Donors and
      samples will be screened for infections transmitted via transfusion (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, WNV,
      HTLV-I/II, T.cruzi, ZIKV) both through the use of the uniform donor questionnaire and FDA
      mandated blood donor screening tests. Plasma will be collected using apheresis technology or
      whole blood collection in accordance with standard FDA and blood bank protocols.
