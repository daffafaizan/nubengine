      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of prospective screening for ovarian cancer in high-risk
           patients.

        -  Determine normal ranges and distributions of CA 125 within and between these patients
           (with subclassification by menopausal status, estrogen replacement therapy usage, and
           prophylactic oophorectomy).

      Secondary

        -  Determine estimates of the specificity and positive predictive value of a risk of cancer
           algorithm suitable for designing a definitive trial of screening for ovarian cancer in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients undergo blood collection and CA 125 levels are measured at baseline and then every 3
      months for 1-2 years. Patients may be referred for an ovarian ultrasound if indicated by the
      CA 125 results.

      Patients are followed at 6 months and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,400 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
