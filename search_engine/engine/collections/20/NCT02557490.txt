      million deaths each year worldwide. The development of metastases is the main cause of death.
      Liver metastases are diagnosed in 10-25% of patients at the time of resection of their
      primary colorectal tumor and, eventually, up to 70% of patients with colorectal cancer
      develop liver metastases.Oxaliplatin and raltitrexed were used for the treatment of
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases. We aimed to perform a randomized controlled trial to
      compare the effect of oxaliplatin and raltitrexed treatment of colorectal cancer with liver
      metastases by TACE hepatic artery infusion.
