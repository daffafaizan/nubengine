      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV CBZ relative to orally administered CBZ in adult
      subjects with epilepsy. The study design used an increasing dose/treatment escalation cohort
      paradigm wherein subjects were enrolled in a cohort based on their total daily dose (TDD) of
      oral CBZ and their calculated creatinine clearance (CLcr; calculated by the Cockroft-Gault
      equation) on Day -28. The purpose of the increasing dose/treatment escalation cohort design
      was to provide a means for the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to assess safety
      prior to enrolling in subsequent cohorts; data were summarized by infusion time, renal
      function and dose. The initial subjects enrolled had normal renal function (CLcr >= 80
      mL/min) and were stable on oral dosing of CBZ from 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day. Subsequent
      Dosing Cohorts enrolled subjects on higher doses of oral CBZ and allowed subjects with some
      renal impairment to be enrolled.
