      pioglitazone affect:

        -  Beta-cell function as measured by proinsulin/insulin, homeostasis model assessment for
           insulin secretion (HOMA Î²-cell) and glucagon stimulated C-peptide test

        -  Insulin sensitivity as measured by adiponectin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin
           resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin tolerance test and

        -  Surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease as measured by BNP, NT-pro BNP and plasma
           lipid profile as add-on therapy in patients with T2D and secondary drug failure. The
           patients' satisfaction with each treatment was also surveyed.
