      outpatient basis. The following examination will be carried out in each subject after 12 hrs
      fasting:

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (75 g of glucose) (in healthy subjects to confirm the normal
           tolerance of glucose).

        -  Evaluation of insulin secretion after 1 mg of glucagon i.v.

        -  Hyperinsulinaemic (75 milly-international unit(mIU)/l) euglycemic clamp study lasting 4
           hours combined with indirect calorimetry and biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

        -  Hyperinsulinemic (75 mIU/l) euglycemic clamp study lasting 4 hours combined with
           indirect calorimetry after losartan 100 mg given in the evening and in the morning
           before the study.

        -  Proton and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

      Before (0 min), at 30 min and in the end of studies c) and d) the blood samples will be taken
      and biopsies of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be done.
