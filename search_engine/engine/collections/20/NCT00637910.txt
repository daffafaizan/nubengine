      with a small benefit on Overall Survival. Recent evidence suggest that patients with EGFR
      mutations have a clear benefit when they are treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
      while the role of these drugs in wild-type EGFR patients, that are representing the large
      majority (about 85-90%), is still unclear and no properly planned trials assessed before this
      issue. Recently, indirect evidence on subgroup analyses on randomized trial suggest that
      chemotherapy might be superior to erlotinib in wild-type EGFR patients.

      Moreover, several authors do not recommend the use of EGFR determined with
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) or FISH because they do not reproducibly predict outcome.

      For these reasons the protocol was amended in May 2011 in a superiority trial of docetaxel
      versus erlotinib, while the first version was aimed to assess the interaction with
      biomarkers.
