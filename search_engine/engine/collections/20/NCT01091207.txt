    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase II study recruiting patients with
      advanced GIST who are pretreated with both imatinib and sunitinib. The current study will
      provide an estimate of the activity and safety of sorafenib in GIST. The primary study
      endpoint is the disease control rate (DCR), defined as complete or partial response or stable
      disease of at least 24 weeks of sorafenib therapy. Secondary endpoints include PFS, OS and
      safety.

      Patients with advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) GIST who failed after previous
      therapy involving both imatinib and sunitinib will be eligible. Failure to imatinib and
      sunitinib is defined as disease progression regardless of intervening response during
      therapy, or intolerance. There is no limit to the number of prior therapies a patient may
      have received (e.g., patients may have received therapy with nilotinib, other TKIs, or
      chemotherapy in addition to imatinib or sunitinib).
