    
      This is an expanded access open-label, single-arm, multi-site protocol to provide
      convalescent plasma as a treatment for patients diagnosed with and hospitalized for COVID-19
      with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. Efficacy of this treatment will not be
      evaluated. A single site will initially be established. When additional patients needing
      therapy are identified at other health care facilities, Force Health Protection (FHP) will
      send a protocol package, and a site will be established and approved by the Headquarters
      USAMRDC Institutional Review Board (HQ IRB).
