      abnormal metabolism in a majority of tumor sites in patients with progressive disease and
      that changes in FDG accumulation parallel changes in PSA after treatment. This suggests that
      changes in FDG metabolism may provide an early assessment of treatment outcomes. In previous
      work we established a methodology to examine a radiotracer in patients with progressive
      disease and abnormal imaging studies, which we have applied to the clinical states of
      non-castrate and castrate metastatic disease. This design is characterized by:

      1) Evaluation of uptake on a site-by-site basis in relation to conventional studies 2)
      Standardization of uptake values in tumor relative to a normal organ 3) Controlling for
      progression using standard measures of progression including a rising PSA, new or enlarging
      lesions on bone or transaxial imaging, and new symptoms of disease. In the present study we
      are evaluating fluorinated dihydrotestosterone (FDHT) in addition to FDG. FDHT is targeted to
      the AR and has been shown in preliminary studies to visualize prostate cancers in man. This
      study will apply our established methods to investigate FDHT imaging in patients with
      progressive prostate cancer. In the selected cases where tumor is available, we will study
      associations between FDHT accumulation and AR expression.
