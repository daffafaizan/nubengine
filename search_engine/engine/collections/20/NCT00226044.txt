      (GERD) in infants. Infants, aged 0-12 months, require a non-standard dose of omeprazole. Due
      to this fact extemporaneous formulations of omeprazole are administered to these infants. The
      oral bioavailability of omeprazole in nonproprietary formulations may be unpredictable and
      produce variable degrees of drug exposure. The dose range for GERD management in pediatric
      studies using omeprazole is 0.3 - 3.5 mg/kg/day.

      Dosing information, aged-specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data are not available
      in infants, aged 0-12 months. Two adult studies at healthy volunteers suggest that an
      omeprazole suppository is an effective dosage form.This study is designed to evaluate and to
      compare the efficacy, the pharmacodynamics and the pharmacokinetics of oral and rectal
      omeprazole treatment in infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
