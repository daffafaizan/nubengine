    
      A random sample of 18-69 year-olds living in 10 municipalities in the Capital Region of
      Denmark is invited to a health examination including measurements of anthropometry,
      lifestyles, symptoms and diagnoses of diseases, blood pressure, resting heart rate, muscle
      strength, fitness, lung function, allergy tests, and biochemistry (lipids, liver and kidney
      function, vitamin D status, salt excretion, iodine status). Trends in these parameters over
      time will be assessed.
