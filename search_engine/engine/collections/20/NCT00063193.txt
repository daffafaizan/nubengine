      the coming decades as the population ages. While available medical therapies are usually
      effective for controlling symptoms in the initial years following diagnosis, higher doses of
      multiple agents are required over time, with increasing side effects and incomplete control
      of symptoms. Although these treatments can dramatically improve the lives of patients with PD
      initially, they do not address the underlying causes of the disease or the inevitable disease
      progression.

      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial will involve 42 trial centers in the United
      States and Canada, and enroll 195 people with PD. The primary objective of this
      neuroprotection trial is to identify agents capable of slowing the progression of PD. In the
      trial, investigators will assess the impact of minocycline and creatine on the progression of
      PD and determine if it is futile or non-futile to proceed with further study of these agents.

      In this study, subjects with early, untreated PD will be equally randomized into one of the
      three study arms: 1.) the group that receives active minocycline and placebo instead of
      creatine, 2.) the group that receives active creatine and placebo instead of minocycline, or
      3.) the group that receives placebo instead of minocycline and creatine. Subjects will remain
      on the blinded study drug for 18 months.
