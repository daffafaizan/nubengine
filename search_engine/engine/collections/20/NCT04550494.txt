      I. Determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of talazoparib in tumor biopsies for patients
      with aberrations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes who have or have not
      received prior PARP inhibitor treatment (separately).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of treatment
      with talazoparib in patients with aberrations in DNA damage response genes.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Investigate tumor genomic alterations potentially associated with sensitivity or acquired
      resistance to talazoparib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo biopsy
      at baseline and 4 hours after talazoparib dose on day 1 of cycle 2, and an optional biopsy
      either at the restaging follow up or at the time of disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
