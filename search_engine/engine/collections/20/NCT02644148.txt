      Roux-en-Y. However, the complications after Roux-en-Y reach an incidence of over 30% which
      involve nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. The underlying mechanism might be the
      result of interruption of intestine peristalsis. In 2013, Kim reported total laparoscopic
      uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis could reduce Roux stasis syndrome incidence by keeping the
      continuity of jejunum. In September 2014, we carried out this operation in 30 cases in our
      centre. Our previous results showed that this operation had a low postoperative complication
      and short hospitalization time, indicating uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis might be a safe
      procedure. However, some limitations are noticed. The report from South Korea is a
      retrospective study and the evaluation of QOL is certain subjective. Here, we aimed to
      perform the first randomized controlled clinical study on uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis to
      improve QOL of patients after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. The primary aim is to
      determine whether uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis improve the quality of life of patients after
      laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.
