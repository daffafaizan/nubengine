      previously treated advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate cancer. There will be
      a 7-day run-in period with ipatasertib alone prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. After the completion of
      the ipatasertib run-in period, participants will begin Cycle 1, Day 1 of the ipatasertib and
      rucaparib combination treatment. Each cycle has 28 days. Participants will be split into 4
      cohorts: Dose Level 1 group - 300 mg ipatasertib once daily (QD) + 400 mg rucaparib twice
      daily (BID), Dose Level 2a: 300 mg ipatasertib QD + 600 mg rucaparib BID, Dose Level 2b: 400
      mg ipatasertib QD + 400 mg rucaparib BID, Dose Level 3: 400 mg ipatasertib QD + 600 mg
      rucaparib BID

      A Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2) - The recommended dose identified in Part 1 (highest dose
      level of ipatasertib and rucaparib with an acceptable safety profile and less than one-third
      of participants experience a dose limiting toxicity) will be evaluated in participants with
      advanced prostate cancer who have had at least one line of prior therapy with
      second-generation androgen-receptor (AR)-targeted agents (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide,
      apalutamide).
