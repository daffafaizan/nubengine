      of chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, particularly if transfused before HCV
      serological testing became available. The investigators enrolled 300 patients into the study.
      The patients received PEGASYS (Peginterferon alpha-2a(40 KD)) 180 microgram per week plus
      COPEGUS (Ribavirin) 1000 milligram for weight less than or equal 75 kg and 1200 milligram for
      more than 75 kg for 48 weeks. Follow up period is 6 months after treatment. The patients are
      visited every 4 weeks with biochemistry lab tests. The patients are checked with quantitative
      HCV RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) on the third months after initiation of the treatment to assess
      early virologic response and at the end of the study for complete response rate and on the
      six month after treatment completion for sustained response rate. The patients with
      undetectable HCV RNA are considered as responders.
