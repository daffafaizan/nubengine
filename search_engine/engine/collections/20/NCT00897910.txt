      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of expanding myeloma-specific T cells using autologous ex
           vivo expanded B cells loaded with myeloma antigens as antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs)
           in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  To examine the feasibility of selecting and expanding myeloma-specific T cells ex vivo
           using interferon γ release and CD3/CD28 stimulation.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory
      studies. Samples are analyzed to assess the feasibility of expanding autologous B cells ex
      vivo using CD40L and IL-4; the antigen-presenting phenotype of autologous B-cell
      antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) using flow cytometry; and the antigen-presenting function
      of B-APCs using ELISPOT and chromium-release assay. Myeloma-specific interferon γ secreting T
      cells are isolated and selected using Miltenyi beads. The selected myeloma-specific T cells
      are expanded ex vivo using anti CD3/CD28 beads.
