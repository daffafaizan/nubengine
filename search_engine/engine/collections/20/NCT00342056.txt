      (ABC) transporter that has been shown to confer resistance to several drugs, including
      mitoxantrone and topotecan. Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) has recently been identified as a
      substrate for ABCG2. The expression of ABCG2 in the human jejunum has been shown to be higher
      than expression MDR1, which encodes for P-glycoprotein. Therefore, it is plausible that the
      oral bioavailability of Gleevec could be dependent on the extent of transport. A single
      nucleotide polymorphism (C421A) has been identified in ABCG2 and has been shown in vitro to
      result in functional inactivation of this transporter protein. In this study, the
      relationship between the genotypes of ABCG2 and the pharmacokinetics or side effects will be
      retrospectively explored in patients with cancer who had been previously enrolled on clinical
      trials of Gleevec.
