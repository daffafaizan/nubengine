      advertisements. Following their baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups:

        1. 10-week standard treatment of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT);or

        2. 10-week titrated transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) treatment with
           additional NRT product (NRT+)

      Participants assigned to the "NRT" standard treatment group will follow a 10-week regimen of
      nicotine patches alone.

      Participants assigned to the "NRT+" titrated treatment group will follow a 10-week regimen of
      tailored patch dosage. Participants will also be provided with the Nicorette inhaler.

      All participants will receive five 15-minute counselling sessions from a smoking cessation
      counsellor. These sessions occur at 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 weeks post target quit date.
      Counselling sessions will focus on practical counselling (problem solving and skills
      training) and social support.

      During the treatment phase, participants will complete questionnaires measuring withdrawal
      symptoms, self-efficacy, use of cessation resources and the Beck Depression Inventory
      (BDI-II) at weeks 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10. These questionnaires will also be completed at 26 and 52
      weeks post target quit date.
