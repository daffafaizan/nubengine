        1. Determine if NGAL (POC plasma and confirmatory urine) concentrations can predict which
           critically ill children will ultimately develop significant (>10%) positive ICU fluid
           accumulation Hypothesis to be tested: Elevated plasma NGAL concentrations (initial
           plasma threshold > 250 ng/ml) will predict which critically ill children will develop a
           positive ICU net fluid accumulation of > 10% of ICU admission weight

        2. Determine if NGAL (POC plasma and confirmatory urine) concentrations can predict which
           critically ill children who develop >10-20% ICU fluid overload will recover urine output
           and kidney function rapidly Hypothesis to be tested: Elevated plasma NGAL concentrations
           (initial urinary threshold >1 ng/mg Cr ) will predict which critically ill children who
           develop >10-20% FO will not have an improvement in AKI as determined by an improvement
           of at least one pRIFLE strata within 24-48 hours of developing pRIFLE-I or pRIFLE-F

        3. Determine if NGAL (POC plasma and confirmatory urine) concentrations can predict kidney
           function recovery in critically ill children develop >10-20% ICU fluid overload who
           receive continuous renal replacement therapy Hypothesis to be tested: Decreasing NGAL
           concentrations will be associated with improvement in urine output and initial
           resolution of AKI in < 72 hours

      This pilot study will be novel in that the investigators will evaluate NGAL levels in near
      real-time, twice daily to guide clinical decision support in terms of fluid administration
      effect assessment and CRRT provision in this critically ill pediatric population.
      Specifically, the investigators will use the NGAL data daily to 1) drive initiation of CRRT
      in children with elevated NGAL and > 10-20% fluid overload and 2) drive CRRT discontinuation
      in patients with decreasing NGAL concentrations. In addition, the investigators will employ
      an adaptive study design to readjust the threshold NGAL during the time course of the study
      if the data suggest adjustment will enrich the data pool.
