      subungual onychomycosis including subjects with evidence of subungual dermatophytoma or
      yellow spikes, lateral and proximal onychomycosis and severely dystrophic nail plates.
      Subjects with only superficial white onychomycosis were excluded. Confirmation of the
      clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis of at least one great toenail included a positive KOH wet
      mount.
