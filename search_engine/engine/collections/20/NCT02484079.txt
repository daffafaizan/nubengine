      and cold snare polypectomy. There has not been performed any big studies on this subject
      earlier, but current knowledge indicates that hot polypectomy (i.e. with use of electrical
      current) is somewhat better with regard to complete resection of polyps compared to cold
      polypectomy (without electrical current).

      In this project the patients will be randomized to either hot or cold polypectomy. The
      investigators will distribute videos of how the polypectomies should be performed, and a
      gastroenterologist in the project group will instruct the doctors examining the patients to
      make sure that everyone performs polypectomy according to current guidelines.

      The study is designed as a non-inferiority trial.
