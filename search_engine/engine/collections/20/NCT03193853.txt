      characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads
      to errors in DNA pathway [non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)] that repair DNA-breaks, a
      process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival. The hypothesis
      of this pilot trial is that administration of the oral combination of TAK-228 and TAK-117
      (PIKTOR) will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC, leading at the time of disease progression to
      metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive to cisplatin plus nab paclitaxel therapy.
