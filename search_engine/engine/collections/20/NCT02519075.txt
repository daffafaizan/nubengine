      with liver predominant disease who are not eligible for curative surgery, after
      multidisciplinary discussion will be included. In all cases, patients will undergo
      11C-Choline PET/CT and DWI MRI before starting radioembolization and will be subsequently
      restaged 3 months after treatment completion. A minimum number of 20 patients will be
      considered for the analysis.
