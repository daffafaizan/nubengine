      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of venetoclax with romidepsin,
      including the dose ramp-up, in adults with relapsed or refractory mature T-cell lymphoma.
      (Safety Lead-in) II. To estimate the efficacy as measured by the overall response rate (ORR)
      of venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory mature T-cell lymphoma. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall
      survival and progression free survival associated with venetoclax and romidepsin in
      relapsed/refractory mature T-cell lymphoma. (Phase 2) II. To further characterize the safety
      and toxicities of venetoclax and romidepsin combination in relapsed/refractory mature T-cell
      lymphoma. (Phase 2)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine BCL2 protein expression in base line treatment tumor samples and correlatieon
      with response.

      II. To determine changes in Bcl-2 gene expression in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples of
      mature T- cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a safety lead-in dose-escalation study, followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and romidepsin
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 24
      months.
