      implant surface characterized by bleeding on probing, probing depth and eventually bone loss;
      if not successfully treated they may lead to implant loss. Based on the available parameters
      that have been reported in literature non surgical therapy doesn't seem to be effective on
      peri-implantitis.

      Therefore it is recommended to consider advanced therapies such as surgical interventions
      when non surgical peri-implant therapy fails to achieve significant improvements in clinical
      parameters. Numerous approaches have been used for implant surface decontamination during
      per-implant surgery, including mechanical, chemical and laser treatments. Conventional
      mechanical means don't seem to be effective on peri-implant diseases. In addition, the rough
      implant surface is a retentive factor for bacterial colonization and therefore makes implant
      surface difficult to debride. Another problem in maintaining implant health concerns the
      presence or absence of keratinised tissue around implant: if present, it seams to help the
      patient to maintain an optimal level of oral hygiene around implant and therefore the implant
      survival itself.

      The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial is to assess the influence of
      keratinised tissue around implant in improving clinical parameters. In particular, implant
      surface will be decontaminated mechanically with titanium curettes and chemically using
      chlorhexidine; after this a CTG around tissue implant will be randomized
