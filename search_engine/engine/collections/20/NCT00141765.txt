    
      This is a phase II trial designed to provide a transplant option for patients with rare
      poor-prognosis cancers. The protocol is only open to patients with metastatic or relapsed
      cancers for whom the probability of remaining free of progressive disease for one year after
      being brought into remission is < 25%. Patients eligible for this study have been diagnosed
      with a form of cancer that leads to death more than 75% of the time when treated with
      standard therapy doses of chemotherapy and/ or radiation therapy. Under this treatment
      intensification protocol the expectation is that the one year progression-free survival for
      this group of patients will rise to 40%. Patients eligible for this protocol will be followed
      for one year post-transplant. Patients alive and free of progressive disease at the end of
      this period will be considered successes.
