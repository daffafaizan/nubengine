      NCT00109330. Only subjects who were part of the primary study will be invited to participate
      in this study. All subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix at Visit 1 (Day 0) and
      subjects will be observed till Visit 2 (Day 30) for safety in terms of solicited adverse
      events (during 4 days post vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (during 31 days post
      vaccination) and serious adverse event (during the trial period). A blood sample will be
      collected from all subjects before vaccination (Visit 1) and one month after vaccination
      (Visit 2) for antibodies estimation.

      This summary has been updated following Protocol amendment 2 dated 03 October 2013. The
      protocol is being amended to facilitate enrolment by:

        -  - Extending the window period for re-vaccination from ± 6 months to ± 300 days from the
           Year 10 time point.

        -  - Extending the recruitment period from 6 months to 14 months. The format of
           non-inferiority criterion of the first co-primary objective has been updated to keep it
           aligned with the format of non-inferiority criterion of the second co-primary objective.
