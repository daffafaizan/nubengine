    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in subjects with
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed prior treatment with
      a new hormonal agent (NHA) and have a qualifying tumor mutation in one of 15 genes involved
      in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. Subjects will be divided into two
      cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status.

      Approximately 340 subjects will be randomized 2:1 (olaparib : investigator choice of
      enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate) into the trial.
