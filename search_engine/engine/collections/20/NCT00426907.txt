      tibial osteotomy is a good choice of treatment for the young and active patient.

      However it leaves an open gap which has to be filled with a bone substitute and requires
      stable fixation.

      Different rehabilitation-regimens are described, many advocating a period of partial
      weight-bearing for a period after surgery.

      Results from biomechanical studies suggest that immediate full weight-bearing is safe,
      enabling earlier mobilisation without compromising safe solid healing.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether there is any difference in clinical
      outcome, correction, stability and healing in open-wedge osteotomies (osteosynthesis with the
      DynafixÂ® system (EBI)) after 2 different rehabilitation regimens: Limited weight-bearing (20
      kg) for 6 weeks, and unrestricted weight-bearing.

      The investigation is performed as a randomised prospective clinical trial including 20
      patients with a planned 2 years follow-up period.

      Clinical outcome is evaluated with: Hospital of special surgery score, KOOS, SF 12 and
      Lysholm score.

      Routine standing x-rays is performed. Stability of the osteotomy is assessed with Roentgen
      Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) that provides the opportunity of exact 3-dimensional
      measuring of eventual loss of correction.
