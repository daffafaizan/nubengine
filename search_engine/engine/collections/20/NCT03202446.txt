    
      Laser-Assisted Immunotherapy (LIT) is intended to a systemic anti-tumor immune response by
      priming a tumor with laser energy to liberate an array of tumor antigens from whole cells,
      immediately followed by administration of the immune stimulant Glycated Chitosan (GC), which
      is designed to activate antigen presenting cells and facilitate the uptake of tumor antigens.
      In turn, the antigen presenting cells activate the patient's immune system, resulting in an
      immune response towards the remaining tumor(s).

      In this study it is investigated if the addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide increases the
      anti-tumor immune response of LIT, as well as comparing the effect of LIT plus Placebo or LIT
      plus low-dose cyclophosphamide to a control arm of patients receiving Standard of Care
      therapy.
