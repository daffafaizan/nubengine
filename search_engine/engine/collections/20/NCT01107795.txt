    
      Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a major public health problem, and
      studies suggest that the incidence of OSAHS may be even higher than estimated. Transoral base
      of tongue resections are commonly preformed to improve symptoms in OSAHS, but among surgeons
      there is not yet consensus as to the best tongue base operation. The difficulty in treating
      the tongue base is illustrated by the abundance of available procedures - including
      genioglossus advancement, hyoid advancement, tongue base suspension, radiofrequency
      treatment, transoral midline glossesctomy, submucosal coblation-assisted tongue base
      resection and recently; transoral robotic-assisted surgery (TORS) for base of tongue (BOT)
      resection. We will evaluate TORS BOT resection for use in OSAHS by assessing pre- and
      post-operative OSAHS scores and comparing them to historical data for alternative BOT
      operations.

      Though routine, BOT resection may result in significant post-operative pain leading to
      dysphagia. In certain patients, major complications such as aspiration pneumonia,
      malnutrition and dehydration can occur as a result. Thus, reducing post-operative dysphagia
      is critical to improving patient outcomes and limiting complication-associated hospital
      admissions. Several studies have addressed the management of post-operative dysphagia, but
      none have evaluated TORS BOT resections in OSAHS. Additionally, TORS BOT resections for
      malignant neoplasms have been previously shownto be safe and feasible. An outcome analysis of
      TORS BOT resections for OSAHS may therefore yield recommendations for reducing patient
      morbidity and mortality.
