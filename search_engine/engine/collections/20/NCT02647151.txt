      actinic keratosis with photodynamic therapy between methyl aminolevulinate cream (MAL) and
      aminolevulinic acid nanosoma gel (ALA).

      MAL cream: is an antineoplastic agent used as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy
      (PDT). The mode of action of methyl aminolevulinate in PDT was shown in the pharmacodynamic
      (PD) studies. In the target cells,methyl aminolevulinate was converted to photoactive
      porphyrins, including protoporphyrinIX (PpIX), which are the active photosensitizers. Upon
      light activation, the photosensitizers give rise to the production of cytotoxic singlet
      oxygen species which destroy the target cells.

      ALA gel: Following topical application of 5-aminolaevulinic acid, the substance is
      metabolized to protoporphyrin IX, a photoactive compound which accumulates intracellularly in
      the treated actinic keratosis lesions. Protoporphyrin IX is activated by illumination with
      red light of a suitable wavelength and energy. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen
      species are formed. The latter causes damage of cellular components and eventually destroys
      the target cells.

      Photodynamic therapy technique (PDT) is a conventional technique which is performed applying
      the product under occlusion lesions, let it incubate for 3 hours and then exposed skin to a
      light source, usually red.

      The conclusions of efficacy, tolerance and satisfaction that today are known about PDT with
      MAL, but not with ALA, which is a new photosensitizer indicated for QA. The pharmaceutical
      form of ALA is a gel, which gives a hypothetical better penetration and consequently it is
      more effectively.
