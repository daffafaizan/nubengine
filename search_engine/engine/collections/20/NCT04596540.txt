    
      This is one of two replicate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm
      trials to determine the safety and efficacy of two different dose levels of SEL-212 compared
      to placebo. Approximately 105 patients, stratified as to the presence or absence of tophi,
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to Baseline to receive treatment with
      one of two dose levels of SEL-212 or placebo every 28 days for approximately 6 months in each
      trial (SEL-212/301 and SEL-212/302). The SEL-212 doses will differ as to the SEL-110.36
      component. Participants will receive SEL-037 administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg via
      intravenous (IV) infusion immediately after receiving SEL-110.36 at a dose of either 0.1
      mg/kg (SEL-212A) or 0.15 mg/kg (SEL-212B) via IV infusion. The placebo will consist of normal
      saline.

      Placebo subjects who complete the study will be offered enrollment in an open-label extension
      study for treatment with SEL-212 (SEL-212/303).

      Efficacy assessments will be conducted at intervals that are appropriate to determine
      treatment effect with samples for the primary endpoint drawn during Treatment Period 6.
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study with an independent data safety monitoring
      board (DSMB).
