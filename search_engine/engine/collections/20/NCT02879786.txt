      static and dynamic posturography, in dyslexic children compared to age-matched control group.
      Posturographic data and a questionnaire for motion sickness disorder are used as
      proprioceptive disorder index. This study aims to better characterize the dyslexic population
      with techniques targeting central integration of sensory proprioceptive afferents. The
      purpose of this study is not to search for a postural deficiency syndrome, but to study
      proprioception with posturography, with quantitative and normalized data of analyzed
      population. Moreover, these data could allow an objective evaluation of reeducation with
      quantifiable and reproducible parameters in order to judge its effectiveness. The
      demonstration of the existence of a relationship between proprioceptive disorders and
      dyslexia will imply a specific reeducation care of patients. A study using validated and
      standard indexes is necessary. The presence of postural disorders and a major susceptibility
      to motion sickness could contribute to distinguish different forms of dyslexia and thus be
      complementary to actual medical, orthophonic and neuropsychological criteria. In this
      evaluation, it is important to distinguish between visuo-attentional dyslexia from
      phonological dyslexia involving distinct anatomo-functional neuronal circuits.
