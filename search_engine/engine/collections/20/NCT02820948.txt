    
      A prospective, randomized study was performed. The patients were randomized into 2 groups:
      those patients undergoing a subcutaneous sterile vitamin E acetate ointment application
      (Group 1) and those patients who did not receive this vitamin E ointment application (Group
      2).

      Before the skin stapling and after the subcutaneous irrigation with normal saline, sterile
      Vitamin E acetate ointment (FilmeOft, Hulka SRL, Rovigo, Italy) was applied in the
      subcutaneous tissue; 2 ml were applied in the suprapubic incision and 0.5 ml in the rest of
      port sites.

      Incisional SSI, microbiological cultures from the infected surgical wounds, postoperative
      pain was evaluated 24 hours after surgery by means of a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), ranging
      from 0 mm (complete absence of pain) to 100 mm (unbearable pain) and acute phase reactants
      (white cell count (WBC), fibrinogen and C reactive protein) 48 hours after surgery were
      investigated.
