      different diseases. Continuous glucose monitoring becomes a newly effective technology to
      better understand the glucose level. In this study,the investigators enrolled 25 patients
      with certain active autoimmune diseases during high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy at Peking
      Union Medical College Hospital. It was done by monitoring three-day continuous glucose levels
      by holding continuous glucose monitoring system underneath the skin, which helped to show a
      unique picture of fluctuations. The participants were divided into two groups according to
      the glucocorticoid therapy. Group 1 enrolled subjects who were newly commenced 1-2mg/kg/day
      prednisone-equivalent (intravenous/oral methylpredisolone or oral prednisone) for at least
      five days. Group 2 enrolled subjects who had underwent less than 15mg/day
      prednisone-equivalent glucocorticoid maintenance for at least 3 months but treated with
      high-dose glucocorticoid for the relapse during the study This finding is useful for the
      suitable treatment to control the hyperglycemia in young patients.
