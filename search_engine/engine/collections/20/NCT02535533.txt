      and SLM for adult patients with advanced metastatic CCRCC. This will be a two part study
      consisting of a dose escalation and expansion study.

      Dose-Escalation Part 1 (6-12 patients): THIS PHASE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. SLM will be given
      twice daily for 14 days followed by once daily dosing in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice
      daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The
      MTD was determined to be 4000 mcg SLM.

      Expansion Part 2: In this phase (approximately 19 patients), will be treated at the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SLM determined in the Escalation Part 1. It will be given orally
      twice daily for 14 days, followed by once daily dosing in combination with axitinib 5 mg
      twice daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      A pilot group of 10 subjects will have SLM dose calculated based on patients' BSA to
      characterize the dose-concentration relationship and estimate the effective administered dose
      of selenium necessary to achieve the target blood concentration range informed by preclinical
      data.
