    
      The objective of this study is to dertermine the performance of the ApneaBand, a new
      non-intrusive and portable device, in detecting sleep apnea, in comparison with PSG.

      40 apneic and non apneic subjects will wear the ApneaBand recording the different sleep
      stages and the occurency of apnea-hypopnea sleep events through four sensors including
      oximetry (oxygen saturation), photoplethysmography (pulse wave), electrodermal activity and
      tri-axial accelerometer (movements).

      Inclusion visit will be proceeded at the University Hospital Grenoble-Alpes ; polysomnography
      and mesures by the ApneaBand will be proceeded at the patient's home by IC@dom. Patients will
      be equiped with PSG + ApneaBand during the first night and with ApneaBand only the second
      night.
