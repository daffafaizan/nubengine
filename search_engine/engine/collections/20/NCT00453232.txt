      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of accelerated treatment comprising bleomycin, etoposide,
           cisplatin, and pegfilgrastim in men with metastatic germ cell tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen (particularly with respect to renal, pulmonary,
           and neurological function) in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, pilot study.

      Patients receive etoposide IV on days 1-3, cisplatin IV on days 1 and 2, and bleomycin IV
      over 2 hours on days 2, 6, and 10. Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day
      4. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
