      for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Patients who were admitted at YNHH with hepatic
      encephalopathy will be enrolled. Patients will then be randomized to one of two groups upon
      discharge. The control group will receive usual standard of care for hepatic encephalopathy
      (encephalopathy education, cirrhosis brochure, stool chart, and routine follow up with their
      primary care provider and hepatologist). The intervention group will receive usual standard
      of care as discussed above and phone calls for a 3-month period after their hospitalization.
