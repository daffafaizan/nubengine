      recent study of 109 sexually active women in a urogynecology practice, FSD was noted using
      the validated Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) in 64% of the women. Difficulties with
      sexual function are also associated with pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. One
      in nine women will have surgery for incontinence or prolapse in her lifetime. The impact of
      vaginal surgeries on sexual function and urinary symptoms has been scarcely reported in the
      literature. The methodology of most of those studies is flawed by the use of questionnaires
      that were not validated, small sample sizes and no comparison control group. In addition,
      several studies only focused on one surgical intervention, specific types of incontinence or
      prolapse, or both. It is difficult to make sense out of the discordant research findings when
      applying it to our patient population.

      This is a prospective study of women with incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse. Subjects
      will be selected from three urology practices. All patients will be asked to complete a short
      patient history form. If the woman meets the study criteria, the study will be explained and
      if she agrees to participate in this study, informed consent will be obtained. She will then
      complete the FSFI, SF-12 and PFDI-20 questionnaires.
