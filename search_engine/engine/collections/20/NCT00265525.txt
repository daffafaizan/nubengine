      using traditional delivery models that emphasize supervised, facility-based programs.
      Futhermore, facility based programs to promote physical activity behavior in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) are limited in their impact because most patients are unwilling
      to travel more than 30-40 minutes to participate in a program. CardioFit is an off-site, 26
      week web-based physical activity coaching service for people with heart disease. Within the
      CardioFit program, patients will be assigned to an on-line "coach" and receive customized
      exercise programs based on their medical history, personal goals and preferences. A
      randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate the effectiveness of the web-based
      intervention at increasing physical activity levels against usual care in patients with CAD.

      This study is in the third phase of a three-phase research program to examine interventions
      to promote physical activity for the secondary prevention of Cardiovascular disease.
