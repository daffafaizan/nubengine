      on end-of-life care of patients with advanced disease. A mixed-method approach, including a
      randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews, will be used. Participants in the
      experimental group will received a structured advance care planning programme delivered by a
      trained facilitator. It includes an educational component, reflection and a family meeting.
