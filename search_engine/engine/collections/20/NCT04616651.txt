    
      This is a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability, and to gather preliminary data
      on how patients with a new diagnosis of cancer appraise being prepared for their upcoming
      visit with a cancer specialist. Participants will be randomized to take a survey either
      before or after their Chatbot interaction. The surveys collect participants' self-appraisal
      regarding preparedness for their upcoming appointment with a cancer physician, cancer
      distress and cancer anxiety. The study will examine whether patients who take the survey
      after viewing the Chatbot feel more prepared for their upcoming appointment than those who
      take the survey before the Chatbot interaction.
