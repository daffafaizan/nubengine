      disproportionately greater rates of medical comorbidity and disability associated with high
      rates of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and poor dietary habits. Despite
      greater costs and adverse outcomes associated with the combination of mental illness and poor
      physical health, little attention has been paid to the development of health promotion
      interventions designed to address the needs of the high-risk group of people with SMI. This
      natural experiment presents an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the public health impact
      of a statewide health-promotion program for persons with SMI, a potential model for reducing
      early mortality among persons with SMI served by state mental-health systems nationwide.
