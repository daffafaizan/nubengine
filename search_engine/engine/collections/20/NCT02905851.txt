      dermatology use.

      There are two arms of the study:

        1. Feedback group

        2. Non feedback group

      All subjects will be randomised to either group, all subjects will take photos of their face
      and answer questions at baseline, visit 2 (1 month), visit 3 (2 months), visit 4 (3 months).

      The investigators will then use measurements of acne grading (patient grading, investigator
      global assessment, lesion counting, global acne grading) to reduce/taper antibiotics in the
      feedback group.
