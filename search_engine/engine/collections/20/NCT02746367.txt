      for distinguishing BDI from MDD that also aims to optimize the models to discriminate BDII
      from MDD and BDI. A binary classification model, using linear discriminant analysis and based
      on 13 a priori-defined proteomic markers will aim to distinguish BDI from MDD. An alternative
      binary classification model based on multiple logistic regression and using 10 a priori
      -defined proteomic markers will aim for the same result. To improve the predictive
      performance of the signatures, items from self-report mood rating scales and
      treatment-emergent changes in proteomic markers will be analyzed. In addition, the study will
      examine if baseline or early treatment-emergent changes in proteomic markers predict
      treatment response.
