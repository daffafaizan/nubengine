    
      Type of work: This is an observational, prospective, open, data-driven, single-center study
      at the National Institute of Oncology (NIO) - Mohamed Ben Abdellah Hospital in Rabat,
      affiliated to Mohammed V University in Rabat.

      The objective of the study we are proposing is to determine the incidence and risk factors of
      chronic post-surgical pain in oncological breast surgery on the Moroccan population operated
      on and followed at the Sheikha Fatma Center of the National Institute of 'Oncology of Rabat.

      The main objective of the study is to:

      - Determine the incidence of chronic post-surgical pain in carcinological breast surgery

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Determine the clinical characteristics of chronic post-surgical pain and in particular
           the proportion of neuropathic pain and / or post-mastectomy pain syndromes

        -  Identify the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors of developing
           chronic post-surgical pain in the Moroccan population

        -  Determine the incidence of acute severe postoperative pain

        -  Determine the characteristics of acute postoperative pain

        -  Identify the risk factors for severe acute postoperative pain

      Work flow:

        -  The medical care of patients will be free to the responsible practitioners, according to
           the usual practice

        -  Nursing staff will be informed of the study

        -  An investigator will be appointed after training in the protocol. He will be independent
           and not responsible for the nursing activity

        -  Patients eligible for the study will be identified during the pre-anesthetic
           consultation, carried out in the week before surgery

        -  The recorded agreements will be obtained during these consultations

        -  Patients will be included once admitted to the operating room and operated

        -  The data collected is presented in the observation book in the appendix with the
           definitions of the events and the entry rules

        -  The patients will be followed up and reviewed at 3 months and 6 months in surgery
           consultation for reassessment and completion of the observation book
