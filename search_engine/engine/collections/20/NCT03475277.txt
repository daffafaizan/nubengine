      reward-related human brain circuits. Reward-related brain circuits will be assessed using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging.

      Participants will include volunteers who report more than two prior uses of ketamine (also
      known as "Special K"), when they were 18 years or older.

      The investigators will recruit individuals who have previously tried ketamine rather than
      those who are ketamine-na√Øve.

      Participants will receive an IV infusion of ketamine (~.05mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg) or placebo
      (saline). Following established procedures, these three sessions will be randomized in a
      blinded protocol in order to limit expectancy effects.

      Throughout each session, participants will be monitored. Functional imaging will commence
      after the drug has reached peak levels, following previously established time courses for
      ketamine infusion. Participants will also be monitored after the functional imaging session.
      Secondary effects of ketamine on behavior and self-reported experience will be assessed.

      In the assessment of the acute effects of ketamine, the investigators will take into account
      the cumulative effects of prior drug exposure.
