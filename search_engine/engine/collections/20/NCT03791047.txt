      muscle strength or thickness negatively affect person's balance control. But there are no
      information in the literature about the relationships between muscle thickness and balance in
      healthy subjects. In addition to, it is not known which muscle responsible for balance.
      Therefore, this study will evaluate muscle thickness via ultrasonography and balance in young
      and older adults. Balance will be evaluated computerized Balance system. Muscle thickness for
      different 14 muscle ( diaphragm, transversus abdominis,multifidus, longissimus, quadratus
      lumborum, rectus abdominis, external and internal obliques, rectus femoris, vastus
      intermedius, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus) will be evaluated by
      ultrasonography at the right side. Only diaphram muscle will be evaluated both right and left
      side.
