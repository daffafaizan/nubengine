      about prevalence of auto antibodies anti-FRα in France.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial monocentric,evaluating folinic acid 10mg per day
      versus placebo, in single-blind during 12 weeks.

      Primary objective : The primary objective is to evaluate the efficiency of folinic acid
      (calcium folinate) 5mg twice a day during 12 weeks on reduction of autistic troubles,
      particularly on communication and social interaction

      Secondary objective :

        -  Evaluate the efficiency of folinic acid on reduction of autistic symptoms perceived by
