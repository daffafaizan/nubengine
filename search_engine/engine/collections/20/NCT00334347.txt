      mania and mixed mania. In fact, the American Psychiatric Associations Practice Guidelines for
      Bipolar Disorder recommends divalproex as a first-line treatment for acute mania and acute
      mixed mania; divalproex is the treatment of choice in the treatment of acute mixed mania. The
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved divalproex for the acute treatment of mania in
      the 1990's. A new formulation, divalproex, Depakote ER, was recently FDA approved for the
      treatment of epilepsy and prophylaxis of migraine headaches. In a pooled data analysis of
      nine open-labeled trials involving 321 epilepsy and bipolar disorder patients, Smith et al.
      that Depakote ER was associated with superior tolerability including less frequent tremors,
      weight gain, and gastrointestinal complaints (all p<0.001) compared with Depakote DR.
      Depakote ER was preferred by subjects and it provided improved seizure control and a greater
      reduction in psychiatric symptoms.
