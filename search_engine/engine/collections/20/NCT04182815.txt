      bronchoscopy and radial probe endobronchial ultrasound, successful biopsy of peripheral
      pulmonary lesions remains a challenge due to a number of factors, one of which may be the
      ability to gain access to peripheral lesions due to the size and maneuverability of
      conventional bronchoscopes. The diagnostic yield of conventional bronchoscopic approaches for
      peripheral lesions remains suboptimal.

      A novel robotic assisted bronchoscopy procedure now exists for patients with lung nodules.
      This procedure is performed using the Monarchâ„¢ platform (Auris Health, Inc., Redwood City,
      CA). This study is expected to enroll up to 1200 patients at up to 30 investigative sites.
