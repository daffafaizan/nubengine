      techniques have improved in the last years. Systemic application of lidocaine has gained
      interest since several studies have shown its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and
      antihyperalgesic properties. In this clinical trial the analgesic effect of intravenously
      administrated lidocaine is compared with placebo. Despite longstanding use as an
      antiarrhythmic agent and its use in many clinical trial as analgesic, lidocaine is not
      licensed for this indication and application. Current studies, setting the focus on abdominal
      surgery, indicated that the systemic application of lidocaine was associated with fewer
      intensity of pain at rest and during mobilization and resulted in a decrease of
      patients'opiate consumption.

      The intervention to be studied will either be the additional application of systemic
      lidocaine 1% to general anesthesia in bariatric surgery or the application of placebo.
      Patients, randomly assigned to one study group, will be surveyed for 48 hours after
      completion of surgery, experienced pain, occurrence of PONV, time to first defecation and
      length of hospitalization will be monitored. The population to be studied will include 140
      patients listed for bariatric surgery at the Kantonsspital St. Gallen. Patients, medical
      practitioner, nurses and investigators will be blinded. Each patient will self-evaluate his
      maximal experienced pain eight-hourly during a sequence of 48 hours after completion of
      surgery.
