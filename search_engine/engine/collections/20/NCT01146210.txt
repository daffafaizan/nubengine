      and COG-AAML03P1 who are at high risk of having de novo Fanconi anemia.

      II. Procure diagnostic samples from the COG AML Biology Repository and identify Fanconi
      anemia patients using western blot techniques.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected cryopreserved cells are analyzed via western blot to identify patients
      with Fanconi anemia.
