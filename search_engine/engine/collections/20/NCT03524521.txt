      The MICT group is the standard care group and will be instructed to walk for 30 minutes, 5
      days per week at a moderate intensity. The goal is to accumulate 150 minutes of continuous
      aerobic exercise each week. Participants will be instructed on the use of the Rating of
      Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale during baseline testing and will be instructed to reach an RPE
      of 12-16. A heart rate monitor will be worn to monitor exercise intensity. Heart rate should
      reach ~70% of maximal heart rate.

      The IT group will perform 5 body-weight exercises in three progressive phases. During the
      first 2 weeks the circuit will be completed twice, 30 second intervals, 90 seconds of rest.
      The exercises will be performed on 3 days of the week with at least one day of rest between
      exercise days (ideally Monday, Wednesday, Friday). The number of repetitions will increase to
      a maximum of 4 while the interval and rest periods increase to a maximum of 45 seconds each.
      The total time spent performing intervals by week 8 will be 15 minutes. A 2 minute warm up
      and 3 minute cool down will be performed, such as jumping jacks or simply walking. A heart
      rate monitor will be used to measure exercise intensity. Heart rate should reach
      approximately 90% of heart rate max during the intervals. Participants will be instructed on
      the use of the Rating of Perceived Exertion scale during baseline testing and will be
      instructed to reach an RPE of â‰¥17 during the high intensity intervals.
