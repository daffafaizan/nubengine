      chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in patients with moderate to heavy actinic
      keratosis (AK). II. Determine whether this drug reverses AK in these patients. III. Determine
      whether triamcinolone reduces DFMO-induced skin irritation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive eflornithine (DFMO) topically
      and triamcinolone topically to forearms once daily. Arm II: Patients receive DFMO and placebo
      topically as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive placebo and triamcinolone topically as in
      arm I. Arm IV: Patients receive 2 placebos topically as in arm I. Treatment continues for 6
      months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
