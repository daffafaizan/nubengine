      ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, transported to a comprehensive stroke center
      by aircew will receive RLIC using the Doctormate device.

      The RLIC treatment will consist of 3-5 cycles ( depending on transportation time) of 5
      minutes inflations of both blood pressure cuffs simultaneously. Blood pressure will be 200 mm
      HG with 5 minutes of reperfusion between each inflation.

      Subjects will be evaluated upon arrival to the comprehensive stroke center and evaluated for
      side effects.
