      in the protein components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain - mainly NADH dehydrogenases
      and cytochrome C oxidase, which leads to increased electron transport, production of ATP, and
      tissue regeneration (skin, muscle, bone, and nerves). Moreover, phototherapy stimulates the
      anti-inflammatory effect with analgesia and vasodilatation. Regarding body aesthetics,
      phototherapy increases microcirculation, lymphatic drainage, as well as collagen synthesis
      for the treatment of cellulite. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the
      effects of a new clinical procedure: infrared radiation originated from LEDs associated with
      treadmill training in postmenopausal women. LED arrays were developed for an irradiation of a
      large area, such as hip and quadriceps muscles, main actuators during stance and swing
      phases. These body parts are furthermore areas where there is incidence of osteoporosis,
      mainly at the femur, localized fat deposits, and cellulite. Infrared radiation (850 nm) was
      selected because this spectral range shows better skin penetration compared to red interval.
