      This study is a epidemiological observation study type exposed or unexposed to environmental
      tobacco smoke.

      Methods :

      The eNO is determined by a method On-line, at a rate expiratory 50 mL / s, using a
      chemiluminescence NO analyzer, before the allergy assessment (skin tests and assay of serum
      total and specific IgE ) and measurement of lung function (spirometry). Nasal lavage is
      performed by using a validated technique . Cells are counted and differentiated after Giemsa
      staining. We measured 1-anti-trypsin, neutrophil elastase, albumin, urea, IL4 , IL6, IL8 and
      IL13. Exposure to ETS is assessed by questionnaire to the parents. Statistical analysis
      include a narrative strand to verify the normality of distribution and an analytical
      analysis, including a bivariate followed by a multivariate analysis by multiple linear
      regression and / or logistic regression to model concentrations of biomarkers of inflammation
      and adjustment variables such as age, sex, atopic status, eosinophilia and severity of
      asthma.
