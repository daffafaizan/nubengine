      I. To establish a quantitative prediction rule for accurate and early prediction of the
      pathologic tumor response assessed post-surgery, using the change of contrast enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) assessed tumor size and perfusion characteristics before (baseline) and 2-3
      weeks following initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).

      II. To assess the agreement between CEUS based classification rule and pathologically
      determined treatment response (baseline versus pre-surgical scan).

      III. To establish a quantitative prediction rule for accurate and early prediction of the
      pathologic tumor response assessed post-surgery, using the change in propagation velocity of
      a shear mechanical wave in tissue before (baseline) and 2-3 weeks following initiation of
      NAC.

      IV. To assess the agreement between shear wave elastography (SWE) based classification rule
      and pathologically determined treatment response (baseline versus pre-surgical scan).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the role of combined CEUS + SWE features obtained at early treatment phase (2-3
      weeks following initiation of NAC), in accurately predicting the pathologically determined
      tumor response.

      II. To investigate the agreement in assessment of therapy response to NAC between CEUS versus
      contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE MRI) and SWE versus CE MRI for baseline
      versus pre-surgery scan and to identify discordant cases using scatter plot and contingency
      tables.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging and shear wave elastography at
      baseline, 2-3 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, and before surgery.
