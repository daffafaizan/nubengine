      rhabdomyosarcoma (AR) have a dramatic initial response to multiagent chemotherapy. However,
      approximately 30 percent of patients develop recurrent disease for which conventional
      chemotherapy is ineffective and treatment options are limited. Immunotherapy may represent an
      effective approach for treatment of recurrent ESFT and AR. Experimental evidence has shown
      that immune mediated anti-tumor effects can occur in vivo when T cells recognize and respond
      to antigens present on tumor cells. In ESFT and AR, tumor-specific chromosomal translocations
      resulting in the production of novel fusion proteins have been identified in the great
      majority of tumors. Peptides derived from these fusion proteins have been shown to function
      as tumor antigens for cytolytic T cells in animal studies. This protocol will study the
      safety, feasibility and efficacy of tumor-specific peptide vaccination administered with
      interleukin-2 therapy with or without autologous T cell infusions in patients with recurrent
      ESFT and AR.
