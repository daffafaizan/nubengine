      measurement days. All measurements were on the same day of each week to facilitate maximal
      comparability (Day0, Day7 and Day21). Additionally on Day0 and Day7 there were acute
      measurements 45 minutes after morning "non-acute" resting and fasting blood samples. (In a
      "non-acute" measurement last dose of Panavital or placebo was taken 12 hours before the
      "non-acute" blood sample collected next morning .)

      First week started with Day0 baseline measurements and immediately thereafter a strenuous
      VO2max test with 2 recovery days thereafter. After full recovery a 4-day blinded Panavital
      regimen. Last "non-acute" dose on Day6 was taken 12 hours before Day7 morning blood sample.
      At Day7 an acute 45 min placebo comparison was conducted.

      Thereafter a 14-day follow-up period with halved Panavital dose or Placebo. Altogether 5
      arterial blood samples were withdrawn. Three fasting and resting "non-acute" samples were
      taken in the morning before any treatments at Day0, Day7 and Day21. Two acute samples were
      collected after the VO2max (Day1) and after acute Panavital or placebo doses (Day7).

      Additionally 5 fingertip blood samples for glucose (and lactate) were taken at the same time
      as arterial samples (Day0 and Day7) and one fingertip sample was taken immediately at the end
      of VO2max.
