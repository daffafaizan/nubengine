      institutions radiographies of the ankle and foot are obtained in most of these patients,
      although significant fractures occur only in 15%. Therefore clinical decision rules were
      developed to clinically rule out significant ankle fractures, thereby reducing the number of
      radiographies resulting in significant time and cost savings.

      Up until now the Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules are the only clinical decision rules for ankle
      trauma that are widely accepted. They have a high sensitivity for the detection of fractures
      but a relatively low specificity. This led to the development of alternative clinical
      decision rules claiming equally high sensitivity but improved specificity. These alternatives
      have mostly not been replicated nor have they been directly compared.

      This is what the researchers want to do in this study: compare different clinical decision
      rules regarding sensitivity and specificity. Radiographies of ankle and foot made for every
      patient are used as the gold standard for the detection of fractures.

      Different clinical decision rules will be compared in a pediatric (5-15 years) and an adult
      population (from 16 years onwards). The researchers consider a clinical decision rule
      acceptable of it has a sensitivity of at least 95% and a specificity of at least 25%.
