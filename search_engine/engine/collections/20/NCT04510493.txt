      bad outcome if infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2).
      This may be explained by an over-activation of the Interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta system.
      Metabolic stress (increased glucose and lipid levels) induces NOD-, LRR- and pyrin
      domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) -mediated IL-1beta secretion. SARS-CoV2 also activates
      NLRP3. Therefore, the study proposes that metabolic stress in patients with overweight and
      diabetes potentiates COVID-19 induced hyperinflammatory syndrome leading to excess mortality
      in these vulnerable patients. Canakinumab (IlarisÂ®) is a recombinant, human monoclonal
      antibody antagonizing IL-1beta by blocking IL-1beta activity. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the effect of canakinumab in type 2 diabetic patients with COVID-19.
