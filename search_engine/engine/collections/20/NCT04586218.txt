      impact patient outcomes, increasing risk of stroke, kidney injury, and myocardial injury
      among others.

      Vasopressors are usually used to rapidly correct hypotension. Vasopressor infusions are
      typically administered by standard infusion pump with the rate adjusted by anesthesiologists
      to reach a predefined target mean arterial pressure (MAP); this requires frequent changes in
      the infusion rate because of the almost constantly changing hemodynamic status of such
      patients. Because it is infeasible for human providers to pay constant attention and make
      second-to-second changes, management is often suboptimal (i.e. large amounts of time are
      spent in hypotension below the target, or well above the target with the vasopressor drip
      still running).

      The investigators have developed an automated closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller to
      improve the titration of vasopressor (e.g:noradrenaline) in order to maintain MAP within a
      narrow range in the perioperative setting. The investigators have published engineering,
      animal and most recently, pilot,studies or case series with promising results.

      In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare time spent in hypotension
      defined as a mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg. They tested the hypothesis that the automated
      system will allow patients to spent less time during the postoperative period with a MAP < 65
      mmHg. This is thus a superiority study over a two hours study period
