      (hyperesthesia and paresthesia), and sphincter dysfunction. These neurological symptoms are
      unspecific, so SDAVFs often go clinically underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. But SDAVFs
      typically demonstrated a characteristic imaging appearance on spinal MRI including multilevel
      centromedullary cord T2 hyperintensity, enlarged intradural vessels along the dorsal and
      ventral aspect of the cord. If an SDAVF is suspected, conventional spinal angiography is
      required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the location of the fistula. Flowing
      diagnosis, expedient treatment is required, both microsurgery and endovascular embolization
      are safe and can achieve complete occlusion, the progression of the neurological deficits can
      be stopped in most instances.

      However, it is difficult to predict whose symptoms will improve and whose will stabilize or
      deteriorate. Due to the low incidence of the SDAVFs, nearly all studies which have been
      published about the clinical outcome and prognostic factors of SDAVFs are relatively limited
      and most of them are retrospective. In these studies, the preoperative severity of
      disability, age, gender, location of fistula and duration of symptoms have been analyzed as
      prognostic factors, therefore it remains unclear which are the most reliable predictor of
      clinical outcome. Moreover, the conclusions may be biased by long span of follow-up period or
      few clinical cases. Besides, the fitulas at the craniocervical junction often present with
      hemorrhage, while those below conus constitute 3 types of lesions. So the invsetigator
      conduct this prospective cohort study to clarify the 1-year outcome of patients with cervical
      and thoracolumbar SDAVFs and to determine the main prognostic factors.
