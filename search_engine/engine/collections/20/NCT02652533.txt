      shear wave speed measurements acquired at clinical presentation can discriminate biliary
      atresia (BA) from other causes of liver disease in the setting of neonatal cholestasis. The
      investigators also plan to determine if liver ultrasound shear wave speed measurements
      acquired at clinical presentation or longitudinally during the first one-year period after
      Kasai can predict important long-term outcomes in BA patients.
