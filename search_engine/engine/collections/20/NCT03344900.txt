      validated surveys, qualitative methods (e.g., interviews and focus groups), and medical
      record abstraction.

      The study will utilize a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation design that will blend both a
      new intervention to impact the effectiveness of hydroxyurea, text messaging, and study its
      potential for adoption and dissemination in "real-world" practice settings. In Phase I
      (formative process evaluation), actionable barriers of hydroxyurea adherence in Memphis,
      Tennessee, will be identified. The investigators will begin by conducting a broad evaluation
      of hydroxyurea utilization, impediments and facilitators of hydroxyurea adherence and care
      management in general for patients with SCD. Next, this information will be merged with
      patients' preferences for the content of an mHealth intervention, and test it in a local
      cohort (Phase II). If successful and approved by the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation
      Consortium (SCDIC) executive committee, this intervention will advance to the next phase,
      namely, the dissemination and implementation in a larger geographical area (the other SCDIC
      participating sites in Phase III). We will utilize the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the
      intervention representativeness and impact during all phases.
