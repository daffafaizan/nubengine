      the most frequent conditions requiring colostomy are abdominal malignancies, large bowel
      diverticulitis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, bowel obstruction or perforation and
      postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage. Colostomy related morbidity includes
      retraction, infection, prolapse, skin problems and parastomal hernia. Parastomal Hernia is a
      quite common late complication, with a clinical rate up to 55%, reaching 80% when assessed by
      Computer Tomography. Although Parastomal Hernia is often asymptomatic, significant morbidity
      exists, including pain, intermittent obstruction, stoma leakage, skin irritation and
      pouching, often reducing patients' Quality of Life. Several surgical options are available
      for Parastomal Hernia repair, many of them supporting the use of mesh to strengthen the
      fascia. However, results are often disappointing with quite high recurrence rates, rising up
      to 33%, even with the use of a mesh. Several studies have been published, testing
      effectiveness and safety of a prophylactic mesh in vertical laparotomy closure to prevent
      incisional hernia.

      The aim of this study was to assess feasibility, potential benefits and safety of a
      prophylactic biosynthetic mesh placed at the time of colostomy.
