      post-operative discomforts and to administrate paracetamol (acetaminophen) as soon as the
      child expressed a pain score â‰¥2 evaluated on the faces pain scale-revised (FPS-R).

      socioeconomic level, and cooperation of the child before and during anesthesia or extraction,
      influence of accompanying person, number of previous extraction, dental hygiene. Moreover,
      details about the type of extraction; the indication of extraction (tooth decay, orthodontic
      treatment, obstacle, infection and traumatism), the type of tooth (incisor-canine or molar),
      the degree of root resorption, number of doses of local anesthetic, and presence of
      preexisting or per-operative pain are also collected.
