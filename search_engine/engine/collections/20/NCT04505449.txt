      clinical syndrome without effective targeted therapies. The clinical syndrome of HFpEF
      develops from a complex interaction of several risk factors such as aging, obesity,
      hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and arterial stiffness that cause organ dysfunction and,
      ultimately, clinical symptoms. Although the H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF scores have recently been
      proposed to estimate the probability of HFpEF in patients suffering from unexplained dyspnea,
      diagnosing HFpEF remains still challenging. The aim of the current registry was to evaluate
      the role of invasive left heart catheterization with the measurement of left ventricular
      end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in suspicious of HFpEF patients.
