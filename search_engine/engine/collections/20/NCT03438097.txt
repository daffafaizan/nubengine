      patients consists of fluids that are given for indications other than volume expansion.
      However, the type of non-resuscitation fluids that hemodynamically unstable ICU patients
      receive has not been well characterized.

      Methods: A multicenter observational cohort study. Baseline data including, sex, age,
      physiological data at admission, source of sepsis, illness severity, and ICU and hospital
      mortality will be collected.

      Fluids administered during the first five days of ICU admission will be registered. Fluids
      used as vehicle to administer drugs will be regarded as non-resuscitation fluids and will be
      characterized in detail. All glucose solutions will be regarded as non-resuscitation fluids.
      Crystalloids delivered at a rate of < 5 ml/kg/h will be considered as non-resuscitation
      fluids. Parenteral nutrition will be regarded as non-resuscitation fluids. Crystalloids
      delivered at a rate of â‰¥ 5 ml/kg/h will be considered to be resuscitation fluids. Blood
      products and colloids will be regarded as resuscitation fluids.
