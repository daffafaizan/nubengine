      with acute myocardial infarction between march 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 and compared those
      data with those of this year (march 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019).

      The following elements will aslo been collected:

        -  Clinical presentation

        -  Mode of admission (SAMU (Service d'Aide MÃ©dicale Urgente in French ie Emergency Medical

        -  Thrombolysis

        -  Delays (symptom onset to first medical contact / door to balloon)

        -  Final Result : TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction)

        -  COVID-19 status if known

        -  Underlying known ischemic cardiopathy

        -  ECG (electrocardiogram) Q waves.

        -  Complication after PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention): Discharged date, LVEF (Left
           Ventricular Ejection Fraction), ventricular tachycardia Data will be collected through
           all participating centers under the supervision of the cath lab director.
