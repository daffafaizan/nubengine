    
      The proposed study is a single center, randomized, double-blind (patients, psychiatrists and
      outcome assessor), cross-over clinical trial comparing the recovery of neuromuscular blockade
      from rocuronium with reversal of sugammadex to succinylcholine in participants receiving ECT.
      The primary outcome will be the measurement of time when the first train-of-four (TOF) twitch
      (T1) returns to 90% of baseline. The secondary aims are to document the safety (adverse event
      rates) of rocuronium/sugammadex compared to succinylcholine in ECT patients. The exploratory
      aims are to establish the perioperative efficacy and efficiency of sugammadex reversal of
      rocuronium in ECT procedures in comparison with succinylcholine.
