    
      MARS is a multicenter, multinational, observational disease registry for patients diagnosed
      with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MPS IVA). The Registry will collect medical history, and
      clinical and safety assessments every six months, for up to 10 years. The Registry will
      enroll and collect data on patients over a period of at least 8 years from the time of the
      first marketing approval globally and data on individual patients will continue to be
      collected for at least 2 years from the time the last patient was enrolled or until the
      Registry is completed.

      These assessments are designed to further characterize the spectrum of clinical signs and
      symptoms of the disease, and to further characterize the safety profile of Vimizim in a
      broader population. It is not required that patients receive Vimizim to be eligible to
      participate in this Registry.

      In addition, this Registry will collect additional data on patients who have completed the
      MOR-005 and MOR-007 clinical trials. The MOR-005 and MOR-007 clinical trial patients will be
      enrolled into the appropriate Registry Substudy for a minimum of 5 years from the time of the
      patient's enrollment in the MOR-005 clinical study or MOR-007 clinical study. After the 5
      year period, these patients should remain in MARS until the Registry is complete.
