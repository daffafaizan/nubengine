    
      Tree MATAMPL (tyrosine adsorbed tree pollen allergoid with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLÂ®)) has
      been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with proven type I
      hypersensitivity to cross-reacting tree pollens that cause rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis
      with or without mild to moderate asthma.

      This was a phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the tolerability and
      immunogenicity of different doses of Tree MATA MPL in volunteers allergic to birch, hazel and
      alder pollen.

      Sixty eight (68) volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three active treatments or
      placebo to receive up to 4 subcutaneous injections of either increasing doses of Tree MATAMPL
      or Placebo over 7 day (+1 day) interval.

      The duration of the study from screening (Visit 1) to end of study (Visit 6, Post-Treatment
      Visit) was approximately 50 days.
