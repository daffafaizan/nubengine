      because of the resulting motor deficit and spasticity. Autonomy in activities of daily living
      is reduced.

      The principal treatment for focal spasticity is currently intramuscular botulinum toxin
      injection (BTI).

      BTI is classically combined with only 2 to 3 sessions of out-patient physiotherapy per week.
      This is mainly because of a lack of out-patient therapists. However, this amount of therapy
      is insufficient and does not follow current literature which shows that the intensity of
      physiotherapy affects the recovery of impairment and activity. This gap in our health system
      could be filled by a self-rehabilitation program in addition to physiotherapy.

      Recent studies have shown that self-rehabilitation following BTI could significantly improve
      activity limitation (Roche et al, 2014 ; Sun et al 2010).

      The addition of a self-rehabilitation program to BTI and usual out-patient physiotherapy
      could thus increase the effects of BTI on impairment and activity limitation in patients with
      spastic hemiparesis following stroke.
