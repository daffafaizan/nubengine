      measuring plasma levels of adenosine at different time points, ranging from 30 minutes to 6
      hours. Because activation of A2B receptors also mediates the release of inflammatory
      cytokines, including IL-6, samples will be taken to measure these and other
      inflammatory/angiogenic cytokines.

      In a second protocol, we will administer adenosine intradermically via a microdialysis probe
      for 30 minutes while we measure the local effect on skin blood flow using laser Doppler
      techniques. One hour after the end of the infusion we will obtain a skin biopsy from the
      perfused area for measurement of mRNA for VEGF, IL-8, IL-6 and other cytokines. In addition,
      we foresee the possibility of further testing looking for and genetic association between
      angiogenesis and adenosine.

      These are proof-of-concept pilot studies. We will study up to 12 subjects in each protocol
      but an interim analysis will be performed after 6 subjects are studied. This will help us
      determine if a trend is observed, to perform power calculations, and determine if more
      extensive studies are warranted.
