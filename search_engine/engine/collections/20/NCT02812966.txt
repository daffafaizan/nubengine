      with clinical indications for treatment with angioplasty, there will be a difference in the
      12 month patency (defined as PSVR <=2.4 at 12month follow-up visit with no TLR or target
      lesion bypass) between the subjects with Lutonix 035 Drug coated Balloon PTA Catheter and
      IN.PACT Admiral Paclitaxel-Coated PTA Balloon Catheter. Investigators will also assess and
      compare target lesion revascularization rates, safety profiles, adverse events, healthcare
      costs, and healthcare utilization.
