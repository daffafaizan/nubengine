      precision radiation (SBRT) to melanoma metastasis that have progressed on PD-1 inhibitor
      therapy. Patients will continue on PD-1 inhibitor therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) for up
      to one year after completed precision radiation and will be followed-up for 24 months or
      until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint of the study is overall response
      rate (ORR) in non-irradiated lesions. The study will be conducted according to Simon´s two
      Stage minimax Design. Patients will be enrolled in two batches, first consisting of 13
      patients. If no objective responses (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) are
      reported after the first stage, the study is interrupted early for futility. When the 13th
      patient is recruited, if there is at least one objective response in patient´s non-irradiated
      lesion(s), the recruitment can proceed into second stage. 14 more patients will then be
      included up to a total of 27 patients to determine ORR along with the 95% confidence
      interval. The test result is considered positive when at least 15% of the patients have a
      confirmed objective response.
