      physicians. Cyclical breast pain is defined as prementstrual breast discomfort associated
      with hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. A clinical breast examination and
      sometimes additional imaging, such as sonography or mammography, is required as part of the
      evaluation to exclude malignancy. For most women, the symptoms are effectively managed with
      reassurance and conservative treatment measures such as the use of a supportive bra or over
      the counter pain medication such as acetaminophen or anti-inflammatories. However, a small
      number of women will require additional drug treatment with danazol after failing to respond
      to conservative measures. Unfortunately, danazol is associated with significant side effects.
      In the Mayo Breast Clinic, women with cyclical breast pain are managed with Vitamin E and
      Evening oil of primrose (EOP) either as single agents or in combination. These over the
      counter supplements are readily available, acceptable due to minial side effects and appear
      to lead to significant reduction in breast pain. We propose a randomized placebo controlled
      trial to determine if any vitamin E or EOP or the combination of both are effective in
      managing cyclical breast pain.
