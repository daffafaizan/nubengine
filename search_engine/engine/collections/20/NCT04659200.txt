      through droplet, has caused the global Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 infection
      can be asymptomatic as well as lead to severe illness and even death. This virus causes a
      hypersensitive immune reaction and varying degrees of widespread inflammation through
      cytokines in various organs of the body, mainly the lungs.

      Cytokine-mediated widespread inflammation caused by the virus may also affect the thyroid
      gland and thyrocytes, causing thyroiditis and impairment of thyroid functions. Thus, it may
      cause changes in thyroid hormones and thyroid autoantibodies.

      In study, the researchers found that in patients who were symptomatic with COVID-19 infection
      and who were hospitalized, thyroid function tests such as serum thyrotropin (TSH), free
      triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb),
      anti-thyroglobulin evaluated antibodies (TGAb). The investigators did not recruit patients in
      intensive care and patients with known thyroid disease.

      Researchers looked at the association of patients' thyroid hormones and thyroid
      autoantibodies with white blood cells, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio, c reactive protein,
      fibrinogen, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer from hospital archives. The researchers
      determined how the thyroid hormones and autoantibodies of patients with COVID-19 infection
      were compared with healthy individuals without COVID-19 infection and thyroid disease.
