      phase.

      Phase 1 (Exploratory): A minimum of 10 and up to 12 participants will be recruited to
      identify any issues in using the app when used in conjunction with CPAP therapy (e.g. missed
      signals, inappropriate classification of breathing signals).

      Phase 2 (Iterative Updates): Where changes to the algorithm or user interface are required,
      an additional 30 and up to 35 participants may be tested to provide design confidence.
      Conversely, if substantial issues are experienced and the time and effort required to address
      the issues is sufficiently large, the study may terminate before completion of phase 2.

      Each phase is expected to last up to six weeks with the overall study duration taking up to
      12 months.

      Participants will be required to visit ResMed twice. The first visit will involve briefing of
      the study, consent form signatures, briefing on trial equipment and setup/usage instructions.
      The second (last) visit will involve going through the daily questionnaires with
      participants, collecting trial equipment and providing reimbursement for the study.
