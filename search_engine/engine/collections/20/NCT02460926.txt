      treatment (FM-SRP). Aim of this study will be to compare quadrant scaling (Q-SRP) versus
      FM-SRP in terms of systemic acute (24 hours) and medium-term (3 months) inflammation.

      Material & Methods. 38 periodontitis-affected subjects will be randomly allocated to FM-SRP
      or Q-SRP after a baseline visit. Periodontal and anthropometric parameters, such as systolic
      and diastolic bood pressure, BMI and temperature, will be collected at baseline and 3 months.
      Serum samples will be drawn at baseline, 1, 7 and 90 days after treatment. High sensitivity
      assays for a broad array of inflammatory (PCR, IL-6, TNF-alpha) and endothelial assays will
      be performed.
