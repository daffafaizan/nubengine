      question: can pivoting ARI CDS tools towards nurses overcome established implementation
      barriers to reducing antibiotic use? The proposal is highly innovative in three ways: It uses
      CDS tools to embed evidence-based risk stratification to enable nurse-led ARI management. It
      creates a nurse training program to support this nurse-led ARI treatment pathway. It will be
      evaluated and optimized using evidence-based implementation frameworks that will guide
      assessment of the fidelity, acceptability, adoption, cost, and sustainability of the tool.
      This will provide comprehensive implementation measures, formative and summative, and enable
      a rigorous understanding of barriers and facilitators to implementing nurse-led CDS tools for
      reducing antibiotic overprescribing. This study will provide much needed guidance on how to
      implement CDS-enabled, nurse-led ARI assessment and treatment to reduce antibiotic
      overprescribing.
