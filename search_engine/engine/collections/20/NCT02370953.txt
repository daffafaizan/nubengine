        -  A decrease in residual astigmatism

        -  An improved best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA)

        -  An improved uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA)

        -  A decrease in residual refractive astigmatism

        -  A decrease or comparable complication profile

      Secondary Objective:

      The secondary objective of the study is to compare residual astigmatism when using the VERION
      Measurement Module and VERION Digital Marker for alignment of the toric IOL or the
      conventional manual ink-marking procedure.

      Other Secondary Objectives:

      The other secondary objectives are to compare:

        1. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA)

        2. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA)

        3. Residual refractive astigmatism

        4. Wavefront aberrations

        5. Complication profile
