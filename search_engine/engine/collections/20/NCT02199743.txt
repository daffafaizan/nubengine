      (APD) and switched to haloperidol 4mg for 5 days. At the end of this discontinuation period,
      all baseline symptom ratings and cognition testing will be done, as well as the baseline
      imaging procedures. At the end of the baseline procedures, volunteers will be blindly
      randomized, either to lurasidone at 40mg (N=12), or to haloperidol at 4mg/d or perphenazine
      at 16mg/d (N=12). Doses will increase to 80mg/d lurasidone, 8 mg/d haloperidol, or 32 mg/d of
      perphenazine at the beginning of week two. Dose should be stable for the last 3 weeks of
      treatment unless side effects are prominent, then the dose can be decreased to 40
      lurasidone/4 haloperidol/16 perphenazine mg/d for optimal clinical management. The
      randomization strategy will be designed and implemented by the research pharmacist in four
      blocks of six volunteers; drug will be dispensed by the research pharmacy according to the
      randomization schedule. The randomization will be followed by a four week treatment period at
      optimal dose levels. On the last two days of the 4 week stable dosing period, the specified
      glutamate outcome measures will be completed (neuroimaging and cognitive testing) along with
      all the symptom outcome measures, testing for drug plasma levels, and usual blood safety
      measures. Patients will be seen weekly for clinical evaluation; suicidality will be monitored
      weekly. All medications other than study drugs will be discontinued, as much as possible, for
      the 24-48 hr assessment period. After the evaluation phase, patients will be cross-titrated
      back to their original treatment medication and dosing.

      This design will generate outcomes from 12 patients on lurasidone vs. 12 patients on
      haloperidol/ perphenazine.
