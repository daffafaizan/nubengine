    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, clinical study with Dose Escalation (Phase 1) and
      Expansion (Phase 2) to independently assess the MTD, efficacy , and safety of 10 combination
      therapies in 11 arms in patients with RRMM and NDMM. Patients will be assigned to treatment
      arms based on their diagnoses and treatment histories. For 9 patients, a PK Run-in period
      will precede Cycle 1 (DLT evaluation) to assess selinexor PK when co-administered with a
      strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. In the Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1): (a) in Arm 1 (SPd), Arm 2
      (SVd), and Arm 3 (SRd in RRMM), patients will be randomized to either QW or BIW selinexor
      dosing cohorts; (b) in Arm 5 (SDd), patients will be sequentially assigned in blocks of 3 to
      either QW or BIW selinexor dosing; (c) in Arm 4 (SPVd), Arm 6 (SKd), Arm 7 (Srd in NDMM), Arm
      8 (SNd), Arm 9 (SPEd), Arm 10 (SBd), and Arm 11 (SDPd) patients will be assigned to QW
      selinexor dosing.

      Cohort 1.4 is included from Version 10 to study safety and tolerability of SPd with selinexor
      40 mg QW, is lower than RP2D (ie, selinexor 60 mg QW) in combination with pomalidomide 4 mg.
      Cohort 1.4 is a different expansion cohort from the one with RP2D (ie, Cohort 1.3). In Cohort
      1.4, 20 patients will be enrolled in total.

      Starting in protocol Version 8.0, patients enrolled to the Dose Escalation Phase of Arm 4
      (SPVd), Arm 6 (SKd), Arm 8 (SNd), Arm 9 (SPEd), Arm 10 (SBd), and Arm 11 (SDPd) will first be
      enrolled to a 14-day PK Run-in period (selinexor +/- clarithromycin) until 9 patients have
      been enrolled. During this 14-day PK Run-in period, selinexor 40 milligrams (mg) will be
      administered alone on Day 1, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (BID) will be administered on
      Days 2-8, and selinexor 40 mg will again be administered on Day 8 with the morning
      clarithromycin dose. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose and 1 (± 10
      min), 1.5 (± 10 min), 2 (± 10 min), 3 (± 10 min), 4 (± 10 min), 5 (± 10 min), 6 (± 10 min), 8
      (± 10 min), and 24 h (± 30 min) hours after selinexor is dosed on Day 1 (without
      clarithromycin) and Day 8 (with clarithromycin). Patients will then proceed to the DLT
      evaluation period that will begin after the completion of the 14-day PK Run-in period; this
      day will be designated as Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) in the Dose Escalation Phase.
