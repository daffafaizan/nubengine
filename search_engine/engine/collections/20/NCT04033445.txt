      inflamed and develops ulcers. Guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) that binds to human interleukin (IL)-23 with high affinity. The study is
      designed to answer scientific questions pertaining to the efficacy and safety of guselkumab
      in the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. Overall, the study will evaluate
      long-term guselkumab treatment. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and
      biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points.
