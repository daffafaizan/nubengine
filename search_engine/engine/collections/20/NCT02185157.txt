      impacts of improvements in walking abilities and cognition. If the elderly maintain safe gait

      consequently reduce the burden of care on the family and caregivers. Additionally, the public
      health system may ultimately receive important positive economic and social impacts. This
      clinical trial may be reproduced in research and clinical practice environments.
