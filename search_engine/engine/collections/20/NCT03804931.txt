      through FMT as a therapy for ulcerative colitis(UC). We established a standard microbiota
      isolation from donated fresh stool in lab. Then the microbiota is transplanted to the
      intestine. Patients from Guangzhou First People's Hospital in this study will be assigned to
      receive FMT at least two times according to associated guidelines and follow-up for at least
      three months.
