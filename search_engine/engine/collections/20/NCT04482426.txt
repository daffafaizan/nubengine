      incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse are relating to the function of pelvic floor
      structures. Essential components responsible for pelvic floor function include bony,
      muscular, and fascial structures of the pelvis. Among above components, pelvic floor muscles,
      either the superficial or deep group, are considered crucial in maintaining the morphology
      and functional integrity of the pelvic floor.

      Inspection and digital examination incorporating Oxford grading system during pelvic
      examinations are the most convenient and commonly methods applied to evaluate the function of
      pelvic floor muscles. Nevertheless, both methods cannot provide quantitative information of
      pelvic floor muscle contraction. With the introduction of pelvic floor manometry and
      electrophysiological testing, quantification of pelvic floor muscle contractions can be
      expected.

      The study aimed to explore and quantify functional and electrical activities in different
      pelvic floor muscle groups, to differentiate the electrophysiological role in different
      pelvic floor muscle groups relating to pelvic floor dysfunction or disorders, and further to
      develop treatment strategies for different pelvic floor muscle groups in different female
      pelvic disorders.
