    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of monitoring step count as a measure of physical activity in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioma undergoing radiation therapy (RT) at MD Anderson Cancer
      Center (MDACC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate the effects of physical activity as measured by step count on cognition, fatigue,
      anxiety and depression scores and assess differences between groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients wear a pedometer for step count monitoring over 6 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients wear a FitBit for step count monitoring over 6 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months after completing
      radiation therapy.
