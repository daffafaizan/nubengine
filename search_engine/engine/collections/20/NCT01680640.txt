    
      We will recruit people with NAFLD who have been diagnosed as part of their NHS (National
      Health Service) care with having this condition. At present there is no treatment for this
      condition.

      Purpose and design:

      We are asking the research question: "Does the modulation of gut microflora with a synbiotic
      improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the related risk factors for heart disease and
      type 2 diabetes?"

      Presently there is no treatment for this liver condition. Research evidence suggests that a
      synbiotic supplement might be beneficial for this condition.

      To address this research question we want to undertake a randomised double blind placebo
      controlled trial recruiting people who have been diagnosed with NAFLD.
