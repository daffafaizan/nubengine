      include 10 HIV infected women on any antiretroviral regimen and their newborn infants and 10
      healthy women on no antiretroviral regimen and their newborn infants.

      Primary Objective: To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes can be detected more
      frequently in cord blood of infants exposed to zidovudine in utero and intrapartum compared
      to cord blood from infants not exposed.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes can be detected in pregnant women on any
           antiretrovial agents.

        -  To determine if micronucleated erythrocytes change in frequency in infants exposed to
           antiretrovial agents over the first 6 weeks of life, during the time the infant is
           exposed to Zidovudine.

        -  To determine the change in micronucleated erythrocytes in the infants after cessation or
           Zidovudine (6 months).
