        1. to compare the efficacy between switching patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from
           galantamine or rivastigmine to donepezil because they were not responding adequately,
           and naive patients with AD who initiated therapy with donepezil

        2. to help to clinicians in choosing the best treatment
