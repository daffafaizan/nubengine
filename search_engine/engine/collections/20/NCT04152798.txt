      cruroraphy with mesh reinforcement techniques.

      Cruroraphy it is suturing of the right and left diaphragmatic crura using nonabsorbable
      stitches. Main disadvantage of such technique is the high hiatal hernia recurrence rate after
      surgery.

      Cruroraphy with mesh reinforcement technique followed by relatively less hiatal hernia
      recurrence rate but associated with a large number of mesh-related complications.
