      results in increased compliance in the maintenance of bleeding logs.To do this subjects will
      be randomized into a control group and a group who will receive consistent counselling by a
      pharmacist about their bleeding logs.

      The aims of the study are:

        -  To provide a new method of bleeding and treatment documentation in the home setting
           (logs) to adolescent subjects with Hemophilia A or B

        -  To counsel these subjects about adherence to their treatment regimen prescribed by
           physician and the importance of keeping accurate documentation of each bleeding episode
           and its treatment.

        -  To improve maintenance of logs, to allow for 1) assessment of bleeding frequency and
           treatment efficacy and 2) early detection of target joint bleeding and the potential
           need for prophylactic factor replacement.
