    
      The primary objective is to determine the response rate (RR) to E7389 monotherapy
      administered as an IV bolus of 1.4 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-Day cycle and on Days
      1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer treated with
      chemotherapy including an anthracycline and a taxane, with previously documented progression
      during or within six months following the last dose of prior chemotherapy.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

        -  The safety and tolerability of E7389 monotherapy in this patient population;

        -  The antitumor activity of E7389 as determined by duration of response, time to
           progression, and overall survival;

        -  Quality of life measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)
           questionnaire/tumor-related symptom improvement or worsening measured by pain intensity
           on a visual analog scale (VAS), analgesics consumption, weight changes and performance
           status (PS);

        -  Tumor pharmacogenetics and their possible relationship to response (assessment of
           beta-tubulin isotype mRNA on biopsy sample) in patients who have signed a separate
           consent form
