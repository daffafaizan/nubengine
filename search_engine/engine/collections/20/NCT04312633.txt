      about your future care and treatment.

      In addition , by recording the results of all your biopsies over 5 years, it may be possible
      to find out if the brush biopsy, forceps biopsy, or both can predict which patients with
      heartburn develop Barrett's esophagus, (an abnormality in the esophagus that may lead to
      cancer), and which patients with Barrett's esophagus develop precancer and cancer.

      You are being asked to participate in the study because you are receiving an upper endoscopy
      (a procedure where a tube with a light and camera are inserted in your mouth and down your
      throat) with forceps and brush biopsies of your esophagus as part of you standard clinical
      care, and you are at least 18 years old.
