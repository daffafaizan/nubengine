      (400mg/day, 800mg/day, 1200/day and 2400mg/day) will be consumed daily for two weeks.
      Information on safety and fasting blood/urine samples will be collected. Primary endpoint is
      plasma F2-isoprostanes (adjusted for arachidonate) while secondary endpoint is the change in
      the total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) before and after treatment. Serum
      phospholipase A2 activities, plasma all trans-retinol, plasma total tocopherol (sum of α-, δ-
      and γ-tocopherol) and serum uric acid will be measured.
