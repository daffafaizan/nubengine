    
      This prospective, multi-center study will enroll up to 500 participants who are undergoing
      their initial CIED implant with either a CanGaroo envelope or no envelope.

      Once a participant is enrolled in one of the two cohorts, each participant will have their
      medical history data reviewed and data will be recorded in the CRF including baseline
      demographics, medications, and diagnoses.

      The details of the CIED procedure including any complications/AEs that occur during the
      procedure will be captured on the appropriate CRF.

      Information collected at the follow-up visits will include documentation of post-procedure
      status, including any complications, adverse events, or revision/reoperation procedures that
      occur during the follow-up period. This information will also be collected for any
      unscheduled follow-ups, visits, or care encounters that occur up to 3 months post-procedure.
      For participants that agree and qualify for optional long-term follow-up, the same
      information will be collected at additional follow-up points every six months for up to five
      years.
