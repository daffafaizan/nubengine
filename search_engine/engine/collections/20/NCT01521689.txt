      Main objective:

      - To improve the minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) rate after
      consolidation using subcutaneous low dose of rituximab

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Progression free survival, treatment free survival, overall survival,

        -  MRD follow-up,

        -  Safety

        -  Medico-economic study

        -  Quality of life study

        -  Immune functions study (ancillary study)

      Main assessment criteria:

      MRD negative CR rate, established by peripheral blood 4colour flow cytometry according to
      international consensus on CLL MRD study, at the end of the consolidation treatment.

      Experimental plan:

      Inclusion of patients after the evaluation of response to induction treatment according to
      NCI-ICLLWG criteria and MRD analysis (2 to 3 months after induction completion): patients
      having not achieved MRD negative CR.

      Consolidation treatment by subcutaneous rituximab given at 20 mg/mÂ²/d thrice weekly during 12
      weeks.

      Evaluation of the response 3 months after completion of the consolidation treatment.

      Subjects number: 35 patients will be needed to accept the hypothesis of an augmentation of CR
      with negative MRD >=40%, excluding the hypothesis that this rate is < 20%. This ensure us an
      alpha risk at 5% with a 80% power, taking into account that non evaluable patients will be <
      5%.

      Immune functions study before and after consolidation treatment by rituximab
