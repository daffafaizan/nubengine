      It is clearly observed in clinical practice that there seems to be significant variability in
      the characteristics of the expulsive phase from one woman to another without this being
      clearly described to date. During the same expulsive phase, the number, intensity and
      duration of each push can be very different from one woman to another.

      Considering that during expulsive efforts, the fetal head exerts pressure on the perineal
      tissues , the repetition of these compressions, moreover if they are prolonged or brought
      closer together could generate muscular lesions by hyper extension of the fibers, by
      microtrauma or by tissue hypoxia. These variations in the characteristics of expulsive
      efforts could thus modify the perineal risk for women.

      More than the expulsive efforts evaluated by the recording of intra uterine pressures which
      has already been described, it is the evaluation of the mechanical stresses transmitted to
      the perineum secondary to the pushing efforts that we would like to record by the
      installation of a sensor pressure connected to the woman's bladder catheter.

      Investigations During the second phase of labor, at 8 cm dilation, after information and
      obtaining free and informed consent, women will be included by one of the MD investigators.

      3 visits are planned in the protocol: The first visit will be at childbirth Evaluation of the
      mechanical stresses transmitted to the perineum secondary to the pushing efforts by the
      installation of a sensor pressure connected to the woman's bladder catheter

      Follow up A prospective study including nulliparous term pregnant women with 2 other visits
      planned at 3 months (12 to 16 weeks) and 6 months (26 to 30 weeks) after delivery, to assess
      secondary perineal complications
