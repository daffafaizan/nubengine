      chronic SCI and loss of bone mass in their lower extremities. A convenience sample of 60
      subjects with SCI will be enrolled into a 12 month study assessing the effects of PTH (20
      ug/day) and vibration (10 min/day) individually or in combination on BMD and bone markers.
      Subjects will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initiating treatment with
      measurement of bone density as well as bone markers of formation and resorption.
