      levels of care for the patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD). And while the pathology of
      dementia has been studied in great detail, the etiology is considered multi-factorial. The
      hypothesis behind this clinical study is that the presence of the apo lipoprotein E4 (APO E4)
      allele will serve to predict which patients with late on-set AD are at greater risk to
      develop agitation.
