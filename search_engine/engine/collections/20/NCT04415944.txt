    
      Primary Objective: Determine the feasibility of second look laparoscopy and hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy with carboplatin.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To compare the quality if life in patients with ovarian cancer after undergoing second
           look laparoscopic reassessment surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
           using carboplatin (CBDCA) versus quality of life in patients treated with cytoreduction
           surgery and systemic chemotherapy alone.

        -  To describe toxicities in patients with ovarian cancer treated with second look
           laparoscopy and simultaneous hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
