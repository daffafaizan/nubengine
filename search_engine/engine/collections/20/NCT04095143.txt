      kidney injury. It remains unclear if fluid overload is merely a marker of disease severity or
      if organ congestion is a direct mediator of complications. Point-of-care ultrasound could be
      a modality used to assess organ congestion and its clinical implications.

      Objective: To determine whether ultrasound markers of organ congestions are associated with
      major adverse kidney events and other adverse clinical outcomes.

      Study design: A cohort of critically ill patients with a new onset of severe acute kidney
      injury will undergo repeated ultrasound assessments to detect the presence of the following
      markers:

        -  Portal flow pulsatility on pulse-wave Doppler

        -  Discontinuous intra-renal venous flow on pulse-wave Doppler

        -  Abnormal hepatic vein waveform on pulse wave Doppler

        -  Presence of pulmonary B-line artifacts on 2D lung ultrasound

        -  Presence of dilated and non-collapsible inferior vena cava on 2D ultrasound

        -  Presence of systolic right ventricular dysfunction

        -  Presence of systolic left ventricular dysfunction

      Clinical outcomes will be collected for up to 90 days after recruitment.

      Perspective: An approach targeting the resolution of organ congestion might improve the
      prognosis in patients with severe acute kidney injury. Identifying clinically relevant
      markers of organ congestion is a precursor to the design of future interventional trials
      investigating personalized fluid balance management.
