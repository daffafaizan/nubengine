      are used during surgery for broken arms for post-surgery pain relief. One group will receive
      general anesthesia (state of total unconsciousness) the other group will get sedation
      (medicine injected into patient's vein that helps patient fall asleep), and a nerve block
      (injection of anesthetic drug into the nerves going to patient's arm in order to make
      patient's arm numb).

      Both forms of anesthesia are used for a variety of surgeries to the arm including shoulder
      and elbow surgeries. Currently it is thought that there are advantages and disadvantages to
      both types. The advantage of not using the nerve block in addition to general anesthesia
      (current standard or care) is that it decreases the potential risk for bleeding, infection
      and nerve injury. Alternatively, the advantage of using the nerve block with sedation
      (research-related procedure) is that it can potentially offer better post-operative pain
      control. This study will examine whether there is added benefit with the addition of nerve
      block for anesthesia for decreasing pain after surgical treatment of lower arm fractures.
