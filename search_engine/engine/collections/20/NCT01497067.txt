      C-03-21 (NCT00726297), and C-05-57 (NCT00727688) who received an L-series lens either in the
      first eye or second eye (including those who were explanted) were enrolled in this
      open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled, extension study in which they attended
      postoperative visits for up to 10 years following the date of implantation. Subjects could
      enroll in the study at any time, thus the Entrance Visit may have coincided with any visit
      (Year 4 to Year 10).
