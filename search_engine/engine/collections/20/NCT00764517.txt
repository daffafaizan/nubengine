      I. Determine objective response rates of the SCR regimen (vorinostat, cladribine, and
      rituximab) in B-cell malignancies.

      II. Determine the tolerability and toxicities of the SCR regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate progression free survival in patients treated with SCR. II. Estimate event free
      survival for patients treated with SCR. III. Determine the contribution (if any) of
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation/histone deacetylation to disease progression and/or
      response to SCR combination chemotherapy.

      IV. Perform scientific correlates to determine if SCR treatment a) is associated with global
      and gene specific changes in transcription of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)s and micro
      ribonucleic acid (MiRNA)s b) is acting as an inhibitor of DNA methylation c) is activating or
      silencing specific genes or miRNAs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) on days 1-14, cladribine intravenously (IV) over 2
      hours on days 1-5, and rituximab IV on day 3 (weekly for the first course). Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years and then every 6
      months thereafter.
