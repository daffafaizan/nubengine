      is to summarize individual cases, where Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has been applied during
      pharmaceutical care. Health-related data of patients experiencing therapy failure (TF) or
      adverse drug reaction (ADR) is collected and will then be supplemented with pharmacogenetic
      testing during pharmaceutical care in a study pharmacy. The patient data (diagnoses,
      medications and results of pharmacogenetic testing) is harmonized in order to generate a
      compilation of case reports. The primary objective is the compilation of case reports, where
      pharmacogenetic testing is applied to determine the hereditable component of the patient's
      susceptibility to experience therapy failure and/or adverse drug reactions. The experience
      with the compiled cases will be basis for the development of a reliable standard of procedure
      for pharmacogenetic testing in the community pharmacy. The cases will be supplemented with
      information on additional Parameters reported in the literature to affect efficacy or safety
      of the respective drug.
