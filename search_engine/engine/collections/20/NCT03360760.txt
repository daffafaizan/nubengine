      nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of pelvis and sacrum have included surgery with adjuvant
      chemotherapy. Pre-surgical chemotherapy has been advocated for these patients because of
      putative improvement in event-free survival (EFS). The advantages of pre-surgical
      chemotherapy include early administration of systemic chemotherapy, shrinkage of primary
      tumor, and pathologic identification of risk groups. The theoretic disadvantage is that it
      exposes a large tumor burden to marginally effective chemotherapy, especially in the axial
      region. The contribution of chemotherapy and surgery timing has not been tested rigorously.
      To study the effect of the timing of surgery on outcome of patients with nonmetastatic
      osteosarcoma of pelvis and sacrum, we conducted multicenter randomized trial to determine
      whether chemotherapy administered before definitive resection of primary tumors improved EFS
      and overall survival compared with traditional resection of the primary tumor followed by
      adjuvant chemotherapy.
