    
      This is a Phase IV, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of continuous weekly versus
      weekly times three with one-week break nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin as
      first-line treatment in elderly subjects (â‰¥ 70 years old) with advanced non small cell lung
      cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for their advanced disease and are not
      candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. The primary study endpoint is the
      percentage of subjects with either peripheral neuropathy or myelosuppression adverse events.
      Patients will continue treatment until they develop progressive disease, unacceptable
      side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study, according to local standard of care.
      Patients will have radiographic evaluations every 6 weeks while on treatment.
