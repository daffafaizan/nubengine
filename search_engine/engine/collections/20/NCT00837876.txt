      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of sorafenib tosylate in combination with erlotinib
           hydrochloride in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen at 4
           months.

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the change in serum Ca 19-9 levels at baseline and at 8-week intervals.

        -  To evaluate the plasma proteomic profile at baseline and at 8 weeks to correlate with
           clinical parameters in order to identify potential prognostic or predictive markers.

        -  To analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms on DNA obtained from pretreatment blood
           samples to evaluate toxicity and response to erlotinib hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate once or twice daily and oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Serum samples are collected at baseline and at 8-week intervals to measure Ca 19-9 levels,
      and plasma and buffy coat samples are collected at baseline and at week 8 for proteomic
      assessment and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with response and
      toxicity to erlotinib hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
