      16-18 year olds experiencing emotional problems, in the form of one-day CBT-based workshops,
      delivered in schools. DISCOVER has been tested in schools and preliminary outcomes have shown
      to be positive. Given the lengthy waiting lists of some CAMHS services, the present study
      seeks to explore whether the DISCOVER programme can be implemented in clinic settings, with a
      broader age range of 15-18 year olds, with the aim of providing young people with some form
      of help, whilst they are awaiting more individualised treatment. Fifteen to eighteen year
      olds awaiting treatment for anxiety and/or depression will be recruited from local CAMHS
      waiting lists, and randomised to receive either the DISCOVER workshop, delivered in clinic
      (in addition to usual care), or to continue usual care. The study will assess the
      feasibility, acceptability and range of outcomes of DISCOVER in clinic settings.
