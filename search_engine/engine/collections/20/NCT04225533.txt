      mg/kg is safe and well tolerated in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) and associated with a reduction in the acute inflammatory response to STEMI, as
      measured as area-under-the-curve (AUC) for C reactive protein (CRP), the preferred
      inflammatory marker for cardiovascular risk prognostication.

      SP16 will be administered subcutaneously as this route has greater ease of administration
      than intravenous injection. A single dose administration has been selected based upon
      pre-clinical data and expected clinical use of SP16.
