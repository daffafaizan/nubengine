      laryngoscopy and is the usual patient position preferred by most anaesthetists. In theory,
      neck flexion aligns the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes, and head extension at the
      atlanto-occipital joint aligns the oral axis with these two axes allowing the line of sight
      to fall on the glottis. It is recognized as the starting head position for direct
      laryngoscopy because it provides the best chance of adequate exposure.

      However the sniffing position does not guarantee adequate exposure in all patients because
      many other anatomical factors control the final degree of visualization.

      To achieve a proper sniffing position in obese patients, the "ramped" (or the back-up)
      position has been used as this produces better neck flexion and head extension in these
      patients when compared to the horizontal supine position. Also the forces required to elevate
      and move the tongue and other tissues out of the line of sight are less when the patients are
      ramped.

      Our hypothesis is that the view of the glottis may be improved by putting all (ie not only
      obese) patients requiring intubation in the ramped or back up position while maintaining the
      classic sniffing position.
