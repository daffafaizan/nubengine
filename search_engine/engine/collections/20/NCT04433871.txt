      of a new coronavirus called "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2),
      which is responsible for an infectious disease mainly with respiratory manifestation and
      potently severe or even lethal, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (N. Zhu et al.
      2020; Huang et al. 2020). The global spread of this virus led to the development of an
      unprecedented pandemic with an huge impact on public health and from a social and economic
      point of view (Ayittey et al. 2020).

      First published data mainly concerned the adult population with a detailed COVID-19 clinical
      description. Few data are available in children. However, the first studies suggest that
      children may be at a lower risk than adults of developing a severe form of COVID-19 (Guan et
      al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020; Sinha et al. 2020). Neonatal presentation may be more severe (H.
      Zhu et al. 2020). Children seem to present with similar symptoms compared with adults but
      often with a milder form (Cao et al. 2020). Radiological findings also appear to be similar
      to those in adults (Liu et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2020). Children may be asymptomatic and may
      participate in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al. 2020; Chan et al. 2020). Nevertheless,
      severe COVID-19 forms were described in children, even if deaths remain extremely rare (Sun
      et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020). Among the previous described severe forms, one of the patient
      dependent on mechanic ventilation had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Sun et al. 2020). The
      publication of Lu et al. probably refers to this patient and it appears that this patient was
      receiving a maintenance treatment (Lu et al. 2020). This patient presented a co-infection
      with influenza virus, which probably explained his aggravation (Sun et al. 2020).

      To describe COVID-19 presentation in children, adolescent and young adults, this study will
      include all patients with the following criteria:

      - Patient followed-up in any French pediatric oncology and hematology center for a cancer or
      a benign tumor treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a targeted therapy and with an
      oncologic treatment ongoing or terminated within the last 6 months, or with an hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation history with an immunosuppressive treatment ongoing or terminated
      within the last 6 months, or a CAR-T cell therapy history

      AND

      - PCR or serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection

      OR

      -Clinical and radiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the following criteria : At
      least two of the following signs (three if no history of contact with an individual with a
      confirmed COVID-19): fever, cough, loss of smell, loss of taste, myalgia, chest pain, breath
      shortness, rhinorrhea, acute respiratory signs, diarrhea, headache, recent lethargy, skin
      rash.

      AND

      - At least one abnormality compatible with COVID-19 on a chest computed tomography scan.

      In all included patients, the following informations will be retrieved from their medical
      record :

        -  socio-demographic and anthropometric data: age, sex, weight, height...

        -  cancer history: type of cancer, severity, ongoing or 30-days past oncologic treatment,
           significant oncologic treatment with potent impact on COVID-19 evolution (lung surgery,
           lung radiotherapy...)

        -  clinical symptoms at initial stage, at 10-15, 15-20, 20-30 days of evolution

        -  biological signs at initial stage, at 10-15, 15-20, 20-30 days of evolution

        -  radiological signs at initial stage and on the following exams

        -  COVID-19 management data: oxygen, antiviral agents, antibiotics...

        -  Evolutive data: resolution/aggravation of infection, potent sequelae...
