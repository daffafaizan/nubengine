      photoacoustic images and functional data (oxygen contents, blood vessel characteristics, etc)
      of the uterine lining to assess its appearance in women with and without cancer of the
      endometrium. Currently, it is difficult for physicians to know whether or not tumors of the
      endometrium have invaded and spread to other organs without performing an extended surgery
      called a staging operation (removal of the lymph nodes or glands that drain the uterus to
      assess under the microscope whether or not the cancer has spread). Our long term goal is to
      use this new photoacoustic (PA) technology to improve detection of occult metastatic disease.
      Occult disease is defined as tumor which cannot be seen without the use of imaging
      techniques. and possibly avoid the need of extended operations. All of this could result in
      better care for patients with endometrial cancer and other gynecologic problems.
