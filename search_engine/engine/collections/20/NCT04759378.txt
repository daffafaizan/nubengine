      functional disorder. Its prevalence in the population is 9.8%-12.8%. Its frequency in women
      is more than men. In some studies, it has been shown that a patient may have an overlap of
      symptoms of different functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Different
      researchers have ambiguously assessed the frequency of occurrence of esophageal disorders in
      patients with IBS. So, based on the publications of different authors, they are found in
      15-80% of cases. In a study by N. de Bortoli et al. (2016) noted the association of IBS with
      functional heartburn in 77% of cases, and with GERD and hypersensitive esophagus (called
      heartburn associated with reflux) - in 33% of cases.

      Traditionally, diagnostics of a combination of functional disorders of the esophagus and
      intestines were based on data X-ray and endoscopic methods. However modern research has shown
      the importance of using in this group of patients with daily combined pH impedance
      measurement. Thus, many authors have noted the undoubted advantages of this method in the
      diagnosis of esophageal disorders. Unfortunately, works devoted to this topic, extremely few
      in number, and the information obtained in them is quite contradictory, which indicates the
      need to continue research in this direction.
