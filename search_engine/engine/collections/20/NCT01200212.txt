    
      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer
      after treatment with taxane plus bevacizumab with (TXB) or without capecitabine (TB).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To determine the objective response rate in both arms.

        -  To determine the duration of response in both arms.

        -  To determine the Time to Progression (TTP) in both arms.

        -  To determine the clinical benefit defined as CR, PR, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks in
           both arms.

        -  To determine the overall survival rate 3 years after "Last Patient In".

        -  To determine PFS and TTP response rates in patient's ≥ age 65.

        -  To determine the toxicity and compliance in both arms.

        -  To determine the predictive value of serum markers such as VEGF.
