    
      The primary objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate a novel intervention of induced
      positive affect and induced self-affirmation to increase physical activity in patients with
      asthma. At the start of the trial all patients in conjunction with their physicians will
      select a program of mild to moderate physical activity or exercise to be adopted and
      maintained on a routine basis. All patients will record perceived exertion and pedometer
      measurements in a log diary. All patients will be contacted by telephone at set time
      intervals to encourage them to continue their selected physical activity or exercise.
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will also receive induced positive affect and
      self-affirmation throughout the study period. Patients in the control arm will not receive
      the positive affect and self-affirmation components.
