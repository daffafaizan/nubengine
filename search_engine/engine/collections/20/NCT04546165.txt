      pain is markedly more common in individuals with TTH compared with the control population
      (88.4%, and 56.7%, respectively). Therefore, current research on the pathogenesis of TTH
      focuses on the role of musculoskeletal disorders in the cervical spine and the facilitation
      of nociceptive pain processing. It has been suggested that peripheral sensitivity of
      nociceptors in cranio-cervical muscles and other cervical structures, as well as sensitivity
      of nociceptive pain pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) due to long-term nociceptive
      stimuli may play a role in development and chronification of TTH
