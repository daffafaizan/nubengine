    
      AS is a chronic inflammatory disease that eventually causes the affected vertebrae to fuse or
      grow together. The cause of AS is unknown, but genetic factors seem to play a role. Risk
      factors include a family history of ankylosing spondylitis and male gender.

      This study will collect patient information and blood samples from affected patients (and
      when available, both parents of the affected patients) of 400 families with children
      fulfillling the modified New York criteria for AS. Diagnosis of AS will be verified by
      patient questionnaire, medical record review, and pelvic radiographs. Information from these
      patients will be used to search the human genome for disease-associated loci and/or genes.
      This study will also utilize contributions of investigators who have conducted recent
      clinical or genetic research in AS at 10 academic medical centers throughout North America
      (the North American Spondylitis Consortium, or NASC).
