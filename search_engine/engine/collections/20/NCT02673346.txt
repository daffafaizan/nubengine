    
      All employees at YKHC will be invited to complete an online survey that took approximately
      10-15 minutes to complete. All employees will receive information via email, which includes
      an overview of the project, information regarding privacy and consent, and a link to the
      survey. Those who wish to do so were able to print a copy of the information for their
      reference. Employees who wish to participate did so by clicking on the survey link. Those who
      do not wish to participate could simply delete the email. Participants will be given two
      weeks to complete the online survey. Individuals who do not respond within the first week,
      will be sent an automated email reminder. All employees who participate will received a small
      incentive (approximately $10 in value).
