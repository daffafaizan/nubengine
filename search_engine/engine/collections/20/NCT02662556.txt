      surgical procedure.

      Upon meeting all entrance criteria, patients will be administered the first dose of ST 30 mcg
      and will remain in the study for up to 12 hours for safety and efficacy measurements.
      Patients may receive additional doses of ST 30 mcg as needed for pain management, but no more
      frequently than every 60 minutes.
