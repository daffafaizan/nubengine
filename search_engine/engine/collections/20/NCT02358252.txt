      predict patients occurring dizziness during the tilt table test, this study utilized a
      self-developed integrated intelligent biosensor system to assist clinical staff efficiently
      and immediately assessing stroke patients with orthostatic hypotension. Further purposes were
      to survey the relationship between the orthostatic hypotension and heart rate variability
      (HRV) and find the predicted models of orthostatic hypotension.
