      patients with AML, these treatments are very toxic and not available to all AML patients or
      only useful for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Also, there is essentially no treatment
      for patients with refractory or relapsed AML outside of bone marrow transplant. Accordingly,
      there is a great medical need for a safe and effective therapy for AML, especially refractory
      and relapsed AML. Also, although hypomethylating agents have been found to be effective
      against MDS, these agents are toxic. Furthermore, after relapsing from a hypomethylating
      agent, there is no treatment for this disease.

      A nearly completed clinical trial of CPI-613 (Cornerstone Study# CL-CPI-613-009 or Wake
      Forest Study# CCCWFU 29109, under IND# 107,800) shows that CPI-613 is well tolerated at doses
      as high as 3,000 mg/m2. Results from this nearly completed trial also suggest that CPI- 613
      may be effective against refractory and relapsed AML, as well as against MDS that is relapsed
      from a hypomethylating agent. Therefore, CPI-613 may be a suitable treatment option for
      refractory/relapsed AML and MDS relapsed from a hypomethylating agent. The promising
      preliminary efficacy data from Study# CL-CPI-613-009 (Wake Forest Study# CCCWFU 29109, under
      IND# 107,800) is the basis on which Cornerstone is conducting the current Phase 2a trial to
      further assess the efficacy of CPI-613 against these diseases.
