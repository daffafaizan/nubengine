      Gastric cancer has been in the top-5 of cancer-related death worldwide. Early detection by
      screening program in high risk patients is very important. If we can detect pre-malignant
      lesion eg. gastric intestinal metaplasia, we can provide the appropriate surveillance program
      to those patients. However, the screening protocol for gastric intestinal metaplasia remained
      unclear. Recently in July 2019, British Society of Gastroenterology published the guideline
      on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. The
      image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) is recommended as the best modality for assessing gastric
      intestinal metaplasia. Additionally, they recommended taking biopsy by using Sydney protocol
      which means taking biopsy at two areas for antrum, two areas for body and one for incisura
      although they look normal. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of this protocol for
      extensive gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) diagnosis in this study.

      Methodology:

        -  All patients with history of GIM will be enrolled and undergone standard with white
           light esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

        -  Those with suspected lesions of GIM will proceed to narrow band imaging (NBI)-mode
           endoscopy.

        -  Targeted biopsy will be done at the suspected GIM lesions. Random biopsy will be while
           will be done if no suspicious GIM lesion seen.

      Data collection:

      All data will be processed and recorded by one physician.
