      called "Raskere tilbake prosjekt". Helse Sør-Øst was invited to establish projects within
      their health care system, and the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at
      Sykehuset Innlandet HF was assigned the task to constitute an outpatient-clinic for
      musculoskeletal diseases.

      This initiative opened possibilities to explore new strategies based on science and own
      clinical experience to help these patients back to work without being confined to the
      traditional diagnose related examination and treatment offered in most clinics. In this
      project the main focus is directed towards work and barriers for working life. Because
      sickness absence often is multicausal and needs a bio-psycho-social approach, this should be
      reflected in the composition of the treatment team.

      There is a great demand to make out how complex bio-psycho-social problems can be solved,
      organized, implemented, and have economic gains for the society. To answer these questions we
      need randomized controlled clinical studies, and we need documentation when new treatment
      models are offered to this group of patients.
