    
      Patients with chronic venous disease causing pain or ache satisfying the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be randomised into two groups, active stockings (18-21 mmHg) or
      placebo stockings. The primary outcome of the study (pain/ache scored using a visual analogue
      scale) and a number of secondary symptoms, signs and rVCSS (revised Venous Clinical Severity
      Score) will be obtained at baseline and after one week of wearing the active or placebo
      stocking.
