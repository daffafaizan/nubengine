    
      In this 4-year cohort study, a total of 120 patients with stage III-IV head and neck cancer
      (squamous cell carcinoma) patient undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy will be enrolled.
      Laboratory examination will be performed to evaluate the physiological change and treatment
      related toxicity, including BUN and Cr for hydration and renal function; complete blood cell
      and differential count, pre-albumin and albumin for nutrition, and C-reactive protein for
      inflammatory change. Both CT and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to
      evaluate total body composition. CT is used to evaluate surface area of fat and muscle, and
      DXA is used to evaluate lean body mass, fat body mass and bone mineral content. MRI of the
      head and neck region is used for tumor staging of the head and neck cancer, monitoring the
      treatment response and detecting treatment related adverse effect.
