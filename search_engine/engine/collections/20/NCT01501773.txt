      intravenous autologous bone marrow derived stem cell/mononuclear cells(BMMC arm); and second
      control arm. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke between 7-30 days after onset with moderae
      severity in sable condition will be entered into the study after informed consent. Both arms
      will receive standard treatment but BMMC arm will,in addition,have bone marrow aspiration and
      receive autologous 30-500 million bone marrow mononuclear cells intravenously on the day of
      randomisation and all patients will be followed at DaY 7 Â± days, Day 90(-7 days to +14 days),
      Day 180(-7 days to +28 days)and Day 365 (-7 days to + 28 days). A number of safety and
      efficacy variables will be measured. This phase 2 study will aim to determine dose response
      gradient of stem cell therapy and to explore if results have a favourable risk to benefit
      ratio to justify a phase 3 study. This will be the first human trial to determine and compare
      favourable and unfavourable effects of bone marrow mononuclear cells(mainly CD34) in acute
      ischamic stroke and also the first multi-centric study with potential to achieve a reasonable
      sample size in a relatively short time.
