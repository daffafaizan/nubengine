      between BU exposure and post-transplant clinical results (efficacy and safety) to establish
      the optimal BU treatment window for myeloablative conditioning in Chinese pediatrics, provide
      theoretical basis and the new strategy for BU individualized dosage, further optimize
      transplant treatment and reduce drug-related toxicity.

      Endpoint primary The main study endpoints are event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival
      (OS). EFS is calculated from the time of transplant until death, relapse of disease, or graft
      failure (defined as non-engraftment or rejection), whichever occurred first. OS is the time
      between transplantation and death of any cause. All surviving patients are censored at day of
      last contact. Duration of follow-up is the time from transplant to the last assessment for
      surviving patients or death.

      Secondary The investigators are also interested in transplantation-related mortality (TRM),
      acute toxicity and chronic GvHD. TRM is defined as death unrelated to underlying disease.
      Acute toxicities are defined as VOD (diagnosed according to modified Seattle criteria), acute
      GvHD grade II-IV (diagnosed and graded according to Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International
      Consortium (MAGIC) criteria, oral mucositis (grade II-IV) and hemorrhagic cystitis (grade
      II-IV). Two of the most commonly utilised scales for oral mucositis are the WHO and NCI-CTCAE
      scales. Chronic GvHD should be graded as mild, moderate or severe according to the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria.
