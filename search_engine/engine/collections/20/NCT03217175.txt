      outpatient run-in period prior to their exercise visit wearing the bi-hormonal bionic
      pancreas. This will allow the bionic pancreas to adapt to their diabetes management needs.
      After the run-in period is complete, the subjects will participate in an exercise visit
      during which they will arrive fasting and remain fasted until the visit is completed.
      Subjects will walk on a treadmill for up to 1 hour at a comfortable walking pace. Plasma
      glucose (PG) measurements will be performed frequently. In one experimental period the bionic
      pancreas will remain in the bihormonal configuration and will deliver glucagon as needed
      during the exercise visit. In the other experimental period the glucagon will be replaced
      with a placebo during the exercise visit. The two experimental periods will be performed in
      random order. The study will be performed in single-blind fashion in that the participant
      will not know whether the bionic pancreas glucagon pump is filled with glucagon or placebo
      during the exercise visits. The outpatient run-in period will always be with the bi-hormonal
      bionic pancreas delivering glucagon.
