      consume control biscuits or biscuits supplemented with soy fiber for 12 wk (approximately
      100g/d). Information on body weight, body mass index, waist/hip circumference, blood pressure
      as well as measures of lipoprotein, glucose concentrations, and HbA1c was obtained at
      baseline, 8 and 12 wk after intervention. Body composition was also assessed at baseline and
      wk 12, respectively.
