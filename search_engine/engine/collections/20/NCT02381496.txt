    
      Part A of this study is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      single-ascending dose (SAD) design in healthy male subjects. In each cohort, eight subjects
      will be randomized as follows:

        -  Six male subjects will receive a single oral dose of ACT-453859, under fasted
           conditions.

        -  Two male subjects will receive matching placebo, under fasted conditions.

      The doses of ACT-453859 were 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 800 mg. Subjects in only one cohort
      (100 mg dose cohort) will come back for a second period of treatment under fed conditions.

      Part B is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending
      dose (MAD) design in healthy male and female of subjects.

      In each of 3 cohorts, eight subjects will be randomized to receive multiple doses of
      ACT-453859 or placebo once a day for 7 days as follows:

        -  Three male subjects will receive ACT-453859.

        -  Three female subjects will receive ACT-453859.

        -  One male subject will receive matching placebo.

        -  One female subject will receive matching placebo.

      The doses of ACT-453859 will be 10, 100, and 800 mg per day.

      Part C is a single-center and open-label design consisting of multiple oral doses of
      setipiprant given in a sequential design in healthy male and female subjects.

      Eight subjects will be randomized to receive multiple doses of setipiprant for 7 days (only a
      single dose on Day 7), in Treatment Period I (TPI) and Treatment Period II (TPII), as
      follows:

        -  Four male subjects will receive setipiprant 500 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) in TPI and 1000
           mg b.i.d. in TPII.

        -  Four female subjects will receive setipiprant 500 mg b.i.d. in TPI and 1000 mg b.i.d. in
           TPII.
