      and mitral valve area . Evaluation of mitral valve area with transthoracic echocardiography
      maintains rapid, accurate analysis of valve disease and serves as a practical gold standard
      for clinical evaluation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is a recently used method
      that allows to evaluate cardiac structures and function noninvasively. Direct visualization
      of valve area with CMRI is also possible and it has been shown that the valve area assessed
      by CMRI planimetry correlates reliably with the invasive assessment. Velocity-encoded cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging can be used to quantify mitral valve area. The objective of this
      study was to evaluate mitral valve area with CMRI and compare it with echocardiographic
      methods including 2D planimetry, Doppler continuation equation and Doppler pressure half-time
