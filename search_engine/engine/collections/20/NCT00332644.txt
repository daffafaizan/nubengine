      smoking cessation medications (bupropion, nicotine patch, and nicotine lozenge), including
      medications used in combination. The results of this study may allow researchers and
      clinicians to decide which medications are best for helping people to quit smoking as well as
      what treatments work best for different people. In addition, the first year of this study may
      help to clarify how these medications work.The purpose of the second and third years of this
      research study will be to get long-term results on the physical health, mental health,
      lifestyle factors, and the overall quality of life of people attempting to quit smoking. The
      results of this study may help researchers and clinicians better understand the health
      improvements that come from quitting or not quitting smoking.
