      participant feedback for individual messages and progress towards health goals to deliver
      increasingly personalized positive psychology (PP) and health behavior text messages over

      efficacy in a randomized, controlled pilot trial in 60 adults with two or more cardiac risk
      conditions (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).
