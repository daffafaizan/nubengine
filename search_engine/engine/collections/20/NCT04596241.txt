      in subcutaneous fat tissue and muscle tissue of arms. The study is a prospective multi-center
      open-label single-arm study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a single study
      group. Subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and two follow-up
      visits. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject device.

      At the baseline visit, MRI imaging will be performed; the subject's weight and arm
      circumference will be recorded. Photos of the treated area will be taken.

      The treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments, delivered 5-10 days
      apart. The applicator of BTL-899 will be applied over the treatment area. The device will
      induce visible muscle contractions along with heating of the subcutaneous fat. Each therapy
      session will last 30 minutes.

      At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight and arm circumference will be recorded, and
      photos of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will receive a Subject
      Satisfaction Questionnaire to fill in.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE), including the subject's
      experience of pain or discomfort after each procedure. Following each treatment
      administration and at all of the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate
      post-procedure adverse event assessment.

      During the post-procedure visits (at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits), the subjects will
      undergo a MRI imaging. Also, the subject's satisfaction will be noted, and weight with arm
      circumference will be recorded. Photographs of the treated area will be taken. In addition,
      subjects will receive a Lifestyle Change Questionnaire to fill in.
