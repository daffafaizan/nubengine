      perioperative hemodynamic targets according to individual physiological status and may be
      managed by computer-based algorithms.

      By identifying incoherence between macro- and microcirculation, we could elaborate the idea
      of an individualized fluid and vasopressor therapy by establishing optimal hemodynamics for
      any given patient.

      Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for obstruction or perforation of the
      gastrointestinal tract are at a high risk for complications.

      Often suffering from hypovolemia/septicemia and low flow states, effecting the central and
      peripheral perfusion. this patient group frequently receives vasoconstrictors as part of the
      resuscitation strategy and are as such an ideal group in which to study perioperative
      microcirculation and diagnostic changes in the intravascular system.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the microcirculation and to determine possible
      correlation of central and peripheral measures of tissue perfusion in patients with
      intraoperative hemodynamic challenges undergoing emergency laparotomy.
