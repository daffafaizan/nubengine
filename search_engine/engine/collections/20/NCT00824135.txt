      in combination with thiotepa and melphalan as a conditioning regimen for a haploidentical
      stem cell transplant with an engineered graft depleted of CD3+ cells. Study participants will
      children and young adults with refractory hematologic malignancies.

      Secondary objectives include the following:

        -  To describe the one-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates in
           these study participants.

        -  To determine the time to hematopoietic recovery and donor cell engraftment following
           this study treatment.

        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse in study participants.

        -  To estimate the incidence of overall grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD and the
           rate of chronic GVHD.

        -  To estimate the incidence and describe the causes of non-hematologic regimen-related
           toxicity and regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post HSCT.

        -  To explore the biologic significance of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, tumor
           necrosis factor (TNF), and lymphocyte reconstitution (qualitative and quantitative, V
