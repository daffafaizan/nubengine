      nerve fiber layer by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients following pars
      plana vitrectomy.

      The study will include 60 patients with a temporary silicone oil tamponade who will be
      surgically treated with pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and
      proliferative vitreoretinopathy. All subjects will be subdued to complete ophthalmologic
      examinations, measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness by an OCT examination,
      tests of the visual field with the use of an Octopus computed perimeter (automated static
      perimetry) and FDT-perimetry - both prior to the surgery, and on control visits for check-up
      during the postoperative period.

      All results provided by postoperative examinations will be compared with one another.

      The study is expected to provide data on the effect of the silicone oil on thickness of the
      retinal nerve fiber layer. It is also planned to show possibilities and advantages of OCT as
      a method of choice in the follow-up of patients with intraocular silicone oil tamponade.
