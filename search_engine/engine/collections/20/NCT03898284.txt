      current definition of disease progression (fast decline in lung function) in idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis. There is a need for techniques allowing to characterize disease
      progression earlier, so that treatment may be adapted as early as possible in the lack of a
      response.

      Hypothesis. Our hypothesis is that 3-month changes of lung function parameters measured by a
      novel technique, impulse oscillometry, predicts 6-month changes in forced vital capacity in
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
