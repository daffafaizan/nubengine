      with SA-AKI have a high mortality and morbidity and are at risk of developing chronic kidney
      disease. AP is a homodimeric endogenous enzyme present in many cells and organs, e.g.,
      intestines, placenta, liver, bone, kidney, and granulocytes. It exerts detoxifying effects
      through dephosphorylation of endotoxins; pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules
      (PAMPS e.g., lipopolysaccharide) and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS
      e.g., adenosine tri- and di-phosphate). In animal models of sepsis and AKI, administration of
      AP attenuates the inflammatory response, improves renal function and/or reduces mortality.

      AM-Pharma B.V. is developing AP as a novel, recombinant chimeric human AP medicinal product,
      called recAP, to be used as an intravenous infusion for the treatment of SA-AKI. In the Phase
      2 trial STOP-AKI, a survival benefit was observed in the two highest dose groups, 0.8 mg/kg
      and 1.6 mg/kg groups, compared to the placebo group. There were no safety or tolerability
      concerns for any of the doses tested (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg). The 1.6 mg/kg recAP dose was
      selected for this Phase 3 trial based on the significant survival benefit observed. PK/PD
      simulations also confirmed this dose to have the most pronounced treatment effect.

      The primary objective of this Phase 3 trial is to confirm the mortality benefit seen in
      STOP-AKI by demonstrating a reduction in 28 day all cause mortality in patients with SA-AKI
      treated with 1.6 mg/kg recAP.
