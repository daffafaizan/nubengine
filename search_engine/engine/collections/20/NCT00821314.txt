      perception of symptoms exist, and whether the patient's 'everyday' symptoms are reproduced
      during objective studies, when the results are reported. The principle aim of urodynamics is
      to reproduce a patient's symptoms and to provide a patho physiological explanation for them.
      The purposes of this study is to evaluate whether there is a relation between the position
      (sitting/standing up vs supine position) and the bladder sensations in both healthy
      volunteers and patients with OAB. Furthermore we would like to study patient perception of
      bladder condition and bladder filling and volumes voided as well as the functional and
      maximal bladder capacity in patients with OAB.

      Because patients with pelvic floor dysfunction have widely varying expectations from
      treatment, the patient's goal for treatment is highly subjective. Therefore, strategies for
      assessing OAB should incorporate self-perceived disease condition.
