      proportion of participants will not experience an adequate response to topical steroids and
      continue to have some degree of discomfort. Sirolimus is a non-steroidal immunosuppressive
      medication that has demonstrated efficacy in the management of cGVHD. Based on this, it is
      believed that a topical formulation applied inside the mouth may also demonstrate efficacy on
      a localized basis.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of topical sirolimus as a
      swish and spit solution for the treatment of oral cGVHD in participants that have not had an
      adequate clinical response to topical steroid therapy alone.
