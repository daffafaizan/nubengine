      I. Facilitate studies aimed at investigating new prognostic markers and potentially
      therapeutic therapies in malignant melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at the time of the initial diagnostic work-up,
      and possibly prior to the initiation of surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation
      therapy, at tumor progression or recurrence, and annually during routine follow-up (no more
      than 4 blood draws per year). Patients may also undergo collection of tissue sample during
      standard of care surgical or radiologic procedures. Healthy individuals undergo collection of
      blood samples up to 4 times over 1 year.
