      kinesio tape ends on top of each other, leaving the lateral epicondyle region exposed while
      the elbows are slightly flexed in the supine position. In the groups where different tensions
      will be applied, the middle points of the tapes will be stretched according to the amount of
      tensions, and the ends will be taped over each other without tension.In the placebo group,
      the tapes of the tapes will be applied tensionlessly without overlapping each other.
      Algometer will be used in the assessment of pressure pain threshold and pain tolerance. Pain
      severity felt at the level of pain threshold and pain tolerance will be evaluated with the
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All measurements will be made before taping, immediately after
      taping and 30 minutes after taping, will be repeated 3 times and their average values will be
      recorded. There will be a 60 second rest period between each trial to avoid temporal
      sensitization. Each assessment will be performed bilaterally by another physiotherapist who
      is blind to the band tension and has no experience with the kinesio banding technique.
