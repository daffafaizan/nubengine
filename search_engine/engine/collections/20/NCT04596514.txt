    
      This is a prospective, randomised, parallel group, multi-centre, phase II clinical trial.

      Patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to be included to the control group or the
      intervention group. The control group receives ACLS according to national guidelines, while
      the intervention group receives ACLS according to national guidelines and the REBOA procedure
      as an adjunct treatment.

      The REBOA procedure is performed by a team consisting of a physician (anesteshiologist) and a
      paramedic, working at a helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) base. All operators will
      be properly educated and tested before they can include patients.

      If the patients in the intervention group achieves ROSC, the balloon will be deflated and
      post-ROSC treatment will be continued as per routine.
