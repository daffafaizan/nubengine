      lignocaine 2%, with 1cc of adrenaline of 1:200,000 (which will be prepared by adding 1cc of
      adrenaline of 1:1000 conc. with 200ml of normal saline marked as solution "A" and without
      adrenaline marked as solution "B" to form the two different tumescent solutions. Both
      solutions with be topically applied in soaked gauzes for around 10 minutes. Solution A will
      be applied over the anterior side of thigh while solution B will be applied over lateral side
      of thigh.

      Tumescent solutions will be prepared around 10 minutes before applying. After 10 min
      Split-thickness skin graft donor sites will be harvested with a Dermatome adjusted on with a
      randomized setting to harvest a fixed depth of wound depth. After harvesting skin graft the
      donor site wound will be photographed.

      The apparent severity of bleeding will be scored on an ordinal scale from 0 to 5 (0=no
      bleeding/staining, 1=minimal bleeding/staining, 2=mild bleeding/staining, 3=moderate
      bleeding/staining, 4=moderately severe bleeding/staining, 5=severe bleeding/staining by two
      independent surgeons. At last photographs will be compared with pre-infiltration records in
      each side. Skin graft donor and recipient site will be inspected on the 5th post-operative
      day
