    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-treated hematopoietic
      stem progenitor cells (HSPC) (lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic
      progenitor cells) transplantation in AIDS patients completing treatment for non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of HIV infection on the presence of gene-marked blood cells as
      measured by woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed before, during, and after ATI.

      II. To demonstrate the engraftment of gene-modified progeny cells following such treatment.

      III. To determine if selection of these gene-modified progeny cells occurs during analytical
      treatment interruption (ATI) of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5; rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on day 1; etoposide, doxorubicin hydrochloride and vincristine sulfate IV
      over 96 hours on days 1-4; and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 5. Patients then
      receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) beginning on day 6 and continuing
      until absolute neutrophil count recovers. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients then receive lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells IV on day 0 (48 hours after the final combination chemotherapy course).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and
      24 months, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 10 years.
