      UltheraÂ® System for improving laxity/crepiness and texture of abdominal tissue. Changes from
      baseline in the laxity, crepiness and texture of abdominal skin will be assessed at each
      study follow-up visit. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, assessments of dermal
      thickness, and patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.
