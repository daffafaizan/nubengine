      to offer a unique intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training of the arm. The goal
      is to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is
      meaningful for the individual patient. The study objective is to compare ARMin therapy and a
      form of conventional occupational therapy that involves both arms regarding change in motor
      function.
