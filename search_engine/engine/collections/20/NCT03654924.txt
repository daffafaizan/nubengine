      unobstructed airway and provides a reliable seal from bleeding and surgical debris. However,
      there have been few studies of the integrity of the LMA seal during intraoperative surgical
      manipulation with the use of the LMA.

      In general anesthesia using LMA, airway and esophagus cannot be separated completely.
      Insufficient airway seal become the risk of aspiration in airway management. This study will
      focus on airway seal following LMA use in dental surgery.
