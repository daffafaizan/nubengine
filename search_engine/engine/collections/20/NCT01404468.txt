      and burning, and also for minor surgery.However,its application via this conductive
      method,has been confined to surface anaesthesia because it seems that it is not possible to
      have a deep transmission with local drug massage, without injection or systematic
      administration.On the other hand,the injection of lidocaine can lead to tissue injury and
      pain,and its use is not advised in children. Phonophoresis is one of the common procedures
      for reducing these problems. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to compare the two
      modes of therapeutic ultrasound by assessing the effect of lidocaine gel phonophoresis on
      percutaneous absorption and sensory blockade.
