      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
      for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presenting during admission
      with clinical and laboratory data suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome with the
      objective to investigate whether the use of immunosuppressive drugs (including high-dose
      steroids, tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakimra) or immunoglobulins in avoiding the need for
      invasive mechanical ventilation or in-hospital death.

      The Ethics Committee for Research of Virgen Macarena and Virgen del Roc√≠o University
      Hospitals approved the study and waived the need to obtain informed consent.

      The data source was the electronic medical records. All data were entered directly by
      personnel at each institution using an online case report form (CRF), that satisfied local
      requirements of data confidentiality.

      The variables registered included administrative data, epidemiological information, type of
      clinical specimen in which the diagnosis was confirmed, demographics, comorbidities and
      current medications, signs and symptoms at admission, baseline laboratory tests results and
      at day 0, chest X-ray findings at baseline and during follow-up, medications with potential
      activity against COVID-19, supportive treatments including oxygen therapy, use of
      immunosuppressant medications or immunoglobulins, and outcome.
