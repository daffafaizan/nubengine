      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and seek total knee
      arthroplasties at a reduced rate, thus conservative treatments are needed. Prevalence of knee
      OA among the older HA population is rising dramatically. There is moderate evidence that
      lower extremity strengthening, manual therapy and self-management training improve pain and
      physical performance in people with knee OA and little evidence in the HA population. We
      conducted a pilot prospective trial implementing a multimodal high intensity targeted
      strength training, manual therapy and self-management education intervention to evaluate
      feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherence and preliminary estimates of change on
      physical performance and health related quality of life (HrQOL) in HAs with moderate knee OA.
      If this trial is feasible and shows promise for efficacy, it may warrant further testing as a
      primary treatment for knee OA.

      Methods: Spanish speaking older adults will be recruited from Kaiser Permanente San Francisco
      through a medical record search. Participants will attended 10 physical thearpy clinic visits
      over 8 weeks, followed by 4 weekly phone calls to assess adherence to exercise via 1-week
      verbal recall. Participants will be instructed to exercise 3 days per week for the study
      duration combining both clinic and home exercise participation. The intervention is led in
      Spanish and will include progressive open and closed-chain quadriceps and gluteal
      strengthening, progressive cycling training with short power intervals, manual therapy and
      self-management training.
