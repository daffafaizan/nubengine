      transplantation in children. However, no pharmacokinetic study has thus far been conducted in
      pediatric patients. Fludarabine can cause adverse reactions which include neurotoxicity,
      damage to lungs. Pharmacokinetic study is critical to predict the safety of fludarabine in
      pediatric patients.

      Through an individualized pharmacokinetic study (which entails numerous samplings) of
      fludarabine in pediatric patients, this study aims to develop a sampling-minimized analysis
      method and study the population pharmacokinetics.

      Through a pharmacokinetic analysis, we aim to evaluate whether pediatric patients show
      similar population pharmacokinetics of adults, for whom fludarabine is authorized, and
      evaluate the safety (toxicity) and efficacy (event free survival).
