      ability for prognostic value in patients with DLBCL. PET/ CT scans evaluation using the liver
      SUVmax as reference. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than
      the threshold or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. 18F-FDG PET/CT-based prognostic model includes
      PET/CT image, dominant clinical and pathological prognostic factors to predicting disease
      progression during chemotherapy or survival in NK/T-cell lymphoma.
