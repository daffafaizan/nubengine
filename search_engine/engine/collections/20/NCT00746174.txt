      tolerance test. Participants will be treated in a community-based practice setting and will
      receive detailed instruction on diet and glucose self-monitoring. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to treatment with 4 mg daily of Rosiglitazone or placebo. They will return
      to the clinic after 4 weeks to monitor changes in glucose levels, HbA1c and liver enzymes.
      The drug dose will be increased as indicated to 8 mg daily and the patients will be
      reevaluated every 4 weeks. The participants will all be admitted to the General Clinical
      Research Center at UT-Southwestern Medical Center at the end of 16 weeks to measure changes
      in the following primary endpoints: 1) insulin sensitivity, 2) lipid content of heart, liver,
      and skeletal muscle, 3) lipid oxidation. Additional noninvasive HMRS measurements will be
      made to quantify the muscle lipid content and respiratory gas exchange will be used to assess
      lipid oxidation. Following the GCRC admission, patients will switch to the alternative
      therapy for 16 additional weeks before the studies are repeated. We expect Rosiglitazone to
      improve insulin sensitivity in association with reduced muscle lipid content that may arise
      either from increased lipid oxidation or enhanced storage of fat in adipose tissue.
