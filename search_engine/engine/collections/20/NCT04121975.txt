      confirmed locally advanced cervical cancer were enrolled to receive the treatment of
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar. Radiotherapy was administered in 1.8-2.0
      Gy fractions 5 times weekly to a total dose of 45-50 Gy. Endostar (30 mg/d) was administered
      on days 1-5 every two weeks for 4 cycles. Cisplatin (30-40 mg/m2) was administered day 1, 8,
      15, 22 and 29. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year. The
      secondary endpoints were PFS, overall survival (OS) and safety.
