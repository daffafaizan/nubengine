    
      Four FDA-cleared junctional tourniquets (Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC), Abdominal Aortic and
      Junctional Tourniquet (AAJT), Junctional Emergency Treatment Tool (JETT), and SAM Junctional
      Tourniquet (SJT)) wereassessed in a laboratory on healthy human volunteers. Lower extremity
      pulses were measured in 10 volunteers before and after junctional tourniquet application
      aimed at stopping the distal pulse assessed by Doppler auscultation. Tourniquets were applied
      in a randomized fashion, with 5 min rest periods between each application. Each tourniquet
      was applied to each subject, such that the subjects acted as their own controls.
