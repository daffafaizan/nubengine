      circulation in humans with coronary endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis risk factors.
      Aim II: To assess the potential of chronic endothelin receptor antagonists to improve
      preexisting coronary endothelial dysfunction and myocardial perfusion in humans and Aim III:
      To assess the effect of chronic endothelin receptor antagonism on the endogenous nitric oxide
      system in association with oxidative stress in humans with early coronary disease risk
      factors.
