      n=72, 28 days) and ii) combination of tobramycin 0.3% - dexamethasone 0.1%, one drop qid,
      plus Ketorolac tromethamine 0.5%, one drop tid (TD-K group, n=73, 28 days). Patients
      undergoing vitrectomy due to posterior capsule rupture were excluded. On days 7, 14, 21, 28,
      the frequency of inflammation-related signs [corneal edema, conjunctival hyperemia, anterior
      chamber (Tyndall) reaction], as well as the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were
      measured. On day 21, logistic regression was performed to evaluate risk factors for
      inflammation.
