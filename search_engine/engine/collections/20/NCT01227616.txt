    
      This was a Phase IV, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial
      designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and frequency of use of ferumoxytol compared to
      iron sucrose for the episodic treatment of IDA in hemodialysis subjects with CKD over a
      1-year period. As part of this Main Study, an Oxidative Stress Substudy and an MRI Substudy
      were conducted. The Oxidative Stress Substudy, to be run concurrently with the initial TP of
      the Main Study, was to examine the varying degrees to which iron sucrose and ferumoxytol may
      or may not induce oxidative stress in vitro in subjects undergoing hemodialysis. The MRI
      Substudy, to be run concurrently with the Main Study and continue for an additional 11
      months, was to assess the potential for deposition of iron in cardiac, hepatic, and
      pancreatic tissues and changes in laboratory parameters over a 2-year period.
