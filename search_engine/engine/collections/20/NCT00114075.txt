      plans for children with gait abnormalities, particularly children with cerebral palsy.
      Previous studies have shown that gait analysis testing significantly impacts surgical
      decision-making for these patients. However, no controlled studies have been done to
      determine whether gait analysis and the subsequent changes in surgical decision-making affect
      clinical outcomes. Consequently, the use of gait analysis in clinical practice remains
      controversial. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      assess the effects of preoperative gait analysis on surgical outcomes in ambulatory children
      with cerebral palsy.

      information from gait analysis testing.
