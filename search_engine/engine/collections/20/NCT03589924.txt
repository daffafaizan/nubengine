      implant-based breast reconstruction have inconsistent results and investigators find that
      there is a lack of high quality evidence focusing on comparing one-stage and two-stage
      implant-based breast reconstruction with TiLoop速Bra.

      This study is the first prospective randomized study assessing the safety and
      patient-reported outcomes of immediate one-stage IBBR compared with those of two-stage IBBR
      with TiLoop速 Bra in breast cancer patients.

      The hypothesis is that one step method is not inferior to two step method in implant based
      breast reconstruction following skin-sparing and/or Nipple-sparing mastectomy using TiLoop速
      Bra.

      The current study is a randomized multicenter, open labeled, prospective, controlled study.

      Participants were enrolled at six hospitals in different places of China. All participants
      will undergo Skin Sparing Mastectomy(SSM)/Nipple Sparing Mastectomy(NSM) with one-stage or
      two stage IBBR with TiLoop速 Bra.

      Based on earlier experience, investigators calculated that the surgical complication rate was
      approximately 30 percent in the one-stage group and 25 percent in the two-stage group.
      Consider a dropout rate of 5%, a total of 450 patients, with 225 in each group, are needed.
