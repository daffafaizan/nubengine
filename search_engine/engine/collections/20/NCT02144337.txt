      levels of physical activity, are overweight or who lack confidence to take part in physical
      activity. The intervention involves an Activity Diary, circuit training, pedometer step
      counting, daily physical activity monitoring and goal setting to promote long-term increases
      in physical activity and its associated health benefits. This randomised single-centre
      feasibility study will test whether the STAK programme is feasible for children with T1DM, in
      terms of acceptability, attractiveness and compliance and a qualitative process evaluation
      will aid the assessment of feasibility.
