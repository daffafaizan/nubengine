      interface between the patient and the ventilator. NIV by positive pressure assistance
      involves ventilating the patient by means of a mask adjusted on the nose or covering the nose
      and mouth. This technique is now the recommended therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
      chronic alveolar hypoventilation. It improves survival and quality of life, and improves
      daytime blood gases in patients suffering form chronic restrictive respiratory failure.

      For each check-up (3 visits), patients will have a polysomnography, a complete respiratory
      function measurement (Flows and lung volumes, CO2 sensitivity test, SNIF test, blood gazes
      analysis), a test of endothelial function (peripheral arterial tone), a test of arterial
      stiffness (pulse wave velocity), an assessment of systemic inflammation (ultra sensitive CRP,
      TNFa, IL6), assessment of diurnal vigilance tests ( OSLER test and sleepiness scale) and
      assessment of metabolic and endocrinal function (insulinemia, glucose blood level, Leptin,
      DHEA).
