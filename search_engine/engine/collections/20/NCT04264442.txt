    
      This study is an open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      long-term dosing of Losmapimod in patients with FSHD1 who participated in the ReDux4 study.

      This study is a multi-center clinical trial. It will be conducted in North America, Canada
      and Europe. Only patients who participated and competed all study procedures in the ReDUX4
      Study treatment period will be eligible to participate in this open label extension study.

      Patients who complete the randomized, placebo-controlled portion of the study will have the
      option to roll over into the open-label extension study.

      Patients will receive 15 mg of losmapimod by mouth twice daily for a total of 30 mg by mouth
      daily. All patients will attend clinic visits approximately every 12 weeks and 7 days after
      the last dose of study drug for safety follow-up assessment.

      Participation in this open-label extension study will continue until losmapimod becomes
      commercially available, the patient withdraws from the study, or the Sponsor decides to close
      the study.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term
      dosing of losmapimod in patients with FSHD.
