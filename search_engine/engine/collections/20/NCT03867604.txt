      nodule and taut band of muscle or fascia. MPS was usually treated by dry needling or met
      needing, local anesthetics injection, to the trigger point. According to recent researches,
      dry and wet needling to affected muscle are effectiveness for short term and medium term pain
      relief. Although some researches indicated an increased viscosity at fascial layer in MPS and
      there are few studies of manipulation for fascial release. There is not study of injective
      fascial release.

      Investigators will include 40 patients with myofascial pain syndrome at upper trapezius.
      Participants will be randomized into 2 groups, fascia injection group and subcutaneous
      control injection group. Investigators will use algometer to measure pain threshold and peak
      pressure, measure the range of motion of neck and shoulder and assess the neck and shoulder
      function by questionnaire. The examination will be done before injection, immediately after
      injection, 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after injection.

      To our hypothesis, investigators suggest focal anesthetics injection could decrease the
      fascial viscosity and improved pain and quality of life.
