      past. A number of studies have assessed patients before and after breast reduction surgery
      using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments and found this to be an effective technique. A limited
      number of studies have been done in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer using
      these techniques. The main limitation of these existing studies is the lack of prospective
      measurements before surgery and through time, thus restricting the findings to isolated
      long-term outcomes. Additionally, no studies have compared patients undergoing mastectomy
      versus lumpectomy to determine the impact that surgical approach has on breast sensibility.
