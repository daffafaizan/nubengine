      Health England's (PHE) current free sugar reducing advice, for reducing total energy intakes
      (TEI) of free sugar. A total of 240 participants (age 18-65years) consuming diets >5% total
      energy intake from dietary free sugars will be recruited from across the Dorset region.
      Participants to be randomly assigned into the following recommendation interventions groups:
      1) Reduce free sugar intake to <5% TEI (nutrient-based recommendations); 2) Reduce free sugar
      intake to <5% TEI, via reducing intake of specific foods identified as high in free sugars
      (nutrient- + food-based recommendations); 3) Reduce free sugar intake to <5% TEI, via
      reducing intake of specific foods identified as high in free sugars and replace/swap with low
      sugar versions (nutrient- + food-based recommendations with swaps); and 4) Control Group. The
      primary outcome will be changes in free sugar consumption from baseline to endpoint at week
      12. Secondary outcomes include change in: BMI; dietary profiles; sweetness preference;
      sweetness liking; food choices; low calorie sweetener intakes and adherence levels.
