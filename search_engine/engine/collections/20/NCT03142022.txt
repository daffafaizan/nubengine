      obstructive) of SDB in patients after lung transplantation.

      Secondary research objectives are the evaluation of correlations between severity of SDB and
      clinical findings (weight, medical therapy, heart function, lung function, renal function,
      graft failure, â€¦). Furthermore, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between SDB
      and cardiovascular morbidity.
