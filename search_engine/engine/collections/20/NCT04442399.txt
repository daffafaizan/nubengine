      particularly pressing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the majority of the 2.1 million ALHIV
      reside. Highlighting the vulnerability of ALHIV is their increasing HIV-related mortality, up
      50% in 2012 compared to 2005, while the global number of HIV-related deaths among all ages
      decreased by 30%. In response to the disparate burden of HIV mortality among ALHIV, combined
      with the compelling evidence from HIV prevention and chronic illness literature and research
      on the influential role of families, the study team propose to refine and pilot test an
      ALHIV/caregiver group intervention. This intervention will draw upon principles of Positive
      Youth Development (PYD) and Social Cognitive theory (SCT) to emphasize skills building,
      self-efficacy, youth participation, and strengthening adult relationships. The intervention
      will build upon an existing ALHIV support group guide and utilize trained facilitators to
      hold group sessions with ALHIV and their caregivers to: 1) improve understanding of HIV among
      ALHIV and caregivers; 2) help ALHIV develop strategies for healthy living including adherence
      to ART; 3) build the capacity of ALHIV to make informed decisions about their sexual and
      reproductive health; 4) build the capacity of caregivers to support ALHIV; and 5) help ALHIV
      develop life skills to communicate their HIV diagnosis effectively, and to plan for their
      future. The study design has two phases. The first phase is the refinement of the
      ALHIV/caregiver intervention manual followed by a second phase feasibility pilot study. The
      Study goals are to refine and pilot a feasible intervention that fosters resiliency and draws
      upon the strengths of adolescents and their families. Specific aims include to: (1) Refine
      activities and an intervention manual for a family-focused group intervention for adolescents
      and their caregivers to improve HIV self-management among adolescents living with HIV; (2)
      conduct a pilot study to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the group intervention
      among 50 adolescent/caregiver pairs that are randomly assigned to the intervention or the
      comparison arms, and (sub aim 2a) examine preliminary trends in outcome measures, including
      ART adherence, safer sex behaviors and stigma, comparing the intervention and comparison
      study arms.
