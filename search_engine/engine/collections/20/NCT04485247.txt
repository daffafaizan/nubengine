      laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) for pediatric patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis
      in cosmetic aspect. However, this technique has not gained popularity because it has been
      regarded as a tricky and time-consuming procedure. Recently, the frequency of implementation
      of transumbilical laparoscopy-assisted appendectomy (TULAA) is increasing in pediatric
      patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. The reason that this operation is possible in
      children, is that the length between umbilicus and appendix is shorter than that of an adult,
      and the abdominal wall is flexible, so that the appendix can be extracted through umbilical
      incision. It was reported that the operation time was shorter and the postoperative frequency
      of complications was not high compared to the laparoscopic appendectomy with three
      conventional ports. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of transumbilical
      laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy (TULAA) and to compare them to the outcomes of CLA.
