    
      This is a cluster randomised trial based in Danish general practice. 100 general practices
      will be recruited, each of which will recruit 10 successive women at their first routine
      antenatal appointment. All practices will receive standardised training in assessing maternal
      mental health, neurodevelopmental assessment of the child and assessment of the quality of
      parent-child interaction as well as in completion of an enhanced pregnancy or child
      development record.

      Practices will be randomised either to receive additional training in the principles of
      mentalisation and in the use of an online resource (Robusthed) that parents can use to
      improve their mentalisation skills (https://robustbarn.dk) or not to receive this extra
      training. The trial is therefore comparing Robusthed plus enhanced care as usual with
      enhanced care as usual alone.

      Baseline measures will be taken at recruitment into the trial and outcomes will be collected
      when the child is 15 and 30 months.
