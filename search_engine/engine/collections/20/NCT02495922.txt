    
      Prospective, multicentre, randomised, parallel group, open, phase III clinical trial, for
      patients with confirmed diagnosis of untreated multiple myeloma requiring systemic therapy .

      Investigational Medicinal Products:Elotuzumab, lenalidomide

      Patients are randomized in one of 4 study arms (A1, A2, B1, B2). Patients randomized in arm
      A1 or A2 will receive 4 cycles VRD (Bortezomib (Velcade®), Lenalidomide (Revlimid®),
      Dexamethasone). Patients in arm B1 or B2 will additionally receive the monoclonal antibody
      Elotuzumab in the 4 cycles VRD. After induction therapy patients undergo intensifying therapy
      according to GMMG standard (usually mobilization therapy followed by stem cell collection and
      autologous stem cell transplantation). After intensification a consolidation therapy will be
      performed with two cycles VRD (A1 und B1) or VRD+ Elotuzumab (A2 und B2), followed by
      Lenalidomide maintenance therapy with (arm A2 and B2) or without (arm A1 and B1) additional
      Elotuzumab. Maintenance therapy will be performed for 2 years.

      Primary objective is the determination of the best of four treatment strategies regarding
      progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomisation to progression or death
      from any cause whichever occurs first.

      The duration of the trial for each patients is expected to be 36-39 months (induction and
      intensification treatment: 7-10 months, 3 months rest between intensification and start of
      consolidation, consolidation 2 months, maintenance phase 24 months).
