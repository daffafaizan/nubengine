      days, period 1 of 8 days, period 2 of 8 days, a washout period of at least 10 days, and a

      The oral drug Sotagliflozin is metabolized by the liver and released in the bile juice into
      the intestine. Ingestion of charcoal a few hours after the drug administration circumvents
      the re-uptake of the drug from the intestine back into the blood circulation; instead,
      Sotagliflozin is eliminated with the feces. By comparison of Sotagliflozin drug
      administration with and without charcoal, the extent of this so-called enterohepatic
      circulation can be assessed.
