      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of multiepitope autologous dendritic cell vaccine in combination
           with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and vinorelbine ditartrate in patients with locally
           recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress human epidermal growth
           factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu).

      Secondary

        -  Determine if this regimen is effective in generating functional antigen-specific T
           cells.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Therapeutic autologous dendritic cell (DC) preparation: Patients undergo mobilization of
           DC and apheresis for production of therapeutic DC. DCs are expanded in vitro for 10-20
           days and pulsed with E75 and E90 peptides.

        -  Treatment: Patients receive vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 6-10 minutes, therapeutic
           autologous DC intradermally over 2-5 minutes, and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90
           minutes on day 1. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 2, 4,
           and 6, or until neutrophil counts recover. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6
           courses (or more at the discretion of the investigator) in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
