      humans, the investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study in three groups:

        -  blood donors at blood donation organizations (general population)

        -  beef and dairy cattle farmers

        -  veterinarians involved in a rural practice

      All the participants in the study will provide a blood sample and will fill in a
      questionnaire.
