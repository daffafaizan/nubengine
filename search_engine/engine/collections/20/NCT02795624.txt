      accelerated vascular aging in 300 pre-ban FAs with pre-ban SHS exposure, and compare their
      vascular measures of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction to those of age and
      risk-factor matched Framingham controls. It is hypothesized that pre-ban FAs have increased
      arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction compared to the Framingham subjects, related
      to SHS exposure.
