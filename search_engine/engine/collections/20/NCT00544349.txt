      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen by the measurement of objective response rate
           (RECIST criteria).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the duration of tumor response.

        -  Determine the duration and rate of tumor control.

        -  Determine the rate of secondary resectability of hepatic metastases.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival

        -  Determine rate of progression of the tumor.

        -  Determine overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours. Patients also receive oxaliplatin by hepatic
      arterial infusion over 2 hours. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
