    
      Study participation involves a visit to Mayo Clinic at 6 months and 1 year after you begin
      cardiac rehabilitation. In addition to the standard of care cardiac rehab program, which
      consists of 36 full sessions, you would be randomized to an activity monitor group or a usual
      care group.

      If randomized to the activity monitor group you will receive a FitBit and will be asked to
      wear this during cardiac rehabilitation and for one year after you complete the program;
      complete 4 blood draws (at the start of rehab, at the end of rehab, 6 months after finishing
      rehab and 1 year after completing rehab) and complete questionnaires about your lifestyle,
      sleep, mood. The data from the FitBit will be sent to the study team for one year.

      If randomized to the usual care group you will complete 4 blood draws (at the start of rehab,
      at the end of rehab, 6 months after rehab, and 1 year after completing rehab); and complete
      questionnaires about your lifestyle, sleep, mood.

      If you agree to be in the study, you will be asked to wear monitors with capabilities to
      detect your heart rate or physical activity for up to 1 year. Data will be acquired from the
      monitors or remote device accounts.

      You will also be asked to fill out questionnaires about your current level of physical
      activity, dietary intake, mood, stress, motivation, and quality of life.

      You will have a blood draw.

      You will be asked to complete 2 different stool sample tests, saliva tests, and a fingerstick
      measure for glycosylated hemoglobin; performed at 4 time points.

      Information from your medical record will be recorded and used.
