      significant differences amongst patients of Arabic and south-east Asian descent, with regard
      to plaque burden, severity and composition. Due to the "all-comers" nature of that trial, the
      factors of diabetes, previous CVD, and other coronary risk factors were likely confounders in
      the results. In this trial, those subject selection is screened to eliminate those factors
      with the goal of working with a more homogenous population to perform the plaque analysis.
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, post marketing, observational registry study
      designed to describe frequency and patterns of various risk factors, indications and findings
      in patients who undergo CCTA.

      BIG PICTURE 2 (abbreviated as "BP2") will collect data on patients from a wide variety of
      imaging sites (inpatient, outpatient, in-clinic CT machine). While the majority of the sites
      are within the US, the data collection will not be limited to US-only sites. A sub study of
      BP2 will perform a remote short follow-up questionnaire of subjects who were in the original
      Big PICTURE study.
