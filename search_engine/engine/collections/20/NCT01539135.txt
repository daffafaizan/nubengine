    
      This study is designed to yield data on the intraoperative use of TaperGuardâ„¢endotracheal
      tubes and its potential influence on postoperative pulmonary complications and outcomes. The
      TaperGuard Basic tube has a taper-shaped cuff and has been shown, via bench and animal
      testing, to decrease microaspiration, which has been associated with respiratory
      difficulties. The intraoperative use of this tube (i.e. during short term intubation), and
      its impact on postoperative complications and outcomes has not been investigated. This study
      will determine whether the intraoperative use of the TaperGuard tube results in a decrease in
      microaspiration compared to the Hi-Lo endotracheal tube having a barrel-shaped cuff.
      Moreover, the relationship between a decrease in microaspiration and subsequent decrease in
      postoperative respiratory complications will be explored.
