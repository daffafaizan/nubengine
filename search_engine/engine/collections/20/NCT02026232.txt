      malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other conditions. It is closely related to
      chloroquine but with a better side effect profile for long term use. In treating these
      conditions it was discovered to have some beneficial properties like lowering cholesterol and
      lowering sugar in the blood of those who have diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these
      effects are unknown. In animal studies, we have discovered that chloroquine appears to
      decrease glucose, lower blood pressure and decrease atherosclerosis (hardening of the
      arteries). This collection of problems commonly occurs in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes
      mellitus, which affects over 20% and 7% of adults in Western countries respectively. We have
      recently looked at the effects of chloroquine on the metabolic syndrome in humans which
      showed that small doses given for a short period of time would reduce insulin resistance in
      patients with the metabolic syndrome. Several population studies have shown similar effects
      with hydroxychloroquine. Since hydroxychloroquine is similar to chloroquine, we thus expect
      similar effects on blood glucose, blood pressure and blood cholesterol in type 2 diabetes.
      This offers a unique opportunity to develop a novel approach for lowering blood pressure,
      lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), and glucose in people at risk for heart disease
