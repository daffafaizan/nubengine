      I. To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with standard
      of care (SOC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) at 6 weeks post-treatment versus quality of
      life (QOL) patients treatment with intravenous-therapy (IV) chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

      II. To describe neurotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      III. To describe abdominal discomfort in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with
      NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      IV. To describe toxicities in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed
      by CRS with HIPEC.

      V. To describe the response rate in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      VI. To describe progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
      treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS. Patients
      then receive carboplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 90 minutes immediately following CRS.

      After completion of chemotherapy, patients are followed up at 30 days, and 3, 6, and 12
      months.
