      Pilates-based mat exercise and Pilates-based mat exercise with Theraband® (blue color).
      Interventions will be performed three times a week for eight-weeks on alternate days. Half
      will perform Pilates-based mat exercise and the remaining 29 will perform Pilates-based mat
      exercise with Theraband®. Both groups complete eleven exercises from week one to four and
      twelve exercises from week five to eight.
