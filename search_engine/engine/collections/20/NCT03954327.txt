    
      Primary endpoint:

      Greater than 10% difference in mean percentage of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reduction in
      cART vs. placebo at 6 and 12 months.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Serum biochemistries bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
           aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) will be studied as continuous
           variables.

        2. Composite endpoint used for the POISE study [A Placebo-Controlled Trial of Obeticholic
           Acid in Primary Biliary Cholangitis]: (i) reduction of ALP to < 1.67 upper limit of
           normal, (ii) normalization of bilirubin within upper limit of normal (ULN) and (iii)
           reduction of ALP by > 15% at 6 and 12 months.

        3. Symptomatic evaluation performed using the PBC-40 to assess five symptom domains
           relating to fatigue, itch, cognitive symptoms, social and emotional symptoms, and other
           symptoms.

        4. Histological change in grade and stage of PBC using the Nakanuma scoring system for a
           subgroup of patients undergoing liver biopsy [liver biopsy not compulsory for study].

        5. Serial human betaretrovirus measurement in peripheral blood and cellular immune response
           to viral peptides.
