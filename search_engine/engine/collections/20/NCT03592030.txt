    
      This project is meant to propose and validate specific and non-invasive diagnostic and
      prognostic tests for the acquired idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.

      These tests rely on the measure of Miss-1 expression in circulating blood cells on flow
      cytometry and its plasmatic concentration.

      To date, no equivalent tests exist to diagnose idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) from other
      causes.

      These simple tests would allow a quick diagnosis of acquired INS by avoiding an invasive
      renal biopsy. It would also help anticipate the relapses of the disease and guide the
      treatment modalities as do nowadays the PLA2R antibodies in idiopathic membranous
      nephropathy.

      We will propose the tests to every consent patient, hospitalized in the participating centers
      (Néphrologie pédiatrique of Robert Debré hospital, Néphrologie adulte of Tenon hospital) with
      a nephrotic syndrome.
