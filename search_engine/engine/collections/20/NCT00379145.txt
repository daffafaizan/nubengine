        -  Determine the antitumor activity of trabectedin, as measured by frequency and duration
           of objective response, in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent uterine
           leiomyosarcoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive trabectedin IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a
      confirmed complete response may receive at least 2 additional courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
