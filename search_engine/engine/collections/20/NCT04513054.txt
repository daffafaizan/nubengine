      triggered by intense emotional or physical stress, and can have catastrophic and potentially
      fatal consequences. Despite data linking takotsubo cardiomyopathy with conditions that have a
      recognized genetic predisposition (such as mental health and neurological problems), a
      systematic and comprehensive characterisation of the genetic-epidemiologic factors in
      takotsubo is lacking. The researchers propose to further investigate this disorder by
      collecting blood from probands and characterising the genotype of patients with takotsubo
      cardiomyopathy in a large scale, nationwide genome wide association study. The investigators
      will also archive DNA for identification of future candidate genetic variants. Ultimately,
      understanding the underlying predisposition of this poorly understood neuro-psycho-cardiac
      disorder is essential if we are to move this field forward.
