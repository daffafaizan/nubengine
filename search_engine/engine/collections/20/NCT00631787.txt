      for many patients with life-threatening hematologic illnesses and malignancies. Peripheral
      blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion has been associated with systemic toxicities including
      arrhythmias, hypertension, and organ dysfunction. It has been thought that the preservative
      dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that is frequently used to store frozen PBSCs may be the etiology
      of the adverse effects that occur during the infusion. However, we hypothesize that the red
      blood cells that rupture upon thawing infused with the graft release free hemoglobin which
      scavenges nitric oxide. This can lead to systemic vasoconstriction and organ dysfunction. In
      this protocol, we will monitor subjects who are undergoing PBSC transplantation with either
      fresh grafts that lack DMSO or frozen whole grafts. We will also evaluate patients who
      receive purified stem cell grafts, which will contain negligible red blood cells and
      associated free hemoglobin. We will then measure the frequency of infusion-related systemic
      toxicity and organ dysfunction between the groups.
