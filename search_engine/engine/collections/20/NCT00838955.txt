      cycle. Patients will be assessed for response with CT scans after the second cycle, and then
      after every other cycle until disease progression is confirmed.

      Patients will be treated with Temsirolimus until disease progression, or up to six cycles.
      Continuation of therapy beyond cycles is at the discretion of the investigator.
