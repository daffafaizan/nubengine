      hemoglobin, fractional tissue oxygen extraction and HbD as measured by near infrared
      spectroscopy during the first 72h of life in very low birthweight infants.

      Differences between relatively healthy and sick preterm infants will be explored. A focus is
      to find differences between those infants who develop germinal matrix hemorrhage and those
      who are at risk only but do not develop hemorrhage.
