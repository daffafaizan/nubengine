    
      Phase 1: derivation analyses 25 patients with a PCR-based diagnosis of Covid-19 will be be
      included to give 500 microliters of saliva and a 3 ml sample of blood for proteomic analysis;
      a drop of blood will also be put in a device connected to a silica matrix to perform
      spectrometric analyses. 25 patients with a non-Covid-19 respiratory infection will be
      included for the same samples. The proteomic analyses will be performed from classicaly
      draught blood, blood drop on silica, and saliva, to search for discriminating profiles
      between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19.

      Phase 2: confirmation analyses 150 patients with a suspected Covid-19 will be included at the
      same time than the Covid-19PCR is performed ; they will have a sample of saliva and of a drop
      of blood for proteomic analysis, whose results will be matched with PCR results.
