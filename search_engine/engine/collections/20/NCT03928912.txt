      fractures. And the incidence of nonunion of tibial shaft fracture varied from 1% to 80%. The
      investigators retrospectively analyzed the demographics of these participants in our hospital
      that occur long tubular fracture. One group is participants that existed fracture nonunion.
      And the other group is the participants that did not exist fracture nonunion. The
      investigators recorded twelve variables and confirm the risk factors by uni-variate Logistic
      regression analysis. Moreover, the investigators hope to establish the clinical pathway of
      various risk factors for fracture nonunion and affirm the importance of different risk
      factors.
