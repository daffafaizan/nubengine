      and can severely impact the outcome of the critically ill. To ensure a safe outcome during
      this particular procedure, there are many factors that the clinician is faced with. One
      decision that confronts the critical care physician involves the correct combination of
      medications with which to facilitate such a safe outcome. Given the reported hemodynamic
      stability, etomidate is a medication that is chosen by many providers in this particular
      situation. However, its association with a possible increase in mortality makes it less than
      ideal for a number of critical care physicians. In recent years, an admixture of propofol and
      ketamine has been studied that demonstrates hemodynamic stability based on the balancing of
      the hemodynamic effects of these two individual agents alone. This novel medication
      combination, sometimes referred to as "ketofol", may offer a valuable alternative to the
      critical care physician. Therefore, a randomized parallel-group clinical trial of adult
      critically ill patients admitted to a medical and/or surgical intensive care unit at Mayo
      Clinic Rochester who meet the criteria designated below for which urgent and/or emergent
      intubation is needed will receive one of two interventions based on stratified randomization.
      The "active" intervention arm will receive ketamine/propofol (ketofol) to facilitate
      endotracheal intubation. The comparison arm will receive etomidate. The primary outcome will
      focus on hemodynamic data recorded during the first 5 minutes post-administration with
      secondary outcomes looking at hemodynamic data at 10 and 15 minutes and addressing intensive
      care unit length of stay, mortality, adrenal function, and vasoactive medication use, among
      others.
