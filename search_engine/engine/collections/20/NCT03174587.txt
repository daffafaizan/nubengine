      generation of autoantibody and immune complex due to abnormal activation of the immune cells
      on the basis of abnormal immune responses.

      Although about 50% of lupus patients have lupus nephritis, there is no therapy product
      targeted for the lupus nephritis now.

      We have performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using allogenic bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal stem cells in SLE.

      CS20AT04 has anti-inflammatory effects, controls activity of immune cells and reduces
      generation of autoantibodies. So, it is expected to have treatment effects of lupus
      nephritis.

      The clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, phase 1 clinical trials.

      If that subject's written informed consent form to participate in this clinical trial will be
      conducted the required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol within 56
      days investigational drug administration.

      Then, the register for each dose step. For the final 3 subjects in the inclusion / exclusion
      criteria and be administered a drug test.

      Check the adverse events for more than four hours after administration of the investigational
      drug, and will determine whether the expression of adverse drug reaction(ADR) by the visit
      after 3 days, 7 days and 28 days.

      Except for dose administration, all subject are tested in the same schedule. As a result of
      evaluating severity of AE divided into grades in accordance with the CTCAE (Version 4.0)
      standards.
