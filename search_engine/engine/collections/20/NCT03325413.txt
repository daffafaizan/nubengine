      years and above. These patients often offer an extensive set of risk factors such as frailty,
      malnutrition, poor physical fitness and multi-morbidity that may in turn lead to longer
      hospitalizations and decline of health and functional status after surgery. An age-related
      increase in postoperative complications, such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD)
      and delirium is associated with a higher rate of postoperative morbidity, mortality and
      longer hospitalization.

      Early detection of risk factors and implementation of prophylactic measures is important to
      reduce postoperative complications and improve clinical outcomes in elderly patients. The aim
      of our study is to develop and verify a protocol - which allows for a systematic evaluation
      of risk factors and the implementation of prophylactic or therapeutic measures in order to
      optimize the postoperative outcome. The feasibility of our protocol will be verified in
      clinical practice by systematic process evaluations.
