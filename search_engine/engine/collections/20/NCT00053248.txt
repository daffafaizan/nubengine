        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of arsenic trioxide and imatinib mesylate in
           patients with resistant chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine potential dose-limiting toxic effects in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on
      days 1-5 of week 1 and then twice weekly. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients (at least 6 patients for phase I and at least 12
      patients for phase II) will be accrued for this study .
