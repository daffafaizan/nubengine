      other family caregivers need information, resources, and training in evidence-based
      strategies to manage the varied and changing concerns following their child's injury. Recent
      research provides evidence that theory-driven, self-directed online parent training is
      effective in improving both child and parent outcomes.

      The objective of this project is to produce the Traumatic Brain Injury Positive Strategies
      (TIPS) program, a comprehensive educational and training resource to help families improve
      their knowledge and skills to address cognitive, behavioral, and social challenges following
      pediatric TBI. The TIPS program will be grounded in the theory of planned behavior, which
      postulates that training in problem-solving leads to improved skills and increases in
      perceived behavioral control that mediate direct changes in parenting behaviors and indirect
      changes in child outcomes. The web-based product will include: (a) the Training Center, which
      will provide training in a range of evidence-based strategies within a problem-solving
      framework; and (b) the TBI Resource Center, an extensive library of educational materials,
      information, and resources about childhood TBI.

      Approximately 216 family members will participate in the evaluation phase of this study.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) treatment (TIPS program
      ) or (b) control (brain injury website).
