      sensitive disorders, the main sign of which is alterations in shoulder mobility. Design:
      Prospective randomized and double-blind pilot trial. Objective: To pilot the effectiveness of
      accessory joint and nerve mobilization techniques in order to get an overview of the joint
      capsule and nerve involvement in shoulder motion restriction. Participants: 18 women who were
      undergoing unilateral breast cancer surgery and axillary lymph node dissection. Setting:
      WomenÂ´s Health Research Group at Physical Therapy Department of University of Alcala, Madrid,
      Spain. Intervention: accessory joint mobilization versus neural mobilization. Follow-up:
      Six-month follow-up. Key outcomes: Range of motion, sensitive disorder, pain and upper limb
      functionality.
