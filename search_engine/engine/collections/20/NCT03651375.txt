      used approaches are unsatisfactory. The addition of neoadjuvant/induction chemotherapy before
      the irradiation and in the prolonged gap between the end of hypofractionated 5x5 Gy
      radiotherapy and surgery may allow to obtain the R0 resection rate, high pathological
      response rate and/or a higher rate of limb-sparing/conservative surgery as well as to
      increase patients' survival.

      Hypofractionation represents a variation of radiotherapy fractionation in which the total
      dose is divided into fewer fractions with an increased fraction dose. Such treatment may lead
      to additional biological effects when compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy
      (eg. vascular damage, increased immunogenicity, and antigenicity). The main advantages of
      hypofractionation are those related to the decreased overall treatment time what is more
      convenient for both patients and physicians, increased compliance and makes the treatment
      more cost-effective. Intriguing, such an approach may provide an additional benefit when
      treating non-radiosensitive tumors with a low alpha/beta ratio (eg. sarcomas).

      The basis of the study was a trial conducted by Kosela et al. in our center, which showed
      that preoperative short 5x5 Gy radiotherapy with immediate surgery is an effective and
      well-tolerated treatment of resectable sarcomas of extremities or trunk wall.

      The rationale of chemotherapy comes from the interim analysis of a multicenter, international
      EORTC study comparing neoadjuvant systemic approaches in high-risk sarcomas. It was proven
      that AI regimen, which consists of ifosfamide and anthracyclines allowed to obtain 20%
      benefit in relapse-free survival and overall survival as compared to pathologically-tailored
      chemotherapy.
