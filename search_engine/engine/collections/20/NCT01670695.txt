    
      Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently defined emerging clinical entity
      characterized by tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells, tissue fibrosclerosis and
      elevated serum IgG4 concentration.

      In this study, patients with IgG4-RD will be investigated, including clinical presentation,
      laboratory findings and imaging study. All patients will be treated by standard care and
      follow-uped for at least 6 months.
