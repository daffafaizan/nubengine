      voluntarily enrolled. Through the collaboration of 12 Multidisciplinary Teams (MT), we took a
      Pre-EOI picture of the human resources (i.e. doctors to patients ratio) and of the
      organisational structures (i.e. laboratory's opening hours) of each hospital. For six months,
      each unit enrolled was asked to fill in a Clinical Checklist for every patient suspected for
      severe sepsis or septic shock; so that the Pre-EOI "sepsis six" bundle compliance could be
      evaluated. Then, we planned several pre-agreed educational meetings for all of the doctors
      and nurses belonging to the enrolled wards. In the meanwhile the MT worked to overcome any
      impediment to a better septic patient management. Finally, the educated medical staff was
      asked to fill in again the same Clinical Checklist used in the Pre-EOI phase; so that the
      Post-EOI "sepsis six" bundle compliance could be evaluated and a comparison with the Pre-EOI
      phase could be done.

      Hypothesis This is the first study aimed to analyze the impact of an Educational and
      Organizational Intervention in the outcome of septic patients managed in no Critical Care
      Units. We guess that the differences showed in human resources and organizational structures
      among the hospitals could have a role in the "sepsis six" bundle compliance and in the
      patient's outcome, but only a comparison with data collected from the clinical checklist and
      patient's outcome will confirm our guess. Likewise, we believe that an educational
      intervention could improve the septic patient's management, but we need the Post-EOI phase
      conclusion to demonstrate or not our hypothesis.
