      urinary tract symptoms who visited urogynecologic clinics in a tertiary referral center, were
      reviewed. Based on bladder diaries, women with at least one episode of urgency and urinary
      incontinence (UI) were allocated to the overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) -wet group. Women
      with at least one episode of urgency but without incontinence were allocated to the OAB-dry
      group. Women with at least one episode of UI but without urgency were allocated to the UI
      group. Women with more or equal to 2 episodes of nocturia but without urgency and UI were
      allocated to the nocturia group. Women with more or equal to 8 episodes of daytime frequency
      but without urgency, UI and nocturia were allocated to the frequency group. Otherwise, normal
      group. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was used to perform statistical
      analysis for between-group comparisons.
