      recombinant EC allergen dose from low to high.Conducting clinical trials of TB-PPD as
      controlled arms intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin
      test，after the test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. The vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood
      pressure and temperature), skin reaction at injection site (flush and induration) , local
      reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events; The
      vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram
      （before the skin test,after skin test 144h ）are the main test items,Evaluate the safety of
      the recombinant EC allergy in the expansion of the healthy people , and provide the
      appropriate dose range for phase IIb clinical trials.

      Second，56 patients of TB are distributed different dose groups according to the recombinant
      EC allergen dose from low to high. Conducting clinical trials of TB-PPD as controlled arms
      intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin test，after the
      test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. The vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and
      temperature),skin reaction at injection site (flush and induration) , local reactions (rash,
      pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events; The vital signs,
      blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram （before the skin
      test,after skin test 144h ）are the main test items,Evaluate the safety of the recombinant EC
      allergy in patients of TB,and provide the appropriate dose range for phase IIb clinical
      trials.

      Third，32 patients of TB are distributed into different dose groups according to the
      recombinant EC allergen dose from low to high. Conducting clinical trials of placebo as
      controlled arms intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin
      test，after the test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. The vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood
      pressure and temperature), skin reaction at injection site (flush and induration), local
      reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events; The
      vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram
      （before the skin test,after skin test 144h ）are the main test items,Evaluate the safety of
      the recombinant EC allergy in patients of TB on safety.
