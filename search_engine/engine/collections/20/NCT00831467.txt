      recurrent forms of prostate cancer. Recently, immunotherapy of prostate cancer has been
      facilitated by the identification of a number of prostate specific antigens that are
      expressed in healthy and tumor prostate tissues. For prostatectomized patients, such antigens
      offer ideal targets for immunotherapy as they are only present in tumor but not in healthy
      tissue. The use of prostate specific antigens in a cancer vaccine is one attractive option
      for cancer immunotherapy.
