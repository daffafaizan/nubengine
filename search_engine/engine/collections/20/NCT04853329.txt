    
      This first-in-human Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, dose-escalating, single-agent study
      conducted in patients with advanced CD20-associated hematological cancers for which the
      investigator determines there to be no other higher priority therapies available. All
      patients must have failed at least two prior lines of conventional systemic therapy that must
      also include an approved CD20 based treatment. All patients will need to have CD20-positve
      disease, as determined by the expression of CD20 on tumor cells assayed within 6 months prior
      to study entry.

      The study will consist of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A of the study, dose escalation
      will proceed according to the guidelines in the Treatment and Dosing section below, following
      a rule-based design methodology. Two different schedules will be explored to establish the PK
      profile and thus better inform the selection of the final dosing schedule to be developed.
      Arm A will explore a continuous weekly dosing schedule and will commence first. Arm B will
      explore a 3 weekly schedule in which a single dose is administered every 3 weeks. Part B dose
      expansion of the study will commence, in which a single dosing schedule will be explored in
      CD20-positive patients. The schedule will be selected based on PK and safety determinants
      from Study Part A.
