        1. whether the knee and function scores and the radiographic results of the knees with a
           Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis would be better than those with an Nexgen cementless
           prosthesis.

        2. whether the patients with a Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis would have a better range of
           knee motion than those with an Nexgen cementless prosthesis.

        3. whether patient satisfaction and preference would be better in the patients having a
           Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis than those of patients having an Nexgen cementless knee
           prosthesis

        4. whether complication rate would be less in the knees with a Nexgen cemented knee
           prosthesis than in the knees with an Nexgen cementless prosthesis.
