      ulceration and severe incapacitation. Torpid ulcers of the lower limbs affect up to 15% of
      diabetic patients at some moment of their lifetime; about one-third of patients developing
      ulcers will never achieve their definitive cure, and half of them will die within three years
      .

      Heparins, besides their well known antithrombotic effects, have been shown to stimulate both
      the synthesis of heparan sulphate -a potent endogenous anticoagulant- in endothelial cell
      cultures and the proliferation of fibroblasts taken from diabetic ulcers .

      After noticing the highly positive evolution of chronic ulcers in six diabetic patients who
      had received LMWHs in their homes for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis , and
      considering the excellent safety record of these drugs, we decided to explore the effects of
      LMWHs on the evolution of diabetic foot ulcers and the quality of life of diabetic patients
      seen in our primary care practices.
