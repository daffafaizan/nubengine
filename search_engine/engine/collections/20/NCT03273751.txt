    
      Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is the concept of mitigating ischemia-reperfusion
      injury to target organs by a brief episode of ischemia-reperfusion of the limb. The
      protective effect of RIPC on major organs has been demonstrated in an animal study, but its
      clinical efficacy has not yet been established.

      The kidney is a typical organ vulnerable to ischemic injury, and the renal protective effect
      of RIPC can be expected. There have been many reports of renal protective effects of RIPC in
      cardiac and vascular surgery. On the other hand, few studies have investigated the effect of
      RIPC during partial nephrectomy in which ischemia-reperfusion injury can occur during the
      surgery.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of RIPC in patients undergoing
      partial nephrectomy to prevent renal impairment and improve the prognosis after the surgery.
