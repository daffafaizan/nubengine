      epilepsy. One study found that epilepsy patients who received music therapy for six months or
      greater had a significant reduction in number of seizures and could potentially aid in
      decreasing medication dosage. The investigators would like to contribute to this sort of
      research, but focus on what effect music therapy has on a patient's cognitive recovery after
      undergoing epilepsy surgery. Although research exists regarding music therapy on memory and
      communication, its overall effect on this patient population is unclear.

      The Dell Children's Epilepsy program hopes that this research project on memory and
      communication will have a positive effect on their patients with epilepsy.
