      patients with supratentorial tumors and healthy people . The AUC (area under the curve) of
      ROC, which is associated with the increased maximum and the difference between left and right
      equilibrium of impedance value, is calculated. The specificity of brain biological electrical
      impedance tomography in screening supratentorial tumors are evaluated.

      To compare the changes of parameters detected by brain biological electrical impedance
      tomography, the enrolled brain tumor patients with cerebral edema were paired with themselves
      and intravenous infusion of mannitol so that the sensitivity of this device in monitoring
      cerebral edema can be evaluated.
