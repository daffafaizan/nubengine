        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with cervical lymph node metastases of
           squamous cell carcinoma from an unknown primary treated with selective irradiation vs
           extensive irradiation.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of acute and late side effects in the head and neck region in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare control of the neck and incidence of subsequent primary in the head and neck
           region in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease stage (N1-2a vs N2b-3), radiation technique (2D vs 3D conformal vs
      intensity-modulated), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo selective irradiation of the ipsilateral level of the neck once
           daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo extensive irradiation of the neck (nasopharyngeal,
           oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal mucosa and ipsilateral neck node areas on
           both sides of the neck) once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 4, on the last day of therapy, and then
      every 3 months for 1 year.

      Patients are followed at day 30, every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 7 years.
