    
      This study will be carried out to evaluate and compare the effect of propolis extract
      mouthwash and pomegranate (botanical name: Punica granatum) extract mouthwash on taste
      alteration, salivary pH and antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans in high
      caries risk patients.

      Thats by taking unstimulated saliva samples at the morning before using the mouthwash, then
      taking another one after using the mouthwash and finally after 7 days, to make a bacterial
      culture and measure the salivary pH by a digital pH meter and evaluate taste changes by a
      questionnaire.
