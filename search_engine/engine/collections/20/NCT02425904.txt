    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention, to learn whether the drug works in treating
      a specific disease, in this case, clofarabine to treat LCH.

      "Investigational" means that the intervention is still being studied. It also means that the
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved clofarabine for your
      disease.

      Clofarabine is a chemotherapy drug that has been used and is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of leukemia in children and adults. Information from other research studies
      suggests that this drug may also be effective in participants with LCH and other histiocytic
      disorders.
