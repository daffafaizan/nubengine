      neuropathic pain. All will have their medical treatment optimized by a pain medicine
      specialist before being randomly assigned to either an 8-week group MBSR program or a
      wait-list. All participants will complete self-report questionnaires, provide a hair sample
      for cortisol measurements and a blood sample to measure several markers of immune function at
      four different time points: before medical treatment, after medical treatment and before
      randomization to MBSR or waiting, after the completion of MBSR as well as at 3-month
      follow-up. A sub-sample will complete a series of tasks while undergoing functional magnetic
      resonance imaging before and after participation in MBSR.

      The primary outcome is pain interference. The investigators will compare the proportion of
      participants who report reduced pain-related disability, as measured by the Brief Pain
      Inventory-Interference Scale, in each group. The primary hypothesis is that at 3-month
      follow-up, there will be at least 30% more responders (â‰¥1.0 decrease in mean Brief Pain
      Inventory Interference score) in the interdisciplinary program in comparison to medical
      treatment alone.
