    
      Patients undergoing aortic valve replacement are randomized to one of six groups:
      preanesthesia-TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), preanesthesia-sham,
      sevoflurane-TENS, sevoflurane-sham, propofol-TENS, propofol-sham. Patients receive TENS or
      sham stimulation (without electrical pulse generation) at one arm for 30 min under no
      anesthesia (preanesthesia) or sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia.

      In all patients, blood samples are obtained before and after TENS or sham procedure to make
      plasma dialysate to perfuse rat hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury through
      Langendorff system.

      Cardioprotective effects are determined by comparing infarct sizes of rat hearts perfused
      with human plasma dialysate, which reflects cardioprotective effects of TENS in human
      subjects. By comparing infarct size differences, the myocardial protective effects of TENS in
      various anesthetic conditions can be determined in human subjects undergoing aortic valve
      replacement.
