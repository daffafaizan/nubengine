    
      A Randomized prospective case control study to evaluate the surgical outcome of using the new
      barbed bidirectional tissue controlling device in reducing the time and blood loss at uterine
      closure during C-Section. In addition, the need of additional sutures to control bleeding
      after the 2- layer closure is used and the occurrence of any tearing of the uterine muscles
      at the time closure of the uterine incision will be also studied. These will be the primary
      outcome measure and the secondary outcome measure will be factors related to the blood loss
      at the time of the uterine closure, surgical complications, duration of hospital stay,
      postoperative fever, and the number of sutures required to close the uterine incision.
