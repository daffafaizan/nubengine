        1. To determine the use of the CPWalker rehabilitation platform, a robotic device composed
           by an exoskeleton linked to a walker that provides support and balance, as a gait
           training intervention in the pediatric cerebral palsy population.

        2. To create and define detailed guidelines consisting of robotic based treatment methods
           for gait rehabilitation.

      Hypothesis:

        1. CPWalker can be used as a gait training intervention for pediatric patients with gait
           impairments due to cerebral palsy

        2. Performing lower limb training in conjunction with active head and trunk control
           therapies will improve functional gait levels

        3. Following 16-24 CPWalker training sessions, persons with cerebral palsy will show
           improvements in functional mobility when comparing pre-training measurements to
           post-training measurements

      Procedures:

      Participants will engage in an 8-week training program, consisting of 2-3 sessions per week
      based on the level of gait impairment. Percentage range of motion (ROM), partial body weight
      support (PWBS), and gait velocity are the principal parameters under variation during
      training.

      Additionally, screening, baseline and post-training testing sessions will be conducted
