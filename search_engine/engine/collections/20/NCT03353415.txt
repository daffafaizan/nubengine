      the FDA for monitoring the glucose levels of people with diabetes. The investigators of this
      study are looking to see if this CGM will be able to benefit people who have had gastric
      surgery and experience low blood sugar episodes, which can be asymptomatic and lead to
      complications. This study will involve three to five visits, and involves wearing a sensor
      and regularly recording blood sugar values and any symptoms experienced as well as a record
      of treatments for symptoms. This study also involves the use of a fitness tracker, which will
      be worn for the duration of the 4 weeks of the study and returned at the end of the study.
      Participants will be able to keep the Dexcom CGM receiver and transmitter.
