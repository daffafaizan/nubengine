      glycosylation is the hallmark of most human cancers and affect many cellular properties,
      including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, transformation, migration and
      immune response.

      Though widely explored in various human cancers, the role of mucin glycosylating enzymes in
      HNSCC has not been elucidated. Our aims is to analyze the expression patterns of mucin
      glycosylating enzymes in HNSCC tissues. Furthermore, we will correlate the expression levels
      of mucin glycosylating enzymes with clinical characteristics of HNSCC patients.
