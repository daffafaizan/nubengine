      Ischemia/reperfusion injury cripples the treatment effect of reperfusion management, and
      increases the final myocardial infarct size. Copeptin is related to the prognosis of heart
      failure and AMI, and may be a potential prognostic biomarker for myocardial infarct size,
      myocardial function and outcomes in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI.This study will enroll
      consecutive STEMI patients undergoing PCI, who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in
      a large-scale hospital in Northeast China. After obtaining an informed consent, blood samples
      will be drawn at the time of before, immediately after, and 3 days after PPCI. They will be
      collected in EDTA tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 g within 0.5 h. Plasma will be
      stored at -80Â°C until analysis. Plasma copeptin concentrations will be determined by a
      commercially available automated immunofluorescent assay (R&D Systems Inc. Minneapolis, USA).
      And other information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, medical care, demographic
      characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests, medications and
      procedural data will be also collected. Baseline CMR will be performed 3-5 days after PPCI.
      All scans were performed on a 3.0 Tesla scanner. At 1 month, 3 month, and 12 month after
      discharge, participants will receive a follow-up by phone. At 6 month after discharge,
      participants will return to the clinic for follow up visits, and a face-to-face interview
      will be conducted to get information about clinical events, symptoms, functioning, quality of
      life, and medical care during the recovery period. Follow-up CMR scan will be conducted.
      Follow-up blood samples will be drawn for testing copeptin.

      Sample Size Calculation A study size analysis was performed using PASS (version 11.0.4, 2011,
      NCSS, LLC, USA). In a previous study, the 90-day primary composite end point of all-causes
      death, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and congestive heart failure requiring
      rehospitalization or an emergency room visit through 90 days was 10.3% in STEMI patients
      undergoing PCI. [1] Although available data for detecting clinically relevance between
      copeptin and prognosis in STEMI patients undergoing PCI was limited, a previous study
      demonstrated that a high concentration (quartile 4 vs. quartiles 1 to 3) of copeptin
      identified an increased risk of CV death or HF (HR:2.80,95%CI:2.24-3.51,P<0.001). [2] When
      the ratio between groups1 and 2 is 3:1, an overall sample size of 275 subjects, of which 207
      are in group 1 and 68 are in group 2, achieves 90% power at a 0.0500 significance level to
      detect a difference of 0.1280 between 0.9290 and 0.8010--the proportions surviving in groups
      1 and 2, respectively. The proportion of patients lost during follow up was 0.1000.
