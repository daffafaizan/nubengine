      study will be conducted employing a quasi-experimental (not a randomized controlled trial),
      before and after design to evaluate the effectiveness of the POWERPLAY program. 2. An
      integrated set of research activities (systematic review, sleep behaviors and consultation
      groups) will be used to provide the basis for developing recommendations for promoting sleep
      health in male-dominated workplaces, and inform the development and testing of a POWERPLAY
      sleep health module (REST-UP) in Year 2.
