      accompanied by metastasis, the NCCN guidelines (NCCN guidelines hepatobiliary cancer, 2019)
      recommend that the current treatment options are limited, mainly recommending gemcitabine
      combined with platinum based antitumor drugs (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.) chemotherapy as
      first-line treatment. Adding targeted drugs can enhance the anti-tumor effect. GC
      chemotherapy (Cisplatin + gemcitabine) has been used in the treatment of advanced
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but the efficacy is still not satisfactory. Lenvatinib is a
      small-molecule multikinase inhibitor that is currently approved for first-line treatment of
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy may have a better
      effect than single use for advanced ICC. At present, lenvatinib combined with GC chemotherapy
      in the first-line treatment of advanced ICC has not been reported.
