      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) now affects 850 million individuals worldwide, exceeding the
      global prevalence of diabetes, cancer and HIV/AIDS. In addition, end-stage renal disease
      affects 7.4 million individuals and mortality rate for individuals burdened by kidney disease
      is now estimated at 5 to 10 million individuals each year. Therefore, developing better
      diagnostic and treatment approaches for the kidney disease epidemic is a global priority, as
      leading professional societies and health agencies have emphasized (the US Food & Drug
      Administration, the National Kidney Foundation, the European Medicines Agency, the European
      Society of Organ Transplantation, the American Society for Transplantation and the American
      Society of Transplant Surgeons).

      However, current approaches for investigating the relationship between eGFR course and
      outcomes such as ESRD and mortality have been limited by registries with an overall lack on
      granular data, including infrequent eGFR measurements for a single patient and convenience
      clinical samples. An unsupervised longitudinal approach to determine patient eGFR evolution
      may bring an original perspective to the traditional clinical interpretation of kidney
      function based on limited eGFR measurements, short-term follow-up, and standard statistical
      approach.

      Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)

        -  eGFR trajectories

        -  Determinants of eGFR trajectories

        -  Associations of eGFR trajectories with ESRD and death

        -  Prediction system that will provide the personalized probabilities of belonging to eGFR
           trajectories
