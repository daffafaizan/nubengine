      intervention to these cases by using videoconferencing method on the physical condition of
      the cases. The exercise program will be a total of 6 weeks, 3 days a week. Online access will
      be carried out synchronously by telephone or computer, and training sessions will not be
      recorded in order to protect patient personal information. The cases will be evaluated online
      at the beginning of the study and at the end of the 6-week exercise program. The selected
      evaluation parameters have been selected considering the ease of online application.
