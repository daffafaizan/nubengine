      Intracytoplasmic Sprem injection (ICSI) were randomized into two groups; the first group (100
      patients) received intrauterine Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) and the second
      group (100) received intrauterine Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) at ovum pick up day. The
      clinical pregnancy rate was evaluated as a primary outcome after 14 days and ultrasound
      imaging of gestational sac was evaluated as a secondary outcome after 6 weeks.
