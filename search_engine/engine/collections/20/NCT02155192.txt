      human exposure, have no therapeutic intent and are not intended to examine clinical

      medical research study) and pharmacogenomics study in participants with psoriasis.
      Participants who were treated in study Phase 2 NCT01483599 (X-PLORE), Phase 3 NCT00267969

      returning to their study site where a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be obtained for
