      A standard "3+3" design will be used to determine the MTD of eribulin with avelumab.

      The maximum tolerated dose is the dose of eribulin combined with avelumab with dose limiting
      toxicity of 0-1 of 6 patients in the first cycle of combination therapy. After the MTD has
      been determined, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the MTD
      to evaluate the efficacy of this combination.

      After determination of MTD for eribulin mesylate, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled
      on the expansion cohort. Subjects on the expansion cohort will be assessed for adverse events
      but will not be assessed for DLTs.
