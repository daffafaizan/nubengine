      inclusion criteria. Management of patients do not differ from the usual care in the service
      concerned. During the usual patient care, several pain assessments will be performed: Numeric
      Pain Rating Scale, MMSE score if the patient is able to communicate, Algoplus® scale and
      Doloplus® scale will be performed by doctors and/or caregivers without patient's
      participation. The patient will be assessed by two doctors and or caregivers (the time
      interval between the two assessments must be as short as possible).

      In a first step, 48 hours after patient admission in the care service, a first
      doctor/caregiver will assess pain with Numeric Pain Rating Scale and evaluate MMSE score if
      it is possible and then assess pain with the Algoplus® scale. The results of the Numeric Pain
      Rating Scale, the Algoplus® scale and the MMSE score will be recorded in the medical record
      and in the study Case Report Form.

      In a second step, less than 3 hours after the first assessment, a second doctor/caregiver
      will assess pain with the Doloplus® scale and the result will be recorded in the medical
      record and in the study Case Report Form.

      The Case Report Form (containing demographic data, the history of pain, analgesics treatment,
      scores of Numeric Pain Rating Scale, MMSE, Algoplus® scale and Doloplus® scale) will be faxed
      to the Coordinating Center at Clermont-Ferrand in the day.
