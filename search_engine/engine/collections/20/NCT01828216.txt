      parallel study on new referrals to the Respiratory Clinic, Prince of Wales Hospital, with
      suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS). OSAS was defined by apnea-hypopnea index(AHI) 5/hr
      or more of sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness or two of the following symptoms: choking
      or gasping during sleep, recurrent awakenings from sleep, unrefreshed sleep, daytime fatigue,
      and impaired concentration. All patients with suspected OSAS underwent assessment at the
      clinic with the Epworth sleepiness score(ESS) and symptoms evaluation. Patients who had ESS
      score>9 or at least two OSAS symptoms as described above were invited to join the study. They
      were randomized into either group A)home-based management approach or group B)hospital-based
      management approach by a random table by a third party not involved in the trial.
