      effects in animal and human models, and is currently available as an over-the-counter dietary
      supplement. Polypodium leucotomos extract (PLE) has been shown in laboratory, animal, and
      clinical studies to serve as a potent antioxidant that helps mitigate UV-induced damage by
      scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Oral consumption of PLE in human
      studies has been shown to significantly reduce the number if UV-induced sunburn cells and DNA
      damage, and to inhibit photosensitization. Importantly, PLE appears to be exceptionally
      well-tolerated with no serious reported adverse side effects.

      PLE has been studied in numerous trials for many conditions, including skin diseases. Doses
      up to 1200 mg per day have been used in clinical studies, though doses for prevention of
      sun-damage are typically in the range of 480 mg per day. To date, no serious adverse effects
      have been clearly attributed to the use of PLE (this high tolerability is one of the reasons
      for the great interest in the clinical use of PLE). Oral consumption of other fern species,
      such as Polypodium vulgare, have been associated with low blood pressure and increased heart
      rate. On theoretical grounds, similar side effects may be possible with PLE.
