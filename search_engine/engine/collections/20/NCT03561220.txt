    
      This study is a large, prospective, pragmatic, controlled comparison of patient-centric
      outcomes [quality of life (QOL), toxicity, and disease control] between parallel cohorts of
      men with prostate cancer treated simultaneously at proton therapy facilities and at
      geographically similar conventional (photon-based) radiation facilities using
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques. Pre-specified subset comparators
      include a randomized comparison of standard fractionation and moderate hypofractionation dose
      schemes within the proton therapy cohort. In addition, analysis of heterogeneous treatment
      effects (HTE) will include a comparison of outcomes by race (Black vs. White), comorbidity
      score (0 vs. 1+), age (â‰¤65 vs. >65), and prostate cancer aggressiveness (low, intermediate,
      and high risk) for all endpoints.

      All interventions will be standard of care (SOC) radiation strategies using either IMRT or
      proton therapy. All patient-reported QOL, patient-scored and patient-reported toxicity, and
      disease control assessments will be SOC. Participants will also complete pretreatment surveys
      regarding demographic data, personal treatment goals, factors affecting treatment
      decision-making, and sources of information used in treatment selection.
