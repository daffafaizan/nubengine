      up to 60 mL/kg of isotonic saline should be administered within the first 15 minutes of
      resuscitation. There are practical challenges to achieving these benchmarks. Syringes are
      often used to perform manual fluid resuscitation as they are generally available and health
      care providers are typically comfortable using them. Health care providers have been observed
      to have different preferences regarding the syringe size used to perform manual fluid
      resuscitation. Larger syringes e.g. 60 mL-size requires more force to depress the syringe
      plunger, due to a larger crosssectional area, but fewer syringes are needed to administer a
      given volume. Fewer syringes results in less time spent connecting and disconnecting
      syringes, which contributes to total fluid resuscitation time using this technique.

      Consenting participants will be randomly assigned (by an independent Randomization
      Coordinator) to one of four syringe size groups (10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 60 mL sizes). The
      allocation sequence is therefore concealed. After undergoing a standardization procedure,
      each participant will be instructed to administer 900 mL of 0.9% normal saline using
      pre-filled provided syringes by manual push as rapidly as possible using the
      disconnect-reconnect method. Participants will be advised to consider that they are in a
      situation where they are resuscitating a 15 kg child (represented by the model) in
      decompensated shock. Syringes for each 300 mL (20 mL/kg) aliquot will be colour-coded for
      identification purposes.
