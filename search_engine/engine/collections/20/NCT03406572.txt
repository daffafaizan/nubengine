      gas measurement between one hour and two hours after initiating the NIV session. The NIV will
      be extended for those patients with a pH < 7.30. In both groups, patients will be assessed
      for their tolerance of NIV and their ability to switch to spontaneous breathing every hour
      +/- 30 min, except during sleep (10 pm-8 am); they will be assessed for their tolerance of
      spontaneous breathing and for the need of resumption of NIV every 2 hours+/- 30 min and every
      4 +/- 1 hours thereafter. To ensure the consistency of indications of NIV and invasive
      mechanical ventilation (IMV) across centers and reduce potential bias, NIV and IMV will be
      initiated and stopped in the same way in the two groups, using predefined criteria.
