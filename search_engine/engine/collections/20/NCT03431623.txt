    
      This was designed as randomized, double-blind, multi-center, Phase 3 clinical study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous CKD-11101 versus Darbepoetin Alfa in
      patients who had stage 3, stage 4, and stage 5 chronic renal failure not on hemodialysis or
      peritoneal dialysis.

      The selection criteria will be evaluated in patients who are receiving anemia correction
      among patients with 19 years of age or older and who had anemia in chronic renal failure of
      stage 3 or above.

      Subjects who are identified to meet all inclusion criteria will be randomized to test group
      and control group at 1:1 ratio and go through 24-week correction period and efficacy
      evaluation period. During correction period and efficacy evaluation period, subjects will
      visit the clinical study center every 2 weeks to receive processes designated for each visit
      and be administered investigational product from the investigator in charge of drug
      administration.

      In the safety evaluation period, all subjects will be administered test drug for 28weeks.
