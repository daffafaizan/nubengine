      (SOC) is not available. Two Groups of AML participants will be included in this study:

        -  Group I participants will have hematologic relapse/refractory disease (participants not
           in CR or CRi i.e. with >=5% blast cells in the bone marrow (BM) or presence of
           circulating blast)

        -  Group II participants will have molecular relapse/persistent disease (participants with
           a CR or CRi, and a positive MRD based on local multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC)
           assessment).

      The study consists of three parts:

        -  Part A (single-participant dose escalation cohorts) - single participants from Group I
           will receive increment-based escalating doses until a Grade >=2 AE related to RO7283420
           or a clear pharmacodynamic effect

        -  Part B (multiple-participant dose escalation cohorts) - multiple-participant cohorts of
           >=3 participants will be enrolled for dose escalation for Group I and Group II
           independently.

        -  Part C (dose expansion) - participants will receive the respective identified RP2D for
           that group.

      Each participant will receive up to 6 cycles of treatment with RO7283420. At the end of Cycle
      6, at the discretion of the Investigator (based on the assessment of clinical benefit), the
      participant could receive up to 3 additional treatment cycles.
