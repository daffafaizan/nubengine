    
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b study to determine the MTD and RP2D and to assess
      the safety and efficacy of PRS-343 administered in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1
      antibody, in previously treated advanced or metastatic HER-2 positive solid tumors (e.g.,
      bladder, breast and gastrointestinal). The study will include a dose escalation period
      followed by an expansion period. PRS-343 and atezolizumab will be given intravenously once
      every three weeks (Q3W).

      All available safety data, emerging PK, pharmacodynamic data, and dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) will be considered in guiding the Safety Committee's decisions regarding subsequent
      doses to be tested during the escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD and RP2D have been
      established, an expansion cohort will be enrolled.

      One treatment cycle is defined as 21 days (3 weeks).
