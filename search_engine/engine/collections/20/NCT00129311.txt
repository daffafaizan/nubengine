      for the treatment of nicotine dependence, there is still a significant proportion of
      cigarette smokers who are unable to quit smoking. Therefore, new and effective
      pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation are needed. The primary aim of this study is to
      determine the safety and efficacy of selegiline as an aid to smoking cessation.

      In this study, 200 nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers will participate in an 8-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and then will be followed over 4 years. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive either selegiline or placebo. Selegiline doses of 5 mg
      will be taken once a day during the first week. This will be increased to 5 mg twice daily
      for the remaining 7 weeks. The target smoking "quit date" will be Day 15. All smokers will
      receive brief weekly manualized smoking cessation counseling from the Mayo Clinic's "Smoke
      Free and Livin' It" program. The primary smoking cessation outcome measure will be 7-day
      point prevalence smoking abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. Secondary cessation outcome
      measures will include continuous smoking abstinence during the last four weeks of the trial
      (Days 29-56) and 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of the 8-week trial (Days
      49-56).
