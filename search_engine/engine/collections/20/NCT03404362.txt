    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double arm study to collect data on safety and
      effectiveness of ExAblate MRgFUS and EBRT treatments of metastatic bone tumors. Following
      treatment assignment and treatment itself, subjects will be followed for up for 6 months to
      evaluate pain relief as well as quality of life. Additional data regarding dosage and
      frequency of analgesic consumption for the management of the bone tumor induced pain will
      also be collected. MRI of the treated lesion will be obtained 3 and 6 months post therapy to
      evaluate effect on the lesion in both radiation and MRgFUS arms. This is clinically
      acceptable and widely utilized diagnostic method in follow up of this patient population.

      Data will be collected for total of 144 patients, 72 patients treated by EBRT and another 72
      patients treated by FUS. Treating physician, as of his/her normal practice, might offer
      additional treatment of other type in cases where pain score of the treated lesion will not
      improve by at least 2 points, and will remain 4 or greater. Additional treatment may be
      performed up to one month following treatment. Prior to offering alternative treatment, an
      MRI will be performed to evaluate effect on the lesion. Patient receiving another treatment,
      different from the initial one (i.e. patient initially treated with FUS is now treated by
      EBRT) will be considered as treatment failures for the primary analysis and their post-x-over
      follow-up results will be analyzed separately.
