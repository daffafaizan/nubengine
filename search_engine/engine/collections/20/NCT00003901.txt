    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the relationship between three indicators of occult metastases (cytological
           examination of pleural lavage, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay of lymph nodes, and IHC
           assay of rib bone marrow) and survival of patients with resectable non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Determine the relationship between these indicators and conventional histology.

        -  Model survival considering the indicators and other patient attributes that are of prime
           prognostic significance.

        -  Determine the relationships between the indicators and the site of first recurrence in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the prevalence of the indicators in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationships between the indicators and disease free survival in these
           patients.
