      patients with Mullerian carcinoma (closed to accrual as of 8/23/01), gastrointestinal
      carcinoma, or peritoneal mesothelioma (closed to accrual as of 8/23/01). II. Determine the
      qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intraperitoneal
      interleukin-12 over 30 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with
      stable or responsive disease may receive an additional 6 courses. Patients receive escalating
      doses of intraperitoneal interleukin-12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is established, additional patients are accrued to
      receive interleukin-12 at the recommended dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2
      years.
