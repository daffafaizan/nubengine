      I. Assess the safety of infusing ex vivo expanded natural killer (NK) cells in patients
      receiving busulfan-fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine) with an allogeneic human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) matched hematopoietic transplantation for myeloid malignancies. Two sources of
      NK cells could be studied, depending on what donor source is available: cells from the HLA
      matched related donor or cells from an unrelated cord blood unit.

      II. For each source of NK cells: the maximum tolerated cell dose; the phenotype and function
      of the ex vivo expanded NK cells and their survival in vivo; the rate of engraftment,
      graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), immune reconstitution, relapse rates and survival for patients
      receiving this regimen will be determined.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of NK cells followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and busulfan IV over 3
      hours on days -13 to -10. Patients then receive allogeneic CD56-positive CD3-negative natural
      killer cells IV over 1 hour on day -8. Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC)
      once daily (QD) on days -8 to -4. Patients then undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) transplant on day 0.
