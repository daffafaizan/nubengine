      cyclophosphamide or interstitial lung disease requiring cyclophosphamide to be administered
      either daily orally; monthly intravenously; or intravenously every 2 weeks for 6 doses.
      Because cyclophosphamide treatment may be required urgently for some indications, study entry
      may occur before either the first or second dose of cyclophosphamide for patients receiving
      cyclophosphamide intravenously.

      Of 16 participants who were screened, only 14 were randomized and only 7 participants
      actually completed the study. Due to this low number, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      levels were not obtained.

      Secondary outcome measures that are not available include presence of menses and FSH.
