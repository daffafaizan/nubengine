      prostate cancer screening, and therefore the investigators will focus on employing the best
      possible means for reducing them. The project introduces a novel concept for PC screening
      that minimises overdiagnosis and overtreatment, while retaining the mortality benefit to
      shift the balance of screening benefits and harms to a favourable net effect. The strategy
      for implementation as a randomised screening trial utilises three levels of risk assessment
      (PSA, kallikrein panel and MRI) before the diagnostic procedure (prostate biopsy), each aimed
      at eliminating detection of indolent disease. The study hypothesis is that by virtue of the
      novel three-tiered screening algorithm, the beneficial screening effect (prostate cancer
      mortality reduction) can be retained, while the overdiagnosis can be largely eliminated. The
      impact of an integrative approach has never been evaluated - each of the methods has only
      been assessed in isolation. The breakthrough potential of the proposal lies in combining the
      three novel approaches and taking them to the forefront of applied research through a
      randomised trial. The key impact of the study is in defining whether the overall balance of
      benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening can be reversed by applying the best possible
      methods to detect only clinically important disease. If the study hypothesis is affirmed, it
      opens the way to introduction of prostate cancer screening. If the balance of harms and
      benefits is still unfavourable, the problem of overdiagnosis in prostate cancer may be
      intractable.
