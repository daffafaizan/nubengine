    
      This study is an extension out to 5 year follow-up of a randomized comparative IDE trial of
      the CHARITÉ™ Artificial Disc vs. ALIF with the BAK cage for treatment of degenerative disc
      disease. The original 2-year trial demonstrated non-inferiority of the CHARITÉ™ compared to
      ALIF.

      This extension will continue to follow-up the original outcome measures and will also examine
      adjacent segment progression.
