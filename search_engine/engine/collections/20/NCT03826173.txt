      for a positive psychology intervention program to promote exercise among low-active
      overweight and obese adults. The program will be (a) a 6-week, group-based intervention, (b)
      delivered at local YMCAs, and (c) supplemented with text messaging. In an additive design,
      participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PPPA (n = 40) versus a control intervention
      (n = 20) including only the standard PA promotion components of the PPPA intervention (i.e.,
      PA education, self-monitoring, and goal-setting), with equal frequency of staff contact and
      text message delivery. All participants will be followed for 3 months, and will receive a
      3-month YMCA membership to equate access to PA facilities. As a secondary aim the
      investigators will examine effect sizes for PPPA versus the standard PA intervention on
      putative mediators that may underlie the efficacy of PPPA in improving PA outcomes, including
      positive and negative affect, optimism, happiness, life satisfaction, social support for PA,
      and PA enjoyment. The proposed research will set the stage for an RCT to test a novel PA
      promotion intervention that can be readily disseminated.
