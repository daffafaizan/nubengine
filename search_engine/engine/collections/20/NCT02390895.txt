      for the prenatal surgery of myelomeningocele offers at least two potential advantages: i) it
      may reduce the maternal and obstetric morbidity related to the hysterotomy; ii) it may be
      performed earlier in gestation than open surgery, therefore potentially further reducing
      exposition of the spinal chord to the intraamniotic environment and thus improving the
      overall prognosis of the malformation. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and
      potential benefits of a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure for the prenatal treatment of
      myelomeningocele in a single-center trial.

      Technically the procedure will be performed through 2 intra-amniotic ports, under fetoscopic
      visualization and intra-amniotic carbon dioxide insufflation. The defect will be dissected
      and the cord replaced in the canal. Closure will be performed by suturing paravertebral
      muscles using a barbed running suture. A Duragen patch will be sutured when primary closure
      is deemed impossible.
