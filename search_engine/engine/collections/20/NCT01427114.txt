      including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP) did not show the acceptable
      response rate compared with radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy for this disease can cause
      many complications of eyes. This clinical trial was designed to examine the efficacy of R-CVP
      combination therapy as a first-line treatment for stage I or II non-conjunctival OAML aiming
      to avoid radiation hazard and increase the efficacy of CVP chemotherapy.
