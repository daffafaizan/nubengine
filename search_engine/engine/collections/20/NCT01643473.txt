    
      Using a randomized controlled trial design, this study will compare the efficacy of a
      tailored adherence intervention (TAI) to a single patient education (PE) session, on
      medication adherence among 40 high-risk Black and Latino patients with uncontrolled
      hypertension (HTN) who are non-adherent to their prescribed antihypertensive medications.
      Patients randomized to the PE group will receive a single tablet delivered patient education
      session at the baseline visit. Patients randomized to the TAI group will complete a tailoring
      survey at the baseline visit to identify the most salient adherence barriers to the
      individual, which will be used to create an individualized adherence profile. Following
      completion of the tailoring survey, patients will collaborate with the RA to identify the
      most suitable mix of intervention strategies for improving medication adherence (i.e.,
      reminder aids, motivational interviewing, case management) that are matched to the barriers
      outlined on patients' individualized adherence profiles.
