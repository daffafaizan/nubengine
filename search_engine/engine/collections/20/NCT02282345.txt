      I. To evaluate the feasibility of using talazoparib prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant
      therapies.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity profile in women taking talazoparib in the neoadjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide first estimate of clinical response to talazoparib in the neoadjuvant setting
      in a pilot trial setting.

      II. To evaluate biomarkers of therapy efficacy as well as initiate patient derived xenograft
      (PDX) models: targeted or whole exome sequencing for BRCA pathway mutations and other somatic
      and germline alterations; ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing; evaluation of changes in immune
      response; transcriptional profile to assess triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype,
      BRCA-ness signature and putative PARP sensitivity predictors; functional proteomics with
      reverse phase protein array (RPPA); generate PDX models and mammosphere cultures from patient
      derived tumors; PTEN, gamma-H2A histone family, member x (gamma-H2A.X), Ki-67 and cleaved
      caspase 3 by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then proceed to the standard of care therapy of the treating physician's
      choice.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until the day after definitive
      breast surgery.
