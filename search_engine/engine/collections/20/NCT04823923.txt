    
      This study involves patients treated with cabozantinib or pazopanib in their metastatic renal
      cancer.

      Indeed, the aim of this study is to assess the blood concentration of these two drugs as well
      as their tolerance, in relation to their renal function (normal renal function or moderate or
      severe renal failure).

      Pazopanib and cabozantinib are kinase inhibitors that are indicated for a number of cancer
      conditions, including metastatic kidney cancer.

      Both of these oral therapies require a daily intake of the drug to ensure its effectiveness.

      For this, the patient must have optimal compliance and benefit from regular follow up to
      assess clinical and biological tolerance.

      Chronic renal failure is a factor that may impact the efficacy and toxicity of pazopanib and
      cabozantinib. This may be due either to a elimination default of the drug or to much
      elimination if the drug is filtered after dialysis.

      As a result, kinase inhibitors could be impacted by chronic renal failure and thus modify the
      safety and efficacy of the treatment.

      A study-specific blood test will be taken at 1 month and at 3 months during a consultation
      (this blood test is in addition to the routine blood test). Its analysis will evaluate the
      quantity of medication present in the blood.

      The other objective of this study is to evaluate the side effects of the drug taken by the
      patient (pazopanib or cabozantinib).

      This will alow to propose possible dose adjustments for each of these treatments and thus
      improve the management of these patients.
