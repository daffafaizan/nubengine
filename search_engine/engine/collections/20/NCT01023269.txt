      intractable (functional) disorders of the pelvis and lower urinary or intestinal tract
      through the sacral nerve or the pudendal nerve systems.

      This trial is designed to demonstrate that neuromodulation of the pudendal nerve will
      effectively treat patients with neurogenic overactive bladder. Symptoms of urinary
      incontinence are compared when stimulation is switched on for 4 weeks to stimulation switched
      off for 4 weeks. After the eight week crossover period, all patients receive treatment and
      are followed up within the study for 12 months post implant.
