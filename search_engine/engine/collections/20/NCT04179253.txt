      of uterine cavity pathology, many gynecologist are reluctant to perform hysteroscopy as an
      initial test without a high degree of suspicion for pathology due to the need for anesthesia
      in an operating room setting. The basic infertility work-up has included a HSG to evaluate
      the uterine cavity and tubal patency. However, HSG does not allow for simultaneous correction
      of uterine pathology. Moreover HSG may miss 35% of uterine abnormalities. Hysterolaparoscopy
      (Pan Endoscopic) approach is better than HSG and should be encouraged as first and final
      procedure in selected infertile women.

      Sonohysterography (SHG) has been proposed as a better diagnostic test of the uterine cavity.
      However, it also suffers from a sensitivity and specificity inferior to that of hysteroscopy
      in most studies.
