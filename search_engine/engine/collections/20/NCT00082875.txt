      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of EMD 121974 at two different doses in patients with
      metastatic melanoma by determining the progression-free survival rate at 8 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate of EMD 121974 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      II. To determine the overall survival in patients who receive EMD 121974. III. To determine
      the safety and toxicity of EMD 121974 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      IV. To determine the population pharmacokinetics of EMD 121974. V. To determine the
      biological activity of EMD 121974 in melanoma cells of patients who are treated with the
      drug.

      VI. To evaluate the use of optical imaging and functional dynamic imaging scans in assessing
      biological activity of EMD 121974.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      systemic treatment (yes vs no), visceral metastases (yes vs no), serum lactic dehydrogenase
      level (normal vs abnormal), and tumor integrin α_vβ_3 overexpression (yes vs no). Patients
      are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11*, 15, 18, 22, and 25.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *For the first course only, treatment is omitted on day 11.

      ARM II: Patients receive cilengitide as in arm I at a higher dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
