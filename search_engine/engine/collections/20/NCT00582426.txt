      adjuvant chemotherapy or first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease with a regimen
      containing fluorouracil, capecitabine and/or irinotecan. Eligible chemotherapy regimens
      include Irinotecan, Leucovorin (folinic acid), and Fluorouracil(IFL), Leucovorin,
      Fluorouracil, and Irinotecan (FOLFIRI), combinations of Irinotecan and Capecitabine, the
      Roswell Park regimen and the Mayo Clinic regimen, all of them without or with Oxaliplatin,
      Bevacizumab or Cetuximab. Patients receiving Erlotinib, or other Tyrosine-kinase, Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-inhibitors, will not be eligible.

      The acute treatment for diarrhea will be left to physician's discretion in both groups.
      Patients in the control arm will be treated without Octreotide LAR. Patients in the
      experimental arm will receive the first dose of Octreotide LAR (30 mg) at chemotherapy
      initiation, in addition to a minimum of two more identical monthly doses of Octreotide LAR
      (with an interval of 28 days between them), until chemotherapy is discontinued or for a
      maximum of six doses of Octreotide LAR, whichever occurs first. Patient evaluation will be
      done at each cycle for efficacy and toxicity.
