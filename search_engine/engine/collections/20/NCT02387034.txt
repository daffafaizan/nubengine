      consist of exercise, information about osteoarthritis and if necessary, weight reduction. It
      is well documented that exercise has a positive effect on pain and physical function in these
      patients. Therefore, it is important to have methods to increase physical activity levels in
      these patients. It is not explored whether an intervention with PAP may lead to increased
      physical activity in patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis. The study will be a
      prospective, randomized, single-blind intervention study including 140 patients (70
      patients/group). Patients will in a parallel design be randomized to intervention or control
      group. Both groups receive oral and written information about osteoarthritis and if
      necessary, advice on weight loss. The intervention group receives Swedish Physical activity
      on prescription. It is a patient-centered counselling about physical activity related to the
      disease. The counselling results in an individualized written prescription on physical
      activity including specific modes on physical activity. After three weeks, three months and
      six months they are offered a follow up which could be by telephone or personal meeting.
      During the follow up they discuss who the physical activity works out and plan new goals. The
      control group will receive an intervention with general advice about being active three times
      a week and do strength training functional during the day. Patients in the control group see
      the physiotherapist once.
