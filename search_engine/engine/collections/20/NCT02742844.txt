    
      This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of ABCB5+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with chronic
      venous ulcer (CVU). Autologous MSCs will be isolated ex vivo from a small skin biopsy and
      will be expanded in vitro. The IMP APZ2 containing the ABCB5+ cells will then be applied on
      the wound surface of CVU under local anesthesia.

      Patients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound
      healing from transient wound coverage.

      The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size
      evaluation will start on the day of the first change of wound dressing. The quality of the
      wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue,
      epithelialization and wound exudation.

      Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated
      with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of APZ2 an
      additional follow-up visit at Month 12 post IMP application is included.
