    
      For this prospective study, 22 individuals were selected, with skeletal discrepancies
      randomly divided into two groups: 1 - accelerated tooth movement technique (ATMT) and 2 -
      Control.

      Orthodontic records done in two times, initial and preoperative; Gingival Crevicular Fluid
      samples will be collected using periopapers in 7 times (1, 2, 7, 14, 28 days and after space
      closure- end of orthodontic treatment movement activation).

      Flapless cortical perforations will be made in ATMT Group after dental extraction. Surgical
      protocol will be flapless to preserve periodontal health.

      After extraction space closure, results will be assessed by clinical effects with biological
      markers levels:

      CCL3/MIP-1 alpha, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL8/IL8, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL6, TNF-alpha, TRANCE/RANK
      L, OCN OPG IL-10 VEGF TGF-â„¬

      Those biomarkers levels will be performed using ELISA Assays. After collecting data, the
      results will be statistically analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk and, posteriorly, T-student or
      Wilcoxon.
