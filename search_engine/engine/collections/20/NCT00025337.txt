      I. Compare the response, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with
      previously treated advanced or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with oxaliplatin,
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil with or without bevacizumab versus bevacizumab only.
      (Arm III closed to accrual as of 03/11/2003).

      II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance
      status (0 vs 1 or 2), and prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on
      day 1. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil (5-FU) IV
      over 22 hours on days 1 and 2.

      Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and 5-FU as in arm I.

      Arm III: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. (Arm closed to accrual as of 03/11/2003).

      Courses in all arms repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response may receive 2 additional
      courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
