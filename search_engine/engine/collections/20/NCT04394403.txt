      reducing stress in the time of COVID-19. Two studies are proposed: 1) an international study
      in English in which individuals proficient in English throughout the world will participate
      and 2) a study in Hebrew. The first study will publicize via social media and participants
      will be randomized to either immediate participation or a 6 week waitlist period. Assessments
      will be conducted pre, (again after waitlist for the control group), posttx (after
      completion/cessation of the program), 6 month and 1 year followup. Two forms of assessment
      will be conducted: pre-post-follow-up (with the CRISIS measure) and weekly during the program
      (via the DASS-21). For the full program see: https://www.iterapi.se/sites/coronastress/
