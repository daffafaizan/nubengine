      nasal obstruction in the pediatric population. Chronic rhinitis may result in mucous gland
      hypertrophy, engorgement of the vascular system and deposition of collagen in the nasal
      mucosa. These changes occur most prominently in the inferior turbinate, causing enlargement
      and nasal obstruction. In children, inferior turbinate hypertrophy is associated with a
      greater degree of nasal obstruction relative to adults because of their small nasal anatomy.

      Cases that do not respond to conservative treatments may be considered for one of many
      surgical procedures, including turbinate excision, submucosal resection, submucosal cautery,
      laser treatment, cryosurgery, powered microdebridement, or radiofrequency-based ablation.
      Clinical studies have shown that bipolar radiofrequency-based plasma (CoblationÂ®) devices are
      capable of creating focal submucosal lesions with minimal or no damage to structures adjacent
      to the treated area. At present, however, this technique has not been formally evaluated in
      children. This study will investigate whether surgical turbinate reduction performed using a
      Coblation device is associated with reduced nasal obstruction symptoms that has failed to
      improve with other treatment methodologies.
