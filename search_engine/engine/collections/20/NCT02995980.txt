      mammography to detect breast cancer in patients with increased breast density (Breast
      Imaging-Reporting And Data System category c or d). Eligible patients will be invited to have
      full-field digital mammography and dual-energy (DE) contrast-enhanced (CE) digital
      mammography to compare accuracy of the imaging methods for the detection of breast cancer
