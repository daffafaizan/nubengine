      contrast-free method for observing intracranial vessels and is widely utilized as a screening
      examination for intracranial aneurysms. The studies available in Medline show mixed
      results.Some of these studies just included MRI/MRA in the analysis, which have a high rate
      of false-positives and are unreliable, and some were lack of control (ruptured aneurysm),
      precise numbers of false-positive results, standard images process and review, or
      corroborative IADSA in some patients. Furthermore, most previous studies included small
      sample size with aneurysm detection at 0.5-T or 1.5-T MR. Thus, these results have been
      inconclusive because of certain pitfalls in these studies.

      Since 2007, we have conducted a clinical study to objective detection of intracranial
      aneurysms in our routine diagnostic work-up of intracranial aneurysms by our
      neuroradiologists using a standard procedure with 3D-TOF-MRA with VR at 3T. The investigators
      want to establish the quality data to prospectively compare 3D-TOF-MRA with VR at 3T vs
      3D-RDSA in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms in a largest cohort of patients and test
      it accuracy in screening for suspected patients
