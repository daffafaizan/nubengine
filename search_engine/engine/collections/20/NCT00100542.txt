      significantly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Although the effects of HIV on the CNS
      are not fully understood, there is growing evidence that the effects are psychosocial in
      nature; HIV infected children experience higher rates of psychiatric symptoms and
      hospitalizations than their uninfected counterparts. Confounding the HIV CNS relationship is
      evidence suggesting that the CNS effects of HIV may also be related to antiretroviral
      treatment. This study will examine the rates and severity of psychiatric symptoms in both HIV
      infected and uninfected children and adolescents. In addition, this study will determine the
      relationship between duration of antiretroviral treatment and psychiatric symptoms.

      No treatment will be given as part of this study. The study will last for 96 weeks and be
      divided into two parts. In Part 1, HIV infected and uninfected participants and their
      caregivers will complete a series of measures and questionnaires regarding mental health,
      pain, and adherence to treatment. In Part 2, all participants and their caregivers will
      complete a subset of the original measures at Weeks 48 and 96. This follow-up part of the
      study will assess any long-term changes in psychiatric symptoms. In addition, a subset of HIV
      infected and uninfected participants and their caregivers will take part in psychiatric
      interviews at specified study sites. A portion of these interviews will be audio-taped.
