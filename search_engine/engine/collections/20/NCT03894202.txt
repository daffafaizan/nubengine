        1. To evaluate outcomes in patients admitted with poor neurological status after
           intracranial aneurysm rupture in Hong Kong;

        2. To evaluate whether ultra-early aneurysm treatment improves outcomes in patients
           admitted with poor neurological status after intracranial aneurysm rupture.

      Hypothesis to be tested: Ultra-early aneurysm treatment increases chance of favorable
      outcomes in in patients admitted with poor neurological status after intracranial aneurysm
      rupture.

      Design and subjects: Prospective observational study to recruit consecutive poor grade
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the seven public neurosurgical services in
      Hong Kong.

      Study instruments: Modified Rankin Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Stroke-Specific
      Quality of Life, Short Form-36, Return to Work, and hospital resource utilization.

      Groups: Ultra-early (within initial 24 hours) and non-ultra early aneurysm treatment.

      Main outcome measures: Favorable outcome at six months. Data analysis and expected results:
      Comparisons are carried out with adjustments for age, sex, admission Glasgow Coma Scale,
      hypertension, and modality of aneurysm treatment with appropriate regression analyses.
