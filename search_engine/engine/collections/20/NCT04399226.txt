      groups were included. Patients that had severe organ disease, allergies to study drugs,
      refused to participate in the study were excluded. Cases were randomized into the
      dexmedetomidine-propofol group (Group D, n=30) and ketamine-propofol group (Group K, n=30).
      Cardiac monitoring, peripheral oxygen saturation, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring were
      performed. Group D received 1mg/kg dexmedetomidine+0.5mg/kg propofol intravenous (iv) bolus,
      0.5 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine+ 0.5 mg/kg/h propfol infusion. Group K received 0.125 mL/kg
      bolus, 0.125 mL/kg/h ketamine+ propofol = ketofol infusion (ketofol was prepared with 4 mg
      propofol+2 mg ketamine). Patients were followed up with a Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) of≥4.
      Mean, standard deviation, mean, lowest-highest frequency and ratio values were used in
      descriptive statistics of the data, SPSS 22.0 program was used for the analyses.
