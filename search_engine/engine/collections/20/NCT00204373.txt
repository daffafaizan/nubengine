      including Zollinger-Ellison using Prevacid. The immediate objective is to heal peptic ulcers
      and eliminate symptoms and in the long term to prevent relapse of symptoms, lesions and
      complications. Other objectives include observation of the efficacy in controlling gastric
      acid production and of the safety of high dose, long-term use of Prevacid.
