      proposed intervention utilizes an innovative evidence-based approach while addressing the
      shortcomings of prior individual intervention components. In this project, investigators seek
      to refine a smoking cessation app by conducting two rounds of usability testing followed by a
      pilot test of the final app, to access usability problems, user satisfaction, and
      user-friendliness. This data will be collected in a de-identified and confidential manner,
      and will then be analyzed and used to refine the final app that will later be used.
