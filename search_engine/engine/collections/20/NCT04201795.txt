      to 40 years old, not obese. Participants will be randomized into two groups. Experimental
      group performed a bilateral plantar fascia manual pressure and traction technique. Control
      group performed a laser placebo. The time duration (5 minutes), position, and therapist were
      the same for both treatments. The investigators will measure stabilometry variables and
      static footprint. The footprint variables will be divided in bilateral rear foot, bilateral
      midfoot, bilateral fore foot.

      Measures. Stabilometry will be measured by displacement of the center of pressures in X and Y
      with eyes open and closed , center of pressure (COP) with eyes open and closed, COP area with
      eyes open and closed, COP antero-posterior (a-p) and medio-lateral (m-lat) directions with
      eyes open and closed, and COP speed. Two trials will be recorded for each condition and the
      order of the conditions will be randomized across subjects, eyes open and eyes closed. Foot
      plantar pressure and surface area of two static footprints will be measured during bipedal
      standing. Static plantar pressure will be evaluated by means of maximum pressure, medium
      pressure and surface area of each aspect of the foot (rearfoot, midfoot, and fore foot).
