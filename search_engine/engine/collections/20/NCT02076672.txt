      pleural disease, and therefore at increased risk of mesothelioma, the investigators will
      evaluate whether the treatment with the commercially-available Artichoke Whole Phytocomplex
      Concentrate (Artichoke WPC) for 90 days will decrease mesothelin serum levels.

      Although the investigators have general information on toxicity in humans, the investigators
      will monitor and assess the potential toxicity of Artichoke WPC in this patient population.

      In addition to mesothelin, the investigators plan to evaluate the effects of Artichoke WPC on
      serum microRNAs (miRNAs). The use of miRNAs as minimally-invasive biomarkers has opened new
      opportunities for the diagnosis of cancer. A number of studies have addressed the potential
      association of disregulated miRNA profiling and benign asbestos-related disease and
      mesothelioma. Thus, the investigators will evaluate serum miRNA profiling before and after
      treatment with Artichoke WPC.
