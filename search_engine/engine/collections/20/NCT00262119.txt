      compared to DDDR pacing in sinus node disfunction patients.

      Several authors have shown that, in patients with intact AV conduction, unnecessary chronic
      RV pacing can cause detrimental effects such as AF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and
      congestive heart failure. These findings arose the hypothesis that the non-physiologic nature
      of ventricular pacing may result in electrophysiological and LV remodeling changes that have
      potentially deleterious long-term effects.

      The MVP mode, present in the Medtronic pacemaker EnRhythm, provides atrial based pacing with
      ventricular backup. It operates in true AAI(R) mode, it provides ventricular backup in case
      of a single conduction loss and converts to DDD(R) mode in case of persistent loss of AV
      conduction.

      Aim of this study is to test the impact of the MVP pacing mode and atrial preventive and
      antitachycardia pacing therapies on the reduction of a composite clinical outcome composed by
      any death, permanent AF, cardiovascular hospitalizations.
