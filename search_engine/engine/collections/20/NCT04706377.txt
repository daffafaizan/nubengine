      on metformin treatment for at least four years, and both peripheral and autonomic diabetic
      neuropathy were randomized to an active treatment group (n=44) receiving B12, and a control
      group (n=46) receiving placebo. All patients had B12 levels less than 400 pmol/L. Subjects
      underwent measurement of sural nerve conduction velocity and amplitude, vibration perception
      threshold, and performed cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs: Mean Circular
      Resultant, Valsalva test, postural index and orthostatic hypotension]). Sudomotor function
      was assessed with the SUDOSCAN that measures electrochemical skin conductance in hands and
      feet. The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Questionnaire and Examination and
      questionnaires to evaluate quality of life and level of pain were also used.
