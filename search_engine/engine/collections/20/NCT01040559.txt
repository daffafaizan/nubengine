      cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most of the patients are diagnosed at
      intermediate-advanced stage when the sole standard treatment is transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE). In the literature, survival rates in TACE studies vary widely and
      finally, there is no suggestion for the best chemotherapeutic agent or the optimal treatment
      regimen.

      We hypothesise that the use of idarubicin (the most cytotoxic drug on HCC cell lines) in DC
      Bead would enhance the efficacy of TACE. The primary objective of the study is to determine
      the maximal tolerated dose of idarubicin in DC Bead for chemoembolization of non resectable
      non metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
