      evidence on the effects of vildagliptin on key biomarkers of atherothrombosis and
      inflammation. We plan to prospectively enroll 60 patients with proven coronary artery disease
      and randomize them in a 2:1 ratio to either vildagliptin-metformin therapy (n=40) or
      metformin therapy (n=20).
