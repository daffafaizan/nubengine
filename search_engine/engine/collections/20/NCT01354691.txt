      investigational compound ladostigil versus placebo in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
      patients. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the trial will be 26
      weeks in duration and will involve two cohorts (i.e. one arm receiving ladostigil and one arm
      receiving placebo). After the initial 26 week period, all participating subjects will receive
      26 weeks of treatment with ladostigil (i.e. the open label phase). A total of five
      territories will be participating in this trial. These include Austria, Croatia, Germany,
      Serbia and Spain.
