      periods, in which the healthy volunteers received, in each period, the test or the reference
      formulation after standardized meals. Test product is Rosiglitazone Maleate + Metformin -
      Avandamet 4 mg + 1000 mg (GlaxoSmithKline Brasil Ltda) in the form of film coated tablets.
      Reference product is Rosiglitazone Maleate + Metformin - Avandamet 2 mg + 500 mg (Glaxo Smith
      Kline Brasil Ltda) in the form of film coated tablets. The population is composed by 26
      healthy volunteers, adults, of both genders and their ages varied between 18 and 50 years.
      Their body mass index (BMI) varied between 18,5 and 25. There are no restrictions regarding
      the ethnic group. The relative bioavailability of the two formulations, after oral
      administration, will be evaluated based on statistical comparisons of relevant
      pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from data of drug concentration in blood.
