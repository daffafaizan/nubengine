      down-titrated based on a combination of efficacy and safety parameters followed by a fixed
      dose period during which no dose adjustments were allowed. Participants completed a 7-day
      patient diary prior to every visit (start of 905-CL-076 to end of 905-CL-077, 14 visits). The
      first visit of this study (905-CL-077) was combined with the last visit of the 4-month study
      905-CL-076. At each visit, the participant was required to undertake a number of assessments
      or examinations to determine whether it is safe for him/her to take part or to continue to
      take part in the study.
