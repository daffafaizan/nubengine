      after laparoscopic colon resection without fast track. Length of hospital stay and recovery
      seems to be reduced as well.

      OBJEKTIVE: To compare laparoscopic and open colonic resection concerning nursing hours,
      length of hospital stay and recovery.

      DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: triple blinded study (Patient, nursing staff and data
      collector) including 2 x 12 patients needing sigmoid resection due to cancer. Nursing hours,
      length of hospital stay and recovery (postoperative pain, questionnaire, actigraph ect.)
