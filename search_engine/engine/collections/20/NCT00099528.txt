    
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study.
      After screening and baseline clinical assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive 30 or 100 mg REN-1654 by mouth (p.o.), or matching placebo, once daily for 3 weeks.
      After 3 weeks of treatment, the clinical assessments will be repeated. Subjects who complete
      the 3 week placebo-controlled segment may enter the 3-week active-treatment extension
      segment, during which subjects in the REN-1654 30 mg group will remain on that dose, subjects
      who were given placebo in the previous segment will receive REN-1654 100 mg daily, and
      subjects who received REN 1654 100 mg in the first 3 week study segment will discontinue
      dosing. Double-blind conditions will be maintained through the placebo-controlled active
      treatment period (primary efficacy endpoint) and for those continuing dosing into the 3-week
      second active treatment period. The clinical assessments will be repeated at the end of 6
      weeks, after which all subjects will discontinue treatment and return 2 weeks later for the
      final clinical assessment.
