      ventilation and outcomes (mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay,
      hospital length of stay). Enrolled patients will undergo a water sip test in the ICU and a
      videofluroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) performed by a registered speech-language
      pathologist (SLP). A VFSS is a videotaped or digitized dynamic fluoroscopic image that
      focuses on the oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal and upper esophageal swallow physiology. Patients
      will then be followed as two cohorts 1) patients that have dysphagia (or abnormal test) based
      on the VFSS, and 2) patients who have normal VFSS. We will then prospectively follow these
      two groups of patients during hospital stay censored at 30 days.
