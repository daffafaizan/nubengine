      written informed consent will be screened to determine eligibility for study entry. At week
      0, study participants who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a blind
      manner (participant only) in a 3:1 block ratio. The study will randomize 750 subjects to the
      composite group visit and 250 subjects to the dietitian-led group into a 12-months duration
      study.

      For Aim 2: A subset of 200 participants who identify as female and over 50 years old and
      males over 40 years old randomized to either the composite group arm or the dietitian-led arm
      will have the option to take part in a sub-study that involves getting a Coronary Artery
      Calcium (CAC) scan done at the Lundquist Institute. The first 125 subjects in the composite
      group arm and the first 75 subjects in the dietitian-led arm that express interest and want
      to undergo CAC scanning and perivascular fat measurements at baseline and at 12-months of
      intervention will need to sign a separate consent for these procedures. CAC scan readers will
      be blind to the assigned group. A group of 100 subjects not participating in the aim 1
      intervention will be able to join the study under the control group. These participants will
      not be randomly assigned.
