      treatment of low risk MDS with del(5q). Treatment of this subgroup of MDS patients resulted
      in 67% major erythroid responses and 45% complete cytogenetic responses. We therefore intend
      to test the efficacy of lenalidomide in a group of high-risk patients who are ineligible for
      conventional chemotherapy and who have a dismal prognosis. The patients must have a karyotype
      including del(5q) but patients with a karyotype including monosomy 5 are also eligible. We
      hypothesize that hight risk MDS or AML patients with other chromosomal aberrations than
      del(5q) can be affected by the lenalidomide effect.
