      population. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, also called psoriasis
      vulgaris. A variety of drugs, including biologics, are available for treatment of moderate to
      severe psoriasis. When biologic agents are stopped, psoriasis can return (relapse) and often
      requires the biologic to be restarted and continued. No treatment program has been identified
      to prevent relapse of psoriasis.

      The study design has a lead-in period of weight-based ustekinumab treatment, with all
      participants receiving either 45 mg ustekinumab (<= 100 kg) or 90 mg ustekinumab (> 100 kg)
      administered subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4. At week 12, participants will be assessed for a
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response to ustekinumab. Participants who do not
      achieve a PASI 75 score will be discontinued from the investigation and permitted to seek
      standard therapy.
