      of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation patients will normalize the metabolic abnormalities.
      The secondary hypothesis posits that galactose intervention in Congenital Disorders of
      Glycosylation patients will normalize specific physiological biomarkers of protein
      glycosylation that can be utilized for future phase II/III trial development. The knowledge
      gained from the investigation of these two aims will help the investigators learn more about
      the disrupted metabolic mechanism of this disease and should lead to the identification of
      new disease biomarkers that can be used to evaluate clinical efficacy in future therapeutic
      trials.

      Over a two-year period, the investigators will enroll patients diagnosed with Congenital
      Disorders of Glycosylation. The investigators propose to administer oral galactose
      supplementation for a period of 18 weeks in increasing dose to assess its effectiveness at
      normalizing glycosylation. Galactose will be given in a series of doses within the range of
      normal dietary intake of galactose over fixed time points. To assess the effects of oral
      galactose supplementation for each participant, changes in participant growth, as well as
      blood sugar levels, coagulation parameters and liver function (the primary clinical features
      of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation) will be correlated with biomarkers derived from
      participant blood and urine samples obtained at key time points and then compared to standard
      normative ranges of data for each measure.
