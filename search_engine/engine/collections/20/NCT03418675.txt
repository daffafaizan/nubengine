      impulsive behavior, and disturbed relationships (1-3). A variety of psychotherapies have been
      developed (4-6) and, while research on the use of medication is ongoing, no drug has been
      approved in the United States or elsewhere for its treatment (7). Second generation
      antipsychotics have been the most intensively studied (8-11). Current treatments for BPD are
      often inadequate. Dialectical behavioral therapy has been shown to reduce BPD but finding
      trained psychologists is difficult.

      Dysfunctions in the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems have been demonstrated in-and
      considered as possible causes for-symptoms associated with the disorder (25-28). Several
      studies on the use of traditional (29) and atypical antipsychotic agents in patients with
      borderline personality disorder (30-31) have shown a positive effect on individual symptoms
      (29, 32-36). However, we are not aware of any study evaluating Brexpiprazole in the treatment
      of patients with borderline personality disorder. In the proposed double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study, the influence of Brexpiprazole on the multifaceted
      psychopathological symptoms and aggression of patients with borderline personality disorder
      will be investigated.

      Brexpiprazole therefore has distinctive properties that make it a promising option for
      patients with BPD. Brexpiprazole is a novel D2 partial agonist, has affinity for 5-HT1A, acts
      as an antagonist of the noradrenergic Î±1/2 receptor, partial agonist for D3, and antagonist
      for 5-HT2A (37-39). In addition, because of low rates of side effects, Brexpiprazole should
      be a well-tolerated and in fact desired medication approach to BPD.
