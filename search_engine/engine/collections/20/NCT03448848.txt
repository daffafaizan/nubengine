    
      Patients will be enrolled in the study&randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive either
      intravenous (IV) BCAAs in a dose of 0.5-1gm/Kg/day for at least 48hours up to maximum 5 days
      immediately post-operative or placebo (sterile normal saline in a volume equal to the study
      drug).

      All demographic data will be obtained including the patients' age, sex, weight,associated
      co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus & hypertension), the presence of chronic liver disease
      (CLD), Child-Pugh score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), the type of liver
      surgery, & nutritional status according to nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002);
      well-nourished if NRS 2002 < 3 while malnourished if NRS 2002 â‰¥ 3 prior BCAAs infusion.

      Vital signs including the heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure
      (CVP), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), insulin requirements, urine volume & fluid balance
      will be recorded on admission (day 0), then will be followed up and recorded at regular
      intervals during treatment on 1, 3, 5 &7days.

      Laboratory investigations including the complete blood profile (white blood cells, band%,
      lymphocytes), prothrombin time (PT), liver enzymes; Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT),serum bilirubin, serum albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP)& kidney
      functions will be recorded at randomization as a baseline (day 0)& will be assessed on day
      0,1, 3, 5 & 7 of the study. Thirty-day survival & infectious morbidity will be followed by
      phone calls to the patient or one of his/her first-degree relatives.
