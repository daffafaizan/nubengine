    
      Purpose To evaluate whether mothers' gestational weight gain is associated with differences
      in maternal and their infants gut microbiota characteristics.

      Methods and analysis This is a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study including
      about 550 mother-infant pairs from PUMCH and other 3 hospitals in Beijing. After signing
      consent form, every participant will bring home a weighting scale for checking and record the
      weight every week from they enrolled to a year postpartum. The blood samples, fecal samples,
      vaginal swabs and oral swabs of the mothers will be collected at first, second, third
      trimester and postpartum 42 days. The infants' fecal samples will be collected at 0~3, 14, 42
      days and 3, 6, 9, 12 months after born. Questionnaire for mothers (diet, exercise, antibiotic
      and probiotic usage, oral hygiene habits etc.) and their infants (delivery mode, feeding
      pattern, antibiotic and probiotic usage etc.), as well as the medical records will be
      collected along with the sample collecting. Bio-specimen will be tested by 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing. Logistical regression and covariance analysis will be used to determine the
      relationships between the demographic data, gestational weight gain and microbiota
      composition.
