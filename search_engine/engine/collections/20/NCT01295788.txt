      type 1 diabetes. However, studies of RT-CGM in children and adolescents have been mostly
      negative. The lack of effectiveness in the pediatric population appears directly related to
      adherence to RT-CGM, i.e., the willingness of children and teens to wear and use this
      technology. Most previous RT-CGM studies have focused on experienced pump users or children
      with new-onset diabetes. At the time of pump initiation, children and adolescents who have
      been living with diabetes (and their parents) are highly motivated to make changes in their
      diabetes management and to take on additional responsibilities to improve their diabetes
      control and lifestyle, the two primary reasons for initiating pump therapy in the pediatric
      population. The investigators hypothesize that readiness for making changes in diabetes
      management will be greater at the time of pump initiation than at six months after the pump
      start. Further, the investigators hypothesize that readiness for change at the time of RT-CGM
      initiation will predict future adherence to RT-CGM and its effectiveness.
