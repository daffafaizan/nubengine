      the rates of PTSD have risen significantly, particularly among populations with repetitive
      exposure to critical incidents. The continued threat of attacks against Americans warrants
      development of preventive interventions to reduce the occurrence of PTSD and its precursor,
      ASD. This study will determine the effectiveness of a preventive treatment in urban
      firefighters who have experienced a traumatic event.

      Firefighters will undergo an initial assessment that will include an interview and
      self-report questionnaires to measure depression, anxiety, coping skills, social support,
      physical health, and work functioning. Following the occurrence of a traumatic work-related
      event, firefighters will be reassessed. The post-incident assessment will consist of
      self-report questionnaires that assess ASD symptoms.

      Participants who display ASD symptoms will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the
      first group will learn cognitive behavioral strategies for symptom reduction, and the second
      group will receive psychoeducation regarding common reactions to traumatic events.
      Participants' treatment will last for 12 weeks. Participants will have follow-up assessments
      1 and 3 months after the interventional part of the study. Assessments will include clinical
      scales and interviews.
