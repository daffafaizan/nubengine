      Primary

        -  To evaluate unacceptable bleeding or hepatic failure at 10 weeks post-treatment in
           patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with transarterial
           chemoembolization in combination with sunitinib malate versus transarterial
           chemoembolization alone.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival of these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the tumor stabilization rate in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the relapse-free survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the quality of life of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival rate at 2 years of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Pilot: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Beginning 7-10 days
      later, patients undergo 1-3 courses of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks for 1 year.

      Randomization: Patients are stratified according to main tumor diameter (< 5 cm vs â‰¥ 5 cm),
      nodular involvement (uninodular vs multinodular), and center. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive sunitinib malate and TACE as in the pilot phase.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-28 and TACE as in the pilot
           phase.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.
