      randomized into intervention and control groups. Intervention group subjects used BCSMS App
      and the control group subjects received usual care. Two questionnaires: EORTC QLQ-C30 and
      EORTC QLQ-BR 23 were distributed to subjects in both arms at baseline and at 1.5 and 3
      months. All evaluations were anonymous.
