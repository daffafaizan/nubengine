      Urological Association to update its guidelines in 2015 to include mirabegron as an
      alternative first-line agent for treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). NGB symptoms are very
      similar to OAB so the conditions are often treated similarly; however, data is lacking on the
      use of this promising agent for NGB. We thus propose to test the hypothesis that cognition
      will improve with substitution of mirabegron for the AC agent in elderly persons with SCI who
      require NGB treatment.

      Subjects eligible for enrollment will have been treated with an anticholinergic agent for at
      least 3 months prior to enrollment. Baseline measurements will be recorded for subjects
      currently treated with an AC agent, after enrollment, the subject will start treatment with
      the study drug. Measurements from baseline (AC agent) will be compared to measurements taken
      after study intervention (mirabegron).
