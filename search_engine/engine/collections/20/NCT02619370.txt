      game format will stimulate participants to engage in additional ACP behaviors including
      completion of ADs. We will use the ACP Engagement Survey to measure readiness to perform ACP,
      which includes measures of the "stage of change" for performing ACP behaviors.

      The proposed study has two specific aims:

      Aim 1. To determine whether individuals who play a conversation game are more likely to
      subsequently complete an online AD (called 'Making Your Wishes Known'; MYWK) compared to
      individuals who receive standard information about ACP. Our hypothesis is that playing a
      conversation game will result in a higher AD completion rate (compared to control) in the
      three months following the intervention.

      Aim 2. To identify which participant and/or conversation-related factors influence movement
      along the stages of change continuum with respect to ACP behaviors (discussing end-of-life
      wishes with families or clinicians and then completing ADs). Our hypotheses are that: H1) the
      game intervention will lead to higher quality conversations than the control; and H2)
      participants whose conversations consist of high-quality ACP discussions will be more likely
      to progress toward enacting ACP behaviors (as measured by the ACP Engagement Survey score)
      than those participants whose conversations consist of low-quality discussions.
