      are more appropriate than others in people over 65 years of age. This study therefore aims to
      describe the frequency of the DSM-5 criteria for the substance use disorder in a population
      over 65 years of age and to link it secondarily to the severity of the addiction.

      The study is a descriptive study of a population of subjects over 65 years old. It aims to
      search for addiction criteria in this population by formulating the hypothesis of an
      addictive vulnerability relating to certain risk factors.

      To sensitize the detection of criteria, we chose among older subjects those who are most at
      risk because they are more exposed to the vulnerability factor relative to this population
      (physical disability, loss of autonomy, loneliness).
