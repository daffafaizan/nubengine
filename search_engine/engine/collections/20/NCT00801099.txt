      of hospitalization and rehabilitation. Patients with SSIs are five times more likely to be
      readmitted and are even twice as likely to die compared to patients with similar
      interventions without SSI. In non-industrialized countries, the incidence of SSIs is higher
      and the consequences of SSI are even more severe: Many hospitals lack appropriate facilities
      for early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, microbiological identification of pathogens
      and susceptibility testing are rarely available, a prerequisite for targeted treatment of
      SSIs. Overcrowding and understaffing are additional risk factors for SSIs, common in these
      countries.

      A study conducted at the local surgeons' suggestion in an 82-bed department of general
      surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, urology and orthopedics at the St. Francis Designated
      District Hospital (SFDDH) in Ifakara (Southern Tanzania) showed an SSI-rate of 21.6%.

      The analyses of this study identified two major risk factors for SSI in clean and
      clean-contaminated surgical procedures: Inadequate timing of administration of routine
      antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) and inappropriate selection of antibiotics not covering the
      most commonly observed pathogens.

      Therefore, an intervention study was discussed with the local surgeon in charge to improve
      selection and timing of routine AMP and thereby reduce the rate of SSIs.

      The study design and objective were presented to all the staff during a general meeting and
      special duties and responsibilities discussed with the individual colleagues. Furthermore we
      distributed pocket flow sheets to the involved staff and hung up some laminated flow sheets
      in theatre.
