      beta-arbutin, administered to healthy human subjects for: i) 12 weeks, at a dose of 150
      mg/day, and ii) 4 weeks, at a dose of 400mg/day. Safety will be determined by assessing
      adverse event rates between treatment groups and mean changes relative to baseline in serum
      biochemical, hematological and urinary markers.
