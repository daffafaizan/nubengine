      I. Determine the safety of adenovirus p53 construct (adeno-p53) in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      II. Investigate the potential effects of intralesional adeno-p53 given by monthly
      percutaneous injections in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive adenovirus p53 construct by percutaneous injection to a maximum of two
      lesions on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 28 days for up to 6 courses. In the absence of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cohort of 6 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of
      6 patients each receive escalating doses of the drug on the same schedule. If DLT occurs in 2
      of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and that dose is declared
      the maximum tolerated dose. Study treatment may continue in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable adverse events.
