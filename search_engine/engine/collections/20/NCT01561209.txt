      clinic. After verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients consenting to enter
      the study are assigned randomly to one of the following groups: 1-Amitriptyline 5 mg for 2
      months 2- placebo for 2 months. Co-morbidities and other painful conditions are noted, and
      then clinical evaluation of the patient is performed; pain is assessed according to Visual
      Analog Scale, anxiety, depression, insomnia and disability are evaluated by adapted scores
      (Bergen insomnia scale, neck pain disability score, neck pain diary & anxiety and depression
      score). Patients are followed at 2 months and outcome measures are assessed.
