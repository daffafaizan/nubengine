      vaccine and 19 not vaccinated with a prophylactic HPV vaccine. These women are asked to
      collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device (Novosanis). Hereafter, a blood
      sample of 5-10 cc is collected. The collected urine and blood samples will be used for the
      development and optimisation of robust analytical protocols for sample preparation and
      antibody assays.
