      I. To determine the feasibility of using spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) to guide dose-escalated
      radiation therapy (RT) for newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM)s.

      II. To determine the safety of using sMRI to guide dose-escalated RT for newly-diagnosed
      GBMs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether the progression free survival at 1 year with sMRI-guided,
      dose-escalated RT is improved for newly-diagnosed GBMs.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether sMRI-guided, dose-escalated RT increases the overall survival of
      patients with newly diagnosed GBMs.

      II. To determine whether sMRI data obtained after initiation of therapy (at 2 weeks after
      RT/TMZ start and prior to cycle 1 and 5 of adjuvant temozolomide [TMZ]) will provide early
      evidence of GBM progression not seen on standard MRIs.

      III. To determine whether performance on neurocognitive and quality-of-life (QOL) assessments
      in newly-diagnosed GBM patients treated with sMRI-guided, dose-escalated RT differ from
      historical controls.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo sMRI-guided radiation therapy daily for the first 5 days of every week
      (Monday - Friday) over 6 weeks. Patients also receive standard of care temozolomide orally
      (PO) daily during radiation therapy for up to 42 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years and then periodically.
