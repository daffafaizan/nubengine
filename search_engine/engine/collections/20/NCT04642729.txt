    
      Macular Corneal Dystrophy is a severe form of stromal corneal dystrophy characterized by
      bilateral cloudy regions within hazy stroma and eventually severe visual impairment.

      Most cases of MCD are caused by mutations in the CHST6 gene encoding a protein involved in
      the production of keratan sulfate, which plays a role in the maintenance of corneal
      transparency.

      According to biomechanical instability of corneal metabolism (abnormal increase collagenase
      activity, decrease proteinase inhibitors, excessive premature keratocyte apoptosis, increase
      cytokine binding) at corneal dystrophies. Fresh Corneal Lenticule and autologous serum
      contains live stem cells that produce keratocytes, collagen fibers, extracellular matrix
      which contribute to the regeneration of the cornea, and all this results at increasing of
      corneal transparency and visual acuity in patients with corneal macular dystrophy.
