      undergoing day surgery and information must be based on the child's age and understanding. It
      is important to help children to cope with any upcoming surgery because the more anxious and
      fear they are, the more pain they experience after the day surgery. Digital gaming solutions
      could help families and children to be better oriented to the coming treatment. Icory
      -solution is a digital pathway for children and family and it contains a virtual tour to
      hospital and distraction games for children. The information on the application is aligned
      with the patient's individual needs based on the type of surgery and requirements.
