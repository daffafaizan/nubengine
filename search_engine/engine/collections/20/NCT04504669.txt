      escalations and expansions at selected doses. Dose-escalation will occur with AZD8701 in
      monotherapy (Part 1) and in combination with durvalumab (Part 3) in selected participants
      with HNSCC, TNBC, NSCLC, ccRCC, gastric cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, small-cell lung
      cancer and/or participants with solid tumours who have demonstrated a response to prior
      PD-(L)1 treatment.

      Disease specific expansions will occur with a selected dose AZD8701 in participants with
      NSCLC (Part 2) and with a selected dose of AZD8701 and durvalumab in participants with TNBC
      and clear cell RCC (Part 4).
