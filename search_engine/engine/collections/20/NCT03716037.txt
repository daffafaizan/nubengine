      diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease at a higher rate compared
      to non-minorities; moreover, those living in rural areas are less likely to seek treatment
      due to various factors including lack of accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of
      health care services. Fortunately, non-pharmacologic and cost-effective interventions such as
      physical activity can yield physical, psychosocial, and cognitive benefits for older adults.
      The purpose of the proposed research effort is to test the feasibility of, and effect of a
      community-based physical exercise program among community-dwelling older adults living in
      rural areas on the physical and psychosocial well-being. The research effort will be a
      randomized controlled trial. Fifty African American older adults will be recruited from
      community centers. A total of 50 participants will be recruited. These adults will be
      randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group, with each group containing 25
      participants. The intervention will occur over a period of eight week. The exercise program
      will be offered three times a week, with each session lasting one hour. Study measures will
      be collected prior to the start of the exercise program, after the fourth session, after the
      last session, and at one-month follow-up. The primary outcome measures for the feasibility
      study will include enrollment rate, randomization rate, retention rate, and data completion
      rate. Additionally, the investigators will examine whether there is improvement I both
      physical and psychosocial measures. All statistical analyses will be conducted using
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.
