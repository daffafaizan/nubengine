    
      This study is a national (20 centres) retrospective (10 years) and prospective registry of
      pregnant women with dilated cardiomyopathy.

      As this study is observational, medical attention of the enrolled patients will not be
      modified. No specific visit is planned for the study.

      Before the enrolment of the patient, the investigator provides the subject with clear and
      precise information about the protocol and requests her for written informed consent. The
      French ethical committee gave the investigators the possibility to include women in the
      registry if the investigators are unable to inform her (deceased women, no follow-up).

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate clinical characteristics and study maternal
      and neonatal evolution and complications during pregnancy using analysis of the
      morbi-mortality and clinical and para clinical criteria.

      The following data will be compiled in a case report form (e-CRF):

        -  Risk factors, cardiac history

        -  BNP or NTproBNP value, echocardiographic data (LVEF and LV diameter)

        -  Medical treatment before and during the pregnancy

        -  complications; occurrences during the pregnancy

        -  Modalities of medical attention during delivery: mother/child Patient's data are coded,
           and therefore anonymous, by using the inclusion number and initials of the patient
           (first letter of name and first letter of surname (ex: 01-X_X).

      In this prospective and retrospective, multi-centre, clinical study, all patients enrolled in
      the cohort will be included in the statistical analysis. As an observational non-randomized
      single arm evaluation, the statistical analyses will be descriptive. A minimum of 100
      patients will be enrolled.
