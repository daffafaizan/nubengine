      visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance.
      Recently, it has been described that oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction, which are
      important in progression of atherosclerosis, increases in individuals with the metabolic
      syndrome. Statins might have beneficial effects such as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory
      actions that are independent from their cholesterol-lowering effects. Pitavastatin, a
      chemically synthesized statin, has potent LDL-cholesterol lowering and also anti-oxidative
      and anti-inflammatory effects in animal studies. However, the effects of pitavastatin on
      oxidative stress and inflammatory action in patients with the metabolic syndrome have not
      been reported.
