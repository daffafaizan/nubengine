      the therapy tendency in PTCL. The novel regimen IVE/MTX (ifosfamide,
      etoposideï¼Œepirubucin/methotrexate)-ASCT(autologous stem-cell transplantation ) was piloted
      for patients eligible for intensive treatment, followed by auto-stem cell transplantation.
      Five-years PFS (progression-free survival) and OS (overall survival) were 52% and 60%
      respectively, significantly improved compared with the historical group treated with
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The encouraged results were extended to the peripheral T
      cell lymphoma-non specified (PTCL-NOS). Former studies reported that GDP (gemcitabine,
      cis-platinum, and dexamethasone) compared with CHOP as the therapy strategy for PTCL-NOS (not
      otherwise specified). The response rate was 78.57% in GDP group and 60.00% in CHOP group
      respectively. DFS (disease-free survival) was 9.79 and 4.2 months in above two groups. They
      concluded that GDP is superior with CHOP. The main side-effect of two regimens is
      hematological toxicity. Furthermore, high-dose combined with ASCT has been the first-line
      therapy for PTCL. However, only about 30% patients with PTCL have chance to receive ASCT for
      multiple reasons. So it is urgent to explore new combination-therapy regimen to improve the
      outcome for patients with PTCL.

      The aim of our study is to compare the response and survival rate of CEOP/IVE/GDP
      (cyclophosphamide, vincristin, epirubucin and prednisone/ ifosfamide, epirubucin, and
      etoposide/ gemcitabine, cis-platinum, and dexamethasone) with those of CEOP regimen, looking
      forward to its superiority in efficacy and safety for the newly diagnosed adult patients with
      PTCL.
