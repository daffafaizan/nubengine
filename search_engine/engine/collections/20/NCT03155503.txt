    
      This is a single and multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of SUVN-911 administered orally once a day to healthy male subjects. The
      study will be conducted under double-blind conditions.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SUVN-911 following oral
      administration of single or multiple ascending doses and estimate the maximum tolerated dose
      of SUVN-911, if possible.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the single and repeat dose plasma and urine
      pharmacokinetics of SUVN-911 following oral administration of single and multiple ascending
      doses in healthy male subjects.
