      affect the acute and 24h response in whole-body protein and amino acid metabolism and
      cognitive function as compared to baseline values in COPD patients and healthy subjects. To
      do this, subjects will complete a baseline visit in which they receive stable amino acid
      tracers. The next day they will complete a one-time resistance exercise with an immediate
      measurement of the amino acid tracers, and return 24 hours after exercise to repeat amino
      acid tracer measurements. This project will provide important clinical information on the
      whole body protein and amino acid metabolic response to acute resistance exercise in elderly
      subjects with COPD, as well as, the exercise induced changes in physical and cognitive
      function, and absolute muscular strength capacity in this population. In this way, this study
      will provide preliminary data for the development of standardized, repeatable resistance
      exercise protocols that will stop the process of ongoing muscle loss and improve metabolism
      and function in COPD subjects.
