      receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy comprised of allogeneic T cells prepared for the
      treatment of B cell malignancies. The cells are from healthy adult volunteer donors that are
      genetically modified ex vivo using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated protein 9) gene editing components (single guide RNA
      and Cas9 nuclease).
