      prosthetic hands, being at the same time functional and aesthetic solutions, are widely used,
      for some professional or leisure activities, myoelectric users will have a better functional
      response with a non-morphologic terminal device such as a hook.

      Axon-hook and Greifer are two myoelectric hooks proposed by Otto Bock HealthCare. Greifer
      (Myobock system) has two movable strong hooks and a wrist that can be orientated medially or
      laterally. Axon-Hook (Axon-Bus system) has thin hooks for a good visualization of the grip,
      one being fixed for more precision, and a flexible wrist that can be orientated and locked in
      flexion and extension position.

      Previous studies on myoelectric hands showed that functionalities of prosthetic components
      such as type of hand or type of wrist, have an influence on compensatory movements, which can
      explain musculoskeletal pains. The hypothesis of the study is that Axon-Hook may reduce
      shoulder abduction and improve patient satisfaction. No significant difference is expected
      regarding manual dexterity.

      This randomized corossover trial compares shoulder abduction, manual dexterity and
      satisfaction while using Axon-Hook and Greifer. Shoulder abduction and manual dexterity
      results are also compared with the sound side.
