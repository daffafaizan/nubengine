    
      A prospective study in patients with DTC at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery at
      Perking University Cancer Hospital (also called Beijing Cancer hospital). A total of 120
      female patients who underwent surgical treatment for DTC were enrolled in the study from June
      2012 to June 2014. All patients were diagnosed with DTC through preoperative fine needle
      aspiration biopsy pathology. These patients were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1 ratio)
      into the conventional access group (CA), the aesthetic principles access group (APA) or the
      minimally invasive access group (MIA). Lobectomy plus ipsilateral central lymph node
      dissection (CLND) was adopted in each patient. DTC staging was T1N0M0 or T1N1M0. The
      investigators retrieved the patients' information, including age, incision length, incision
      closure procedure, incidence of complications, and cosmetic assessment from patients' medical
      records. Patients with other medical diseases, such as diabetes or obesity, a smoking
      history, a keloid tendency, a history of radiotherapy to the head and neck, or with
      incomplete information, were excluded. RLN function was evaluated by electronic fiber
      laryngoscopy 6 months postoperatively. The follow-up time was 12.3 months. The research was
      reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Cancer Hospital, and
      informed consent was obtained from all patients to publish the information/image(s) in an
      online open-access publication. The study was open-label with no blinding of patients,
      clinicians, or research staff.
