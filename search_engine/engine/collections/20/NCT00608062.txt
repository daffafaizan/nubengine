      arteries that are located around the heart get stiffer. Over time this increase in arterial
      stiffness can lead to a number of health problems such as high blood pressure and heart
      disease. In this study we want to find out if a short-term drop in estrogen levels in
      premenopausal and perimenopausal women can cause arteries to become stiffer, and why this
      happens. Additionally, in postmenopausal women, we want to find out if a short-term increase
      in estrogen levels causes their arteries to become more flexible (less stiff).

      Arterial health (i.e., stiffness) will be examined in premenopausal, perimenopausal and
      postmenopausal women before and after they are given a drug called Ganirelix™ (for 7 days),
      which will markedly lower their reproductive hormones. After the first 4 days of taking
      Ganirelix™, the women will be randomly placed into 1 of 2 treatment groups to take either
      estrogen (0.075 mg/d skin patch) replacement or placebo for the rest of the Ganirelix
      treatment. This is to increase estrogen levels back to the normal level. After having the
      patch on for 4 days, arterial health will be examined again.

      Pre-specified Outcome Measures were divided into unit-of-measurement specific Outcome Measure
      tables for the purposes of results reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov
