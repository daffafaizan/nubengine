      form of dressing and fixing with elastoplast. All patients were ventilated using NIPPV
      (Engstrom Carestation), which was delivered to the patient through full-face mask and was
      started with pressure support of 8-12 cmH2O and PEEP of 3-5 cmH2O and gradually increased in
      2 cmH2O steps. When patients tolerate FiO2 ≤ 0.5 with pressure support ≤ 8 cmH2O and PEEP ≤ 5
      cmH2O for > 6 consecutive hours, withdrawal from NIPPV was attempted daily in 30 minutes
      spontaneous breathing trials. Therapy was considered successful if endotracheal intubation
      was avoided and the patient could be discharged from the ICU. During this period follow up
      arterial blood gases, chest X-rays and CT scans were obtained.
