      of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Under this protocol, patients with parkinsonism of
      uncertain etiology will be tested for their motor response to intravenous levodopa to aid in
      the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This protocol regulates and stipulates the acute
      administration of intravenous levodopa and associated safety issues.
