      implicated that asymptomatic transmission occurs in at least 25% SARS-CoV-2 cases. We
      hypothesize that droplet emission from oral fluids generated during speaking could be an
      important and actionable factor driving asymptomatic transmission. We aim to collect oral and
      nasal secretions, conjunctival fluid and blood to test for viral load and viral infectivity
      in 1) asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic high-risk subjects with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status,
      but with a history of close personal contact with a SARS-CoV-2 positive person and 2)
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects who are SARS-CoV-2 positive. 3) COVID-19 positive
      individuals retesting as negative can be enrolled to complete the electronic questionnaire(s)
      assessment and allow for evaluation of history of symptoms. 4) COVID-19 positive individuals
      admitted to the NIH Clinical Center can be enrolled as a symptomatic comparison cohort.
