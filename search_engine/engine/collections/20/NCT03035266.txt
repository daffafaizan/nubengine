      post-operative therapy with and without adjunctive BFR training. To accomplish this task the
      investigators will compare differences in thigh girth between two groups of patients after
      the first 6 weeks and 12 weeks as well as 6 months following meniscus or articular cartilage
      repair requiring 6 weeks of non-weight bearing or limited weight bearing status in a brace at
      0Ëš degrees of extension. In addition, isokinetic testing of the quadriceps and hamstrings
      will be performed at 12 weeks and 6 months post-operatively. Lower extremity girth
      measurements after knee surgery can be performed with good to excellent intra- and
      inter-rater reliability. Quadriceps strength measured with isokinetic testing is related to
      performance measures such as jumping. Limb circumference measurement, limb CSA measurement,
      and isokinetic strength testing are commonly utilized in BFR studies as outcome measures.One
      group will receive BFR for 12 weeks in addition to standard post-operative rehabilitation and
      the other group will receive standard post-operative rehabilitation without BFR.
