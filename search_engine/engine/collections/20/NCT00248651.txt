        1. Determine whether antidepressant therapy is more efficacious than placebo in relief of
           the symptoms of functional dyspepsia, adjusting for psychological and psychiatric
           co-morbidity. The investigators also planned to determine if antidepressant therapy
           reduces disability, improves quality of life and influences clinical response over 6
           months after ceasing medication.

        2. Determine if gastric emptying (motor dysfunction) and the nutrient drink test (a test
           that assesses gastric hypersensitivity and/or gastric accommodation) is altered by
           antidepressant therapy with a tricyclic or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
           (SSRI), and whether subgroups with altered physiology are associated with treatment
           outcome.
