      various enzymatic activities and associated pathways in isolated CTCs as well as the number
      of CTCs during the perioperative period in patients undergoing robotic pancreatectomy for
      pancreatic cancer. It is expected that by downregulating the pathways by lidocaine might
      affect the enzymatic activity in those CTCs as well as the number of CTCs in the circulation.

      A prospective randomized controlled double blinded trial design will be used for the proposed
      study.

      Patients undergoing robotic pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer will be randomized (ratio
      1:1) into two groups: one group will receive a 24-h normal saline infusion and the second
      group will receive a 24-h lidocaine infusion. Blood samples will be collected in different
      times perioperatively in order to evaluate the objectives of the study.
