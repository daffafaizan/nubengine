      have been shown to improve recovery in terms of reduced pain, shortened time to ambulation
      and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing surgery. However, data concerning the role
      of ERAS protocols in urogynecological surgery is limited. The present study, therefore, aimed
      to address the role of ERAS protocols in patients undergoing surgery for urinary incontinence
      and pelvic prolapse.
