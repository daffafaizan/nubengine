    
      Methods:

      sixty patients with OA knee having unilateral or bilateral synovitis validated by ultrasound
      (N=40) were studied. All the patients were randomized to receive PRP (N=40) or Hyaluronic
      acid(HA)(N=40) injection twice at 2-week intervals; Clinical assessments were performed using
      a visual analog scale(VAS) and The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index (WOMAC index) before injection at baseline, 4 weeks(first evaluation) and 12
      weeks(secondary evaluation). Imaging evaluation based on color Doppler ultrasound(CDUS) and
      the depth of synovial fluid accumulation ,and the width of synovial hypertrophy was performed
      simultaneously.
