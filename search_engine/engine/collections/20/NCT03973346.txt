      and drive health and well-being. Social needs are common among undeserved patient
      populations, but health care providers are often not equipped to routinely identify and
      address patients in need.

      Using a combination of health information exchange, electronic health record, and aggregate
      datasets the investigators developed predictive algorithms to identify patients a highest
      risk for a need for a referral to a social worker, dietitian, behavioral health, or other
      wraparound service provider. Risk scores are available to primary care providers in two ways
      within the electronic health record system (EHR): 1) a graphical summary of individual risk
      or 2) a line listing of all scheduled patients.

      The investigators are introducing the risk-stratification tool in an urban safety-net primary
      care provider on a voluntary usage basis.
