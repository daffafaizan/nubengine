      relatively long problems and with the need for intensive or sub-intensive care.

      Upon discharge from the hospital, some studies have shown that the majority of subjects with
      COVID-19 present a reduction in functional capacity, exercise tolerance and muscle strength,
      regardless of previous health status and pre-existing disabilities. Furthermore, some works
      on patients suffering from similar respiratory infections, such as SARS or MERS, have
      described how a functional deficit can persist even in the long term. An early rehabilitation
      intervention, which included aerobic reconditioning, was tested in some pilot observational
      studies in hospitalized subjects for COVID-19, and proved feasible and safe. A single
      randomized controlled Chinese study has documented the efficacy of an acute respiratory
      rehabilitation intervention. Given the number of hospitalized subjects for COVID-19, the
      difficulties linked to the infectious risk, and the high cost of managing departments for
      COVID-19 subjects, the execution of home rehabilitation programs, in the form of
      telerehabilitation, was suggested as a viable option. Telerehabilitation programs that
      included effort re-conditioning, intended for subjects with reduced functional capacity, have
      already been successfully proposed in cardiac, respiratory, orthopedic, and neurological
      patients. No studies until now have described the feasibility, safety and efficacy of early
      exercise reconditioning treatment to improve disability in the subject discharged after
      hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia.
