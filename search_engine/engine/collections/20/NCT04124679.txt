      (Shenmen) and Neiguan (PC6) acupoints on bilateral side, which were identiÔ¨Åed in accordance
      with the TCM anatomic localizations on the first night before surgery by a stimulator (Hwato
      Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument, model no.: SDZ-II; Suzhou Medical Appliances Co.
      Ltd, Suzhou, China). And after surgery, ST36 (Zusanli) and LI4 (Hegu) acupoints were added
      for the effect of relieving postoperative complications. 30 minutes of TEAS treatment was
      also performed on bilateral side by an experienced acupuncturist at the Neiguan (PC6), HT7
      (Shenmen), ST36 (Zusanli) and LI4 (Hegu) acupoints on the first three nights after surgery.
      The TEAS was standardized before each treatment and was set at 2/10 HZ, which has been
      documented as the most effective frequency. The optimal intensity is from 6 to 15mA, which
      was adjusted according to individual maximum tolerance to maintain a slight twitching of the
      regional muscles. Patients in the control group were attached the gel electrodes at the sham
      acupoints. The acupuncture points were to be stimulated by microcurrents generated by a
      special electrical device, which the patients may only experience a mild electric current
      sensation or nothing at all.
