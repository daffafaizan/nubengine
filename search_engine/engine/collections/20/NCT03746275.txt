    
      The study aims to collect real-world data on treatment patterns and decision points for
      treatment in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and/ or peripheral artery disease
      (PAD) treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg [twice daily] for the prevention of major
      cardiovascular events in adult patients with CAD at high risk of ischemic events and/ or
      documented PAD and to describe outcomes of an antithrombotic regime based on dual pathway
      inhibition (vascular dose of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg [twice daily] plus low-dose ASA [once daily])
      across the broad range of patient risk profiles encountered in routine clinical practice.
