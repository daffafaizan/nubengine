      IU/kg/week), micro-dose rhEpo (20 IU/kg/week), or placebo control (saline) group. All
      subjects receive two subcutaneous injections per week for four weeks. Muscle biopsies are
      taken at the beginning and end of the study period. Mitochondrial function is measured in
      permeabilized fibres using high-resolution respirometry with the substrates malate (2mM),
      octanoyl carnitine (1.5mM), glutamate (10mM), succinate (10mM), under saturating [ADP] (5mM),
      and with the membrane uncoupler FCCP (1Î¼M).

      On the first day before administration of rhEpo and after the four weeks' treatment the
      subjects are undergoing two cognitive performance-tests, Raven Standard Progressive Matrices
      (Raven), and Number Finder (NUFI). Weekly semi-structured interviews are conducted by a
      blinded interviewer focusing on experienced change in cognitive performance.
