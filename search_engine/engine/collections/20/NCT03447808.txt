      I. To characterize the safety of treatment with daratumumab and ibrutinib for previously
      untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      II. To determine the complete response rate (CR) at the post cycle 12 response assessment
      following treatment with daratumumab and ibrutinib for previously untreated chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the activity of daratumumab and ibrutinib as measured by overall response
      rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival
      (OS), and time-to-next treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure pharmacodynamic parameters in B cells including drug occupancy of BTK and B
      cell receptor signaling during treatment.

      II. To determine the influence of this combination on T cell and natural killer (NK) cell
      number and function.

      III. To assess for development of mutations that may confer resistance to this combination.

      IV. To assess the ability of daratumumab to clear CLL in the peripheral blood and association
      of CD38 expression on CLL cells with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1-2, days
      1 and 15 of courses 3-6, and day 1 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      course 2, patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2
      years.
