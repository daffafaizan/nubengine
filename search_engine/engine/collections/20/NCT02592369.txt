      R system used in routine hospital practice in a large patient cohort for the treatment of
      symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis or a stenosed, insufficient, or combined surgical
      bioprosthetic valve failure necessitating valve replacement.

      Prospective, single arm, multi-center, observational, post market study. In Australia and
      Canada it is a prospective, single arm, multi-center pre-market study.

      Up to 60 centers worldwide. Geographies may include Europe, Australia, Middle East and
      Africa, Latin America and Canada.

      Approximately 1000 implanted subjects, consented for follow-up through three years.

      For each subject, data will be collected preoperatively, intra-operatively, at hospital
      discharge, 30 days, 1, 2 and 3 years.
