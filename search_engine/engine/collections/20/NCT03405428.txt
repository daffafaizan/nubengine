      a common procedure in anesthesia and critical care setting. The most commonly used site for
      arterial catheterization is the radial artery because of its superficial course, alternate
      blood supply to hand via ulnar artery and a low rate of complications. Allen test is a
      simple, but not reliable, method for assessing the safety of radial artery catheterization.
      Intraarterial catheterization has some complications such as hematoma, vasospasm, arterial
      thrombosis, necrosis of skin overlying. Using larger size cannula from radial artery
      diameter, increase rate of complications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      corelation of radial artery diameter with sex, age, height, weight and body mass index for
      determination of proper cannula size and investigation of correlation between Allen test and
      doppler ultrasonography.
