      to one or more brief episodes of ischemia results in protection of that organ against
      subsequent ischemia. The effects of ischemic conditioning are not confined within an organ
      but can be can be transferred from one organ to another, a technique called remote ischemic
      conditioning. A clinically feasible method for this is remote limb ischemic conditioning
      (RLIC), where episodes of ischemia and perfusion are induced with a blood pressure cuff
      placed on the arm.

      The overall goal of this line of work is to use ischemic conditioning to enhance learning and
      outcomes in persons with neurologic injuries. Two previous studies have shown that remote
      limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) can enhance learning a motor task in healthy young adults.
      The current study extends that work to determine if RLIC enhances muscle strength training
      and a complex cognitive-motor task (simulated driving). This Phase I study will yield the
      necessary information to design and execute subsequent trials in neurologic patient
      populations.
