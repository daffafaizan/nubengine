      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of single agent ONC201 orally once every three
      weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of ONC201. II. To assess serum biomarkers of therapeutic
      response to ONC201. III. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of ONC201 as a single agent
      in advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for a total of 2
      courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
