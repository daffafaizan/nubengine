      thymidine on mitochondrial metabolism and adipocyte apoptosis (fat cell death). Changes in
      mitochondrial metabolism and increases in adipocyte apoptosis are associated with
      lipoatrophy. Lipoatrophy is a common condition characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat and
      can be caused by many anti-HIV medications. This study will examine the metabolic
      consequences of the use of thymidine analogue-sparing treatment regimens.

      This study will evaluate HIV infected patients who are enrolled in ACTG A5202, starting their
      first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimen. This regimen will
      include either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or abacavir/lamivudine
      (ABC/3TC), which are thymidine-sparing regimens. The changes in mitochondrial activity and
      fat cell death will be compared between participants taking thymidine-sparing regimens
      (TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC) and thymidine-containing regimens.

      This study will last for 96 weeks, with two study visits occurring at entry and another visit
      at Week 96. During each visit, a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and blood
      collection will occur, and a fat biopsy will be performed in the lower abdomen under local
      anesthetic.
