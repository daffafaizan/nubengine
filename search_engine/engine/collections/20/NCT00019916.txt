        -  Determine whether endogenous cellular immunity to the p53 peptide vaccine is present in
           patients with stage IV, recurrent, or progressive breast or ovarian cancer and whether
           vaccination with these peptides and low-dose interleukin-2 can induce or boost the
           cellular immunity in these patients.

        -  Determine the type and characteristics of cellular immunity generated by this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate any immunologic response with any objective tumor response to this regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients undergo apheresis of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are
      harvested and selected for monocytes on day -6. The monocyte fraction is cultured with
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 7 days and then pulsed with p53 peptide vaccine.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive p53 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive p53 peptide vaccine IV over 5 minutes on day 1. Treatment in
           both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 4 vaccinations (4 courses). During
           courses 3 and 4, patients also receive low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC daily on days
           3-7 and days 10-14. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to receive
           vaccine and IL-2 treatment for up to 2 years.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2-4 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
