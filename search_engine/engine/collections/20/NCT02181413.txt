      citrate is being tested to slow disease progression and improve overall survival in people
      who have NDMM and who have had any type of positive response to induction therapy followed by
      HDT and ASCT. This study will look at the effect ixazomib citrate has on the length of time
      that participants are free of progressive disease (PD) and their overall survival (OS).

      The study enrolled 656 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Ixazomib citrate 3 mg for the first 4 cycles, then 4 mg for the remaining 22 cycles

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle,
      for up to 26 cycles (approximately 24 months).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted globally. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 107 months. Participants will make 28 visits to the clinic during the
      treatment period and will continue to make visits after treatment has ended. During this
      initial follow up period, participants will be assessed for disease status with follow up
      every 4 weeks. After the next line of therapy begins, follow-up will occur every 12 weeks
      until death or termination of the study.
