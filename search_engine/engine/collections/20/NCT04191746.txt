      strategies, clinical outcomes, and costs associated with patients presenting with critical
      limb ischemia.

      Population: Patients over age 18 presenting with critical limb ischemia After initial
      enrollment at 40 study sites throughout the US. participants will complete follow-up 6 months
      and 12 months via call center telephone calls.

      The study plan calls for enrollment of approximately 1,200 participants throughout the US
      that will then have 12 month followup that includes collection of medications,
      hospitalizations for collection of events.Additionally, the BEST-CLI trial will be gathering
      quality of life data and cost data using similar instruments, thus providing an opportunity
      for comparison between cost and quality of life analyses in a clinical trial versus in a
      real-world registry and collection of Quality of Life using validated instruments: EQ-5D,
      VASQOL, SF-12.and bill review to determine economic impact of disease.
