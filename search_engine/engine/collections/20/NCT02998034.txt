      fractures, we wish to undertake a prospective randomised trial to compare a modern cemented
      hemiarthroplasty prosthesis with a modern hydroxyapatite coated uncemented arthroplasty.

      Cemented Exeter monoblock hemiarthroplasty The Exeter stemmed total hip replacement is
      considered one of foremost performing hip replacements in the world. The ETS (Exeter trauma
      stem) is one such implant and costs around Â£200. The implant has modern instrumentation and
      the stem has proven long term survival rates when used for total hip replacement.

      Hyroxyapatite coated prosthesis Coating a hip prosthesis with hydroxyapatite is common
      practice for an uncemented hip replacement arthroplasty. The hydroxyapatite stimulates bone
      ingrowth around the prosthesis and is this is thought to reduce loosening of the implant,
      residual pain and the long-term revision rate.

      The aim of the study is to assist in defining the optimum choice of arthroplasty for an acute
      hip fracture.
