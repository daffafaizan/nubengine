      replication and improving hepatic necro-inflammation with minimal adverse effects in HBeAg
      positive chronic hepatitis B patients. The efficacy of lamivudine in HBeAg positivce Asian
      patients has been weel established. However, the evidence in HBeAg negative patients is
      limited.

      In the absence of HBeAg seroconversion, guidance on the clinical management of HBeAg negative
      hepatitis B patitents treated with lamivudine and data on the efficacy of lamivudine in
      controlling pre-core HBV disease long-term is still needed. Existing data in HBeAg negative/
      HBV DNA positive HBV demonstrate clear and statisticallysignificant serological benefit of
      lamivudine over placebo during treatment. Limited sustained response was observed
      post-treatment following a one year treatment period. Whether these results can be applied to
      patients in Asia is uncertain. This study is therefore intended to further assess te efficacy
      profile over an extended treatment period in the Asian population.
