      (PROBE), controlled phase 2 trial (2 arm with 1:1 randomization) in ischemic stroke patients.

      Randomized patients will first be stratified by both the setting of treatment: metropolitan
      hospital vs regional hospital (>1 hour transfer to endovascular centre) vs mobile stroke
      unit; and by site of baseline arterial occlusion: Intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA)
      and Basilar artery versus Middle cerebral artery (MCA - M1 and M2); overall resulting in six
      strata.

      Imaging is performed with CT or MR (magnetic resonance) acutely as part of standard care with
      imaging follow-up at 18-30 hours. The sequences and the parameters used follow the STIR
      (Stroke Imaging Research) roadmap guidelines, but imaging takes place acutely and at 18-
      30hrs only, as previously validated.

      The sample size estimation was based on the proportion of pre-endovascular reperfusion
      observed in the 0.25mg/kg group from Part 1 of EXTEND-IA TNK (22%). An estimated total sample
      size of 188 patients (with 94 patients in each of treatment and control arms) yielded 80%
      power to detect a significant difference of 20% in strata-weighted angiographic reperfusion
      (mTICI 2b/3) at initial angiogram (22% in 0.25mg/kg vs 42% in 0.4mg/kg arm) at two-sided
      statistical significance threshold of p=0.05 for superiority. Adaptive increase in sample
      size will be performed if the result of interim analysis using data from the first 150
      patients is promising, as per the methodology of Mehta and Pocock.

      During the trial, blinded analysis of operational characteristics revealed a 20% reduction in
      the time from thrombolysis to arterial access versus part 1 due to improved workflow (In the
      first 150 patients in part 2 median 37min [IQR 19-54] versus 46min [IQR 28-63] in part 1).
      This directly impacts the time for thrombolysis to have an effect. A 20% reduction in the
      hypothesized rate of reperfusion at initial angiogram (18% vs 33%) would require 145 patients
      per group. Allowing for potential further improvements in workflow the sample size
      re-estimation was postponed from 150 to 240 patients with a revised minimum sample of 300
      patients. Adaptive increase in sample size will be performed if the result of interim
      analysis using data from the first 240 patients is promising, as per the methodology of Mehta
      and Pocock. The maximum sample size is capped at 656 patients.
