      purpose of the study is to verify that WOODCAST Circular system performs safely and
      effectively in its intended use. Patients, who need immobilization of extremity (including
      for example scaphoid fracture of the wrist or ankle fracture) will be participating in the
      study. Various casting techniques with novel WOODCAST material will be studied.
