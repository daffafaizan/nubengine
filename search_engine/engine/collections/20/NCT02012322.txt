      whether coenzyme Q10 (Q10) administration reduces symptoms and improve subjective health in
      an aging population.

      Rationale: In a number of settings, studies have reported benefits of Q10 to fatigue, muscle
      pain, and cognition. Additionally Q10 defends against mechanisms that may play a role in
      health problems in aging populations. For these reasons, a study evaluating benefits by Q10
      to symptoms and quality of life in an aging population is merited.

      Subjects: 44 subjects ages 55 and older.

      Design: 9 month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study.

      Analyses: Nonparametric and secondarily parametric analyses will compare effects of Q10 vs
      placebo; and of higher dose vs lower dose Q10 on primary and secondary endpoints. Possible
      effect modification (differential benefit) based on factors such as oxidative state and Q10
      serum concentration will be explored through regression analysis.
