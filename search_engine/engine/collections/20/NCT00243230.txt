    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of
      vicriviroc maleate in HIV subjects infected with CCR5-tropic virus only for whom standard
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) has failed. The study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy of
      two doses of vicriviroc (20 mg QD and 30 mg QD) compared with placebo when added to optimized
      ART therapy. The optimized background regimen will be chosen by the investigator based on
      results of drug susceptibility tests, history of prior antiretroviral drug use by the
      subject, and drug toxicity. The background regimen must include at least 3 antiretroviral
      drugs (not including study drug), one of which must be a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor
      (â‰¥100 mg ritonavir). There will be two interim analyses: when all subjects have completed 12
      weeks and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Based on the balance of safety and efficacy
      determined in these analyses, a dosage or dosages will be selected for further study in
      additional registrational trials. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all
      subjects have completed 48 weeks of treatment. After Week 48, subjects who meet applicable
      criteria will be offered open label vicriviroc 30 mg QD, if appropriate, until the sponsor
      terminates the clinical development of vicriviroc. Additionally, subjects who discontinue
      early from the study prior to Week 48 will be offered re-screening for the open label segment
      of the study.
