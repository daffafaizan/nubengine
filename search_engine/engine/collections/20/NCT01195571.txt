      randomized into four groups. Four groups will receive one of the four investigational
      vaccines. The four investigational HCMV vaccine candidates will be administered
      subcutaneously to 3 volunteers at 10 pfu (the lowest dose to be used). The safety and
      tolerability of the four investigational HCMV vaccine candidates will be monitored closely
      for a period of 12 weeks following vaccination at this dose. Investigational vaccines that
      are found to be safe and well tolerated at a dose of 10pfu will be administered to 3
      additional individuals at 102 pfu and then at 103 pfu. Safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated at each dose level by monitoring clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters
      and virus detection in the blood, urine, and saliva. After the 12-week safety-monitoring
      period, participants will be followed for the remainder of one year to assess long-term
      safety and immunogenicity of the investigational vaccines.
