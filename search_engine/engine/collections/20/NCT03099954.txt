      This population will be approximately 150 men and 150 women. In order to obtain a relatively
      diverse age range of users (with varying levels of arterial stiffness), we hope to enroll
      participants across three age ranges entered in the Withings application by the user: 18-40
      years, 41-60 years, and > 60 years. These spots will be filled by those that satisfy the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria on a first come, first served basis.
