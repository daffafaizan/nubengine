      which is characterized with highly clinical heterogeneity and no effective treatment is
      available now. The purpose of this registered cohort is to observe the natural history of ALS
      patients in China, and then identify some factors correlated with disease progression.
      Besides, ALS-related gene mutations will be screened and explore novel disease causing gene
      as well.
