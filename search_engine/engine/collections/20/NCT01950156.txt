    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and
      clinical efficacies of HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A
      emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for disease controlled advanced non-small cell lung cancers.

      The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides,
      which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A, as targets
      for cancer vaccination against lung cancer. In this phase I/II trial, the investigators
      examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor
      effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      patients whose disease are controlled after any standard therapies, but who do not have any
      options for additional standard ones to prevent .future relapse of the disease.
