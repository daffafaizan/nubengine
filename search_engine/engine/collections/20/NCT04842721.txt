      gargling using a Hypertonic Saturated Sodium Chloride solution would reduce/eliminate the
      Upper Respiratory viral load in Covid-19 infected patients compared to a placebo (Plain Water
      Rinse). Patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 using Nucleic Acid Test via Nose
      or Throat Swabs within 7 days prior to the start of the trial will be instructed to use
      either of the two treatment arms (Active or Placebo) for 15 minutes twice daily for two days
      and retested for Covid 7 days after the last treatment

      A randomized blinded controlled study, whereas a number of patients (at least 20) with
      clinically-confirmed Covid-19 infection within 7 days prior to the start of the study, are
      equally divided into 2 groups, Active and Control groups, using Active and Control Mouth
      rinses respectively. The Active Rinse is a 25 ml of Hypertonic Saturated Saline solution made
      by mixing 10 grams of Sodium Chloride (Table Salt) in 25 ml of Tap water with some salt
      crystals deposited. The Control Rinse is a 25 ml of Plain Tap Water. Each Patient of both
      groups will be asked to keep the solution still in his/her mouth, close to the back of the
      mouth, for 15 minutes without gargling and without swallowing. After 15 minutes the solution
      will be spit out and mouth will be rinsed with plain water several times. The process will be
      done twice a day for 2 days. Patients of both groups will be tested once for Covid-19 7 days
      after the last treatment.
