      anaerobic streptococci (Streptococcus oralis), pH-rising components and Stevia on the oral
      microflora in hyposalivated subjects.

      Material and methods: Subjects with hyposalivation (unstimulated secretion rate of < 0.1
      ml/min and/or a stimulated secretion rate < 0.7 ml/min) and ≥ 10 000 cfu/ml of mutans
      streptococci and/or lactobacilli on the tongue or in the supragingival plaque were included.
      Eighteen subjects used probiotic tablets (≥ 4/day) and gel (once a week) for 3 months and 9
      used placebo tablets and gel. The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial
      samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the
      3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).
