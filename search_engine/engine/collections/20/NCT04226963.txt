      proportion of subjects demonstrating treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The observation
      applies both to major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as bipolar I depression. There is
      growing evidence that the glutamatergic system plays a role in the pathophysiology and
      treatment of depression. Discovery of rapid, although transient antidepressant effect of
      ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in a single sub-anaesthetic
      intravenous dose in unipolar, bipolar and treatment-resistant patients provides evidence for
      a glutamatergic antidepressant. Subsequent studies confirmed this effect in repeated doses.
      Further research demonstrated that repeated ketamine infusions result in sustainable
      antidepressant effect with both, twice-weekly and thrice-weekly administration schedules.
      However, the worsening of depression may occur after infusions are completed. Given the risk
      of relapses, there is a definite need for the development of new strategies to maintain the
      beneficial effects of ketamine treatment. In the present study, the investigators aim to
      openly assess the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of repeated, individually tailored
      IV, nasal spray and oral ketamine for treatment-resistant mood disorders. The investigators
      intend to explore questions regarding optimal dose, treatment frequency and duration.
