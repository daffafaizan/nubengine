      with episodic TTH who have already been treated with Neosaldina according to regular clinical
      practice. This study will assess the pain intensity and pain relief of TTH after the uptake
      of Neosaldina.

      This study will enroll approximately 317 participants. All participants will be enrolled into
      one observational group:

      â€¢ Neosaldina

      Investigators will assess participants from the time of enrolment through the completion of
      observation period up to 6 months. Each participant will be assessed up to 45 days after
      first dose. The data will be collected from medical charts and during routine follow up
      visits. The data from participants will be collected through a self-administered
      questionnaire using a mobile phone. All the participants will be instructed to insert the
      data in an application, downloaded in their phone whenever they will have an episode of TTH
      and use Neosaldina.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall duration of observation
      period in this study is approximately 6 months. Participants will be contacted by telephone
      on Days 15 and 30 for a follow up and will make a final visit on Day 45.
