    
      This Phase I study will evaluate the safety of TM-601 in patients with recurrent malignant
      glioma who have failed first-line, standard therapy.

      Study patients will be assigned to receive treatment in 1 of 6 treatment cohorts. Patients
      will be assigned to each dose level in groups of 3-6 (depending upon treatment response seen
      within each cohort), with escalation to the next highest dose dependent upon demonstrated
      tolerance in the previous dosing group.

      Patients will be administered an imaging dose of 131I-TM-601, intravenously, to demonstrate
      tumor-specific localization prior to study treatment with non-labeled TM-601. Eligible
      patients demonstrating tumor-specific imaging will be assigned to a treatment cohort and will
      received non-labeled TM-601 once a week for 3 weeks, followed by clinical follow-up visits
      and MR imaging.

      Data from this study will help determine the IV dose of TM-601 required to produce MR
      perfusion changes (as well as other biomarker changes) in patients with recurrent malignant
      glioma. It is not known whether participation in this trial will provide patients with
      benefit in terms of improved tumor control, although pre-clinical evidence and evidence from
      other clinical trials with 131I TM-601 suggest that TM-601 is an active agent in malignant
      glioma.
