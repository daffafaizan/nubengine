      body's needs and Acute Heart Failure is a sudden worsening of this condition. It is
      associated with many symptoms but most commonly includes shortness of breath due to pulmonary
      edema (or increased "lung water").

      A physical exam and chest x-ray are commonly used to diagnose AHF and estimate the amount of
      increased lung water in patients with AHF. This study will use images from MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) scans to obtain a more accurate measurement of the increased lung water in
      AHF patients. Lung water will be measured via MRI at hospital admission and discharge to find
      out the change in lung water over the course of hospitalization and treatment. The
      investigators will collect NT-proBNP and perform a chest x-ray upon hospital admission and
      again upon discharge, if not already done as part of usual care. The investigators will
      follow medical records for one year after hospitalization to see if the accurate lung water
      measurements obtained in hospital can predict long term outcomes. This is a single-centre
      project and a total of 300 patients will be recruited to participate.
