      historical limited success using calcium hydroxide dressings placed into debrided pulp
      spaces. Obtaining stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP cells), which are present at the
      base of all teeth, but are most accessible in teeth with immature apices, greatly enhances
      clinical success. Current therapies lack ideal messenger chemicals and scaffolds to optimize
      results.
