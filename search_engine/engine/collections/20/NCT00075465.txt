      Primary

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate and time to tumor progression in patients
           with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach treated with docetaxel
           and epirubicin as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the survival without local relapse and overall survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive epirubicin IV over 30 minutes and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
