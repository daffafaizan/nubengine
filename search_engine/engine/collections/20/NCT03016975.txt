      significant functional mitral regurgitation will be randomized 2:1 to receive either
      transcatheter mitral valve repair with the Edwards Cardioband System plus guideline directed
      medical therapy (GDMT) or GDMT alone. Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at
      discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and annually through 5 years.
