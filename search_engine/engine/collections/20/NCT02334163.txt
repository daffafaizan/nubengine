      protozoa and viruses. A pilot prospective study at the 2008 American Association for the
      Study of Liver Diseases meeting showing clinical improvement in HE among cirrhotic patients
      who received nitazoxanide and lactulose. Based on the excellent safety profile of NTZ, the
      present pilot study is conducted hopefully to prove the efficacy of nitazoxanide in treating
      patients experiencing HE grade II-III.

      Study design:The study is Prospective, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label, Pilot study.

      Method: The study will include a total of 36 patients with grade II-III Hepatic
      Encephalopathy, and an informed consent will be obtained from every patient before being
      included.

      All the patients will receive oral lactulose, plus either nitazoxanide, metronidazole or
      rifaximine.

      A- All patients will be subjected to the following at baseline:

        -  Patient's full history

        -  Liver disease staging using Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) score

        -  Measurement of serum electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca2+)

      B- All patients will be subjected to the following at baseline and at the end of treatment:

        -  Measuring Blood ammonia level

        -  Measuring liver function tests (AST, Total bilirubin, international normalized ratio
           (INR), Serum albumin, prothrombin time (PT)), serum creatinine and complete blood count
           (CBC)

        -  Assessing severity of Hepatic Encephalopathy using Clinical Hepatic Encephalopathy
           Staging Scale (CHESS)

      C- Monitoring tolerability up to 30 days after the last dose D- Assessment of quality of life
      using Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)
