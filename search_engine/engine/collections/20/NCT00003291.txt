    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the prognostic significance of deletion of the p16 (MTS1, CDKN21) gene in
           children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Attempt to correlate the incidence of specific, nonrandom combinations of molecular
           genetic lesions with clinical outcome in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by risk (standard vs high).

      Bone marrow specimens from patients enrolled in CCG-1922, CCG-1882, or CCG-1901 are analyzed
      for the following genetic lesions: p16 deletion, p14 deletion, and p15 deletion.

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence
      the type or duration of treatment.

      Patients are followed for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
