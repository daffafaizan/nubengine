      the corresponding umbilical cord blood and neonatal peripheral blood pre- and post-BCG
      vaccination.

      For RNA sequencing, the samples are collected in Tempus RNA Blood tubes at 5 time-points
      (TP): maternal peripheral blood at the time of initial diagnosis with HIV (first OBGYN
      consultation @ 12-16 weeks of pregnancy - TP1); repeated HIV test in 3rd trimester of
      pregnancy (34-36 weeks- TP2); umbilical cord blood (after delivery and ligation- TP3);
      neonates (24 hours after birth and after HBV vaccination, prior to BCG vaccination- TP4); and
      neonates (7 days after BCG vaccination- TP5).

      As an indicator of the inflammatory status, the peripheral blood samples collected at the
      same TP are stained for serological markers of inflammation, exhaustion, maturation and
      activation.

      An advanced bioinformatics analysis examines the immune-associated transcripts in RNAseq
      samples to assess the V(D)J recombination of T-cell and B-cell receptors along with
      immune-associated SNPs.

      The main goal of the study is to identify in umbilical cord blood the genomic biomarkers of
      the neonatal basal immune status for guiding an optimal BCG immunization protocol for such
      neonates and to avoid potential adverse events after vaccination.
