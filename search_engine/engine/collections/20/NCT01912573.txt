    
      This is a randomized, prospective trial that will compare clinical outcomes for parenteral
      naloxone according to the standard of care (TAU; administration via intravenous [IV],
      intramuscular [IM] or intraosseus [IO] delivery) versus intranasal [IN] for the prehospital
      emergency treatment of suspected opioid overdose. Ambulance squads in Adams, Clermont, and
      Scioto counties in southern Ohio will be randomized to administer either standard care or IN
      naloxone as the initial response to a suspected opioid overdose.
