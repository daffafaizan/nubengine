    
      Aim 1: Our first aim is to use a novel fMRI experimental paradigm to investigate the
      pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) in terms of the strength of connectivity (as
      measured by LFBF correlations) between the different emotion regulating areas of the brain
      rather than in terms of increase or decrease in localized brain activity.

      Specific Aim 2: Our second aim is to investigate whether lithium works by altering the
      connectivity of areas of the brain implicated in the pathophysiology of BD, thereby leading
      to changes in the abnormal positive or negative emotional reactions to the environment seen
      in mania and depression respectively.

      Specific Aim 3: Out third aim is to investigate whether patients with the s/s or s/L alleles
      of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism will have greater amygdalar activation and decreased
      cortico-amygdala connectivity compared to patients with L/L genotype. We will also
      investigate whether lithium treatment differentially affects these fMRI measures in the s/s
      or s/L and L/L genotypes.

      Methods:

      We will study unmedicated subjects satisfying DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder current
      episode depressed or hypomanic/manic or who are euthymic. Subjects will undergo fMRI before
      and after 8 weeks of treatment with lithium a mood stabilizer that is known to be effective
      in both phases of BD. Healthy subjects will have a scan at baseline and after 8 weeks but
      will not be treated with any medication. We will also test for the serotonin transporter gene
      (the gene that controls the availability of a chemical called serotonin in the brain), which
      has been shown to effect how lithium works.
