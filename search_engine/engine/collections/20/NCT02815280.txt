      administration of FMX-101, 4% minocycline foam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne
      vulgaris. The first 12 weeks of the study involves randomized, double-blind treatment with
      active FMX-101, 4% or matching vehicle. Subjects who successfully complete the 12-week double
      blind portion of the study will be offered the opportunity to continue in the trial for up to
      an additional 40 weeks (for a total of 1 year) and receive open-label treatment with FMX-101,
      4%.
