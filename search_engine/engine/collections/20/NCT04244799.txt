      controlled trial (RCT). The investigators will randomly select 132 Department of Education
      (DepEd) schools across Zamboanga Del Norte province to comprise the study sample. 66 schools
      will be assigned to the treatment group, and 66 schools to the control group. Treatment
      schools will receive the behavioral nudge intervention, while control group will not. Both
      treatment and control schools will receive DepEd's national WASH in Schools (WinS) policy.
      WinS promotes "correct hygiene and sanitation practices among school children and a clean
      environment in and around schools" and includes initiatives related to infrastructure,
      knowledge, and behavior change, but does not include other programs with an explicit focus on
      handwashing promotion.

      Four months after installing nudges, enumerators will conduct structured observations in
      study schools, observing whether pupils wash their hands with soap, wash without soap, or do
      not wash, after they have used classroom toilets. This will be used to estimate the causal
      impact of the nudges intervention on rates of independent handwashing with water and soap
      after toilet use.
