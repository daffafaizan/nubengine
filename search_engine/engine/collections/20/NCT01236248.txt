      prevention program for adolescent girls and their mothers. The prevention program aimed to
      strengthen and sustain the mother-daughter bond while equipping girls with the necessary
      information and skills to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors associated with
      tobacco, alcohol, and other harmful substance use.
