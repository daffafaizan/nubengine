      significant problem with limited understanding of the connection between the insult of
      surgery and anesthesia and the pathophysiology of the development of these morbidities.
      Surgeons in the thoracic department have noted that some patients seem to recover less
      vigorously than other patients. What accounts for these different recovery trajectories is
      unclear. Researchers have developed a Post-Operative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS) which
      assesses six domains (physiologic, nociceptive, emotive, activities of daily living,
      cognitive, and overall patient experience) and has been suggested to serve as a means of
      tracking patients' recovery from surgery.
