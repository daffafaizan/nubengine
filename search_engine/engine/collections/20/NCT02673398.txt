    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of neratinib in adults age 60 or older with
      locally advanced or metastatic HER2 over-expressing breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the full toxicity profile including all grade toxicities measured by National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0.

      II. To estimate the rate of all grades of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities such as diarrhea,
      nausea, and vomiting.

      III. To estimate the rate of dose reduction, delays and discontinuation related to study
      drug.

      IV. To describe pharmacokinetic parameters of neratinib in adults 60 and older. V. To
      estimate overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      VI. To estimate event free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).

      VII. To evaluate the role of cancer-specific geriatric assessment tool in predicting
      treatment toxicities.

      VIII. To estimate adherence rate to neratinib in older adults (percentage of doses of
      neratinib taken).

      IX. To explore the association of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and geriatric assessment
      findings.

      X. To explore if serum biomarkers of aging (interleukin [IL]-6, C-reactive protein [CRP], and
      D-dimer) are associated with treatment toxicities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive neratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter.
