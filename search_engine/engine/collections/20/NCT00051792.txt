      efficacy of complementary exercises to manage dyspnea is unknown. Complementary exercises may
      be more congruent with patients' lifestyles and values than traditional exercise programs and
      can be adapted to changes in illness severity and disability. Yoga practice is a
      complementary therapy that people use to manage their dyspnea. The aims of this study are to:
      1) develop a safe and feasible yoga program for patients with COPD; 2) test the efficacy of
      this program; and 3) determine whether physical performance, psychological well being, and
      health-related quality of life are positively affected by yoga practice.

      Patients in this study will be randomized to receive yoga training or usual care for 12
      weeks. Patients will be evaluated at study entry, after each session, and immediately after
      the training program.
