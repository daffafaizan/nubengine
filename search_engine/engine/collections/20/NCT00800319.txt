    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, ascending dose, placebo controlled study.
      Dosing sequences will consist of 5 administrations of an oral solution of either ascending
      doses of RDC-0313 or volume-match placebo. Dosing of cohorts will be staggered to allow a
      blinded safety review to occur prior to dosing the next cohort. Subjects will be admitted to
      the facility the morning before each dose, and will be required to fast overnight prior to
      study drug administration. They will be discharged from the facility after the 36-hour
      postdose assessments are completed.
