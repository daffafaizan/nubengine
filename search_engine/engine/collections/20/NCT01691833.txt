      and is important for maintenance of bone formation, remodeling, and healing. An extensive
      literature search indicates that although there is evidence that vitamin D deficiency is
      associated with fracture risk, there is no evidence of the role of vitamin D deficiency in
      subsequent failure to heal. The aims of study were to: 1) quantify the rate of
      hypovitaminosis D in an orthopedic trauma population in the Southeastern United States; 2)
      determine the rate of nonunion in vitamin D deficient patients, and 3) assess the feasibility
      of acute high-dose vitamin-D supplementation in hypovitaminosis D patients.
