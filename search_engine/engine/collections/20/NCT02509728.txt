      this maternal-fetal choline-transfer. We have shown that choline plasma levels rapidly half
      after preterm delivery. We also demonstrated that plasma DHA-PC rapidly falls after preterm
      delivery. DHA supplementation has been evaluated and found safe, however the clinical
      benefits have been smaller than expected. We speculate that choline deficiency may have
      contributed to the smaller than expected benefit of DHA supplementation in the past.

      This study verifies the hypothesis that concomitant supply of choline and DHA will improve
      DHA-PC availability and turn-over. This is important because DHA-PC is the transport molecule
      for the DHA transport to the brain and the retina.

      To explore the effects of enteral choline and DHA supplementation on plasma choline and
      DHA-PC concentrations, this randomized controlled study will assign 40 preterm infants to 1
      of 4 groups: standard care, choline supplementation, DHA supplementation, and choline and DHA
      supplementation.

      After 7 days of supplementation, a single dose of stable isotope labelled choline will be
      administered and the kinetics of newly synthesized DHA-PC determined to assess plasma levels,
      uptake and distribution of choline and DHA.

      This study is designed to inform future larger studies evaluating this approach of enteral
      co-application of choline and DHA on important clinical outcomes.
