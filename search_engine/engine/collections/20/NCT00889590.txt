    
      GCT is a potentially malignant tumour that presents with a locally destructive osteolytic
      lesion. The high risk GCT are characterized by a high recurrence rate around the 40-45%.
      Zoledronic acid is a potent inhibitor of osteolysis and is capable of inducing osteoclast and
      stromal cell apoptosis, which makes it an attractive adjuvant treatment in 'high risk' GCT in
      order to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the recurrence rate.
