      and physiological wellbeing . A growing body of research indicates that chronic sleep
      disturbance is associated with impaired quality of life (QoL) and a risk factor for poorer
      health, for example depression cardiovascular disease, hypertension 1 and diabetes.

      insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a clinical condition defined as difficulties
      falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep and/or poor sleep quality despite adequate
      opportunity for sleep resulting in significant daytime impairment.

      The development of insomnia in healthy populations has a bi-directional relationship with
      psychological factors such as anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress, and may in clinical
      populations also be associated with physical symptoms, such as pain. the physical symptoms in
      psoriasis, such as itch, one would expect a higher prevalence of sleep disturbance in this
      patient group. On the other hand Sleep disturbance is common also in patients with atopic
      dermatitis (AD). Patients with AD often have sleep disturbances due to pruritus.
