        -  Determine the antitumor activity of anastrozole and ZD 1839, as measured by objective
           response (partial or complete) or stable disease at 6 months, in post-menopausal women
           with estrogen receptor-positive, hormone refractory, metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate molecular markers with clinical benefit in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to prior objective response to endocrine therapy (yes vs
      no).

      Patients receive oral anastrozole once daily alone for 2 weeks. Patients then receive oral
      anastrozole and oral ZD 1839 once daily for 28 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-78 patients (18-39 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
