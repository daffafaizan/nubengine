    
      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, single-center efficacy study of acutely
      decompensated heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), low cardiac
      index (<2.2) as determined by pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) who have been hemodynamically
      stabilized and ready for transition to oral vasodilator therapy at the discretion of the
      clinician. The investigators would like to accomplish the following objectives with this
      study:

        1. Establish the superiority of an upfront initiation strategy for sacubitril-valsartan at
           maintaining patients on ARNI therapy at one-month follow-up compared to usual care.

        2. Establish the safety of initiating sacubitril-valsartan in an intensive care setting

        3. Characterize the hemodynamic effect of sacubitril-valsartan on patients with low cardiac
           output

        4. Expand the population of hospitalized patients that can be initiated on ARNIs and thus
           facilitate prior to hospital discharge patients who are on optimal goal-directed medical
           therapy (GDMT) for heart failure

      In this pragmatic study, the primary endpoint will be establishing the superiority of
      sacubitril-valsartan as an oral vasodilator in maintaining ARNI therapy at one-month post
      hospital discharge as compared to usual care. Given the overall mortality and heart failure
      hospitalization benefit of ARNI over ACEI and other vasodilators has been established in
      large-scale clinical trials, establishing that upfront initiation of ARNI therapy in patients
      with low cardiac output is safe and can be maintained post-discharge would be of significant
      clinical benefit. Adverse events including symptomatic hypotension (requiring cessation of
      drug), development of worsening renal function (requiring cessation of drug), hyperkalemia
      [moderate (> 5.5 mmol/L) or severe (> 6 mmol/L)], or re-initiation of IV vasodilator or IV
      inotropic therapy will be monitored and tracked.
