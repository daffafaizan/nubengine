      studies. Atherosclerosis of the cerebral vasculatureis an important pathological process
      causing ischaemic stroke. The investigator's study aims to investigate the relationship
      between tooth loss(used as a surrogate of periodontal disease) and atherosclerotic-related
      arterial stenosis in the Chinese population. An estimated 1,000 participants that underwent
      cerebral angiography at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine between Apirl 2020
      and January 2022 will be recruited in this trial. Arterial stenosis features of each
      participants will be collected based on the results of digital subtraction angiography (DSA).
      The missing teeth counts of each participant will be collected and some of them will recieved
      comprehensive periodontal examination. Besides, blood samples will be collected in order to
      investigate the serum inflammatory markers(CRP,WBC,albumin,IL-6,IL-10). The relationship
      between tooth loss and atherosclerotic-related arterial stenosis will be analysed by
      regression models adjusted for conventional risk factors (sex,age, obesity,smoking,Alcohol
      drinking,diabetes,hypertension,hyperuricaemia,hyperhomocysteinaemia)
