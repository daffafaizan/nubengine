      extension, designed to compare a composite clinical outcomes endpoint of heart failure
      hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation with heart
      failure with preserved systolic function. The will be randomized to catheter ablation or Rate
      or Rhythm control drug therapy. This is an open label two phase study in which patients will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive catheter ablation or rate or rhythm control drug
      therapy. The pilot phase will consist to 60 patients .They will be followed for a minimum of
      6 months for safety and efficacy. The main trial will enroll 360 patients at 20 centers and
      they will be followed for a minimum of 12 months. Pilot phase patients will be followed in
      the main trial. Drug transitions will be performed according to approved drug labeling.
