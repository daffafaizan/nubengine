      number will continue to experience dizziness, balance problems, cognitive deficits, and
      vision problems. Single-task measures of static balance may not be sensitive enough, however,
      to capture mild postural changes still associated with incomplete recovery. Increasingly
      there is an interest in dual-task paradigms of balance assessment as a more accurate
      representation of functional postural control associated with activities of daily living and
      sport participation. Binasal occlusion (BNO) has been proposed as a means of providing visual
      stabilization to improve postural control in individuals with vision-related balance problems
      following a concussion.
