      often obscured by other carpal bone in conventional X-ray plain films, so hamate hook
      fractures are the most easily missed injury in hand surgery. As the incidence of such
      fractures is too small, it brings some difficulties in the clinical choice of correct and
      effective treatment. Currently, treatment programs of hamate hook fractures also are not
      consistent.
