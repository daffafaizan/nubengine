      community as it increases the risk of embolic stroke and other embolic phenomenon. Once
      detected, intervention can be taken to lower such an individual's clinical risk and decrease
      the clinical burden to the community. The lack of suitable tools and large population cohorts
      has led to a likely underestimation of PAF in various patient populations. This study will
      specifically address and characterize the different incidence on PAF in various patient
      populations and hence help to target at risk groups for earlier screening and intervention.

      Patients with HF are more likely than the general population to develop AF. Conversely AF is
      also a strong independent risk factor for subsequent development of HF.

      In Heart Failure (HF) patients, later development of AF was associated with increased
      mortality. Preexisting HF adversely affected survival in individuals with AF. Both HF with
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction
      (HFpEF) patients are at greater risk for AF. There is a direct relationship between
      functional state (as shown by the NYHA class) and prevalence of AF in patients with HF
      progressing from 4% in those who are NYHA class I to 40% in those who are NYHA class IV.

      Acute HF decompensation in patients with prior HF is due to AF as a precipitant in 5.4% of
      cases in a single center study.

      Knowing the true prevalence of AF in HF will allow us to plan for strategies to further
      reduce the clinical burden of HF.
