      (Supportive-Expressive group therapy) versus control group (no intervention) in women with
      primary breast cancer.

      This study tries to evaluate the efficacy of SEGT on breast cancer patients' emotion
      regulation, social support, caregiving, and marital satisfaction, and its improvement on
      breast cancer patients' life quality. This study also intents to explore the moderating role
      of attachment on these associations.
