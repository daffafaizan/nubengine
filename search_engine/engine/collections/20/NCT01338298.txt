    
      This will be a 16-week, double blind, placebo controlled randomized trial of aripiprazole
      added to an existing stabilized regimen of antipsychotics (either risperidone or paliperidone
      oral or long acting injectable formulations) for treatment of elevated symptomatic prolactin
      levels. Aripiprazole dosing will begin at 5 mg/day once daily and increased to 10mg by mouth
      once daily at the end of week 2 and then increased to 15 mg/day once daily at the end of week
      8 in women who have not yet regained their menstrual period. If a woman gets her menstrual
      period on the 5 or 10 mg dose she will remain on this dose for the study. Women will remain
      on their current stabilized medication regimen during the course of the adjunctive trial of
      aripiprazole or placebo. Subjects will be able to receive anticholinergic medications as
      needed (e.g., benztropine and diphenhydramine) for extrapyramidal side effects, propranolol
      for akathisia, and benzodiazepines (e.g.,lorazepam) for agitation or anxiety.

      Participants will be assigned to either get aripiprazole or placebo (a sugar pill), this will
      be decided randomly with a 50-50 chance of receiving one or the other medication. The placebo
      will be sucrose filled capsules that are identical to the active medication. It is double
      blind so no one will know if the capsule is placebo or aripiprazole. The dosing will be the
      exact same, one capsule taken daily until week 8. At this time 2 capsules will be given if
      the participant dose not regains their menstrual period.
