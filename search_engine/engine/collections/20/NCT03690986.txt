    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 alone and VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, on the immune profile in the tumor microenvironment and
      in peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To extend the previously reported safety profile of single agent VX15/2503 to the combination
      of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, in patients with head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning
      days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP B: Patients receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on
      day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP C: Patients receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP D: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36,
      patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP E: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36,
      patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      GROUP F: Patients undergo standard of care surgery.
