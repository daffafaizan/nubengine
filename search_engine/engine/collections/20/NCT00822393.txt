    
      To compare efficacy and safety of Treosulfan-based conditioning (test) with i.v.
      Busulfan-based reduced intensity conditioning (reference).

      The statistical aim of the study is to show non-inferiority with respect to:

      Event-free survival (EFS) within 2 years after transplantation. Events are defined as relapse
      of disease, graft failure or death (whatever occurs first).

        1. Comparative evaluation of incidence of CTC grade III/IV mucositis/stomatitis between day
           -6 and day +28

        2. Comparative evaluation of overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (RI)
           as well as non-relapse mortality (NRM) and transplantation-related mortality (TRM)within
           2 years after transplantation

        3. Comparative evaluation of day +28 conditional cumulative incidence of engraftment

        4. Comparative evaluation of day +28 and day +100 incidence of complete donor-type
           chimerism

        5. Comparative evaluation of cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GvHD within 2 years
           after transplantation

        6. Comparative evaluation of incidence of other CTC grade III/IV adverse events between day
           -6 and day +28

      Individual patients will be followed-up for at most 2 years after transplantation. Three
      confirmatory interim evaluations and one final analysis are planned, which allow to stop the
      trial as soon as the question of non-inferiority is answered (as outlined below). In
      addition, post-surveillance with respect to OS and EFS will be conducted one year after
      transplantation of the last randomised patient.
