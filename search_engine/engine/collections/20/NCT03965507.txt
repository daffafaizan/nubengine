      the study. During the evaluation, sacroiliac joint dysfunction was investigated using
      specific tests, pain levels with a Visual Analog Scale, and the presence of neuropathic pain
      using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Pain Scale. Other clinical
      assessments were performed using the Beck Depression Inventory, Health Assessment
      Questionnaire, and Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale. Positivity in three out of six provocation
      tests was adopted as a criterion for sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

      Sample Size A power analysis using the formula n= t2pq / d2 was performed to determine the
      sample size. Based on those data the investigators concluded that a minimum of 174 and a
      maximum of 322 patients would be required to achieve significant results, and 234 patients
      were enrolled.

      Statistical Analysis The study data were expressed as mean plus standard deviation (SD) for
      constant variables values and as number and percentage for categoric variables. The
      chi-square test was used to analyze categoric variables. Results were evaluated at a 95%
      confidence interval at a significance level of pË‚0.05. The analysis was performed on
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 16.0 software.

      The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline
      has been implemented in this manuscript.
