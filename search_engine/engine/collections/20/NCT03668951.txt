      to determine the early pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of a single dose via nasal or
      oral administration.

      Dexmedetomidine sedation is commonly used at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and other
      pediatric institutions. This compound is typically delivered intravenously or intranasally
      for sedation in children with or without congenital heart disease. Intranasal DEX is very
      effective for sedation although it has significant variability in the onset and peak effect.
      Patient care will be improved if factors that determine this variability can be determined.
      Investigators will determine the important clinical variables of peak plasma DEX
      concentration (Tmax and Cmax) of intranasal and buccal DEX in children.
