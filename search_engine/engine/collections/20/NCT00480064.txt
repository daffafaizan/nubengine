    
      Induction therapy: Patients were randomized to receive idarubicin plus cytarabine (IC) or the
      same drugs plus lomustine (ICL), the latter given at the dose of 200 mg/m2 orally at day 1.
      Patients with persistent leukemia in the bone marrow, defined by at least 20% marrow
      cellularity with more than 5% blasts on day 14 or at a subsequent time point following
      initiation of induction therapy, received a second course of induction chemotherapy identical
      to the initial induction course. Non-responders to the second induction course were taken off
      the protocol.

      Consolidation therapy: After completing induction treatment, patients who were in complete
      remission after 1 or 2 induction courses received a course of consolidation (IC') therapy
      with idarubicin and subcutaneous cytarabine. Subsequently, if stable remission persisted, the
      patients received maintenance therapy or maintenance therapy preceded by a second
      consolidation (IIC) with intermediate-dose cytarabine. Randomization was performed as soon as
      CR was achieved.

      Maintenance therapy: This was conducted in all patients with persisting CR one month after
      completing the first (IC) or second (IIC) consolidation and consisted of the following: five
      courses of combination chemotherapy at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 13 months from the last consolidation,
      namely cytarabine (subcutaneously) and idarubicin and between these courses for one year: a
      continuous regimen of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, as alternating 10 day-courses .
