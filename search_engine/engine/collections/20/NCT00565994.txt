      undergoing dialysis must have access to the vascular system (blood stream) for hemodialysis
      treatment. Methods of access include a catheter, or tube, that goes through the skin and into
      a large vein, a surgically created connection of a vein to an artery called an AV fistula, or
      a surgically created connection of a vein to artery using a graft or plastic tube. Previous
      research has shown considerable differences in the function and success in these types of
      vascular access for dialysis. Research investigators try to explain these differences and
      find the causes and explanations for the variations seen in vascular access.

      Forty patients undergoing dialysis treatment will be evaluated by analyzing serum specimens
      obtained during outpatient hemodialysis access. Serum will also be collected from ten
      pre-dialysis patients and ten normal volunteers for comparison. Pre-dialysis patients are
      those who have Stage 3, 4, or 5 chronic kidney disease but are not yet on dialysis and have
      never had any type of created vascular access. Normal subjects will have no kidney disease,
      autoimmune disorders, recent (<6 months) chemotherapy treatment or corticosteroid use, or
      other chronic condition determined by the investigator to interfere with cytokine and
      inflammatory markers. The serum specimens will be analyzed for cytokine/inflammatory markers
      and correlated with clinical access type and other medical data and demographic information.
