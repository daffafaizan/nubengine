      treatment due to mucogingival problems at pediatric dentistry department during two year
      period. Twenty-two patients treated with either Er,Cr:YSGG laser 2780 nm or 940 nm diode
      laser were selected who fulfilled the study's inclusion criteria. The analyzed data included
      age, gender, frenelum insertion type, type of dental laser, postoperative pain perception and
      wound healing. Post-operative pain was reported with Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale after
      3 hours 1, 7 and 14 days. Wound surface healing was evaluated through photography. Images
      were uploaded to the software and the changes in the wound area were measured in square
      millimeters at the day of frenectomy and on days 1, 7, and 14 postoperatively.
