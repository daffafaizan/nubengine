      registry in the Spain. The study design will reflect real-life clinical management of
      patients with HER2-positive MBC. Type and frequency of actual patient visits and all
      evaluations will be done as for routine clinical practice.

      The analysis of the efficacy and safety results obtained in patients receiving pertuzumab or
      TDM1 in those early access systems is of utmost importance. These real-world patients with
      advanced breast cancer may have different characteristics than those enrolled in clinical
      trials and clinicians must often extrapolate into therapeutic decisions not fully supported
      by a robust evidence.
