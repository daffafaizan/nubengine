      comparative-effectiveness study in which at-risk older adult study participants in three
      communities across the US are followed for 12-months. Using a quasi-experimental design,
      investigators will compare outcomes in those receiving peer-to-peer community support to
      those receiving standard community services.

      At all three sites investigators will include 120 older adults in the peer-to-peer support
      group and 120 in the standard community services group for a total intervention group size of
      360 (120 from each site) and 360 in the control group (120 from each site).

      Study Outcomes & Measures To meet the first two aims investigators will (1) compare
      annualized rates of hospitalization, ED use, and nursing home placement and (2) examine the
      changes in self-reported health, depression, anxiety, and other measures of well-being in the
      group receiving peer-to-peer support compared to the group receiving standard community
      services from baseline to the end of study enrolment. The investigators describe each of our
      outcomes and additional study measures in detail below. Measures have been translated and
      used in Spanish and have been shown to be valid or have high reliability in Spanish
