      patients were diagnosed with advanced disease and suffered from the poor outcome.With the
      development of target therapy among cancers,the overall survival and life quality of patients
      has been continuous improved recently.However,there had little reports focusing on target
      therapy in esophageal cancer . Caffeic acid as an ordinary drug is used for thrombocytopenia
      when patient received chemotherapy. Newly studies shown caffeic acid can target inhibit GASC1
      expression, and GASC1 is confirmed to be a new oncogene in esophageal cancer.

      Aim: to investigate the efficiency and safety of caffeic acid in chinese advanced esophageal
      squamous cell cancer.

      Methods: 80 advanced ESCC patients who failed to the chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (1 or
      2 line) will be randomized to two arms: arm A and arm B. In arm A, 40 patients will receive
      coffeic acid treatment: 100-200mg, tid, po, 2 weeks treated then 1 week black interval(weight
      >50kg, 200mg per time, weight < or =50kg, 100mg per time; in arm B, 40 patients will receive
      the placebo tablets. 1 years follow-up for all patients in this trial. Patients in both arms
      can receive any other ways of anti cancer therapy in the same time.

      Primary endpoints: OS; Second endpoints: PFS
