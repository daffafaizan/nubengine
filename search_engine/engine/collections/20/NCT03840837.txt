    
      This is a single-site non-randomized open label clinical trial in patients with Parkinson
      disease (PD) and mild to moderate cognitive deficits, designed to 1) identify associations
      between cognitive impairment and gait impairment, and 2) identify cognitive domains and gait
      measures that improve after 12 weeks of treatment with rivastigmine. Aim 1 will be addressed
      with a cross-sectional approach (arm 1, baseline only, all participants), and aim 2 will be
      addressed with a longitudinal interventional approach (arm 2, 12 week-treatment with
      rivastigmine, subgroup of participants).

      Patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) and mild to moderate cognitive deficits
      amounting to PD dementia (PDD) will be enrolled. At baseline (arm 1), all participants will
      perform the timed-up-and-go test (TUG), wearing a light-weight sensor device strapped to the
      lower back with a neoprene belt. Participants will also complete a computerized cognitive
      test battery (NeuroTrax Mild Cognitive Impairment & Early Dementia Battery by MindStreams). A
      subgroup of participants (arm 2) will then be treated with transdermal rivastigmine for 12
      weeks, with dose increases every 4 weeks and titration up to 13.3 mg/24h, if tolerated. The
      same assessment (quantitative gait testing and NeuroTrax computerized cognitive test battery)
      will be repeated after 12 weeks, with the participant on a stable dose of transdermal
      rivastigmine.

      The investigators will analyze correlation of iTUG measures and cognitive measures at
      baseline (cross-sectional analysis). The investigators will also analyze change in iTUG
      measures and cognitive measures between baseline and follow-up for the subgroup of
      participants in arm 2 (in other words, before and after rivastigmine treatment; longitudinal
      analysis).
