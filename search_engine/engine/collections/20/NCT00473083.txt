      for further chemotherapy. In July 2005, erlotinib was approved in Canada for the treatment of
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, following failure of first or second-line
      chemotherapy.

      Erlotinib's side effect profile includes rash. The incidence of rash in clinical trials has
      been reported to be approximately 50 - 75%, and has been hypothesised to parallel tumour
      response (20).

      The treatment of rash is controversial and many oncologists believe it is untreatable and
      self-limiting. The cause of the rash is not well understood but is felt to be a systemic
      event. Clinical experience of the investigators has suggested that minocycline 100 mg orally
      given twice-daily for 4 weeks and clindamycin 2% and hydrocortisone 1% topical cream for
      moderate to severe rash is a successful treatment.

      The objectives of this trial are to better delineate the rash and its features and to
      describe an optimal treatment. Since the rash is often facial in distribution and can
      therefore lead to physical and psychological distress to the patient, a dermatology life
      quality index will also be completed throughout the study.
