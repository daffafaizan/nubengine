      alveoli and, consequently, improves oxygenation and, therefore, used by respiratory
      physiotherapy aiming promoting lung re-expansion being. The BS was described by Marini as an
      attempt of optimizing vital capacity in little co-operative individuals and hemodynamics has
      been considered a way of incentive spirometry that provides high lung volume, in situations,
      in which, inspiratory maneuver duration can be as important as the volume reached, composing
      an alternative incentive of inspiration technic4. The system used is composed by an interface
      (facial mask) connected to the patient, an inspiratory unidirectional valve and the
      respiratory branch which is kept occluded during the carrying out of maneuvers.
