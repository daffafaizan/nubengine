      and mortality, especially in chronic kidney disease .

      It has a predictive value of poor prognoses and clinical outcomes in CKD patients such as
      overall mortality and even poor arteriovenous graft maturation .

      Vitamin K is essential for the activation of matrix Gla protein (MGP), a powerful inhibitor
      of tissue calcification, functional vitamin K deficiency may contribute to high vascular
      calcification (VC) burden in haemodialysis patients; this is process in which mineral is
      pathologically deposited in blood vessels, mainly in large elastic and muscular arteries such
      as the aorta and the coronary, carotid, and peripheral arteries.
