      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although in a recent article, the researchers suggested
      the term "non-celiac wheat sensitivity" (NCWS), because it is not known to date what
      component of wheat actually causes the symptoms. Other areas of doubt in NCWS regard its
      pathogenesis, while some papers reported intestinal immunologic activation, others linked
      NCWS to the dietary short chain carbohydrate (fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and
      polyols, FODMAPs) load. The researchers recently demonstrated that higher proportions of
      patients with NCWS develop autoimmune disorders, are antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive,
      and show DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      supporting an immunologic involvement in NCWS. The clinical picture of NCWS is characterized
      by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea,
      epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and extra-intestinal or
      systemic manifestations (headache, depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,' tiredness, dermatitis
      or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, and anemia). Lactose
      intolerance and cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are two conditions with a very high
      prevalence in the general population and there is a large overlap between NCWS and lactose
      intolerance and CMPA symptoms. Therefore, the aims of the present study are to investigate 1)
      the prevalence of positive lactose breath test and DBPC cow's milk protein challenge in NCWS
      patients with self-reported gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to milk
      and/or milk derivates ingestion, 2) the clinical, serological, and histological
      characteristics of NCWS patients with lactose intolerance and CMPA in comparison to NCWS
      patients without lactose intolerance and CMPA.
