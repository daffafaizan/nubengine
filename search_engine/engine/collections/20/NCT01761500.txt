      diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and lymphoblastic
      lymphoma (LBL). These subtypes of NHL are an aggressive group of diseases. At present, in
      developed countries, 80 to 90% of children with NHL are cured by intensive, risk-adapted
      chemotherapy.The best protocols include BFM-90, LMB-89 and FAB/LMB/96. However, in developing
      countries, such as those with low and moderate incomes, the limited availability of resources
      is an obstacle for using these complicated and intensive protocols.As such, very simple
      protocols, such as the CHOP protocol, were often used to treat children and adolescents with
      NHL, thus resulting in poor survival rates. To improve the survival rate of Chinese children
      and adolescents with NHL, This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
      this modified NHL-BFM -90 protocol in Chinese children and adolescents with NHL.
