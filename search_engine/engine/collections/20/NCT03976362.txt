    
      This study has 2 phases: an Induction Phase (4 Cycles) and a Maintenance Phase (Up to 31
      cycles of pembrolizumab). In the Induction Phase, participants receive pembrolizumab plus
      carboplatin plus a taxane (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel). In the Maintenance Phase,
      participants with a partial or complete disease response or with stable disease after
      completing four cycles of induction therapy and who meet eligibility criteria will be
      randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab plus maintenance olaparib OR pembrolizumab plus
      maintenance olaparib placebo. In the Maintenance Phase, participants randomly assigned to
      receive pembrolizumab for up to 31 cycles plus maintenance olaparib OR maintenance olaparib
      placebo until centrally verified progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicities, or
      physician decision."
