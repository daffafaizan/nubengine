      endoscopists, is of increasing interest for clinical endoscopy practice. Recent studies have
      shown that thresholds for optical diagnosis are met in highly selected groups of expert
      endoscopists, but the same is not true in community endoscopy practices. In order to improve
      optical diagnosis, imaging enhancement techniques and the use of artificial intelligence are
      proposed.

      This observational study developes a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to differentiate
      between benign and (pre-)malignant CRPs, using state-of-the-art machine learning methods and
      deep learning architectures. For the development, HDWL and BLI images are used. The CADx is
      trained using histology as gold standard. The CADx is externally validated using on a set of
      60 colorectal polyps. This study will evaluate if the optical diagnosis of colorectal polyps
      can be improved with the aid of CADx.

      In addition, both expert endoscopists and novices optically diagnose the colorectal polyps.
      In the first, pre-training phase, endoscopists optically diagnose colorectal polyps based on
      intuition. Afterwards, in the post-training phase, the same set of colorectal polyps is
      optically diagnosed based on a clinical classification system; BLI Adenoma Serrated
      International Classification (BASIC). This study will evaluate if the optical diagnosis of
      colorectal polyps can be improved with the aid of BASIC in both expert and non-expert hands.
