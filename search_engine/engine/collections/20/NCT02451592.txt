      order to collect data in a comparable way. The requested informations include type of
      malignancy and its treatment, environmental expositions, laboratory work up, antifungal
      prophylaxis, clinical signs of infection, microbiological findings, antifungal therapy and
      outcome of infection at 30 days.

      The planned sample size is about 300 patients to be recruited in 35 participating center over
      5 years, in a retrospective-prospective fashion. Data check will be performed at the
      coordinating center. Missing data will be managed to minimize incomplete reports.

      factors predictive of fungal infection and outcome.
