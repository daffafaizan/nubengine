      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of alisertib (MLN8237) and bortezomib when
      combined with rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell and B-cell low grade
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the rate of overall response (complete response and partial response) for
      patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell and B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      treated with the combination of MLN8237 plus bortezomib and rituximab.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical significance of Aurora A over-expression and the proliferative
      index in initial tumor biopsy specimens from patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      and B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of MLN8237 plus
      bortezomib and rituximab.

      II. To evaluate and compare in paired biopsy specimens pre-treatment and on day 8: apoptosis
      and G2M arrest, and the expression level of cell cycle related proteins including: cyclin D1,
      p53, BIM-1, p27, p21, noxa, puma and survivin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib and bortezomib.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7; bortezomib
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15; and rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Note: *After 8 courses, treatment with rituximab repeats once every 3 courses (12 weeks) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
