      in test tube studies at varying doses. There is a need to see if lower doses result in
      effective therapy with less harmful side effects.

      Patients are assigned at random to one of two treatment programs: (1) 1 dose of AZT given
      orally (PO) for 6 doses per day; (2) 2 doses of AZT PO for 4 weeks followed by 1 dose PO for
      the remainder of the trial.
