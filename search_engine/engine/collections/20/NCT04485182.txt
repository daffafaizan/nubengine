      effects of the tangentor on the low back pain.

      The patients presenting at the rheumatology inpatient clinics were enrolled without into the
      treatment and control groups.

      Patients receiving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation + underwater massage + spine
      gymnastics

      In the controll group the Patients receiving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation +
      spine gymnastics

      Underwater jet massage (Tangentor) would be performed in a tub developed for this purpose,
      where the water temperature: 33-35 Â° C. The treatments lasting from 15 atm and 15 cm for 15
      minutes.

      The water temperature is precisely measured by a built-in thermometer. Pressure is controlled
      by a manometer.

      They take a minimum of 10 treatments for approx. under 2 weeks.

      The back massage position is, that the patient lying on their side, hip and knees are
      slightly bent and the head and neck rest on a support.

      After the massage the client should rest for about 30minutes.

      Patients participated in two visits, for the first time before the study, right after the
      therapy treatments.

      During the study, all participants received the usual or necessary medications. On a Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) patients indicated degree of pain on a scale from 0 to 100 mm for the
      past week. VAS scores were expressed in millimetres (zero point-no pain; endpoint-intolerable
      pain). Patients recorded on the VAS scale the level of low back pain at rest as well as
      during activity. Functional disability was assessed by using the Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI).

      Furthermore, there was a questionnaire on the quality of life, known as the EuroQol Five
      Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).
