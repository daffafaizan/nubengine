      who have undergone SpyGlass pancreatoscopy in Helsinki University Hospital in the recent
      years, and recruit patients continuously to obtain a significant amount of study subjects. We
      investigate the radiological findings and diagnoses before the SpyGlass procedure, and if
      ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) has been performed, also brush
      cytology.

      During the SpyGlass procedure we collect direct visual guided biopsies of the suspected IPMN
      area and the flushing liquid used in the pancreatic duct. We then compare the diagnosis given
      by the collected samples to the ones the patients had based on examinations before the
      SpyGlass pancreatoscopy.

      Our SpyGlass pancreatoscopy technique is different compared to previous studies. With our
      equipment we are able to provide pancreatoscopy to patients, who previously have had an
      endoscopic stenting procedure affecting their pancreatic duct. We also collect and analyze
      the flushing fluid for malignant cells, which haven't been done before. With these new means
      we hope to get more accurate results.
