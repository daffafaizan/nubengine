      There is a high rate of comorbidity with alcohol dependence (AD) and post traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). The rates of PTSD among individuals with AD are at least twice as high as
      those in the general population. In addition, alcohol dependence is the most common comorbid
      condition in men with PTSD. Despite this, little is known about how to best treat individuals
      with comorbid AD and PTSD. The use of an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist represents a
      novel approach to treatment that may target symptoms of both AD and PTSD. There is evidence
      of common neurobiological mechanisms that underlie both AD and PTSD. Prazosin is an alpha-1
      adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been used successfully in the treatment of trauma
      nightmares and sleep disturbance in combat veterans with PTSD, and alcohol dependence.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prazosin (16mg) versus placebo in
      reducing alcohol consumption and decreasing symptoms of PTSD in patients with comorbid AD and
      PTSD. Methods: Thirty participants with a current diagnosis of AD and PTSD will be enrolled
      in a 13-week trial. They will be assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to either prazosin or
      placebo. Significance: This project will be the first to compare prazosin to placebo as
      effective treatments for reducing alcohol consumption and PTSD symptoms in patients with both
      AD and PTSD.
