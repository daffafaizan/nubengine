      I. Determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) busulfan including interdose
      variability and evaluation of a limited sampling strategy.

      II. Determine thymoglobulin (anti-thymocyte globulin) pharmacokinetics.

      III. Determine the incidence of donor engraftment.

      IV. Determine system toxicities >= grade 3 per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version (v.) 3.

      V. Determine the incidence and severity of chronic GvHD.

      VI. Determine the incidence of non-relapse mortality at day +100 and at 1 year (yr).

      VII. Determine the incidence of relapse.

      VIII. Determine relapse-free survival.

      IX. Determine the incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -9 to -6,
      busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -2, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6 hours on
      days -3 and -2 and over 4 hours on day -1. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0. Patients then receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally
      (PO) every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and taper to day 180 and methotrexate IV on days 1,
      3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year.
