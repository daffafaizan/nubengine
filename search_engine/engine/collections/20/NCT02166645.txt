      proportion of successful extubation of preterm infants immediately after the extubation.
      Methods: Participants will be recruited from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and they
      will be divided into two groups (supine and prone) and positioned in their respective groups
      after extubation. A clinical evaluation form and a parameters collection form (respiratory
      rate, heart rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen, fraction of inspired oxygen and
      temperature) will be used and filled before extubation and 48 hours after by the professional
      staff of the NICU. It will be considered a successful extubation all participants who staying
      extubated for 48 hours after extubation.
