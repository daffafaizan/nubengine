      reduction of stroke, death and re-infarction following myocardial infarction, and in the
      reduction of stroke in atrial fibrillation. Warfarin is the most promising unstudied
      intervention in patients with cardiac failure. This randomized, double-blind, multi-center
      study will define optimal antithrombotic therapy for patients with cardiac (heart) failure
      and patients with low ejection fraction (EF). EF is the proportion of left ventricular volume
      emptied during systole. It reliably measures left ventricular systolic function.

      With the rapidly increasing numbers of elderly patients with heart failure, this study has
      important public health implications. The study will determine which of two commonly used
      treatments Warfarin, an anticoagulant, or aspirin, a drug which affects platelet function is
      better for preventing death and stroke in patients with low ejection fraction.
