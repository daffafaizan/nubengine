      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with potentially resectable stage III gastric
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant S-1 and cisplatin followed by gastrectomy and adjuvant
           S-1 vs no neoadjuvant chemotherapy before gastrectomy and adjuvant S-1.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the curative resection rates in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens, in terms of postoperative complications, adverse
           events, and treatment- or surgery-related mortality rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (T3 vs T4) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo gastrectomy with D2+ lymph node dissection. Patients
           then receive adjuvant oral S-1.

        -  Arm II (neoadjuvant therapy): Patients receive neoadjuvant oral S-1 on days 1-21 and
           cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 2 courses in the
           absence of disease progression. Patients then undergo surgery and receive adjuvant S-1
           as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
