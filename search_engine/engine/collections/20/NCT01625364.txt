      approximately 4 million children experience exacerbation of asthma symptoms annually. The NIH
      National Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma specify that part of a
      successful management program includes educating students with asthma and their caregivers
      about the condition. The guidelines recommend expanding education of students and families to
      schools and community settings. An academic and counseling program was developed for older
      school-age students with asthma and their family caregivers titled Staying Healthy-Asthma
      Responsible & Preparedâ„¢ (SHARP). A two-group prospective randomized single-blinded design was
      used. The sample consisted of two cohorts of students diagnosed aged 9-12 years with asthma
      and their caregivers from varying socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Cohort dyads
      were drawn from 23 elementary schools that were located in a diverse, moderately sized,
      medically underserved, inner-city community. The schools were matched based on projected
      enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and
      racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. Recently retired certified elementary
      schoolteachers, identified by the district, were trained to serve as interveners to deliver
      both programs in the schools during instructional time.
