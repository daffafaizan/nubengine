    
      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common and widely recognized disorder involving the
      oral mucosa. It occurs typically as a single or multiple well-defined painful self-limiting
      ulcerative lesions influencing the nonkeratinized oral mucous membrane surrounded by red
      halo. The prevalence of RAS is up to 25% in the world population, with recurrence rate of 50%
      every 3 mouths. The exact cause of RAS is uncertain, and accordingly numerous components are
      as yet being implicated such as genetic, hormonal, traumatic, nutritional, allergic,
      immunological, and psychological factors.
