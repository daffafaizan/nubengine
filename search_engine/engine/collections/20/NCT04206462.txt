    
      A total of 300 patients with osteoarthritis will be included in the study. The objective of
      the study is to investigate the eating behaviour of the patients included in the study by
      using a semiquantitative questionnaire (frequency and quantity) by estimating the foods that
      are known to be protective for osteoarthritis (vegetables, fruits, cereals) as the ones that
      are considered risk factors (meat origin, refined fats). Also, the weight and height of each
      patient will be assessed and the patients will be included in 4 classes based on the body
      mass index: underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. The type of physical activity
      will also be noted and the oxidative-antioxidative balance will be evaluated by determining
      serum markers: oxidated glutathione/reducted glutathione, catalase enzyme, superoxide
      dismutase, glutathion peroxidase and malonyldialdehyde. Correlation between eating behaviour,
      body mass index and oxidative stress markers will be made.
