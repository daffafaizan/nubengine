    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal electrical stimulation intensity level
      at which subjects using the portable electrical muscle stimulator (VeinoPlus) have the
      largest benefit for relief of post thrombotic symptoms. To determine if the subjects reported
      benefit from the device and willingness to continue using the device.

      Subjects will be pre-screened on the phone for eligibility, and an initial appointment will
      be set. The subject will be given a device and complete a quality of life survey. The subject
      will also be assessed on the Villalta scale. After two months, the subjects will return for
      the final visit where the Villalta scale and quality of life survey will be reassessed, and
      the device taken back.
