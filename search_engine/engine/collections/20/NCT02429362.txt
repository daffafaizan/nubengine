      pregnancy, as well as events that occur when women and/or their babies have a disease or
      condition during pregnancy. Additionally, the samples may be used in future studies to
      develop cell lines for research, create tests to diagnose disease, or develop treatments. A
      cell line is the result of cells grown outside the body in a laboratory. This process will
      allow those cells to grow continuously when given the appropriate nutrients and conditions
      for growth, and will result in a permanent cell culture which is the collection of cells that
      are grown outside the body in a laboratory.

      The stored samples will also be used in future studies to help researchers identify genetic
      influences during pregnancy. Genes are like blueprints in each of your cells that determine
      traits that you inherit, like eye color and hair color. Genes may also influence what
      diseases you get and how you respond to treatment. DNA is the substance that makes up your
      genes.

      The subject will sign an informed consent for her participation (Primary Informed Consent).
      In the situation of a stillbirth occurring, the mother of the stillborn baby will sign an
      informed consent regarding the tissue samples to be obtained during the hospital's routinely
      performed autopsy. (Secondary Informed Consent).
