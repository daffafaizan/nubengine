      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in obese,
      diet-controlled, type 2 diabetic patients. Patients are randomized to receive either
      topiramate or placebo. After a 5 week pre-enrollment phase followed by a 6 week run-in phase,
      patients in the topiramate group start an 8-week titration phase to reach the assigned dose
      of topiramate, either 96 or 192 mg daily. Treatment continues for 1 year. Assessments of
      effectiveness include percent change in body weight, hemoglobin type A1c [HbA1c] levels, Body
      Mass Index [BMI], the numbers and proportion of 5% and 10% weight loss responders, glucose
      tolerance, waist and hip circumferences, changes in the mass of left ventricle of the heart,
      blood pressures, and fasting lipid profiles. Safety evaluations, including incidence of
      adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory values, and electrocardiograms [ECGs], are
      monitored throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate, combined with
      controlled diet, will be effective in weight reduction and controlling blood sugar level and
      is well tolerated. During the initial 8 weeks, the oral doses of either a matching placebo or
      topiramate will be gradually increased to the target doses (96 milligrams[mg] or 192mg
      daily); the dose will be maintained for 1 year.
