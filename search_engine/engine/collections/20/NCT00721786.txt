    
      This is Phase VI of a series of clinical trials comparing various Internet methods to help
      smokers quit via the Internet.

      Our previous trials have involved randomized assignment. This trial is a participant
      preference trial, in which English- and Spanish-speaking smokers will be able to choose the
      elements of the site which they would like to use to stop smoking.

      Smokers who find our link via search engines or listing on other Web sites may choose to
      enter the study.

      Participants must be 18 years old to enter the study. Participants will be followed up at 1,
      3, 6, and 12 months after entry into the study to determine whether they have stopped
      smoking. They will receive an email reminder with a link to our follow-up surveys. We will
      stop sending these email reminders on May 19, 2011, when the current Website will close.

      Participation is totally voluntary. Participants are free not to provide data or to stop
      participating at any time.
