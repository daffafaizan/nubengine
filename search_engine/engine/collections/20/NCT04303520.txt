    
      Primary Objectives

      1. To determine the feasibility ad safety of anti-CD19/ CD22 CAR-T cells in treating patients
      with CD19-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine in vivo expression, dynamics and persistency of anti-CD19/CD22 CAR-T cells.

        2. To determine in vivo expression of CD19-positive B cells.

        3. To access the complete remission rate (ORR) in patients with ALL with 3 months after
           CD19/CD22 CAR-T cells infusion.

        4. To investigate the favorable CD19/CD22 CAR-T cells dose and dosage regimen for the Phase
           II Clinical Trial.
