    
      Kidney transplant recipients receiving a non lymphodepletional induction therapy at the
      investigators center will be included in this study.

      Alloreactive T cells are defined prior to transplantation via a mixed lymphocyte reaction of
      donor and recipient PBMC's.

      Following transplantation PBMC's will be sampled at management (3 and 12 months) and
      for-cause biopsies and fifteen patients with histological proven acute T cell mediated
      rejection will be compared to 15 patients without histopathological signs of alloimmune
      response in time matched for-cause biopsies.

      T cell receptor beta chains of T cells found in the circulation and the allograft biopsy will
      be sequenced via Next generation sequencing.

      Abundance of alloreactive T cells of the overall repertoire pre-and post-transplant and their
      presence in the allograft will be assessed.

      The diversity of the overall repertoire and alloreactive repertoire will be compared between
      these two groups.
