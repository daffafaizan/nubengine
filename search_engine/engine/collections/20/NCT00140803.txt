    
      This is a randomized, single-masked (VA examiners, angiographic graders), multi-center, Phase
      2 study with 3 arms comparing VISUDYNE therapy in combination with intravitreal injection of
      either a 1 mg or 4 mg of triamcinolone with VISUDYNE therapy without intravitreal
      triamcinolone in a 1:1:1 ratio.

      Re-treatment may be administered at 3 month intervals (ï‚± 14 days) if evidence of CNV leakage
      is detected by fluorescein angiography.

      At baseline and at 3 month (+ 14 days) intervals patients will undergo the following
      assessments: ophthalmic examination, best corrected visual acuity, fluorescein angiography,
      and color fundus photography. The eligibility criteria for inclusion into the study and
      re-treatment of patients will be based on fluorescein angiography. Patients receiving
      treatment at day-1, week-3, and week-6 following the treatment will have best corrected ETDRS
      visual acuity testing and ophthalmic. Those patients not being re-treated will have will have
      best corrected ETDRS visual acuity testing and ophthalmic examination at week-6 following the
      re-treatment evaluation visit.

      Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study.

      Expected time for recruitment is 6 months; all patients will be followed for the period of 12
      months in the study
