    
      A 2-part multi-center, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RHB-204 in adult subjects with underlying
      nodular bronchiectasis and documented MAC lung infection.

      The primary efficacy endpoint evaluates sputum culture conversion evaluated at Month 6 (and
      defined as at least 3 prior consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures at Month 6).

      Subjects remain on study drug in Part 2 until Month 16.

      Patient reported outcomes and durability of microbiological response will be assessed at
      Month 6 and Month 19 (3 months post-completion of treatment).
