      N-Back test. The 0-back condition and the 2-back condition will be used. After cognitive
      assessment, participants will perform 3 different postural control tasks (standing balance,
      regular gait, and tandem gait) in a random order. Postural tasks for each participant will be
      determined by using random allocation envelopes.

      Computerized dynamic posturography will be used to evaluate standing balance with no added
      cognitive load. Standing balance assessment will be repeated two more times, once with
      participants engaged in performing the auditory 0-back task, and then with simultaneously
      performing the auditory 2-back task. Regular gait at participants' preferred speed will be
      examined using 6 light-weight wearable inertial sensors. The regular walking assessment will
      be repeated with simultaneous performance of the 0-back task and then with simultaneous
      engagement in the 2-back task. We have also included a tandem gait (placing one foot directly
      in front of the other) in order to make the postural task more challenging. The wearable
      inertial sensors will be used to record participants' gait characteristics while tandem
      walking. The tandem walk assessment will be repeated once with the participant simultaneously
      perform the 0-back task and then with the 2-back task. The estimated required time to perform
      all of the assessments and with inclusion of 3 rest intervals is 2 hours.

      In addition, data from the overall SJLIFE assessment will be used in analysis.
