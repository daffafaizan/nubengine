    
      35 volunteers aged 18 to 50 years will be enrolled to receive one of 2 investigational
      malaria vaccines. The vaccines are made of a malaria protein FMP2.1 mixed in 2 different
      adjuvants (AS01B and AS02A). Five volunteers will get a small (10 µg) dose of FMP2.1/AS01B
      since this vaccine has not yet been in humans. If it is safe, then 15 volunteers will get 50
      µg FMP2.1 in AS02A and 15 will get 50 µg FMP2.1 in AS01B. All vaccines are given IM in the
      deltoid of the non-dominant arm, every 1 month for 3 months. After vaccination, the subjects
      will follow up at clinical trials for evaluation of any adverse events.

      20 vaccinees (10 from each 50 µg vaccine group) will undergo primary sporozoite challenge
      14-30 days after dose 3 via bite of 5 malaria-infected mosquitoes. All subjects will have a
      blood slide prepared and read to check for asexual P. falciparum parasitemia at least once
      daily beginning day 5 post challenge. Beginning on day 10 post challenge, subjects will check
      into a designated hotel, where 24 hour evaluation and care will be available for 10 nights.
      After this hotel phase, there will be follow-up visits to ensure there are no late
      developments of malaria in those who have not fallen ill (and thus are considered protected).

      Any subject who tests positive for malaria will be treated with chloroquine. Efficacy
      readouts are complete protection or significant delay in patency defined as >2 days than the
      median prepatent period for the 6 infectivity controls. These 6 controls receive no vaccine
      and are enrolled for malaria-challenge only in order to provide comparison group for
      vaccinated individuals.
