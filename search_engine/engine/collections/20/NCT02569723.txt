      I. To evaluate the feasibility of [14C] (carbon C 14) oxaliplatin microdose as a clinical
      assay to predict oxaliplatin exposure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the degree to which a [14C]oxaliplatin microdose predicts the observed
      pharmacokinetics of standard dose oxaliplatin.

      II. To validate that intrapatient variation of exposure to a [14C]oxaliplatin microdose is
      less than 5%.

      III. To detect the levels of oxaliplatin-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts induced by
      oxaliplatin microdosing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and correlate the
      results with patient response and progression free survival on oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy.

      IV. To develop preliminary safety data of [14C]oxaliplatin microdosing for future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carbon C 14 oxaliplatin microdose intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes.
      Beginning not more than 4 weeks after the initial carbon C 14 oxaliplatin microdose
      administration, patients receive FOLFOX comprised of leucovorin calcium IV, fluorouracil IV
      over 2 hours (over 46-48 hours via ambulatory infusion pump on days 1 and 2), and oxaliplatin
      (contain carbon C 14 microdose course I only) IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every
      14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
