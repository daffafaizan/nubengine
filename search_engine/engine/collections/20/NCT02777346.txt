      Geneva's University Hospital with open wounds needing suture. The patients are treated with
      absorbable versus non-absorbable suture material according to randomization.

      After obtaining the patient's/parent's consent and randomization, the suture material will be
      provided.

      Selection of the size of the thread and the date of the first follow-up are determined as
      follows:

        -  Face: Thread size 5-0 to 7-0, first follow-up 4-7 days

        -  Torso/back: Thread size 4-0 or 5-0, first follow-up 10-14 days

        -  Arms: Thread size 4-0 or 5-0, first follow-up 7- 10 days

        -  Hand: Thread size 5-0 or 6-0, first follow-up 7-10 days

        -  Legs: Thread size 4-0 or 5-0, first follow-up 7-14 days

      The patients are examined by in the outpatient wound clinic by specialised nurses under
      medical supervision at the first follow-up, and at six months by one of the investigators.

      Outcomes:

        1. infection rate at the first follow-up (between 4 and 14 days, depending on the sutured
           site and defined by protocol)

        2. scar appearance at a 6-months follow-up.
