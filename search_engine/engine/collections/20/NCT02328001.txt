      used during the EGD and colonoscopy procedures. The endoscopists will be the participants
      under study and not the patients. The study will be conducted in two phases - pre and
      post-intervention phases. Each phase will include a minimum of 337 combined EGD and
      colonoscopy procedures and a total of upto a minimum 674 and a maximum of 1200 procedures for
      both phases. All consecutive patients undergoing EGD and colonoscopy will be included. For
      the first phase of the study, the endoscopist will not be made aware of the study and also
      will not be briefed at the end of the procedure with the number of accessories used during
      the procedure and the dollar value of the accessories. For the second phase of the study,
      endoscopist will be briefed by the endoscopy nursing staff after completion of each procedure
      about the total number of accessories used and the dollar value of the accessories used
      during the procedure. Once the study is completed, endoscopists will be debriefed about the
      study and outcomes.
