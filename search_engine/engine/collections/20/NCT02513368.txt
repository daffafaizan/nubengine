      order to increase soft tissue volume and keratinized tissue height at implant site: roll
      flaps, connective tissue graft , epithelial connective tissue graft. In recent years, soft
      tissue substitutes , such as acellular dermal matrix or collagen matrix have been proposed to
      increase the dimensions of peri implant soft tissues; however, further studies have
      demonstrated that the allograft materials were less effective and less predictable than
      autogenous soft tissue grafts, in terms of increasing attached keratinized tissue , due to
      the considerable shrinkage and inconsistent quality of the attached tissue gained ;
      consequently soft tissue graft from the palate are currently considered the gold standard for
      augmenting peri implant soft. Some clinical studies proposed the association of contour
      augmentation by guided bone regeneration (GBR) with implant placement. The aim of these
      procedures is to restore the missing volume and to establish a facial bone wall of sufficient
      height and thickness to serve as a support for peri implant soft tissues; in these terms, GBR
      could be considered important to increase the stability of peri implant soft tissue ,
      preventing the marginal soft tissue shrinkage and the following exposition of implant . This
      could be a valid approach to stabilize coronal peri implant soft tissue and at the same time
      less traumatic than grafting procedures.
