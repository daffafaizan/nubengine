    
      PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  To show that the mean 24-hour IOP control obtained with BTFC (morning or evening) is
           statistically better to that with bimatoprost monotherapy given once on the evening.

        -  To demonstrate that the fixed combination will provide a significantly better IOP
           control in the morning when dosed in the evening.

        -  To test whether the mean 24-hour IOP control obtained with BTFC given once in the
           evening may be statistically better to that with BTFC given once in the morning.

        -  To show whether there will be less 24-hour fluctuation of IOP with the evening dosing of
           BTFC.

      STUDY POPULATION

      Consecutive newly-diagnosed, or suitably washed-out patients with exfoliative glaucoma (XFG)
      who exhibit a mean untreated IOP greater than 25 mm Hg at baseline (10:00).
