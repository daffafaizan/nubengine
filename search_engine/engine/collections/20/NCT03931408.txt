      solution will decrease the rate of UTIs and the use of oral medications used to treat UTIs.
      The occurrence of UTIs in the SCI population is high, with a rate of about 2.5 episodes per
      year. The inability to effectively empty the bladder increases the risk of UTIs, which are
      the most common medical complication after SCI. This study will help us understand the
      effectiveness of a local bladder therapy on preventing UTIs and improving bladder function in
      individuals with SCI.
