      and genetic presenting features with molecular assessment of MRD should reduce both
      treatment-related toxicities and relapse risk.

      The patient will be assigned to one of the 3 risk groups depending on his/her response to the
      treatment and special laboratory tests. There are no experimental drugs in this study. All
      the drugs used are standard established treatment for childhood ALL for the last 30 years.
      The difference in treatment is by changes in the frequency and dose of the chemotherapy
      drugs.

      The overall study treatment lasts for about 2 years.
