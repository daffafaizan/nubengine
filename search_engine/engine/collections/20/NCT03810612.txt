      interviews on patients' experiences of healthcare delivery will provide a context for the
      quantitative data to develop the content of the cohort study and trial intervention. (2) A
      prospective cohort design with a 1-year follow-up period will include data on
      patient-reported outcomes, and a 10-year follow-up for adverse events. In translation and
      adaptation of patient-reported outcome measures, a methodological design will be applied. (3)
      A discrete choice experiment will investigate patient preferences for aftercare and cardiac
      rehabilitation.
