    
      1. For the pathogenic gene of Waardenburg syndrome and large vestibular aqueduct syndrome,
           based on the second-generation sequencing technology, the investigators develop
           multiplex PCR system for these two hereditary deafness gene diagnostic kit.

        2. Using CNVplex high-throughput gene copy number detection technology to analyse
           Warrdenburg syndrome pathologic gene. CNVs analysis for Warrdenburg deafness syndrome
           develop special testing system / kit achieve SNP / CNVs detected simultaneously, as a
           supplementary means of genetic testing in clinical deafness.
