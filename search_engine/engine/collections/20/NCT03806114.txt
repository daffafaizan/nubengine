      specific positions and activities to decrease the risk of their hip dislocating following
      their surgery. This, however, results in patients becoming more fearful of moving and leads
      to limitations in their function and decreased quality of life. Previous research has shown
      that hip dislocations following surgery are most commonly attributed to poor implant position
      rather than the actions of the patients. Teaching precautions takes up healthcare resources
      and may use finances that are not necessarily required. This study aims to compare groups
      with half receiving precautions and half not receiving precautions, to assess the impact of
      precautions on the patients' quality of life.
