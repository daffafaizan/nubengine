      who attain a negative PET scan early in therapy (after one or 2 cycles of chemotherapy) have
      a uniformly excellent outcome, with long term disease free survival of 90-95%. We propose to
      abbreviate chemotherapy in those patients showing a complete metabolic response as measured
      by FDG-PET after one cycle of ABVD. These patients will undergo two more cycles of ABVD
      chemotherapy, for a total of 3 cycles. Those patients failing to achieve a complete metabolic
      response as demonstrated by residual FDG avidity will go off study and be treated as per
      their primary treating physician.
