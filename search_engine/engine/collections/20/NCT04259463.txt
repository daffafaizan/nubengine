      Surgery at LSMU KK hospital for removal of all four wisdom teeth with sedation or general
      anesthesia. The patients were given one day to complete the given questionnaires. They were
      asked to complete three questionnaires: a) before the surgery, i.e. at the time the patient
      was hospitalized; b) the same day prior to surgery; c) ten days after the surgery. The
      operating doctor also filled out a questionnaire ten days after the surgery.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate, wheather the sedation or general anesthesia in third
      molar extractions influence the patient's psycho-emotional status. It is believed that the
      type of anesthesia may influence not only the psycho-emotional status after the procedure,
      but also before the procedure.
