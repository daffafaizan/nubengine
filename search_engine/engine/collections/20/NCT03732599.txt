      improve their surgical technique keep getting perfected, both regular and irregular
      postoperative astigmatism continue to be major concerns in achieving predictable visual
      results. Femtosecond laser technology allows for the creation of more precise incisions with
      more reproducible patterns, which could lead us to believe that astigmatism management and
      visual results should be improved with this technology. This would be the first study to
      prospectively analyze standard versus femtosecond laser-enabled deep anterior lamellar
      keratoplasties in order to elucidate their relative advantages in the quest for a gold
      standard.
