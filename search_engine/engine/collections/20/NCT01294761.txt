      without history virological failure including protease inhibitors or raltegravir
      (disregarding whether the patient had a history of drug resistance or drug holiday, or not)
      taking LPV/r+TVD (or TDF+lamivudine) for longer than 15 weeks before the enrollment with HIV
      viral load less than 50 copies/ml for 15 weeks, including those with blips (one time episode
      of detectable level HIV viraemia which are proceeded and followed by undetectable viraemia).

      20 years old or older Japanese willing to participate in the trial and able to agree to the
      informed consent. Main outcome measures are to investigate if the estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) of the intervened group with RAL+DRV/r improves by 10% or more by
      intention to treat (ITT) analysis at the time of 48 weeks after the start of the trial.

      Other outcome measures are:

      virological efficacy of the group on DRV/r+RAL (after 48 weeks and up to 96 weeks) comparison
      of other renal function markers between the two arms: serum creatinine, urine beta-2
      microglobulin, tubular resorption rate of phosphate, urine albumin,
      N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, serum cystatin C, urine protein and urine glucose (after 48
      weeks and up to 96 weeks) comparison of lipid markers between the two arms: triglycerides,
      HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (after 48 weeks and up to 96 weeks)
      discontinuation rate of each arm, reason and timing of the discontinuation or the treatment
      change up to 96 weeks adverse events of each arm, symptoms and rate up to 96 weeks blood
      plasma concentration level of RAL and DRV of all consented intervened cases at National
      Center for Global Health and Medicine
