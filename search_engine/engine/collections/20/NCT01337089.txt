      long-term nabiximols use as an adjunctive measure in participants with advanced cancer. The
      study provided continued availability of nabiximols to participants who completed a preceding
      double-blind phase 3 study and de novo participants. Consenting eligible participants entered
      the extension study (Day 1) on the same day as the "end of treatment" visit of a parent study
      or within 7 days of the "end of treatment" visit or on the day of the "safety follow-up
      visit" of the parent study. The "safety follow-up" visit of a parent study was performed on
      the same day as Day 1, if the participant did not enter the OLE study on the same day as the
      "end of treatment" visit of a parent study. De novo participants attended a screening visit 3
      to 14 days prior to enrollment (Day 1). All participants commenced dosing on Day 1. Further
      study visits took place after 2 weeks (Day 15), and every 4 weeks thereafter until the end of
      treatment period on Day 183 or earlier if the participant withdrew from the study.

      Treatment was started as a single spray in the evening on the first day (Day 1). Participants
      then gradually titrated by 1 additional spray per day to an individualized dose, balancing
      efficacy and tolerability. Participants had to complete titration within 14 days of their
      first dose of study drug and then continue at the same dose for the remainder of the study.
