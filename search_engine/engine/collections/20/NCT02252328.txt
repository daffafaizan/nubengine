      corticosteroids and immunosuppression in patients with sight-threatening uveitis.

      In order to detect a clinical effect the study is designed as a double blinded, parallel
      group, placebo-controlled, randomised trial. Double blinding will be achieved through the use
      of a placebo as well as a masked clinical assessor.

      Based on the reported effect of simvastatin on brain atrophy among multi[le sclerosis
      patients after 12 months treatment, patients will receive treatment or placebo and will be
      treated and followed up for 24 months.

      Patients randomised to simvastatin will receive a dose of 80mg od. There will be no dose
      escalation.

      Patients will be reviewed every 3 months and will undergo a complete ophthalmic examination
      with treatment adjustment accordingly.
