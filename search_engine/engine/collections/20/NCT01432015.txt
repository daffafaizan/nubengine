      efficacy; when evaluating cost and convenience, the intravenous route may be preferable.
      Fosaprepitant, a water-soluble phosphoryl prodrug for aprepitant, is converted to aprepitant
      via phosphatases following intravenous administration. Given the rapid conversion of
      fosaprepitant to the active form (i.e., aprepitant), the two medications appear to provide a
      similarly effective antiemetic impact. Clinical reports have additionally suggested that
      fosaprepitant could be appropriate as an intravenous alternative to the oral aprepitant.
