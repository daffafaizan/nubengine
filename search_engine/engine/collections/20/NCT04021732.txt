      not only with vascular diseases but also with neurological symptoms. This is related to the
      higher homocysteine concentration of up to 150-300 Î¼mol/l without treatment. Recently, some
      articles have shown that mild and temporary hyperhomocysteinemia may follow exercise in a
      healthy population. Investigators hypothesized that increase in homocysteine may be of
      greater importance in patients with classical homocystinuria where cystathionine
      beta-synthase deficiency prevents homocysteine metabolism.

      Objective To investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise in patients with classical
      homocystinuria on metabolic parameters compared to healthy controls.
