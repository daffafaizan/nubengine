      under general anesthesia.Under aseptic surgical technique, a superior rectus suture will be
      placed using 4'0 silk and a limbal-based conjunctival flap to be performed. Sub-Tenon
      dissection and hemostasis will be achieved and a half-thickness 4 x 4mm rectangular
      scleralflap will to be dissected up to clear cornea, and radial incision will be placed at
      the location of the schemes canal, Harms trabepculotome will be used to pass into the schemes
      canal and rotated into the anterior chamber to open app 60 degree on either sides, A 2 × 2 mm
      deep scleral block will be excised and peripheral iridectomy will be performed. The scleral
      flap will be closed with one 10-0 nylon suture and conjunctiva will be closed with 8-0 vicryl
      continuous suture.

      The same procedure will be done for the CTT with ologen® except, before closing the
      conjunctiva, the ologen® implant will be placed subconjunctivally just overlapping the apex
      of the triangular scleral flap

      ologen® Collagen Matrix ologen® Collagen Matrix approved by Indian health authority with
      registration numberof MD-1517 (valid till Mar-15-2018) will be provided by Aeon Ajanta India
      Pvt. Ltd. free of cost for this clinical research only.
