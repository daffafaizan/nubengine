    
      Post operative ileus is a well-known complication following spinal fusion surgery. There has
      been some literature to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of oral naloxone to decrease the
      time to bowel movements after gastrointestinal surgery, to date, there have been no studies
      within the spine fusion literature to investigate oral naloxone's effects on the time to
      bowel movements.

      The aim of the present study is to use the previously established protocols and doses
      established in the gastrointestinal literature to see whether oral naloxone can decrease the
      time to first bowel movements.
