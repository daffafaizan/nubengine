      medical research study), partially blinded, randomized (study drug assigned by chance)
      stratified (arrange in groups for analysis of results e.g., stratify by age, sex, etc.) for
      genotype, multiple dose study. The trial will consist of Screening period (6 weeks),
      Treatment period (24 or 26 weeks) and Follow-up period (24 weeks). The Treatment period will
      include 2 weeks investigational treatment phase and a 24 week standard treatment phase. All
      the eligible participants who were never treated for HCV will be enrolled for the trial and
      will receive the investigational treatment regimen to which they have been randomly assigned
      for 2 weeks. After this in the standard treatment phase participants will receive the
      standard treatment of care consisting of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a 180 microgram
      once weekly and ribavirin (RBV) 400 milligram twice per day. Efficacy will primarily be
      evaluated by HCV viral load quantification. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
