    
      Main Objective:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the optimized self-exclusion
      procedure, compared to the existing procedure, on the intensity of gambling.

      - Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the change in total net loss over the last 4
      weeks, between the last 4 weeks prior to self-exclusion T0, and the last 4 weeks at 12 months
      T2.

      2.2 Secondary objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to assess early effect at
      6 months and maintenance of effect at 18 months.

      - Secondary endpoints:

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate early efficacy at 6 months and
      maintenance of efficacy at 18 months. The endpoint used is the change in total net loss over
      the last 4 weeks, between the last 4 weeks prior to self-exclusion, and the last 4 weeks at 6
      T1 and 18 months T3. The other criteria will be the change between T0 and T1,2, and 3 of the
      following variables (total of the last 4 weeks unless otherwise specified):

        -  Total deposit

        -  Total bet per game

        -  Compulsiveness (as defined by three consecutive deposits in a 12-hour period) (yes/no)
           (number of episodes)

        -  Maximum number of deposits within one hour of a bet,

        -  Total loss per game (average)

        -  Number of gambling sessions (all games) in a clinical sense; session is defined as the
           gambling behavior itself; we will consider the beginning of a session when a gambling
           action occurs after no gambling action has occurred for at least 30 minutes, and the end
           of the gambling session a gambling action followed by no gambling action for 30 minutes.

        -  Session duration (average)

        -  Total playing time defined as the sum of the session durations

        -  Extension of self-exclusion (yes no)

        -  Second and subsequent self-exclusion (yes no, number)

        -  Exceeding 80% moderators (sum).
