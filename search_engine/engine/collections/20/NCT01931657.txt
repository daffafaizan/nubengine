      contraceptive method that is cost-effective and requires limited patient effort. Furthermore
      Mirena offers numerous noncontraceptive benefits and addresses different medical needs for
      women in reproductive and non reproductive age. Side effects such as menstrual abnormalities
      are important reasons for early discontinuation of a contraceptive method. Irregular bleeding
      pattern and spotting represents a well known adverse effect during the first months of use
      with Mirena and corresponds to the most important factor that negatively influences the
      acceptability of the IUS. Up to today no standard treatment has been suggested to resolve
      this issue.

      By inducing amenorrhea within a short period of treatment with an anti-progesterone,
      mifepristone, prior to insertion of Mirena, the bleeding irregularities during the first
      months of use might be reduced and could therefore represent an important strategy for
      increasing acceptability of this contraceptive system.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the bleeding pattern during the first months
      of use of Mirena in patients treated with mifepristone compared to placebo in women using
      Mirena for contraception. The study will also address the effect of mifepristone on
      endometrial morphology and breast tissue.
