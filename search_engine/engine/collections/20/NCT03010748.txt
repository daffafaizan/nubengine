      screening is the most important part for the preoperative examination of refractive surgery.
      Favorable tools and appropriate indicators are the premise of fast and accurate screening,
      and the corneal morphology from various regions of China have various characteristics, the
      use of uniform standards developed by foreign screening will always induce a lot of problems,
      for example, the differences of cornea morphological features between European and American
      ethnic and Chinese race, as well as the corneal morphometric indicators between various
      regions of China, will cause varying degrees of false-positive or false-negative screening
      results. Based on this, in order to further improve the safety of refractive surgery
      effectively and to obtain the effective and accurate screening of suspected keratoconus
      population, this study will be conducted to collect the corneal morphological characteristics
      database of Chinese people from all over the country, and to develop a database of Chinese
      ethnographic characteristics for screening keratoconus indicators and reference valuable to
      guide clinical screening and surgical design.
