      to 1 of 2 open-label background statin treatments (atorvastatin 5 mg or 20 mg daily [QD]) and
      entered a 4-week lipid stabilization period. After the lipid stabilization period, eligible
      patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to investigational product (evolocumab or
      placebo) for the 12-week treatment period.

      Both randomizations were stratified by subject diagnosis and lipid-lowering therapy as
      follows:

        -  current or prior diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)

        -  no diagnosis of HeFH and receiving intensive lipid-lowering therapy

        -  no diagnosis of HeFH and receiving non-intensive lipid-lowering therapy. A participant
           was considered randomized into the study after successfully completing the screening
           period, meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria including meeting final laboratory
           safety criteria, and undergoing both randomization procedures.
