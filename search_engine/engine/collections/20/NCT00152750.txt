      the most poorly researched areas in pediatric psychopharmacology. Of particular concern is
      the growing evidence of an association between sleep disturbance and aggression in children.
      Childhood aggression is a serious public health problem and predicts adolescent delinquency,
      academic difficulties and truancy, and substance abuse. Children with Tourette's syndrome
      (TS) and co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will be studied in a trial
      of a common pharmacological treatment (clonidine) that is expected to improve sleep
      architecture and thereby clarify the relation between sleep disturbance and aggression.

      Hypothesis: Our main hypothesis is that improvement in children's sleep will be associated
      with a reduction in their aggression and an increase in their daily function.

      Method: A double-blind placebo controlled trial with 32 subjects (aged 9-14 years) with
      diagnoses of TS & co-morbid ADHD. Subjects will undergo a mental health assessment, ECG,
      laboratory testing and 2-night polysomnography (sleep study) at baseline. Subjects will then
      be randomized to a treatment (clonidine) or placebo group for an 8-week trial. Clonidine will
      be titrated and subjects monitored weekly. A second 2-night sleep study and mental health
      assessment will occur at trial end.

      Expected results: We expect an improvement in the initial onset, duration and overall sleep
      quality in the treatment group (clonidine), with a resulting decrease in daytime aggression
      and increase in daily overall level of functioning; sleep and aggression in the placebo group
      are not expected to improve.
