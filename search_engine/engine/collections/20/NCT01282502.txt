      will be taken alone (no chemoradiation). After 2 weeks standard chemoradiation will be added
      to the midostaurin regimen. Subjects receive midostaurin and chemoradiation for an additional
      6 weeks. Physical exams will be done weekly. Blood samples will be taken and an optional
      tumor biopsy will be performed in week 2.

      4-5 weeks after completing chemoradiation and midostaurin subjects will undergo surgery as
      standard of care. Tumor tissue from the surgery will be used for research purposes. A Ct scan
      of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed.

      After completion of surgery, subjects will have an end of study visit with physical exam,
      blood tests. CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed yearly for 5 years.
