    
      In the DiRiP-RD study (monocentric, prospective, open-label diagnostic study), patients with
      genetically unexplained diseases will be analyzed or re-analyzed from existing datasets for
      further omics analysis. These are evaluated with regard to the following questions:

      Primary:

        -  Verification of the genetic causes of unclear genetic diseases

      Secondary:

        -  Improve number of diagnoses of unclear syndromes

        -  Further characterization of the identified gene defects

        -  Number of patients receiving appropriate therapy after successful diagnosis. In
           addition, patient phenotype and genotype data can be collected using a software tool for
           collecting and analyzing phenotypic information of patients with genetic disorders (
           PhenoTipsÂ®) software to facilitate data exchange within the UKT, with external
           collaborators and data transfer to the Solve-RD project.
