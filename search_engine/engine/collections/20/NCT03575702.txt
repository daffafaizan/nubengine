    
      To assess clinical efficiency and safety of Uritos® (Imidafenacin) in comparison to Urotol®
      (Tolterodine) according to its influence on urination frequency and number of urinary
      incontinence episodes a total of 327 patients underwent screening and 300 patients were
      randomized (150 patients in the Uritos® group and 150 patients in the Urotol® group).
      Screening period was not exceeding 2 weeks (14 days). Therapy was performed during 12 weeks
      (84 days). Every patient received only one treatment (Uritos® or Urotol®) during the
      treatment period. Patients were returning to the trial site to assessment visits on Weeks 2,
      4, 8 and 12 with permissible variation ± 3 days. Observation period after the end of
      treatment - 30 ± 5 days (could be performed through telephone connection without need for
      physician appointment by patient). Maximum observation period: 136 days.

      Efficacy and safety parameters were assessed as per primary and secondary endpoints.

      The results of this study could potentially provide new optimum approaches to OAB treatment.
