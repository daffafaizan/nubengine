      spectrum from concussion to coma with a limited 3-month follow up and extensive 6-, 12-, and
      24-month follow ups. Patient enrollment will occur in three high-volume TBI Centers (SFGH,
      UPMC, UMCB) and a TBI Rehabilitation Center (MSMC). These Centers have a long track record of
      multi-center TBI research experience as well as existing infrastructure for rapid start-up
      and sustained enrollment. All patients admitted acutely with a history of external force
      injury to the head with a head CT performed in the emergency department are eligible for
      enrollment. Head CTs are performed according to the American College of Emergency Physicians
      (ACEP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for neuroimaging
      and decision making in TBI. These Guidelines are already in place at the participating
      Centers and are used to determine which patients will receive a non-contrast head CT scan as
      part of their initial evaluation. Patients will not be excluded based on age, race, gender,
      ethnicity, substance abuse, or prior psychiatric history to provide a population-based sample
      of of TBI subjects across the injury spectrum from concussion to coma.

      Study Components (Ref: NIH-NINDS TBI Common Data Elements):

        1. Clinical Care and Demographic Data Collection. Variables include: date and time of
           injury, mechanism of injury, acute laboratory values and vital signs, neurological
           evaluations, surgical interventions, hospital course, morbidity and mortality during
           acute care.

        2. Blood Draw for Proteomic and Genetic Marker Analyses. Blood samples will be drawn within
           24 hours of injury. Plasma will be spun and separated from whole blood. Both plasma and
           whole blood samples will be banked centrally under -80 degrees Celsius at the University
           of California, San Francisco (UCSF) DNA Bank.

        3. 3-Tesla (3T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A 3T Research MRI will be completed on a subset
           of patients able to return 1-2 weeks post-injury.

        4. 3-Month Follow Up. The Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOS-E) and neurological
           symptoms inventory will be administered to patients over the phone 3 months post-injury.

        5. 6-, 12-, and 24-Month Neurocognitive Assessment. Standardized measures from all
           designated CORE domains for outcome after TBI by TBI-CDEs, which include: global
           recovery, functional outcome, psychological impairment, post-traumatic stress disorder
           (PTSD), and quality of life, will be administered to the participant.

      The investigators anticipate that this project has the potential to substantially advance and
      revolutionize clinical research in TBI. Repositories for neuroimaging, proteomic, and genetic
      biomarkers will facilitate the evolving field of these emerging technologies in TBI.
