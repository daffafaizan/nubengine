      is platinum-based doublet chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy. As for patients with a
      mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase(ALK), EGFR or
      ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard first-line therapy. Now, the Food and
      Drug Administration approved Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab as first-line or
      second-line therapy for NSCLC. However, there was no reports about therapeutic effect for
      NSCLC patients through detecting herself immune state, immune repertoire could explore
      patients' immune clonality and diversity using NGS technology.The investigators look forward
      to illuminate the mechanism of patients antitumor action.
