      their preoperative social adjustment scale couple domain score : usual treatment and
      psychoeducational programme or usual treatment alone (Figure). The psychoeducational
      programme focuses on 3 domains: 1) neurosurgical procedure and neurological outcome, 2)
      social life including work, social and familial relationship, 3) couple relationship. The
      programme consists of 7 sessions with 3 to 4 couples at the same session, except for the
      'couple relationship' domain. Each domain is tackled in a two-way manner with
      information/education proved by the investigator and discussion of the patients' and
      caregivers' expectations during one session. The following session started with a 'Questions
      and Answers' on the previous domain and then information on another domain. Four sessions
      were carried out prior to surgery and 3 after.
