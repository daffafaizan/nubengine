      Prevention Clinic were screened for smoking status, advised to quit smoking and treated using
      a standardized protocol including counselling and pharmacotherapy. Eligible smokers were
      randomly assigned to either a prescription only usual care group, or, the experimental group
      who received a 4-week supply of cost-free quit smoking medications and prescription for
      medication renewal. All patients received follow-up counselling 7-days prior to and 5, 14,
      30, 60, 90, 180 days following their quit attempt. Levels of eligibility, consent, adherence
      and retention were used as indicators of study feasibility. The primary outcome was
      bio-chemically validated quit rates at 26-weeks.
