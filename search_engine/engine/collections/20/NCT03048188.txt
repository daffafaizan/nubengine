      split-skin grafted third-degree burn wounds aim at reducing infection and improving
      reepithelialization. Although previous studies indicate that burn patients benefit from wound
      dressings containing manuka honey, only a few studies can be found. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to evaluate time to reepithelialization, pain, microbiology and handling of
      manuka honey dressings with second-degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted burn wounds.
