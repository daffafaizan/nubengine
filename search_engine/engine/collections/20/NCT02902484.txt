      of pancreatic cancer, as well as inhibiting metastasis in pancreatic cancer models. This
      effect appears primarily due to nintedanib anti-angiogenic properties. The study will perform
      a clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of nintedanib when combined with
      standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel) for metastatic pancreatic cancer. It
      will utilize advanced imaging correlates including dynamic contrast enhanced Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) which correlates with tumor grade and microvessel density.

      For each patient, treatment will have two phases: nintedanib monotherapy for a two week
      period (Days 1-14) followed by combination phase of nintedanib plus chemotherapy (Cycle 2+).
