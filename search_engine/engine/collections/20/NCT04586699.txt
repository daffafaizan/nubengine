      depression that involves brief magnetic stimulation pulses on the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC) brain region. The ultimate goal of this treatment is to increase excitability
      and long-term plasticity in DLPFC, a brain region shown to be hypo-active in depression.
      Unfortunately, rTMS only has low to moderate efficacy; remission rates for patients range
      from ~15-30% in large randomized controlled trials. The focus of this research is to develop
      a next-generation rTMS protocol that is guided by the basic principles underlying brain
      plasticity, in order to improve the efficacy of rTMS for the treatment of depression.
      Specifically, in this study the investigators will test rTMS paired with a
      depression-relevant cognitive state of internal attentive focus. Meditative internal focus
      has been shown to benefit depression. Our own research shows that the neural correlates of
      attention-to-breath are associated with greater mindfulness. Hence, in this study we will
      pair attention-to-breath training with 10 Hz rTMS neuro-stimulation.
