      selected from the database (50 males and 50 females, between 20 and 60 years old). First,
      they will be anonymized (except the sex and age/date of birth). Afterwards, they will be
      segmented using Materialise Mimics software. The segmented mandibles will then be used to
      create a statistical shape model (SSM) using principal component analysis. This model will
      afterwards be used to predict the mandibular shapes.
