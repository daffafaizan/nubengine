      in patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma using protons or carbon ions in raster scan
      technique for primary or additive treatment after R2 resection. The evaluation is therefore
      based on the proportion of treatments without Grade 3-5 toxicity (CTCAE, version 4.0) up to
      12 months after treatment and/or discontinuation of the treatment for any reason as primary
      endpoint. Local-progression free survival, overall survival and quality of life will be
      analyzed as secondary end points.
