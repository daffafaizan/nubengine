      disease will receive two subcutaneous injection of 50 UI/Kg of the investigational product
      (Eritromax®) or Eprex® per week. After four weeks of treatment, the dose of drugs will be
      change by clinical judged throughout study according to laboratory results. The evidence of
      efficacy will be evaluated by hemoglobin levels alteration throughout the correction phase
      (first four weeks). Secondary efficacy and safety endpoints will be assessed by: maintenance
      of hemoglobin levels (baseline vs. end of treatment) over maintenance phase; dose of EPO
      required during correction and maintenance phase; Transfusion needs; report of adverse events
      (including type, frequency, intensity, serioussness, severity and relation to the
      investigation product) throughouht 12 months of follow-up. Additionally, the immunological
      response of products over study will be evaluated by quantification of anti-erythropoietin
      every six months.
