    
      Patients in this study will be assigned to one of 2 treatment groups. The selection of the
      treatment groups will be done randomly by a computer.

      The first group, Cohort A, will receive bevacizumab 10mg/kg by vein over 30-90 minutes
      followed by pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 by vein over 10 minutes followed by gemcitabine 1500 mg/m2
      by vein over 30-60 minutes. This regimen will be given on day 1 and day 15 of each treatment
      cycle. Each cycle is 28 days long. As long as their disease does not worsen patients can
      receive up to a maximum of 6 cycles of this combination chemotherapy. Following that they can
      receive bevacizumab alone once every 2 weeks as long as their disease does not worsen.

      The second group, Cohort B, will receive bevacizumab 15mg/kg by vein over 30-90 minutes
      followed by pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 by vein over approximately 10 minutes followed by
      carboplatin AUC=5 by vein over 30-60 minutes. This regimen will be given on day 1 of each
      treatment cycle. Each cycle is 21 days long. As long as their disease does not worsen
      patients can receive up to a maximum of 6 cycles of this combination chemotherapy. Following
      that they can receive bevacizumab alone once every 3 weeks as long as their disease does not
      worsen.

      In both regimens vitamin B12 injections and Folic Acid pills will be given to reduce the
      occurrence of side effects from the treatment.

      Each patient's disease will be evaluated at intervals by the proper scans or X-rays to see
      how well the cancer is responding to the treatment.
