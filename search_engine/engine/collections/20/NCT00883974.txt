    
      A randomized controlled trial of a parental sensitivity training program involving 45 women
      with infants born < 30 weeks gestational age. The intervention consisted of 10 individual
      sessions in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Post-intervention, at term-equivalent
      age (40 weeks postmenstrual age), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to evaluate
      brain structure and development. Quantitative volumetric techniques were used to estimate
      overall and regional brain volumes for different tissue types including cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF), cortical grey matter (CGM), deep nuclear grey matter (DNGM), unmyelinated white matter
      (UWM) and myelinated white matter (MWM). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to evaluate
      the integrity and maturation of white matter by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and
      fractional anisotropy (FA).
