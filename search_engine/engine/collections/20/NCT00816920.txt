    
      Outpatients symptomatic for suspected DVT of a leg are examined by a vascular doctor
      according to standard procedure based on pre-test clinical probability (PTCP) assessment,
      D-dimer assay and a CUS limited to the proximal deep veins. Those in whom a proximal DVT is
      excluded and have intermediate/high PTCP or altered D-dimer level are eligible for the study.
      The included patients are immediately submitted to an extensive echo-color-Doppler
      examination of calf deep veins by a different vascular doctor and results are closed in an
      envelope that will be open after three months (or before if necessary). In the meantime,
      patients will follow the standard diagnostic procedure: they receive an appointment to come
      back in 5-7 days for a further CUS examination, or even before in case of worsening of
      symptoms/signs. All the included patients receive a telephone call after three months to
      exclude possible complications.
