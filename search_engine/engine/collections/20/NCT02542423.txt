      shows that alterate levels of its blood concentration correlate with the onset of pulmonary
      failure in patients with major trauma and septic shock.

      In cardiac surgery respiratory failure and infections are threatening complications leading
      to mortality rates up to 80%. A rapid diagnosis and treatment of this pathology is crucial to
      improve the clinical outcome.

      Unfortunately specific data for the efficacy of Endocan predictive value in cardiac surgery
      patients are not available.

      The investigators aim to determinate if Endocan can be a helpful tool to identify patients
      developing acute respiratory failure after cardiac surgery and anticipate specific treatment
      in order to improve survival.
