      combined with the preoperative audiologic assessment could be informed the intraoperative
      middle ear finding in the patients who were diagnosed with chronic otitis media with
      cholesteatoma, which influence the plan of surgical management. Whether these preoperative
      assessments can predict the intraoperative finding is unclear. The aim of this study is to
      assess the accuracy of preoperative HRCT of the temporal bone combined with the preoperative
      audiologic assessment compared with the intraoperative endoscopic middle ear finding.
