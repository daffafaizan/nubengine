      smoking is a very difficult addiction to break and despite established smoking cessation
      programs quit rates are low, especially in the real-life setting. The main reasons for not
      quitting or relapsing after cessation are the nicotine withdrawal syndrome and
      post-cessational weight gain. GLP-1 analogues are well known to stimulate insulin secretion
      and to reduce energy intake and therefore body weight. Recent findings from animal and human
      studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of addiction. The putative role of
      GLP-1 analogues in nicotine reward regulation combined with its weight reducing effects might
      be of major interest in view of novel pharmacotherapeutic options for smoking cessation.
