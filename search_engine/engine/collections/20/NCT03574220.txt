    
      The primary objective of this pilot safety study is to determine the tolerability and
      feasibility of administering pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting following completion of
      definitive SBRT to the lung for patients with medically inoperable early stage NSCLC with
      tumors greater than 3 cm in diameter

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Distant metastases free survival (DMFS)

        2. Disease Free Survival (DFS)

        3. Overall survival (OS)

      Study design including dose escalation / cohorts

      This is an open-label, single arm feasibility study of lung SBRT followed 2 to 4 weeks after
      completion by the addition of pembrolizumab.

      Eligible patients will have biopsy-confirmed T1b-T3N0M0 (stage IA-IIB) non-small cell lung
      cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or large cell/NSCLC NOS), performance status
      0-2, deemed medically inoperable by a thoracic surgeon or pulmonologist, and no
      contraindications to pembrolizumab.

      The primary endpoint for this study is safety and feasibility. For the first stage of this
      study, 8 patients will be enrolled. If >7 of the initial 8 patients complete the therapy
      without experiencing a Grade >3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade >4 toxicity, an additional 7
      patients will be enrolled for a total of 15 patients. If >2 of the original 8 patients (>25%)
      experience a Grade >3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade >4 toxicity the trial will be closed
      and the study therapy will be considered too toxic. If >4 of 15 patients (>26.7%) experience
      a Grade >3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade >4 toxicity, the study drug regimen will be deemed
      too toxic and unsafe. If >12 out of 15 patients complete the study without experiencing a
      Grade >3 pulmonary toxicity or any Grade >4 toxicity, the study drug regimen will be
      considered safe and feasible for further study.
