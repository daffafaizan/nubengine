      access to quality, standard cancer care for persons diagnosed with breast, cervical, and
      colorectal cancer in a culturally sensitive manner. This program will be carried out within
      clinics of The Ohio State University Primary Care Network (OSU PCN) and the Columbus
      Neighborhood Health Centers (CNHC) in Columbus, Ohio with a preponderance of patients from
      underserved (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities, people of lower socioeconomic status, and the
      elderly) populations. This goal will be accomplished by completing the following objectives:

      Objectives

        -  Develop the OPNRP through the work of a consortium of institutions including The Ohio
           State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) and James Cancer Hospital (JCH),
           the Ohio Division of the American Cancer Society (ACS), and the Ohio Commission on
           Minority Health (OCMH);

        -  Conduct a formative research phase to assess referral patterns and barriers to prompt
           diagnosis and treatment services, as well as strategies to overcome barriers among
           patients of these clinic networks;

        -  Implement and evaluate the patient navigator program in 12 primary care clinics using a
           group randomized, controlled design to assess the efficacy of the intervention to reduce
           the time to delivery of standard cancer diagnosis and services and non-cancer resolution
           or cancer diagnosis and treatment after the diagnosis of an abnormal finding from a
           cancer detection procedure for breast, cervical or colorectal cancer, as well as improve
           patient satisfaction with care and quality of life;

        -  Conduct a process evaluation to assess the barriers to implementation of the
           intervention program, the features of the intervention (e.g., appointments kept/missed,
           materials provided to patients, etc.), patient satisfaction with the navigator, and
           clinic perceptions of the navigator program; and

        -  Conduct a cost-effectiveness evaluation of the navigator program. Results from this
           study will be disseminated throughout Ohio by community partners and used to provide
           information on concrete ways to utilize patient navigators to reduce the burden of
           cancer in underserved populations, a goal of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and
           Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) Healthy People 2010. The OPNRP is one of
           nine grantees in NCI/ACS's Patient Navigator Research Program (PNRP).
