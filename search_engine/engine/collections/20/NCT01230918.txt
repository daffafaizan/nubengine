    
      HCM Population:

      The primary objective is to determine whether fibrosis detected by MRI and 99mTc-NC100692
      uptake in patients with HCM are associated. The secondary objective is to determine whether
      99mTc-NC100692 uptake correlates on a segmental basis with fibrosis visualised by late
      Gd-enhancement MRI. The tertiary objective is to evaluate the relationship between the extent
      of fibrosis assessed by 99mTc-NC100692 uptake and mean longitudinal strain as determined by
      speckle tracking echocardiography.

      The primary hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of 99mTc-NC100692 in patients
      with HCM fibrosis detected by MRI. The secondary hypothesis is that the location and extent
      of increased 99mTc-NC100692 uptake will correlate with localization and extent measurements
      of fibrosis by Gd-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The tertiary hypothesis is that the
      extent of fibrosis assessed by the number of segments with and the magnitude of 99mTc
      NC100692 uptake will correlate with mean longitudinal strain as determined by speckle
      tracking echocardiography.

      ACS Population:

      The objective is to determine whether 99Technetium-NC100692 uptake in patients with ACS (MI)
      can serve as a marker for scar formation as detected by contrast-enhanced MRI during the
      process of myocardial remodelling after the ischemic insult.

      The primary hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of 99Technetium-NC100692 in
      patients following an ACS event (MI) and that the location and extent of increased
      99Technetium-NC100692 uptake will correlate with the presence and extent of scar as detected
      by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

      Normal Control Population:

      Preliminary analysis of images from HCM population showed a diffuse, low grade uptake of
      99Technetium-NC100692 in non-hypertrophied myocardial segments. Although not entirely
      unexpected, comparison with control images will allow for quantification of low grade
      fibrosis and low grade uptake.
