    
      The study design is as follows:

        -  Prospective, single-arm study.

        -  Subjects with open-angle glaucoma and medicated IOP > 18 mmHg and â‰¤ 30 mmHg.

        -  Subjects on two topical ocular hypotensive medications (one a prostaglandin).

        -  Implantation of two iStent inject devices (if IOP is < 6 mmHg, at any point during the
           postoperative follow-up, medication will not be prescribed or will be discontinued).

        -  IOP will be measured by two (2) observers to minimize bias; observer 1 will look through
           the slit lamp and turn the dial with readings being masked, and observer 2 will document
           the IOP.

        -  Follow-up through 60 months postoperative (or up to 61 months if subject needs to
           undergo terminal washout).

        -  Descriptive statistics will be tabulated.

        -  Medical therapy considered necessary for the subject's welfare can be implemented at any
           time during the study at the investigator's discretion.
