      (ST) users, and the prevalence of ST use has increased over the past three years. ST is
      increasingly being promoted as a harm reduction strategy for cigarette smoking, and two of
      the world's largest cigarette manufacturers have entered the ST market. ST use is estimated
      to be the greatest exogenous source of human exposure to cancer-causing nitrosamines. ST has
      been associated with oral and extra-oral cancer as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      mortality.

      A need for efficacious interventions exists as 64% of ST users report the desire to quit.
      However, no pharmacotherapy has proven efficacy for increasing long-term (> 6 months) tobacco
      abstinence rates among ST users compared to placebo. New pharmacotherapies, drug
      combinations, and improved dosing of existing pharmacotherapies are needed. Previous research
      with nicotine patches for ST users using standard doses (up to 21 mg/day) have not increased
      long-term abstinence rates. However, studies of higher dose nicotine patch therapy (up to 63
      mg/day) in ST users have demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in tobacco withdrawal
      symptoms as well as preliminary evidence of increased long-term (> 6 months) abstinence rates
      compared to lower doses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of high dose
      nicotine patch therapy (42 mg/day) for increasing the 7-day point prevalence and prolonged
      all tobacco and ST abstinence rates at end-of-treatment (week 8), 12 and 24 weeks compared to
      placebo in ST users who use ≥ 3 cans/pouches per week when all subjects receive behavioral
      treatment for tobacco dependence. To accomplish our aims, we will randomize 60 ST users in a
      clinical pilot study. The work will be conducted at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.
