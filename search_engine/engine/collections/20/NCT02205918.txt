      movement disorder in children. The goal of the study is to learn how the brain and
      environment influence children's ability to suppress tics. Specifically, we want to learn how
      tics are influenced by a certain part of the brain called the supplementary motor area (SMA).
      This part of the brain is thought to be more active in people with tics. This will be the
      first study to look at the relationship between SMA, tic suppression, and urges to tic.

      Research Procedures: The study will take place over the course of three days within a week
      (about 5 hours total). The study will examine the relationship between the SMA and tic
      suppression using a non-invasive medical technology called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS). Participants will have a diagnostic interview, MRI brain scan (used to find the
      location of the SMA), and TMS. Participants will be asked to try to suppress tics before and
      after TMS. The information that will be collected from participation includes information
      about tic symptoms, emotional and behavioral functioning, and brain activity (from MRI brain
      images and TMS results).
