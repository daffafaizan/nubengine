      socio-demographic data collection in primary care has significant potential. Such data could
      be used to better tailor care to a patient's social context, improve diagnostic accuracy by
      incorporating social determinants as risk factors, identify inequities in the uptake of
      health services and in health outcomes, stimulate the development of new programs, and
      advance research. However, a standard set of questions has not yet been developed in Canada.
      Significant challenges remain to implementation of routine socio-demographic data collection,
      particularly around patient engagement, staff training, and support to make use of data
      collected, including adjustment for non-response bias. Existing work has also found that
      health providers and organizations lack evidence-based interventions to address social needs,
      particularly poverty. Work to date by the study team has found that a prototype financial
      benefit tool could be integrated into clinic workflow, particularly if the right staff person
      was administering it and following up with patients, and approximately 17% of patients had
      received a financial benefit after 1 month. No study to date has examined the longer-term
      impact of such a tool on income and health. It is not known whether a "modest" intervention,
      with the tool integrated into a clinic visit and brief follow-up, would be as effective as a
      more "intensive" intervention, with a dedicated visit to use the tool and multiple follow-up
      visits
