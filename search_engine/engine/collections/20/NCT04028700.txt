      address if red blood cells from donors with a G6DP enzyme deficiency have a different
      lifespan once transfused into a patient with sickle cell disease than red blood cells from an
      otherwise normal donor. Results of this critical study will guide future research and donor
      testing policies to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate units of blood for
      their condition. Each patient randomized to the study will receive 2 blood transfusions, one
      from a G6DP deficient donor and one from an otherwise normal donor. Half the patients (8)
      will receive G6DP deficient blood first while the other half (8) will receive non-G6DP
      deficient blood first. Patients will have a wash-out period of at least 3 months before
      receiving the opposite type of blood transfusion. The blood transfusion order will be
      randomized. There is currently no standard of testing in place to screen blood donations for
      G6DP enzyme deficiency. It is believed that up to 10% of the antigen-matched donors for
      patients with sickle cell disease are G6DP deficient, and the lifespan is unknown in the
      sickle cell population.
