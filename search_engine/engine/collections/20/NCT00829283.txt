      of the study, the active medication was sibutramine and was compared to a placebo control. On
      10/8/2010, Abbott Laboratories withdrew their obesity drug sibutramine (Meridia) from the
      market in light of clinical trial data pointing to an increased risk for stroke and
      myocardial infarction. In response to this event, the investigators submitted an IRB
      amendment to change the active obesity medication from sibutramine to Orlistat. The IRB
      amendment was approved on 11/4/2010. The PI received approval from NIH/NIDDK Program Officer
      Robert Kuczmarski to enact this change.
