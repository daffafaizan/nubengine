      adults with the condition report onset of symptoms during childhood or adolescence. Delayed
      Sleep Phase Syndrome involves a chronic mismatch between the usual daily schedule required by
      the individual's environment and his or her circadian sleep wake pattern. Individuals
      suffering from delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome experience great difficulty when attempting to
      fall asleep before 1-2 am, if not later, as well as rising at acceptable hours of the morning
      despite having completely normal sleep architecture and sleep duration. Delayed Sleep Phase
      Syndrome is a sleep disorder that results from a dysregulation of the circadian sleep-wake
      rhythm. Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome is often the cause of severe insomnia and is associated
      with excessive daytime sleepiness, major depressive disorder and severe disruption of
      education, work and social functioning. Its major symptom is extreme difficulty initiating
      sleep at a conventional hour and waking on time in the morning for school or work.

      Ramelteon is a selective melatonin type 1 (MT1) and type 2 (MT2) receptor agonist. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of ramelteon to advance the timing of sleep
      in individuals with delayed sleep phase syndrome. The effect of ramelteon will be analyzed
      based on collection of information from a post-sleep questionnaire completed by participants,
      and data collected by polysomnography in a sleep clinic setting. Total participation time
      involved in this study will be approximately 7 weeks.
