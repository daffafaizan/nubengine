      cardio-pulmonary bypass. AKI is associated with high mortality.

      Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, will be evaluated as a potential biomarker
      of kidney injury. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has been studied as a
      biomarker of kidney injury. Early kidney injury detection has been long sought and NGAL has
      been shown to be a promising biomarker. A troponinlike biomarker of AKI that is easily
      measured and capable of both early detection and risk stratification would represent an
      advancement in our ability to differentiate acute kidney injury from failure.

      Investigating EPO as a biomarker may prove to have increased predictive value in the clinical
      care of cardiac surgery patients.
