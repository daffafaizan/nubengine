      field of view and without the use of dilating drops. The purpose of the study is to compare
      the image quality of the new camera with that of a commercially available color fundus
      camera. Consented subjects will undergo a general ophthalmic examination and series of fundus
      photography exams using the study device and comparison device. Photo image quality will be
      assessed for determination of clinically usefulness.
