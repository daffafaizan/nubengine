      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined 17AAG and irinotecan given
      weekly for two weeks in a 21-day cycle that can be used for future phase II studies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of the combination on the expression of Hsp90 client proteins in
      peripheral mononuclear cells and tumor tissues. Tumor biopsies will be performed before and
      after 17AAG treatment in 12 patients at the MTD ("Expanded Cohort") only.

      II. To investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics of intravenous 17AAG, irinotecan, and their
      metabolites, in this combination.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on the therapeutic activity of 17AAG in combination with
      irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      IV. To obtain preliminary result in the relationship between tumor response and p53-status.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes followed by
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)* IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable or improved disease after course 2 may
      receive additional courses of treatment.

      NOTE: *17-AAG is administered on days 2 and 8 during course 2 for patients treated at
      non-maximum tolerated doses (MTD) (dose-escalation portion) and on day 8 only during course 1
      for patients treated at the MTD (expanded cohort).Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of 17-AAG and irinotecan until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An
      additional 12 patients are treated at the MTD.
