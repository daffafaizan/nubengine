    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 d1, 8, 29, 36

        -  Etoposide 50 mg/m2/day d1-5, 29-33

        -  Radiation 5940 cGy (180 cGy/day)

      Patients with CR, PR, SD Randomized to either:Docetaxel75 mg/m2 q3wk X 3 cycles

      or Observation Only

      Performance Status: ECOG 0 or 1

      Life Expectancy: Not specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  ANC > 1,500/mm3

        -  Platelet count > 100,000/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dl. PRBC transfusions will be allowed to increase hemoglobin to >8 g/dl

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum bilirubin < institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  AST < 2.5 X the upper limits of normal if alkaline phosphatase is < ULN, or alkaline
           phosphatase may be up to 4 X ULN if AST are < ULN

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine of < 2 mg/dl or calculated creatinine clearance > 50 cc/min

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No clinically significant history of cardiac disease, (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension,
           unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the past year,
           or cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication).

      Pulmonary:

        -  Pre-registration FEV1 > 1 liters by spirometry within 42 days prior to study treatment.
