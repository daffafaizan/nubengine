      with either good or bad outcome in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, will construct a
      robust predictive models based on RNA extracted from or paraffin specimens as well on
      immunohistochemistry and will examine the predictive power of new biomarkers associated with
      the anti-tumor effects of rituximab. The acquisition of fixed tissue as a component of this
      uniformly treated prospective study will also afford future studies with this informative
      dataset.
