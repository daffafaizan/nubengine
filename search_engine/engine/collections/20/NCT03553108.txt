    
      The study is an open-label, randomised, 4-period, 4-sequence crossover pharmacokinetic study
      designed to generate in vivo PK data from tablet variants with different size/geometry and
      dose, to correlate with their corresponding in vitro dissolution profiles. The duration of
      each dosing period is 7 days including the washout period. Subjects will be randomised to a
      treatment sequence, following a balanced Latin Squares design. Twelve subjects who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and have provided informed consent will be randomly assigned to
      the treatment sequences: ABCD, BDAC, CADB, or DCBA.

      On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single dose of either Treatment A, B, C, or
      D, according to the randomisation schedule. Serial blood samples for determination of
      olaparib in plasma will be collected for up to 72 hours.

      Cancer subjects with advanced solid tumours are required for this study, as pre-clinical
      toxicology data preclude the use of olaparib in healthy volunteers. The olaparib doses chosen
      will deliver exposure at or below that which has been previously demonstrated to be
      acceptable and tolerated in cancer subjects.
