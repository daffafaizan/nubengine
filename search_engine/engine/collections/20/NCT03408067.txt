      effective in preventing and/or reducing malnutrition. Therefore, a procedure to identify the
      risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients is necessary to guarantee an
      adequate and timely nutritional treatment. It is mandatory for clinics and health services to
      perform the screening test for the evaluation of the nutritional status and need in
      hospitalized patient.

      Aims: The first aim of this study is to compare two validated nutritional screening tools:
      Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). These are
      used to identify the risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients. The
      second aim is to evaluate possible correlations between the tests score and body composition
      parameters (phase angle of the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, BIA), handgrip strength and
      biochemical parameters.

      Patients and Methods: The study is currently carried out at the Federico II University
      Hospital of Naples, Italy. The inpatients admitted in the Clinical Wards coming from the
      Emergency Room of the Hospital since September 2016 are being evaluated. The two screening
      test results and the assessment of the patients' parameters are collected within 72 hours
      following admission. The SGA and NRS 2002 are administered separately. Age, sex, height,
      weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calf circumference and dominant hand of the participants are
      being noted. Venous blood samples are collected for routine biochemistry and inflammatory
      parameters (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen) early in the morning in the fasting state; all
      measurements are determined by routine laboratory methods at the Department of Laboratory
      Medicine of the University Hospital Federico II, Naples.
