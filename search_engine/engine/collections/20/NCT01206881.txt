      Several studies have shown that patients who receive a pathological complete response have
      the best prognosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy including anthracyclines and taxanes has become
      established as a standard option in the multidisciplinary management of this group of
      patients. In HER2 positive patients, chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab is
      therapeutically attractive. Recent studies have also demonstrated that evaluation with PET-CT
      scan can be used to stratify treatment and monitor early response to neoadjuvant therapy.
