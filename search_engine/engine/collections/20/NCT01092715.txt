      for neck pain often utilize multiple interventions on the same subject making interpretation
      of the results difficult. The objectives of this study were two fold, 1) to establish the
      ability to recruit and treat subjects needed for a clinical trial of mobilization vs. massage
      for neck pain and 2) to estimate the variability of the Neck Disability Index (NDI) in a
      defined population of patients with neck pain and determine sample size for a trial. Subjects
      and

      Methods: Subjects were randomized to either sedative massage (SM) to the neck and upper back
      or joint mobilization to the cervical spine (JM). All subjects also received moist heat and a
      home exercise program. Outcomes tracked for establishing trial feasibility included the
      number of referrals, number of referrals meeting inclusion criteria, number of subjects
      declining to participate and reasons for their refusal, acceptance rate of randomization,
      number of dropouts, and reasons for dropout. Descriptive statistics and baseline data were
      analyzed with means and standard deviations when appropriate. Groups were compared in regard
      to demographic and clinical characteristics only. The Neck Disability Index scores were
      calculated for pre-treatment, post-treatment, and change scores within each group.
