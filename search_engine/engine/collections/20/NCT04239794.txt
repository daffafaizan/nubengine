      propofol are associated with less postoperative pain and less opioid consumption compared
      with inhalation anesthesia. However, some studies showed conflicting results. In colorectal
      surgery, there are only retrospective studies that showed the analgesic effect of TIVA and
      inhalation anesthesia. The investigators designed a multi-center prospective randomized
      controlled trial and hypothesized that TIVA with propofol would be associated with reduced
      postoperative opioid consumption and less postoperative pain compared with sevoflurane in
      laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.
