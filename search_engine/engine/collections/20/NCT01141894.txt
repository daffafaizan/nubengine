      proximal femoral fracture. The total study duration for each subject is approximately 12
      months (+- 1 month); each patient will have 4'visits' (i.e. when PI extracts data to
      database) including regular praxis total: at registration; at discharge; 4 months and finally
      at 12 months after the surgery. For practical and logistic reasons, an interim-analysis will
      be conducted after approximately 100 patients whose data are completed.
