      and stimulating Interleukin-1B. In this study, we will evaluate the expression of H+,
      K+-ATPase and Interleukin-1B mRNA according to H. pylori infection and intestinal metaplasia
      in controls and patients with gastric cancer. In addition, we observe the changes of H+,
      K+-ATPase and Interleukin-1B mRNA expression over 5 years after H. pylori eradication.
