    
      Disulfiram (AntabuseÂ®) is a well-tolerated, cheap, generic drug that has been in use since
      the 1950s to treat alcoholism. There is now an increasing amount of independent preclinical
      data to support disulfiram as an anticancer agent. The potency of disulfiram as an anticancer
      agent seems strengthened by copper. There is now anecdotal clinical evidence of disulfiram as
      an anticancer agent. So far no clinical studies have been published in glioma patients, but
      two small, uncontrolled studies are planned according to clinicaltrials.gov. with search 1st
      November 2015.

      The investigators aim to investigate disulfiram and copper-supplement as add-on treatment in
      glioblastoma patients with recurrence receiving alkylating chemotherapy. The study will be
      performed as a multicenter RCT including patients in Norway and Sweden. This will serve as a
      proof-of concept study.

      The primary end-point is survival at 6 months
