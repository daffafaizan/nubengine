    
      The present clinical investigation is designed as a prospective, multicentre, national,
      randomized, open label, 2-arm parallel group, pilot trial comparing Abluminus DES+ versus
      Everolimus-eluting DES on Late Lumen Loss and clinical outcomes in diabetic patients
      undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

      A total of 165 patients will be recruited and randomized in the two groups in a 2:1 ratio at
      up to 6-8 Italian sites.

      After index procedure, patients will be followed up by angiographic follow-up at 9 months and
      clinical follow-up at 12 months.

      The study design is open label, since it is not possible to blind the investigators as to the
      stent type. However the members of the Event Adjudication Committee will be blinded to the
      patient. assignment. All medical records, source documentation and event information
      collected for the adjudication process will be blinded to treatment assignment.

      In addition the primary endpoint will be independently evaluated by the Core-Lab which will
      be blinded as to group assignment.
