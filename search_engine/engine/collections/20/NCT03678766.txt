      of Cues (ROC), which is based on Schachter's Externality Theory. This study will compare ROC
      with Cognitive Behavior Therapy for individuals with Binge Eating Disorder. The investigators
      will recruit and randomize 120 male and female Veterans with BED and subclinical BED with
      comorbid overweight/obesity, provide 5 months of treatment and follow participants for
      6-months post-treatment. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, mid-treatment
      (week 9), post-treatment (week 20), and 6-month follow-up (week 44). This study will be the
      first to contribute to a body of literature developing treatments for BED and
      overweight/obesity in the Veterans Affairs (VA) and/or military health care systems.
