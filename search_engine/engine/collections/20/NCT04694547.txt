      with McArdle disease is due to a limited availability of energy in the muscle due to affected
      carbohydrate metabolism. A key element in improving muscle function is therefore to introduce
      alternative energy sources. Ketone bodies are a well-known source of energy for both brain
      and muscle. Ketone bodies are produced during fasting or when following a ketogenic diet. A
      ketogenic diet is a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates. The classic ketogenic diet
      contains up to 90% fat, but there are several alternative diets with less fat, including a
      modified ketogenic diet, Atkins diet, LCHF (low carb high fat), OMAD (one meal a day) and
      more. This survey will collect information on all variations. The rationale for a ketogenic
      diet for persons with McArdle disease makes good sense in theory, as the diet would
      contribute with a new source of energy (ketone bodies) independent of the affected
      carbohydrate breakdown. However, evidence is sparse on whether the diet actually works. The
      primary purpose of this survey is to report experiences with variants of the ketogenic diet
      in a group of individuals diagnosed with McArdle disease. Secondarily this survey will
      collect information on physical activity, fatigue, sleep and quality of life in this cohort
