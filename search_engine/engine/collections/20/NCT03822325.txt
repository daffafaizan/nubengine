      in EoE are all currently based on histological evaluation of upper endoscopic pinch
      esophageal biopsies. Obtaining biopsies for histological evaluation by this procedure is both
      invasive and expensive. The purpose of our longitudinal prospective study is to evaluate and
      quantify a panel of novel non-invasive eosinophilic inflammatory biomarkers in the blood and
      urine of subjects with EoE and compare their presence and levels with the presence or absence
      of measures of inflammation in esophageal biopsies. While evaluation of esophageal biopsies
      with 15 or more eosinophils per high power field is the gold standard for diagnosis of EoE,
      novel predictors of clinical outcome remain unclear. The objective is to identify one or more
      sensitive and specific non-invasive biomarkers that could be used to monitor esophageal
      inflammation, and identify novel tissue-based markers that identify phenotype and outcome.
      This would eliminate the need for invasive serial surveillance endoscopies for the purpose of
      evaluating for recurrence of inflammation or response to standard therapy since symptoms
      alone do not adequately correlate with either the presence or absence of disease activity
      (inflammation) in the esophagus of patients with EoE.
