      Cardiovascular adverse side effects of ICIs are though to be rare but may be responsible for
      ~50% death rates.

      Prospective screening for cardiovascular and muscular immune related side effects has not
      been undertaken independently from the industry.

      The aim is to describe the incidence of these side effects by means of serial assessment in
      patients undergoing ICI therapy for cancer. Biomarkers as ECG, echocardiography, cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging and long-term ECG monitoring will be undertaken at inclusion
      (before ICI therapy is started), and during the first cycle treatments and at 6 months
      follow-up.

      Mean endpoint encompasses cardiovascular and muscular adverse side effects between the 2nd
      and the 3rd ICI cycle. Secondary endpoints include cardiovascular and muscular adverse side
      effects at 6 months follow-up, and the incidence of individual side effects.

      4 ancillary studies based on patients' blood biobanking are also planned. Their objectives
      are:

        -  to assess sensitivity of heart failure biomarkers in predicting cardiovascular events
           under ICI,

        -  to assess sensitivity of cytokine biomarkers in predicting cardiovascular events under
           ICI,

        -  to bank cells to induce cardiomyocytes from stem cells

        -  to bank DNA to identify genetic factors related to occurrence of cardiovascular events
           under ICI
