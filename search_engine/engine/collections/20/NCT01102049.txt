      introduced food (in this study the dinner on days 2-5) will cause a change in biochemical
      marker excretion with urine. To monitor the kinetics of biomarker excretion it is necessary
      to collect urine several times a day; we will ask volunteers to collect the first morning
      urine, before lunch, before dinner and before going to bed. Urine sampling will start with
      the first morning urine on day 1 and end with first morning urine on day 7.

      As test food, we propose a fruit salad (apples, grapes, orange and grapefruit) on day 2, fish
      on day 3, grapes on day 4, beef on day 5 and again fish for lunch on day 6.

      From day 0 (run-in day) to day 6 the basic diet will always be bread and cheese for
      breakfast, coffee in the morning, a ham sandwich for lunch, and pasta and tomato sauce for
      dinner. As beverages only water will be allowed (although wine is permitted on day 4 if the
      subject wishes but this is not a protocol requirement). The test foods will be consumed in
      addition to that.

      All urine samples will then be analysed using high resolution NMR spectroscopy and mass
      spectrometry. Mathematical data analyses as well as the visual examinations of the NMR
      spectra will also be carried out to identify new food biomarkers.
