      treatment is a maximal effect with minimal side effects. There are various treatment options,
      including conventional pharmacological and complementary approaches. Acupuncture is a system
      with an empirical basis, which has been used in the treatment for centuries. The mechanisms
      can be partly explained in terms of endogenous pain inhibitory systems. Its use for pain
      relief has been supported by clinical trials and this has facilitated its use in pain clinics
      in most countries. Needle acupuncture and other forms of sensory stimulation produce similar
      physiological changes in humans and mammals, e.g. rhythmic discharges in nerve fibres, and
      the release of endogenous opioids. Besides acupuncture points located on "meridians" all over
      the body acupuncture points are also described on the ear. The stimulation of acupuncture
      points can be achieved by pressure, a mechanical action of needling, or electrical point
      stimulation. In chronic pain treatment acupuncture has been found to be more effective than
      other non-pharmacological therapies. Furthermore, continuous electrical stimulation of
      auricular acupuncture points improves the treatment of chronic cervical pain patients.
      Finally, acupuncture represents not only a therapeutically beneficial, but also a
      cost-effective treatment option. Auricular acupuncture is also known to be effective in
      treatment of acute postoperative pain.

      The aim of our study is to investigate in a randomized, prospective, double - blind, and
      controlled design whether continuous electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points
      results in reduction of postoperative pain.
