      However, the field lacks a clear understanding of how liquids of different consistencies
      behave during swallowing. In order to improve understanding of the effectiveness of altered
      liquid consistency for improving dysphagia, the investigators are studying liquid flow
      through the oropharynx.

      This study explores this question in individuals who have undergone radiation treatment for
      head and neck cancer, specifically located in the oropharynx.

      Participants will swallow 20% w/v barium thickened to different consistencies (thin, slightly
      thick, mildly thick, moderately thick and extremely thick) using commercially available food
      thickeners. Swallowing will be observed under videofluoroscopy.
