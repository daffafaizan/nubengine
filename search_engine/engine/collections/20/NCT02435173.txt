    
      This study is designed to explore CDZ173, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, in patients with
      genetically activated PI3Kδ, i.e., patients with APDS/PASLI (Activated phosphoinositide
      3-kinase delta syndrome/ p110δ-activating mutation causing senescent T cells, lymphadenopathy
      and immunodeficiency)I.

      The study consists of two parts. Part I is the open label part designed to establish the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of CDZ173 in the target population, as well as to select the
      optimal dose to be tested in part II.

      Part II is designed to assess efficacy and safety of CDZ173 in this population.
