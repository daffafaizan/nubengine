    
      A total 60 adult male athletes aged 18 to 45 years will be recruited from two cities (Majmaah
      and Riyadh) of Saudi Arabia. Subjects will be included with the history of knee pain during
      activities such as descending and ascending stairs, squatting, and running, had positive J
      sign (lateral tilt of patella), and a sign of patellar malalignment on radiograph.
      Individuals with the history of fracture around knee, patella dislocation, knee deformity
      (e.g., genu varum), flexion contracture, ligaments/meniscal injuries, and osteoarthritis of
      knee will be excluded from the study. The protocol was submitted to and approved by the
      ethical sub-committee of College of applied medical science, Majmaah, Saudi Arabia (Ethics
      number: MUREC-Nov./COM-2O20/11-2). Participants will be requested to sign a written informed
      consent form approved by the institution ethics committee.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to the Group A (experimental group): electromyography
      biofeedback (EMG-BF) guided maximum voluntary isometric contraction exercise with patellar
      taping; Group B (control group): sham EMG-BF guided maximum voluntary isometric contraction
      without patellar taping. The outcome measure for this study will be the mean changes in
      maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the quadriceps muscle, pain intensity, and
      functional status up to 6 weeks.
