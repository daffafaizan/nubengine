      pneumonia. As lack of cell wall, Î²-lactam medicines were invalid, however, macrolides,
      tetracyclines and quinolones were effective. But from 2001, many countries reported
      macrolide- resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Typically, erythromycin was first-line antibiotic
      medicine. With the resistance increasing, Mycoplasm pneumonia treatment will become more and
      more difficult. Thus, optimization of Mycoplasm pneumonia antibiotic therapy is very
      important.
