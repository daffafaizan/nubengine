      gastroenteritis but they do so by a different mode of action.

      Polymethylsiloxane is an enteroadsorbent and it possibly acts by adsorption of viruses and
      doing so it prevents binding rotaviruses for enterocytes. Another mode of action can be
      forming a thin layer over the mucosal surfaces thus protects them from various damaging
      factors.

      Probiotics help the healing of the intestinal mucosa presumably in few ways - by
      normalization of gut flora, by competition with pathogen bacteria for binding sites and
      nutrients and by stimulation of intestinal immune system.
