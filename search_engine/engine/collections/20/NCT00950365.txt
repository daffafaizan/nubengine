    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in the schedule-modulated concomitant
      administration of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) and pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium),
      and in single agent pemetrexed in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      as second-line chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate antitumor objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response
      [PR]) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      II. To evaluate disease control rate (response rate + stable disease, i.e., CR+PR+ stable
      disease [SD]) and duration of response.

      III. To evaluate median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). IV. To evaluate
      the safety profile of concurrent pemetrexed and erlotinib versus single agent pemetrexed.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      i. To determine several molecular and cellular biomarkers in the tumors, the skin and the
      serum that are predictive of the efficacy of pemetrexed and erlotinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV as in Arm A and erlotinib hydrochloride orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
