      among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma at high risk of central nervous system
      recurrence. The main objective is to evaluate safety and efficacy of early institution of
      intensive central nervous system prophylaxis in a high-risk group to minimize the risk of a
      devastating central nervous system recurrence. Patients receive standard primary
      immunochemotherapy with an addition of planned central nervous system prophylaxis courses on
      or around day 15 of cycles 2, 4, and 6. Growth factor support and Pneumocystis jirovecii
      prophylaxis is required. The primary endpoint of this pilot study is protocol-defined
      toxicity, whereas efficacy (cumulative incidence of central nervous system recurrence) will
      be a secondary endpoint.
