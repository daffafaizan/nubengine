      escalations (pelvic lymph node and prostate lesion) will take place one at a time. Minimum
      waiting periods will be assigned between each dose cohort to observe toxicity. The phase I
      portion of the study will be completed when dose limiting toxicity is reached or when a
      sufficiently high dose level (i.e.,5.5 Gy per fraction to a total 27.5 Gy for pelvic lymph
      node region and 11Gy per fraction to a total of 55Gy to the prostate lesion), is attained to
      consider the therapy likely to be efficacious. All patients will be treated with a total of
      24 months of androgen suppression therapy (ADT). Radiation therapy will start 8-12 weeks
      after initiation of ADT.

      No. Patients for each cohort: 7-15 Cohort 1: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10 Gy per
      fraction to prostate lesion, 4.5Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions
      for a total of 47.5 / 50 / 22.5 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 2: 9.5 Gy
      per fraction to prostate/SV, 10 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5Gy per fraction to
      pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 50 / 25 Gy to Prostate+SV
      /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 3: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10.5 Gy per fraction to
      prostate lesion, 5Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of
      47.5 / 52.5 / 25 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 4: 9.5 Gy per fraction to
      prostate/SV, 10.5 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5.5 Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph
      node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 52.5 / 27.5 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate
      lesions/Nodes Cohort 5: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 11 Gy per fraction to prostate
      lesion, 5.5 Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 /
      55 / 27.5 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes
