      was observed, to compare in the 6MWT and 6MWToT; the ΔSp,O2 (delta of arterial oxygen
      saturation measured by pulse oximeter) in the 6MWTTI was significantly greater that in the
      6MWT, but not between to change in dyspnea and fatigue/pain in the lower-limbs between rest
      and exercise of peak (Δ). Concordance and correlation was observed between the lower Sp,O2 of
      the 6MWT with the 6MWToT, 6MWTT, 6MWTTI, 6MST and STST. Strong correlations was observed
      between the performances on the 6MST and 6MWT, 6MWToT and 6MWTT; and between the physical
      activity domain of the SGRQ with the performances in the 6MWT, 6MWToT, 6MWTT,6MST and STST.
      Conclusion: The functional tests produced similar subjective responses; however, the 6MWTTI
      caused greater desaturation that 6MWT. The concordance between the 6MWT and the tests
      performed, suggests acceptable use of any these tests in the physiotherapeutic clinical
      routine of the individuals COPD. The tests in performed, except the 6MWTTI, shown to be
      indicators of the quality of life (physical activity domain).
