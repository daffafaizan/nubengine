      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of women with nonmetastatic, resectable breast cancer
           treated with adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin®) for 6 months vs 12 months.

      Secondary

        -  Compare cardiotoxicity in patients receiving these regimens.

        -  Compare the cardiotoxicity and disease-free survival of patients receiving concurrent
           trastuzumab and chemotherapy vs sequential administration.

        -  Correlate HER-2 polymorphism with disease-free survival/cardiotoxicity in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, modality of adjuvant chemotherapy (concurrent vs
      sequential), and adjuvant hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control arm, 12-month therapy): Patients continue to receive trastuzumab
           (Herceptin®) IV until a total of 12 months of therapy is completed in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (experimental arm, 6-month therapy): Patients continue to receive trastuzumab* IV
           until a total of 6 months of therapy is completed in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients who have already finished 6 months of trastuzumab at randomization do not
      receive further trastuzumab.

      Some patients undergo blood collection for HER-2 polymorphism analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for approximately 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
