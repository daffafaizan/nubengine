    
      Prospective, interventional, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Patients are
      randomized to either treatment arm A or B.

      Patients in both treatment arms receive intrathecal autologous MSCs, arm A at baseline and
      arm B at six months.

      All patients undergo bone marrow (BM) aspiration prior to baseline. Patients in treatment arm
      A receive intrathecal autologous MSCs whereas patients in treatment arm B receive placebo.
      The treatment is blinded for the patients. The BM aspirate from patients in treatment arm B
      is processed, cryopreserved and stored in a biobank.

      At six months, all patients undergo a second BM aspiration. Patients in treatment arm A now
      receive placebo. The BM aspirate from patients in treatment arm A is processed, cryopreserved
      and stored in a biobank. Patients in treatment arm B receive intrathecal autologous MSCs. The
      treatment is blinded for the patients.

      Primary outcome is assessed at six months and secondary outcomes are assessed at six, twelve
      and eighteen months post baseline. Investigator assessing outcomes are blinded to patient
      treatment allocation.
