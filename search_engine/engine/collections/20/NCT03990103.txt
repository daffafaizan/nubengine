    
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial, to compare the efficacy of S1
      plus paclitaxel (intravenous injection & intraperitoneal injection) plus bevacizumab
      (intraperitoneal injection) versus S1 plus oxaliplatin intravenous injection as first-line
      treatment in gastric or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma with malignant ascites. A
      total of 66 patients who are diagnosed with gastric or gastroesophageal junctional
      adenocarcinoma will be allocated to receive either S1 orally administration plus paclitaxel
      intravenous injection & intraperitoneal injection plus bevacizumab intraperitoneal injection,
      or to receive S1 orally administration plus oxaliplatin intravenous injection. The primary
      end point is ascites response rate at 6 weeks. The secondary end points include the median
      overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF),
      objective response rate (ORR), puncture free survival, volume of drainage, the quality of
      life (QoL) and safety.
