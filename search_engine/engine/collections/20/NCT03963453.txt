      weakness and loss of function, a sedentary lifestyle is normal, and disuse of still
      functioning muscles leads to a secondary deterioration. Use of steroids have proven to
      decrease the rate of progression, and also leads to adverse advents like obesity and
      osteoporosis.

      Use of muscle strength training and aerobe exercise in DMD, may optimize muscle function,
      cardio-respiratory fitness and overall physical activity level, in addition to decrease
      possible adverse advents.

      In this study, children with DMD attending Haukeland University Hospital will be invited to
      participate (Nâ‰ˆ14). The participant's physical activity level is registered during a four
      week baseline period and follow up. At start, 6 months and 12 months, a five day hospital
      stay will be conducted, both for testing and to prescribe an individual user preferred
      physical exercise program. The exercise program will be performed at home between the
      hospital visits. Benefits, safety and feasibility of regular physical exercise will be
      examined during follow-up and end of study. For comparison of the physical activity level and
      motor function, DMD children attending standards of care follow-up at others Norwegian
      regional pediatric rehabilitation clinics will be invited to participate in a control group.
