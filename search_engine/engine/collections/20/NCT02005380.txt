      that target individuals with Alzheimer's disease , using mobile devices. The investigators
      developed two different user interfaces: a text-based and a graphic-based. To evaluate the
      usability of the application, participants with early stages of AD were asked to run the two
      user interfaces of the spaced retrieval memory exercise using a tablet mobile device.
