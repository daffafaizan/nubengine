      treatment of mood disorders. Hypericum extracts have been approved in Germany for the
      treatment of mild to moderate depression and are now available in standardized preparations.
      In the United States, hypericum extracts are frequently purchased as over the counter
      preparations. Inhibition of the serotonin transporter, similar to clinically used selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been suggested as a possible mechanism of action
      for the antidepressant properties of hypericum extracts. We propose to study the effects of
      hypericum extracts on mood states in normal volunteers who are concurrently volunteering
      under NIMH protocol 98-M-0094 for SPECT imaging of serotonin and dopamine transporter
      availability with [I-123] Beta-CIT. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design
      will be employed with two two-week periods of drug/placebo administration, clinical
      assessment and SPECT imaging separated by eleven weeks. We plan to test three hypotheses: 1)
      that hypericum alters mood state, 2) that hypericum reduces serotonin transporter
      availability, and 3) that these actions are quantitatively associated with one another.
