    
      Retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a common cause of visual loss in the Western world, is a
      disease whose etiology resembles that of classic atherosclerosis. A therapy that lowers the
      risk of arterial and venous thrombosis would seem to be a reasonable approach to managing
      this disease, for which there is currently no treatment.

      ATORVO is a randomized double-masked clinical trial comparing a daily dose of 80 mg of
      atorvastatin to matched placebo in persons recently diagnosed with RVO. At 24 weeks after
      randomization, we will evaluate each participant's visual acuity and the presence of
      secondary complications related to RVO.
