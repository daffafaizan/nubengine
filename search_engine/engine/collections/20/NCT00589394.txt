      a patient with immunodeficiency. The pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax ®) remains the only
      readily available and the most widely used unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine. Although the
      pneumococcal vaccine is widely used test the immune systems response to a polysaccharide
      antigen, no clear guidelines or studies exist to what is considered a proper response to the
      Pneumovax ®. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory B cells are thought to play an important role in
      protection against pneumococcal disease. It is not known to what extent the ability of B
      cells to be activated in response to pneumococcal vaccination contributes to protective
      immunity. To address these issues, the following two specific aims are proposed:

      Specific Aim 1. Assess Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to pneumococcus pre- and
      post-pneumococcal immunization in healthy controls Specific Aim 2. Analysis of B cell subsets
      in blood of healthy controls pre-and post-pneumococcal immunization to identify changes in
      memory B cell, class switched and activated B cells.
