      diagnosis, understanding, and management of benign and malignant hematologic conditions by
      assembling data collected in usual care and clinical trials. Secondary goals are to
      characterize and study practice patterns for benign and malignant hematologic conditions in
      usual clinical practice, and to aggregate patient-reported data to further understand and
      improve the patient experiences of those affected by these conditions. These objectives will
      be fulfilled by amassing previously collected data within institutions and networks, and by
      building consortia of institutions and networks to support prospective data collection
      efforts.

      As a research-focused effort, another objective of the ASH Registry is to create a learning
      community of hematologic researchers and clinicians by inviting collaborative analyses and
      publications of the data that are collected within it. These analyses may be valuable to
      basic and translational researchers developing new lines of scientific inquiry; clinical
      researchers studying the safety and efficacy of hematologic therapies in current practice;
      industry participants developing new therapies or new indications for previously developed
      treatments; regulators who are interested in new endpoints and other insights to facilitate
      the evaluation of novel approaches; and patients who are looking to understand how
      hematologic diseases and treatments for these diseases will affect their lives. As these
      different stakeholder groups come together to develop and disseminate these analyses, the ASH
      Registry will further expand to accommodate additional data collection to address yet
      unanswered questions that follow.
