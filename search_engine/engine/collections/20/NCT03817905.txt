      participate in this study in order to determine whether the use of a navigator can increase
      the use of colonoscopy, which is the recommended follow up to an abnormal stool test. A
      navigator is an individual trained to help patients access necessary health care services and
      understand the test results and next steps. Participants will be asked to meet the navigator
      at their colonoscopy appointment and discuss any problems that are experienced in getting the
      colonoscopy done. This will take about 10 minutes to complete. Participants will tell him or
      her in their own words how the experience was and whether they faced any barriers to
      scheduling and colonoscopy completion. Study personnel will also look at participants'
      electronic medical record to see what testing participants had done that prompted the need
      for colonoscopy.The study will include about 30 people.
