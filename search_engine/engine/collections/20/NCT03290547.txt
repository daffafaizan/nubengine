      version of the laser under investigation allows the user to choose a wavelength between 640nm
      to 800nm.

      This is a multi-center prospective, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study in up to 75 male or
      female subjects, age 18 to 65 years, who desire laser removal of a tattoo containing single
      or multi-color ink. Subjects will receive up to 10 laser treatments, spaced 1 to 30 weeks
      apart, and will be followed at 6 weeks (±2 weeks). At the Investigator's discretion, an
      optional follow-up visit may be conducted at 12 weeks (±2 weeks) post-final treatment.

        1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint as the Degree of tattoo clearing at 6 weeks post-final
           treatment as assessed by the :

           Investigator (Physician's Global Assessment of Improvement). and Independent blinded
           reviewers (Global Assessment of Improvement).

        2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints as the:

           Degree of tattoo clearing at 6 weeks post-final treatment as assessed by the subject
           (Subject's Global Assessment of Improvement) and Subject satisfaction levels at 6 weeks
           post-final treatment.

        3. Safety Endpoint as the Incidence and severity of adverse device effects during the study
           period, including subject pain level during laser treatment.
