      curable and effective method. However, the recurrence rate is as high as 50%~70% in 5 years
      after surgery. Perioperative treatment with immunotherapy combined with target therapy is
      expected to improve the patient's prognosis. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety
      and tolerability of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the perioperative period
      of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This trial includes subjects with CNLC
      Ib/IIa/IIb/IIIa HCC. All eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to experimental group or
      control group. In the experimental group, patients will be treated with following:
      neoadjuvant therapy (camrelizumab and apatinib, 2 cycles), radical surgery, postoperative
      TACE treatment, adjuvant therapy (camrelizumab and apatinib, 6 cycles); in the control group,
      patients will be treated with following: radical surgery, postoperative TACE treatment. The
      primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of subjects with major pathological
      response and 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate
      in the perioperative period of HCC. The secondary research purpose is to evaluate the R0
      resection rate, the rate of subjects with pathological complete response, EFS, overall
      survival and disease-free survival of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the
      perioperative period of resectable HCC. The safety and tolerability is also evaluated.
