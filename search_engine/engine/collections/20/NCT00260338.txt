    
      Mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow can be stimulated to differentiate into
      endothelial cells and participate in the development of new blood vessels in ischemic tissue.

      The aim of the study is in a phase I/II safety and efficacy study to evaluate the clinical
      effect of autologous mesenchymal stem cell therapy in patients with severe chronic myocardial
      ischemia.

      4o patients with reversible ischemia on a SPECT will be treated with direct intramyocardial
      injections of autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells.Clinical and objective
      evaluations will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up.
