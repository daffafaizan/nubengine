    
      We propose a multi-centre Canadian randomized Study wherein 80 patients are randomized (put
      in groups by no standard pattern ie. flipping a coin) to receive both autograft (sample of
      your own bone: iliac crest) and allograft (bone chips from bone bank) or "infuse" (synthetic
      bone morphogenic protein) and allograft using locked plates. Locked plates are surgical
      plates placed on the fracture in which the screws lock into the plate when they have been
      completely screwed into the bone through holes on the plate. Our objective is to assess the
      total cost of the patients treated in both study group and the benefits of the Infuse by
      comparing the new bone formation in the fracture site.

      We will monitor critical aspects of operative care and rehabilitation at regular intervals,
      up to 2 year after surgery. We will independently monitor revision surgery (surgeries to
      repair a previous surgery) rates. We will also assess patients for functional health and
      quality of life outcomes.
