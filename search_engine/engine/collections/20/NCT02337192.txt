      available for microbial aggregation, difficult the oral health promotion and, in addition,
      promotes the artificial selection of biofilms containing a higher load of pathogenic
      microorganisms. In this way, it becomes of critical importance, the development of techniques
      that might aid in the reduction of the oral microbial load. One possible approach is the use
      of the Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (APDT). In this direction, the objective of this
      study was to assess the clinical utility of the APDT and the association of the APDT with the
      SDS surfactant as oral decontamination agents in orthodontic patients. The selected patients
      (n=24) were randomly distributed within seven experimental groups: G1 - Negative control, G2
      - Curcumin mouthwash, G3 - Curcumin mouthwash+SDS, G4 - light irradiation, G5 - APDT, G6 -
      APDT+SDS and G7 - Positive Control (Chlorhexidine mouthwash). Nonstimulated saliva samples
      were collected from each one of the patients in three steps (S), as follows: S1- Initial
      condition, S2 - Treatment with mouthwashes (water, Chlorhexidine or Curcumin) and S3 - After
      APDT treatment. The efficacy of the proposed treatment protocols was assessed in function of
      the survival fraction observed in each group. The obtained results were statistically
      analyzed using variance analysis (ANOVA) and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
