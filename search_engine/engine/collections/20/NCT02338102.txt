      to receive nasal saline irrigation treatment (treatment group) or not to receive any nasal
      irrigation treatment (control group). Subjects randomized to the treatment group will be
      provided with saline packets to mix with water. All study subjects will be asked to complete
      questionnaires during the study. If a subject completes all study related activities, their
      total length of participation in the study will last about 2 months.
