      In an adult population of patients who are hospitalised or attending the emergency department
      (and not receiving dialysis) with hyperkalaemia:

        1. How does hyperkalaemia impact on RAASi therapy and does this vary according to the
           clinical indication for the drug(s)?

        2. What are the demographics, co-morbidities and drug history for patients presenting with
           hyperkalaemia?

        3. What is the frequency of subsequent hospitalisations and mortality rate in a cohort of
           patients presenting with hyperkalaemia at 12 months?
