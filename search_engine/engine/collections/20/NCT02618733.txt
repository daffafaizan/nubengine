    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, active controlled study with two
      parallel study groups.

      For inclusion in the study subjects should fulfill the following criteria:

        1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

        2. Female or male aged 20-85 years

        3. All patients with ACS scheduled for PCI will be eligible, assuming their ability to
           understand the character and individual consequences of participation as well as giving
           written informed consent.

        4. Be able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, as judged by the
           investigator.

      To investigate the effects of ticagrelor on coronary microcirculation, IMR will be measured
      twice, 6 months apart in the same lesion, compared with clopidogrel.

      The IMR is defined as simultaneously measured distal coronary pressure divided by the inverse
      of the thermodilution-derived hyperaemic mean transit time (Tmn), or more simply, distal
      coronary pressure multiplied by the Tmn.
