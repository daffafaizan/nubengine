      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,
      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which
      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of
      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic
      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals
      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do
      not have asthma or CVA) (COUGH) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose
      of this research is to further explore the pathophysiologic basis for cough in these
      conditions using two 'indirect' inhalation challenge tests: eucapneic voluntary
      hyperventilation (EVH) and hypertonic saline (HS), which induce osmotic and/or temperature
      changes in airway. Specifically, this study will collect preliminary data on the
      sensory-mechanical responses of individuals with CVA, COUGH and healthy controls to EVH and
      HS challenge.
