      The ethical implications are related to the tissue which is being tested for a virus that can
      be implicated in head and neck squamous cancer. These patients would not normally be aware of
      HPV infection and this would raise an new health burden in these patient who are likely to be
      fit and well. The research team would be suitable to counsel patients from any worries
      related to HPV infection.
