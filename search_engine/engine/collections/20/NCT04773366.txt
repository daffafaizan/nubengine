    
      All patients with de novo pathological confirmed LCH enrolled in this study will be
      classified into 4 groups. Group 1: Multisystem patients (â‰¥2 organs/systems) with involvement
      of one or more "Risk" organs" (hematopoietic system, liver or spleen);Group 2:Multisystem
      patients, but without involvement of "Risk" organs; Group 3: Single system, Multifocal+
      Single system, unifocal and special site@ (Isolated lesion of special site)+ Single system,
      unifocal and CNS risk+Single system, unifocal i.e. thyroid, lung, thymus,
      hypothalamic-pituitary+Single system, unifocal and other functionally critical anatomical
      sites; Group 4: Single system, unifocal i.e. bone, skin or lymph node (not the draining lymph
      node of another LCH lesion). For patients in Group 1, a 6-week initial treatment, a 16-week
      consolidation continuation treatment and a 26-week maintenance continuation treatment
      containing cytarabine is applied. For patients in Group 2, a 6-week initial treatment
      containing cytarabine and a 46-week continuation treatment (without cytarabine) is applied.
      For patients in Group 3,a 6-week initial treatment and a 46-week continuation treatment
      (without cytarabine) is applied. For patients in Group 4, only local therapy followed by
      wait-and-see strategy is applied.
