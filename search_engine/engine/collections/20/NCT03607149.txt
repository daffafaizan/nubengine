           administered versus creatine clearance according to Cockcroft-Gault (CrCLCG) versus body
           surface area (SC) on median time before discontinuation of treatment for renal function
           â‰¤ 45mL / min in patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer predominantly
           non-squamous in maintenance.

        -  Secondary objective: To evaluate the impact of calculating the dose of pemetrexed to be
           administered versus CRCLCG versus SC over time to treatment discontinuation,
           progression-free survival (PFS), and patient overall survival.
