      with perinatally and behaviorally acquired HIV. In a cross-sectional design, adolescents will
      be asked to complete an ACASI questionnaire that will assess body image, medication
      adherence, depressive symptoms, medical, and other sociodemographic variables which may
      relate to adolescents with HIV. Information regarding the adolescents' medical history,
      medications, and physical functioning also will be abstracted from his or her medical record.
      Guided by the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, findings from this study will inform future
      intervention studies designed to enhance HIV disease management among adolescents.
