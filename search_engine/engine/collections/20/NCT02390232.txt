      Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease . While simple steatosis has benign prognosis,
      steatohepatitis (NASH) leads to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma and increases cardiovascular
      and cancer- related mortality. Some Escherichia coli (E. coli) belonging to the B2
      phylogenetic group are involved in many diseases. Those producing the genotoxin colibactin
      are in addition known to induce a chronic alteration of intestinal permeability, one of the
      major factors leading to NASH.
