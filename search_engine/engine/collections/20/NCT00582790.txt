      in combination with Zoledronic acid on subjects with previously untreated, unresectable
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Also, the study will assess the tolerability, safety,
      pharmacodynamic effects, and immunologic effects of low-dose Interleukin-2 in combination
      with Zoledronic acid on angiogenesis inhibition and anti-metastatic potential by measuring
      serum/plasma angiogenic/metastatic factor levels and by quantitating changes in cytokine
      expression, antigen-specific T-cell immune responses, and peripheral gd T-cell frequency and
      function.
