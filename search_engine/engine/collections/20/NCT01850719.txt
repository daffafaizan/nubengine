    
      Rationale: Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy (APM) is the most performed orthopaedic
      procedure and is current standard treatment for patients with meniscal tears. Since
      superiority of APM over conservative treatment has not well been described and studies with
      direct comparison between APM and conservative treatment are sparse, therefore there is risk
      of large healthcare inefficiency.

      Study design: Non-inferiority multicenter randomized controlled trial with an economic
      evaluation alongside. The study will be conducted by the Orthopaedic Research Consortium
      Mid-West Netherlands and performed in 6 clinics, including 2 academic medical centers.

      402 patients between 45 and 70 years with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-confirmed
      symptomatic, non-obstructive meniscal tears will be included. Patients will be assigned to
      either APM (n=201) or Physical Therapy (PT; n=201), with optional delayed APM (cross-over)
      when conservative treatment has failed. Block randomization will be done stratified for age
      and site. Data will be analysed on both intention to treat and per protocol basis.

      Measurement points:

        -  Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24
           months.

        -  At both 3 and 24 months they will visit the outpatient department for physical
           examination.

        -  At 24 months an X-ray will be obtained.

      Sample size calculation: 402 patients, based on a power of 90%, an alpha of 0.05, a standard
      deviation of 20 points and a non-inferiority threshold of 8 points on the IKDC 'Subjective
      Knee Form'. Loss to follow up and cross-over have been taken into account in this
      calculation.
