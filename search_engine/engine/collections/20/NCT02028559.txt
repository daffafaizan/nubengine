      ultrasound to reposition kidney stones by imparting sufficient acoustic energy to physically
      move a stone. The focused ultrasound pulses are similar to pulses that may be used in
      elastography or acoustic radiation force imaging. Like conventional ultrasound, the probe is
      placed in contact with the patient's skin to image the stone following standard ultrasound
      imaging procedure. The same probe is then used to focus the ultrasound and apply a burst (a
      sequence of pulses) of acoustic force to push the stone. Brightness mode (B-mode) imaging is
      interleaved with the "pushing" pulses (Push-mode) to monitor stone movement. The user
      controls the burst amplitude. For patient safety, there is a slight delay before the operator
      can execute the next push.
