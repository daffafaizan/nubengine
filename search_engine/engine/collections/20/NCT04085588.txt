      targeting different levels of pain pathways, is used to improve pain control while also to
      reduce opioid use and related side effects. Pain can be treated at various neurophysiological
      levels, including peripheral, spinal and cortical targets. One of the agents used in the
      multimodal analgesia technique is ketamine.

      Ketamine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) and has local anesthetic effect. Ketamine
      is an N-methyl D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which appears to be the main mechanism
      of anesthetic and analgesic action at CNS and spinal cord receptors. Other mechanisms of
      action of ketamine include the interaction with opioid receptors, particularly mu and kappa
      receptors. Another effect is that it has local anesthetic effect in high doses. Studies have
      shown that ketamine is an effective agent in the treatment of postoperative pain. Continuous
      infusion of low-dose ketamine after total knee arthroplasty significantly reduced morphine
      consumption, and provided early rehabilitation without increasing side effects. However, when
      these studies are considered, there is no information about the optimal dose of ketamine that
      reduces opioid consumption at the highest level.

      In our study, continuous infusion of low-dose ketamine at different doses was planned to
      provide postoperative analgesia. Therefore, our first aim in this study was to find out the
      optimal dose that reduced morphine consumption for postoperative analgesia after TKA with
      continuous ketamine infusion at different doses. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      early and late period pain, side effects, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, and
      recovery.
