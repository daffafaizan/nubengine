      existing departmental protocol for these interventions.

      All patients receive individualized goal-directed haemodynamic therapy based on the
      transpulmonary thermodilution technique.

      At designated times, hemodynamic variables will be recorded. These include:

        -  Heart rate (bpm)

        -  Central venous pressure (mmHg)

        -  Mean arterial pressure (mmHg)

        -  Cardiac index (L/min/m2)

        -  Pulse pressure variation (PPV)

      Blood flow and pressure measurements performed by the surgeon :

        -  Hepatic flow : hepatic artery (HAF) and portal vein (PVF)

        -  Pressure measurements in portal vein (PPorta) and caval vein (PCava)

      Both flow and pressure will be simultaneously recorded. To minimize the effect of ventilation
      on pressure, these measurements will be obtained during apnea.

      Between each flow measurement there will be a minimum of 5 minutes.

      NOR will be started at 0,1 mcg/kg/min and titrated according to its haemodynamic effect.
      After baseline MAP (which is > 60 mmHg), NOR is targeted according baseline MAP. At T2, MAP
      is between 10 - 20 % above baseline (T1), at T3 MAP is between 20 - 30 % above baseline (T1).
