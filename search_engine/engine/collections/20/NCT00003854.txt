        -  Estimate the prevalence and evaluate the prognostic significance of sentinel lymph node
           micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry in women with stage I or IIA breast
           cancer.

        -  Estimate the prevalence and evaluate the prognostic significance of bone marrow
           micrometastases detected by immunocytochemistry in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the hazard rate for regional recurrence in women whose sentinel nodes are
           negative by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

        -  Provide a mechanism for identifying women whose sentinel nodes contain metastases
           detected by H&E so that these women can be considered as candidates for ACOSOG-Z0011.
