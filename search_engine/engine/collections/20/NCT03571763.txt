    
      Cerebral microbleeds（CMBs） is a subclinical lesion caused by microvascular disease in the
      brain, characterized by microleakage of blood. About 30% of ischemic stroke patients, 40% of
      the healthy people over 80 years old, and 60% of intracranial hemorrhage patients have
      microbleeds. With the development of imaging technology, clinically more and more patients
      have found microbleeds in the brain. How these patients are treated with antithrombotic drugs
      is not yet clear and is in urgent need of evidence. There are only a few prospective cohort
      studies to determine whether antithrombotic therapy increases the risk of intracranial
      hemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients with CMBs, but the results are uncertain. More
      importantly, whether antithrombotic therapy increases the incidence of the emerging CMBs, and
      whether the change of increased microbleeds is associated with increased intracranial
      hemorrhage has not been reported.
