      at their clinical appointments will be recruited and scheduled to return for the study. After
      completing the informed consent, patients will be taught how to don and doff the pulse
      oximeter, the source of the heart rate and oxygen signals. Patients will participate in a
      demonstration on how to perform the intervention. Recruitment will continue until five
      patients have completed the pilot in a clinic setting. If necessary, the prototype will be
      modified and testing resumed. Once the prototype system has met the criteria for success in
      the clinic, five of patients will be asked to use the prototype at the clinic and to take it
      home for a week and perform the intervention at least five times.
