      pediatric population who have Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) who have relapsed or are resistant or intolerant to a prior tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI)-containing therapy, or who have the T315I mutation.

      The study will enroll approximately 68 patients. Participants will be assigned to a treatment
      group either in phase 1 or phase 2. Participants unable to swallow the ponatinib tablets will
      receive the age-appropriate formulation, minitablets:

      â€¢ Ponatinib + Chemotherapy

      All participants will be asked to take ponatinib once daily. In phase 1 ponatinib will be
      administered in combination with a chemotherapy backbone to determine the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of ponatinib. In both phase 1 and phase 2, treatment consists of two 35-day
      blocks of therapy (reinduction block and consolidation block). Each block will include 29
      days of treatment of daily ponatinib and a chemotherapy backbone regimen followed by a rest
      period from chemotherapy for a minimum of 6 days consisting of daily ponatinib only.

      This is a multi-center trial and will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and may be
      contacted by telephone in follow-up after treatment.
