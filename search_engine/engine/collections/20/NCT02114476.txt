      the first time in pregnancy. GDM is a well-known risk factor for developing overt diabetes
      later in life, especially type 2 diabetes. About 50-60% of woman with prior GDM will develop
      type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. Recent studies show that women with previous GDM
      exhibit a markedly increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, even when glucose
      tolerance is normal. For both maternal and future offspring, women with prior GDM need safe,
      efficient, and acceptable choices for contraceptive methods that do not enhance their already
      substantial risk to develop either overt diabetes or metabolic syndrome and associated
      sequelae. The intrauterine device (IUD) is a very effective and reversible contraceptive
      method without metabolic disturbances and therefore is an ideal contraceptive for women with
      prior GDM. Progestins do not increase globulin production; thus, they do not increase
      coagulation factors or blood pressure. A nonrandomized open-label prospective trial of
      healthy obese, reproductive-age women in California were studied about the metabolic effects
      of progestin-only long-acting reversible contraception levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine
      system (LNG-IUS) and etonogestrel implant (ENG-I)] comparing with nonhormonal contraception
      (NHC). The changes in fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity were seen among obese at 3
      months.
