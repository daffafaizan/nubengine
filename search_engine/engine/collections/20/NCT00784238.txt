      (conducted in more than one center), prospective (study following participants forward in
      time), and non-comparative study, in participants with schizophrenia. The study consists of
      following parts: Screening (that is, 14 days before study commences on Day 1); Acute
      Treatment phase (24 weeks); Extension phase 1 (24 weeks), which will be followed by
      additional Extension phase 2 (48 weeks). Total study duration per participant will be 96
      weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by change from Baseline in Subjective Well-being
      Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale score and change from Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory
      scores. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
