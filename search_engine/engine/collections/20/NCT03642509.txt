    
      An investigator-initiated multicenter, randomized open-label non-inferiority trial with
      blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE design). The active comparison LAAO is tested against NOAC
      therapy in a 1:1 stratified randomization. Patients should have AF, and an ischemic stroke or
      TIA within 6 months prior to enrollment. In total 750 patients will be included. Follow-up
      will be based on in-office and telephone follow-up during the first 3 years after
      randomization, along with up to 10 years long-term follow-up through the National Patient
      Registries.

      The main study outcomes: The primary outcome is a composite of stroke (hemorrhagic or
      ischemic), systemic embolism, major bleeding or all-cause mortality assessed after at least
      two years follow-up for the last enrolled patient. Secondary outcomes will examine early and
      late safety outcome measures. The long-term outcome will be assessed up to 10-years after
      randomization through the National Patient Registries.
