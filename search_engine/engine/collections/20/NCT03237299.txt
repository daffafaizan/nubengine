        -  Cases: children < 18 years old hospitalized for peripharyngeal suppurations, diffuse
           cervical cellulitis or cervical adenophlegmon in participating Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT)
           and pediatric departments.

        -  Controls: children < 18 years old with pharyngitis but without infectious complications
           recruited by general practitioners (GPs) or by primary care pediatricians in private
           setting, matched to cases by age, date of infectious complication (index date), delay
           between the pharyngitis and the index date and, if possible, the referring physician.

      Primary endpoint: Difference in the frequency of exposure to various factors among cases and
      controls during an exposure window going from the date of diagnosis of pharyngitis to day
      -0.5 of the index date of the complication.

      Several exposure of interest will be compared between cases and controls. One specific main
      exposure of interest during a predefined window of exposure has been defined but will not be
      revealed to investigators to avoid selection bias. Several secondary exposure of interest
      were a priori defined but will not be revealed to investigators to avoid selection bias.
