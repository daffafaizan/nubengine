    
      This is a multicentre, first-in-human, open-label, single ascending dose, dose-ranging study
      of autologous, chimeric antigen receptor T regulatory cells (CAR-Treg) in HLA-A2 mismatched
      living donor kidney transplant recipients, with a control cohort of mismatched kidney
      transplant recipients of similar immunological risk.The aim is for the CAR-Tregs to recognise
      the HLA-A2 molecule present on the donated kidney and subsequently induce and maintain
      immunological tolerance to the organ.

      The study requires three different types of participants - transplant recipients who will
      receive the study treatment TX200-TR101; control participants, who are transplant recipients
      who will not receive the study treatment; and transplant donors, who will donate their kidney
      to the transplant recipients.
