      disorder or as a component of other diseases and its onset may be triggered or modified by
      exposure to systemic drugs, contact lens wear, ocular surgery and adverse environmental and
      work conditions. The development of a reliable, highly sensitive and specific test for the
      clinical diagnosis of dry eye is a major unmet clinical need, particularly to differentiate
      it from common conditions such as ocular allergy which exhibit similar presenting symptoms.
      Tear hyper-osmolarity is central to the dry eye disease process and the measurement of tear
      osmolarity could serve not only as a highly accurate diagnostic test but also as a measure of
      disease severity and a means to monitor treatment efficacy.

      Recently, there have been reports in the literature regarding dry eye disease; both early and
      chronic following refractive surgery, with many cases potentially being previously
      inadvertently undiagnosed dry eye disease.
