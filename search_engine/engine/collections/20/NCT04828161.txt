    
      Primary objectives:

      Part A The primary objective of this Part is to demonstrate superiority of ensovibep,
      compared to placebo, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load through Day 8.

      Part B The primary objective of this Part is to demonstrate superiority of ensovibep,
      compared to placebo, in reducing the occurrence of hospitalizations (≥ 24 hours of acute
      care) and/or emergency room visits related to COVID-19 or death from any cause up to Day 29.

      Secondary objectives:

      Part A

      The secondary objectives of this Part are:

        -  To assess the effect of ensovibep, compared to placebo, in reducing the occurrence of
           hospitalizations (≥ 24 hours of acute care) and/or emergency room visits related to
           COVID-19 or death from any cause up to Day 29

        -  To assess the effect of ensovibep, compared to placebo, in reducing COVID-19 symptoms
           through Day 29

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of ensovibep

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ensovibep

      Part B

      The secondary objectives of this Part are:

        -  To assess the effect of ensovibep, compared to placebo, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral
           load through Day 8

        -  To assess the effect of ensovibep, compared to placebo, in reducing COVID-19 symptoms up
           to Day 29

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of ensovibep and its clinical relevance (pharmacokinetic,
           efficacy, and safety).

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of ensovibep
