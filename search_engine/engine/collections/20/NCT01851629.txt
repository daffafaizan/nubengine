      participate for 1-2 days. These individuals may undergo a variety of non-invasive
      neurophysiological tests which evaluate spinal reflexes and integrity of specific spinal
      pathways. In addition, their movement may be assessed during walking on a treadmill and
      overground in a variety of different conditions (e.g. with mirrors, without mirrors, with
      obstacles, without obstacles).

      Eligible individuals with spinal cord injury that are enrolled in the study will undergo the
      same testing as described above for the healthy controls. In addition, a small subset of
      these individuals may receive locomotor training (3 weeks of basic locomotor training
      followed by 3 weeks of adaptive locomotor training, separated by a 3 week washout period).
      For the individuals receiving locomotor training, they will be tested before and after each 3
      week training session.
