    
      In this study, 36 patients with chronic PTSD and heavy marijuana use (heavy) and 36 patients
      with chronic PTSD and no marijuana use (no use) will be recruited to examine the effects of
      marijuana use on behavioral (emotional experiencing), physiological (skin conductance,
      acoustic startle) and biological (cortisol, blood pressure) responding on a well-established
      discriminative conditioning and extinction paradigm. To examine real world therapeutic
      implications, we will also examine how individuals with PTSD and heavy or no marijuana use
      differentially respond to a brief (6 session, 50 min) daily imaginal exposure (IE) treatment.
      Throughout treatment, we will monitor level of cannabis metabolites in urine samples of
      marijuana users to correlate effects to outcomes and preliminarily explore how varying levels
      of cannabis metabolites affect extinction processes. Independent evaluators will assess
      patients at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks following study entry.
