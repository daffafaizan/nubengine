        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate and cytarabine in patients
           with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen as defined by dose-limiting toxicity of this
           regimen and treatment-related mortality in no more than 5% of these patients.

        -  Determine the rate and duration of molecular response, complete hematological response,
           and complete cytogenetic response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate and cytarabine.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate alone once daily on days 1-21. Patients then receive
      oral imatinib mesylate once daily and cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-7. Combination
      therapy repeats every 28-42 days for 2 courses. Patients then receive maintenance oral
      imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 5-20 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate and cytarabine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which at least 5/5, 5/10, or 5/20 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
