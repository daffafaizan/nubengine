      combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. II.
      Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every
      2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for disease progression and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
