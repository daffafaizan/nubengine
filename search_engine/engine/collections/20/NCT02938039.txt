      neonatal patients (including ex-premature) have also been benefited by the use of LMA. There
      are many advantages of LMA over endotracheal tube (ETT) in pediatric patients like ease of
      insertion, securing airway rapidly, avoidance of muscle relaxants, reduced incidence of sore
      throat, post operative hoarseness and coughing at the time of extubation, greater hemodynamic
      and intraocular pressure (IOP) stability. LMA has been recognized internationally in control
      of airway in difficult and failed intubation.

      There are different types of pediatric LMAs available e.g. I-gel, ProSeal, LMA supreme, LMA
      classic, LMA unique, LarySeal and Ambu. These devices differ morphologically from each other
      (silicone, polyvinyl chloride or soft gel). There have been several randomized controlled
      studies comparing different LMAs in adults, however, the literature is sparse in which such
      comparison has been made in patients with weight 10 kg or below.
