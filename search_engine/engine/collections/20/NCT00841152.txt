    
      This study is designed to perform a head-to-head comparison of two synthetic ceramic bone
      graft substitutes, bioactive glass (BAG) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), in filling of
      contained bone defects following surgical evacuation of benign bone tumor or tumor-like
      conditions. Small metacarpal and phalangeal enchondromas (Stratum I) and large long-bone
      lesions (Stratum II) will be evaluated separately. Aside with the head-to-head comparison of
      the two synthetic bone graft substitutes, autologous bone graft (Stratum I) and allogeneic
      bone graft (Stratum II) will be used as the standard of care controls.
