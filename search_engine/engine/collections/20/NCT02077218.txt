      I. Evaluate the feasibility of using CT-based imaging and blood biomarkers for assessment of
      asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) in survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the prevalence and severity of asymptomatic CAD, as measured by CT angiography.

      II. Describe the association between patient demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), pre-HCT
      chest radiation, HCT-related exposures (total body irradiation [TBI], conditioning
      chemotherapy), graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and its management and cardiovascular risk
      factors (CVRFs) on extent of CAD.

      III. Describe the association between asymptomatic CAD and candidate blood biomarkers of
      vessel injury and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP],
      lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 [Lp-PLA2]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cardiac CT and collection of blood samples for analysis of hs-CRP via
      quantitative immunoturbidimetry and Lp-PLA2 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
