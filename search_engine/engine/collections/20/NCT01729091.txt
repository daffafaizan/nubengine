      I. To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived natural
      killer (NK) cells.

      II. To determine efficacy by the percent of patients achieving very good partial remission
      (VGPR) + complete remission (CR) at 3 months post-transplant.

      III. To assess the minimal residual disease rate 100 days post-transplant in high-risk
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To quantify duration of infused allogeneic donor UCB-derived NK cells in the recipient.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of UCB-derived NK cells.

      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-5 hours on day -15 and -8, lenalidomide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -8 to -2, high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day
      -7, and UCB-derived NK cells IV over 1 hour on day -5. Patients undergo autologous stem cell
      transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60 and 100 days and 6
      and 12 months.
