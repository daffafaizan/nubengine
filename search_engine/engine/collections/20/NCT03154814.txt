      moderate hypothermic CPB. The patients were classified into two groups: patients in whom
      high-dose ulinastatin (10,000 U/kg and 5,000 U/kg/h) was administered during CPB (Group-U);
      and patients in whom ulinastatin was not administered (Group-C). We measured PaO2/FiO2 at the
      following time points: before CPB (Pre-CPB), 2 hours after weaning from CPB (Post-CPB) and
      within 6 hours after admission to the ICU. The lengths of ventilator care and ICU stay were
      also reviewed.
