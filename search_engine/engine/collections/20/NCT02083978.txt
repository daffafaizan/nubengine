      results of which have been largely inconsistent, both in terms of what abnormalities are
      present in BD and whether they show any similar abnormalities to those found in
      schizophrenia. One possibility that might explain the varying degree of reported similarity
      in structural findings in schizophrenia and BD is that there might be effects of BPD
      diagnostic subtype associated with brain structure. One viewpoint that contrasts
      schizophrenia and BD considers psychotic (PBD) to differ from non-psychotic (NPBD) subtypes
      in terms of shared pathophysiology with schizophrenia. PBD has been reported as being of
      special interest, as it shares symptomatic overlap with schizophrenia, "runs in families",
      shares a chromosomal linkage to the 13q13-32 and 22q12 with schizophrenia, shows similar
      increases in dopamine receptor Bmax induced by [c-11] N-methylspiperone positron emission
      tomography and similar working memory impairments as in schizophrenia. If PBP and NPBP are
      associated with different forms of brain pathology, then merging the two entities into a
      single "bipolar group" might obscure relevant anatomic differences if these occur primarily
      in only one group. In this proposal, the investigators will focus on subcortical gray and
      white matter structures commonly found to be abnormal in schizophrenia. Thus, the
      investigators will evaluate the volume and shape of the hippocampus, thalamus and basal
      ganglia, as well as measures of structural integrity of the corpus callosum and its various
      subregions.
