      at any given time gives important indicators of corneal physiology, especially in the
      diagnostics of corneal and systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes, herpes simplex and keratitis)
      and recovery from ocular surgery. Current commercial measurement methods are outdated,
      non-quantitative and uncomfortable to use, hence left unused. This results in suboptimal,
      even poor, diagnosis and treatment for patients.

      In this study the operating parameters for a state-of-the-art esthesiometer are defined. The
      operating principle is based on existing rebound technology which is already approved for IOP
      measurement.
