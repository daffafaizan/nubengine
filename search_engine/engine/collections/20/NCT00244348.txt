      catheterization via interventional radiology. The catheter will remain in place for two hours
      while oxaliplatin is infused and then be removed. This treatment will be followed by a 48
      hour infusion of 5FU and leucovorin, generally following the principle of FOLFOX 6. These
      cycles of therapy will be repeated biweekly for six episodes. Hepatic tumor size will be
      evaluated by CT scan to determine if resectability has been established as the result of
      tumor size reduction. If so, the patient will be offered resection of the residual lesions in
      an effort to achieve long term survival.
