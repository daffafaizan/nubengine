        1. Determine the effect of recombinant human insulin like growth factor-I (rhIGF-I)
           (generic: mecasermin) on subcutaneous adiposity in patients with HIV lipodystrophy
           syndrome.

        2. Determine the effects of rhIGF-I on glucose homeostasis and lipids in patients with HIV
           lipodystrophy.

        3. Determine the effects of rhIGF-I on apoptosis, mitochondria, and inflammation, in
           adipose tissue obtained from patients with HIV lipodystrophy.
