      treat cognitive-behavioral factors that are maintaining their symptoms. The investigators
      hypothesize that the prolonged PC symptoms are in part due to disruption of autonomic nervous
      system function post-injury as well as exacerbation by the psychological response to the
      injury. This hypothesis is based on evidence showing that PC symptoms, including headache,
      fatigue, dizziness, and heightened anxiety overlap with upregulated sympathetic activity and
      elevated levels of salivary cortisol. There is evidence linking cognitive-behavioral factors
      (e.g., catastrophizing) to prolonged symptoms of autonomic overactivation after injury (e.g.,
      anxiety, pain, etc.). The participants are taught shallow breathing techniques to normalize
      parasympathetic activity and provide cognitive-behavioral treatment to reduce psychological
      reactions to the injury that exacerbate the autonomic disruption and prolong recovery.
