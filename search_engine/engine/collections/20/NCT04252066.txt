      infants during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. The study will evaluate outcomes of pregnancy
      and/or breastfeeding in women and infants exposed to migalastat. All pregnant women with
      Fabry disease are eligible to enroll, an unexposed cohort potentially can be used for
      comparisons.

      Cases will be reported voluntarily to the Pregnancy Coordinating Center (PCC) from any
      country by Healthcare Providers (HCPs), by patients and secondary contacts. The PCC will
      follow patients throughout their pregnancies and/or breastfeeding and infant through 1 year
      of age.

      patients who have Fabry Disease, and have been exposed to at least 1 dose of migalastat
      during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. Cohort 2 will be pregnant and/or breastfeeding
      patients who have Fabry Disease, who were not exposed to migalastat during pregnancy and/or
      breastfeeding.

      protocol for a minimum of 10 years.
