      average daily number of steps per week using a smartphone personal health record application
      developed by Samsung Medical Center for patients with type 2 diabetes. The study subjects
      were divided into five groups such as 1) basal activity (<2500 steps/day), 2) limited
      activity (2500-4999 steps/day), 3) low activity (5000-7499 steps/day), 4) somewhat active
      (7500-9999 steps/day), 5) active (10000-12499 steps/day), 6) highly active (â‰¥12500
      steps/day)according to the average number of steps per day. During the 12-week period, the
      intervention group receives the text messages that encourage step-by-step increments every
      week, and the control group does not receive text messages. The effect of 12-week step
      monitoring and education on the change in daily step count will be analyzed. Also, the effect
      of change in daily step count on glucose level, body weight, and blood pressure will be
      studied.
