    
      Aim 1: Adaptation and integration of evidence-based content for substance use, SA, and SRB
      prevention into an integrated, technology-based prevention program for adolescents aged 14-18
      in primary care. Focus groups or interviews with adolescents aged 14-18, combined with
      guidance from the mentorship team, will inform the adaptation and integration of
      evidence-based content. Focus groups or interviews will include discussion of integration of
      evidence-based content and attitudes towards substance use, SA, and SRB prevention.

      Aim 2: Usability Testing of Integrated Prevention Program. Usability testing will include
      adolescents (n = 15-20) and physicians (n = 15-20) recruited from community-based primary
      care clinics and feedback will include reactions and obtain direct input from end users
      regarding design and content. Information obtained from this phase of development will be
      used to guide refinements of the tablet-based prevention program.

      Aim 3: Pilot feasibility trial in preparation for RCT. Adolescents aged 14-18 will be
      recruited for screening from community-based primary care clinics to ensure ease of
      dissemination and representation of community-based primary care settings. The primary goal
      is to develop feasibility to apply for an R01 to conduct an RCT. Power analyses indicate that
      280 participants would be needed for an RCT after accounting for attrition. Given that the
      RCT would be conducted over a 3-year period, a recruitment rate of 8 adolescents per month
      would indicate feasibility for a larger RCT. A secondary goal is to preliminarily examine
      outcomes.
