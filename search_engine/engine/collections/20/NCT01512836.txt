      maximize health outcomes within a cost-constrained environment. Evaluations of case
      management in Danish settings are sparse, and so far no Danish studies have evaluated the
      cost-effectiveness of case management.

      This study is performed as a RCT, and the study focuses exclusively on patients with COPD.
      The patients will be enrolled and randomized after being referred to rehabilitation at the
      local rehabilitation center in Aalborg municipality, Denmark. 150 patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups of 75 patients each. Participants in the control group will receive
      usual care, whereas patients assigned to the interventional group will receive case
      management besides their usual care. Each patient will be followed for 12 months. Patients in
      both groups will fill out questionnaires at baseline and 12 months. The data register system
      "Health - Planning and Quality" in the Northern Region of Jutland will be used to determine
      health care services and costs.
