      I. To estimate the probability of clinical response and toxicity of paclitaxel as second-line
      chemotherapy in measurable disease patients with malignant tumors of the ovarian stroma.

      II. To evaluate the value of inhibin for predicting response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for three years, and
      then annually thereafter.
