      per dose. Subjects with renal impairment will receive an adjusted dose based on calculated
      creatinine clearance. The initial 5 day treatment course may be extended for up to 5
      additional days if viral shedding is determined to be ongoing or if clinical symptoms warrant
      further treatment with IV zanamivir.

      The study duration is approximately 28 days for subjects whose treatment duration is 5 days,
      and up to approximately 33 days for subjects whose treatment duration is extended to a
      maximum of 10 days. The study will consist of Pre-dose Baseline Assessments (Day 1), During
      Treatment Assessments (Days 1 to 5, and up to Day 10), and Follow-up Assessments on the
      following days: Post-Treatment +2, +5, +9, +16 and +23 Days. For subjects who have been
      discharged from hospital, the Post-Treatment +2, +5, +9 and +16 Days Assessments can be made
      by telephone contact.
