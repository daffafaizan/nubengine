      CE-labeled compatible accessories. The experimental device will be investigated regarding its
      performance of speech understanding in noise with and without an accessory existing of an
      external microphone to pick sound at a certain target. A secondary objective of this study is
      the investigation of the Overall system stability in daily life situations. The experimental
      device contains direct connectivity functionality. Another objective of this study is the
      investigation of the subjective occlusion effect of different acoustic couplings. This will
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based
      in St√§fa (Switzerland).
