    
      The main hypothesis of this study is that the administration of autologous ex vivo expanded
      HIV-specific T-cells (HXTCs) primed to recognize multiple HIV-1 antigens in HIV-infected
      participants who initiated ART during acute and chronic HIV infection will be safe, increase
      HIV-1 antigen specific T-cell immune responses and decrease low level viremia.

      In addition, secondary objectives are to:

        1. Determine the feasibility of manufacturing HXTC from participants who started cART
           during acute and chronic HIV infection.

        2. Explore the ability of autologous ex vivo expanded HIV-1 specific T-cells (HXTC) to
           increase HIV-1 specific immune responses in participants initiated on cART during acute
           and chronic HIV infection.

        3. Explore the ability of autologous ex vivo expanded HIV-1 specific T-cells (HXTC) to
           impact latent HIV infection as measured by a quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA)
           and integrated proviral DNA quantification, and low level viremia as measured by a
           single copy assay (SCA) in participants initiated on cART during acute and chronic HIV
           infection.
