      the metabolic control of type2 diabetes patients. Patients with type two diabetes mellitus
      patients and confirmed chronic periodontitis will be selected and randomly assign to two
      groups. The treatment group will receive immediate full-mouth scaling and root planing
      whereas the control group will be scheduled to receive periodontal treatment at the following
      3-month visit. Plaque index, bleeding index, probing pocket depth, recessions and cervical
      attachment loss will be recorded at baseline, at six weeks and at three months. Glycated
      haemoglobin (HbA1c) and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be analysed at baseline and three
      months following enrolment.
