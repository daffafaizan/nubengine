      lymph in Surgical ICU patients with septic shock. The lymph drainage will continue for up to
      a maximum of 7 days and will be continued in those interventional group patients discharged
      from ICU back to the ward before that time. The lymph (and time-matched blood) will be
      periodically sampled to detect changes in composition which will be correlated with changes
      in disease severity and outcomes, as well as patient physiology and biochemistry. This pilot
      study is not powered to detect changes in hospital/ICU stay, major complications or
      mortality. The primary endpoint of interest is the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile and
      concentrations in lymph and peripheral blood.
