      group managing patient's airway in the intensive care unit (ICU). Before simulations
      investigators will video-record 20 real-world intubations. Consequently will be run
      simulations to whole staff of the ICU. After the education further 20 real-world intubations
      will be recorded. Also simulations are recorded. From the videos investigators assess
      technical and non-technical skills of the group before and after simulation education,
      correlations between groups and influence of the education on action of the group. On the
      first part of the study, hypothesis is that group's good non-technical skills improve also
      technical skills. On the second part of the study hypothesis is that performing well in
      simulation correlates with performing well in real-world situation and teams with less
      experience the correlation is stronger.
