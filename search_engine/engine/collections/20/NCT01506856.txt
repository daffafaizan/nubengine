      Residual tumor diameter([0cm(No residual)] vs. [0cm<residual<1cm] vs. [1cm<residual<2cm] vs.
      [>2 cm]), FIGO stage(StageII vs. III vs. IV) and institution. Patient randomized to one of
      the treatment arms described below.

      RegimenI(Standard treatment: dd-TCiv therapy): Paclitaxel administered by IV infusion weekly
      plus concurrent carboplatin administered by IV infusion once every 3 weeks

      RegimenII(Study treatment: dd-TCip therapy): Paclitaxel administered by IV infusion weekly
      plus concurrent carboplatin administered by IP injection once every 3 weeks

      The 3-week period (21 days) is 1 cycle. Protocol treatment basically comprises 6 cycles. IDS
      is allowed to be performed after 3, 4 or 5 cycles of the protocol treatment. In such cases,
      the protocol treatment must be restarted within 8 weeks after IDS. If IDS is performed,
      patients can receive up to 3 additional cycles of the protocol treatment after IDS. If
      interval debulking surgery (IDS) is performed after 3, 4 or 5 cycles, the patients can
      receive up to 3 additional cycles of the protocol treatment. A total of 6 to 8 cycles will be
      repeated.

      The analysis of efficacy will be performed on all randomized subjects in accordance with the
      intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. In order to assess the robustness of the results, the
      same analyses will be done using all randomized subjects who satisfy the eligibility
      criteria. The analysis of safety will be performed on all subjects who have received at least
      one dose of study treatment.
