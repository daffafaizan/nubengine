      apnea is the most common form of sleep disordered breathing and patients with sleep apnea are
      at increased risk of developing high blood pressure. Intermittent, repeated exposures to low
      oxygen during sleep (intermittent hypoxia, IH) has been implicated as the primary stimulus
      for increases in sympathetic nervous system activity and blood pressure with sleep apnea.
      Interestingly there are some reports of a lower incidence of hypertension in women with sleep
      apnea when compared to men. Results from the present study will provide information important
      to the investigator's understanding of potential sex-differences in clinical outcomes for
      conditions related to acute/chronic hypoxia and may have important implications for
      treatments which may improve blood pressure control in patients with sleep apnea.
