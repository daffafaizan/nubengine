    
      AMENDED: Based on safety established in the first dosing phase of 52 weeks and long term
      dosing data in adults, the dosing period will be extended to 104 weeks. Original design:
      Information presently available indicates that ddI has high antiviral activity with less
      apparent toxicity than zidovudine (AZT) (the drug presently used to treat AIDS).

      AMENDED: Dosing will proceed for 104 weeks at each dose level. Original design: Five patients
      are treated at the initial dose level. Because ddI is not stable in the acid environment of
      the stomach, oral doses of ddI follow administration of an antacid. An alternative method of
      dosing is to mix the reconstituted ddI with an appropriate volume of Maalox TC or Mylanta II.
      In order to determine the MTD, successive groups of 5 patients enter the study at a higher
      dose level after 3 patients have experienced 3 weeks of dosing and significant toxicities
      have not developed. Patients are assigned to treatment groups in the order in which they are
      enrolled. Dosing proceeds for 16 weeks at each dose level. However, consideration is given to
      escalating patients entered at the lowest dose to the next dose level after 10 weeks of
      dosing. The dose escalation continues until toxicities requiring dose modifications are found
      in 2 of 5 in any group.
