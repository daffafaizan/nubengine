      tunnelised socket preservation technique utilising long term resorbable membranes and
      connective tissue grafting was used for extraction site development (XSD). The novel
      technique was evaluated in a retrospective comparative case series study including a total of
      54 extraction sites. In the test group, out of 33 single rooted teeth, 29 in the maxilla and
      4 in the mandible were removed, extractions sites were treated by the XSD method. Out of 33
      teeth, 27 were incisors, 2 canines and 4 premolars. In the control group, out of 21 single
      rooted teeth, 11 in the maxilla and 10 in the mandible were extracted and left for
      spontaneous healing. Out of 21 teeth, 13 were incisors, 2 canines and 6 premolars. CBCT scans
      were taken prior to tooth extraction and 6-9 months later in both groups. Radiographic
      evaluation was carried out using the I-CAT Vision (Imaging Sciences International, LLC;
      Hatfield, USA) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) softwares. Following manual
      alignment of CBCTs vertical and horizontal linear measurements as well as planimetric
      measurements of cross-section areas were performed in pre- and postoperative data sets at the
      extraction sites.
