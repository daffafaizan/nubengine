      cohort. Subjects will remain at the study center from Day -1 until discharge approximately 24
      hours after dosing (Day 2) for pharmacokinetic, safety, and pharmacodynamic assessments;
      however, all subjects who receive any investigational product, including any subjects who
      prematurely withdraw from the study, will remain at the study center for a minimum of 4 hours
      after dosing. A 15-day follow-up visit will be conducted 15 to 20 days postdose. The study
      will be considered completed for a subject at the time he/she completes the 15-day follow-up
      visit.
