      be enrolled. At baseline visit (V1) eligible subjects will then randomly assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups: HYALODISC + PEP (Group 1) or PEP alone (Group 2). At baseline visit (V1)
      HYALODISC (8 mg/ml) will be administered to group 1. The investigator will use one syringe
      for each involved disc, up to a maximum of three discs. The maximum volume that could be
      injected is 1.5 mL for each disc involved.

      The PEP session will start for both groups one week after V1. Randomized subjects will follow
      the instructions during the PEP session, for a total of 18 sessions that will be performed
      under supervision of physiotherapist twice a week in the first seven weeks (weeks 2-8) and
      once a week in the next four weeks (weeks 9-12). Twelve repetitions of each exercise for 3
      sets will be performed during PEP session. Moreover, all patients will be instructed how to
      continue these exercises at home, where the execution will be once a week in the first seven
      weeks (weeks 2-8) and twice a week in the next four weeks (weeks 9-12). Patients in group 2
      that still present low back pain score > 6, despite the PEP, at the physical examination at
      V3 (12 weeks after V1), could be treated with HYALODISC intradiscally. Those patients will be
      then evaluated at 12 weeks after the treatment (week 24).

      Follow-up visits are set at 4, 12 and 24 weeks (V2, V3 and V4)
