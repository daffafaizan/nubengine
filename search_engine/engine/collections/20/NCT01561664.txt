      inflammation regulation and to insulin response through TLR 4 pathway regulation in obesity.
      The investigators main purpose is to compare innate immunity activation pathway between
      insulin sensitive, insulin resistant obese patients and control patients. Insulin sensitive
      and insulin resistant obese patients will be distinguish thanks to the HOMA ir index. The
      investigators second objectives are to evaluate if the degree of inflammation in adipose
      tissue and squeletal muscle is correlated to insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinemic
      euglycemic clamp and to characterise inflammatory pathway and regulation pathway. A special
      focus will be given to the leukotrienes and their potential role in insulin resistance
      pathogenesis. The investigators will have two approaches:- characterisation of subjects with
      normal weight, of obese insulin sensitive and obese insulin resistant through a metabolic
      evaluation, an inflammatory characterisation and a measure of insulin sensitivity at the
      systemic level, in adipose tissue and in squeletal muscle.- an in vitron approach with human
      myoblast and adipocytes culture, extracted from the investigators patients: characterisation
      of inflammation, innate immunity.
