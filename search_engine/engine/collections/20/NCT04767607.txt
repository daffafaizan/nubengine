      chemotherapy regiments include cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines and a taxane. These
      treatments can adversely affect ovarian function across the lifespan, causing premature
      menopause, infertility, and POI. AMH is currently the most robust marker of prediction of
      ovarian injury in cancer patients during chemotherapy in compare with other sexual hormone
      marker (such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B) and ovarian volume, and is a
      more convenient way of prediction of ovarian reserve compare antral follicle count (AFC). But
      most of the patients' AMH levels become undetectable (using common AMH kits) after several
      cycle of chemotherapy, and some of these patients' AMH levels will maintained at a low level
      after chemotherapy, while others will recover. Using the ultrasensitive AMH detection method
      is expected to accurately assess the ovarian reserve during the chemotherapy treatment,
      predicting the risk of ovarian failure, and providing patients with ovarian and fertility
      function protection recommendations, such as using GnRHa regents during treatment and
      providing assisted reproductive technology consultants.
