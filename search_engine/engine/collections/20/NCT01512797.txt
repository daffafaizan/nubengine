    
      Januvia (sitagliptin phosphate 100mg) is an FDA approved medication for the treatment of Type
      2 Diabetes. Sitagliptin works by inhibiting the Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme, resulting in
      increased active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. GLP-1 is an incretin which increases
      post-prandial insulin secretion. Because Gastric Bypass has also been shown to increase GLP-1
      levels, this study seeks to determine the additional effect of DDP-4 inhibition on glucose
      control in patients who have elevated incretin levels post Gastric Bypass. The study will
      also assess if Januvia (Sitagliptin phosphate) is safe and well tolerated in patients after
      Gastric Bypass.

      Recruitment and data collection for this study was started at St. Luke's Hospital in New
      York, NY and later moved to Columbia University Medical Center in New York, NY.
