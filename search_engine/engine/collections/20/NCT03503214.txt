      understanding their pathophysiology can be important to improve clinical treatment.

      The human body is protected against acid-base disorders by several compensatory mechanisms
      that minimize pH variations in response to acid-base derangements.

      The present study focuses on the acute compensatory mechanisms of respiratory acid-base
      derangements, i.e., respiratory acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. In this case the
      non-carbonic buffers are constituted by albumin and phosphates in plasma, with the addition
      of hemoglobin in whole blood.

      Aim of the present in-vitro study is to measure the buffer power of non-carbonic weak acids
      contained in whole blood and isolated plasma, assess the relative contribution of red blood
      cells and plasma proteins and perform a comparison between septic patients and healthy
      controls.
