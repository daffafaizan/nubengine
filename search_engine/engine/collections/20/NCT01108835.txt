    
      Design: A randomised controlled trial of patients discharged from hospital after an episode
      of acute exacerbation of COPD. Patients will be randomised to the intervention arm or usual
      care group.

      Setting: Tertiary University affiliated Hospital.

      Interventions:

      The Intervention group will receive a comprehensive programme which involves inputs from
      doctors, respiratory nurses and physiotherapists, providing an individualized care plan for
      each subject. The components in the programme will include optimization of medications,
      specialist physician follow up, nursing support in education, and physiotherapist support for
      pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients in the intervention group will also receive monthly
      telephone calls by a respiratory nurse for a period of 1 year to assess their conditions and
      answer their queries. Patients will also be followed up in the respiratory clinic by
      respiratory specialist once every 3 months for 1 year.

      The control group will be managed as the usual care. The discharging physician will determine
      the patients' medication and follow up as in normal practice.

      All patients will be asked to return for assessments (spirometry, 6 minute walk test,
      questionnaires on the severity of dyspnoea and quality of life) at baseline and 12 months

      Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint is the hospital readmission rate and the
      secondary endpoints are the quality of life, mortality, lung function and exercise capacity
      of the patients.
