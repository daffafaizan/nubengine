    
      Subjects with essential hypertension controlled on 1 or 2 antihypertensive medications or
      uncontrolled on 0-2 antihypertensive medications will be included in the RADIANCE Solo cohort
      while subjects with treatment resistant hypertension on a minimum of 3 antihypertensive
      medications will be included in the RADIANCE Trio cohort. Prior to randomization, subjects
      will be hypertensive in the absence of hypertension medication (SOLO) or despite the presence
      of a stabilized, single pill, triple, fixed dose antihypertensive medication regimen (TRIO).
