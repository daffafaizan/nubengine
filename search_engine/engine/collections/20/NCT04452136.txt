      Provide participants with prostate cancer access to 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC to localize the site of
      potential metastatic or recurrent disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Eligible participants will be intravenously administered 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC at a dose of 3-7
      mCi (111 - 259 MBq), target 5 mCi. The estimated uptake time of the study agent is 75 minutes
      Â± 25 minutes. The targeted uptake time is 60 minutes, with an acceptable range of 50-100
      minutes. Following the PET scan with the study agent, participants will undergo either
      surgical management or treatment for metastatic disease in accordance with institutional
      standards.

      Patients will be observed for 2 hours after injection of the radiotracer, and will be
      followed-up 1-3 days post injection with a phone call.
