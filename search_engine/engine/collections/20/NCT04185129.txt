      statements stating that the small airway is caused by asthma and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Both pathogenesis and treatment play an important role. The small
      airway is an airway with diameter less than 2 mm and is one of the main sites where airflow
      obstruction occurs. Small particles (<2 Î¼m) and large particles are more likely to deposit in
      the distal airways, and have shown to have better effects on asthma and pulmonary
      obstruction. At the same time, real-life research has also shown that extra-fine particles
      provide better asthma control than large particles, and can better improve quality of
      life.The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of asthma inhalers between extra-fine
      particles and non-extra-fine particles.
