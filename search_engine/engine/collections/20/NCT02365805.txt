      Response of breast cancer to NAC is correlated with survival: patients who obtain greatest
      survival advantage are those who attain complete response of their primary tumor.BReast
      Cancer 1 (BRCA1) plays a crucial role in DNA repair. Associations between BRCA1 mRNA
      expression and sensitivity to platinum and/or resistance to taxanes are previously
      documented. Improving complete response rates with NAC we can improve outcomes in breast
      cancer. If we establish biomarkers which predict better response we may optimized treatment
      by individualized breast cancer care. Therefore, we propose a two-arm, randomized,
      multi-centre, open-label phase II study. The study will compare the efficacy and tolerability
      of NAC customized by BRCA 1 levels versus standard chemotherapy, being pathological complete
      response the primary endpoint. Women with primary Her-2 negative breast cancer who have not
      undergone previous treatment for invasive breast cancer will be randomized to receive the
      following: Treatment Arm 1 (standard therapy): 5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and
      Cyclophosphamide day 1 every 3 weeks per three cycles; Treatment Arm 2: Patients with low
      levels of BRCA1 mRNA will receive Epirubicin and Cisplatin day 1 every 3 weeks and
      5-Fluorouracil for three cycles; And patients with high levels of BRCA1 will receive
      docetaxel day 1 every three weeks per three cycles. Definitive surgery will be performed
      within 4 weeks after the last cycle.
