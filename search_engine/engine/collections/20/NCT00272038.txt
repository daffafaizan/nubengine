      toxicity of single agent Tarceva in chemotherapy-naive AIPC patients. Patients will receive
      single agent Tarceva at 150 mg daily without interruption until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or investigator's discretion. Eligible patients are those with
      documented prostate cancer (regardless of Gleason Score) who are considered hormone
      refractory as defined below. All patients must fail an anti-androgen withdrawal trial if they
      were already on such therapy. If patients were on LHRH analogues alone, they must fail the
      addition of an anti-androgen before being classified as hormone refractory. All patients must
      have adequate organ functions as specified below and have an ECOG performance status of 2 or
      less. It is hypothesized that 25 patients will be needed to adequately assess the activity of
      Tarceva in AIPC.

      The activity of Tarceva in other malignancies has been demonstrated with dosed ranging from
      100 to 150 mg daily. It is acceptable not to interrupt therapy unless toxicity occurs of
      disease progression is documented. Starting patients at 150 mg daily seems to be the most
      logical step, but dose reductions will be implemented based on side effects and adverse
      events.
