      evaluate side effects and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for
      future studies when administered in combination with five other medications. This study was
      to assess the safety of MLN2480 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants
      with solid nonhematologic malignancies who have failed standard therapies.

      The study was to be conducted in two phases, the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion
      phase. A total of 71 participants were enrolled in the escalation phase. Participants in this
      phase were assigned to one of the five treatment groups:

        -  MLN2480 + MLN0128

        -  MLN2480 + Alisertib

        -  MLN2480 + Paclitaxel

        -  MLN2480 + Cetuximab

        -  MLN2480 + Irinotecan

      Once the MTD for each combination treatment arm was established in the escalation phase, one
      or more of the combination treatments will be selected for the expansion phase. A total of 10
      participants were enrolled in the expansion phase.

      This multi-centre trial was be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 14 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic including
      an end of study visit 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
