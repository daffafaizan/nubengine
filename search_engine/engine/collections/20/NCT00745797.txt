           metastases (BM) and improves survival in patients with extensive disease small cell lung
           cancer after a response to chemotherapy .

        2. PCI has also demonstrated to reduce or delay the incidence of CNS failure in non small
           cell lung cancer patients after primary therapy.

        3. But its impact on overall and disease free survival is uncertain.
