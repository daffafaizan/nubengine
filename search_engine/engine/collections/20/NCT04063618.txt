      These injuries have become the focus of the sports world, as coaches, trainers, and medical
      personnel are more vigilant than ever in screening for concussions. Once diagnosed, return to
      play is dependent on recovery from symptoms followed by a specific protocol for clearance;
      the sooner the symptoms subside the sooner the protocol is initiated. Osteopathic
      Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a low risk procedure that has minimal side effects and has been
      used to decrease both headache intensity and frequency. With the main subjective symptom
      tracked for concussion being headache, OMT can be used to decrease the severity and the
      duration of this symptom. In a prospective superiority comparison between standard of care
      for concussion (rest and return to play protocol) and a single OMT treatment in combination
      with standard therapy, we hypothesize that OMT decreases symptom duration and severity of
      headache in concussion management.
