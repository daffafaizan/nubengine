    
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the temporal course of recovery of CB1R
      availability and neural oscillations, in cannabis-dependent individuals at baseline,
      following 48 hour confirmed inpatient abstinence and after four weeks confirmed outpatient
      abstinence (confirmed by tracking creatinine adjusted urine THC-COOH levels). This research
      will also examine associations between CB1R availability, neural oscillations and cognitive
      function using [11-C]OMAR PET imaging and electroencephalography.
