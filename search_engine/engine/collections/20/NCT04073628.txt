      intervention on sleep physiology and sleep-dependent cognitive processes in mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The premise is that older
      adults, especially those with cognitive impairment, are often in continuous dim light, which
      leads to circadian misalignment. Circadian misalignment impacts the close relationship
      between homeostatic and circadian processes, which can reduce memory-related sleep features.
      The hypothesis is that a lighting intervention technology (LIT), designed to promote
      circadian entrainment, will improve sleep by aligning the two sleep processes (circadian and
      homeostatic) and, thus improve cognition. In addition to improving patients' lives, LIT has
      the potential to reduce the overnight burden on caregivers. Thus, an exploratory goal is to
      also measure the impact of LIT on caregivers' sleep, cognition, depression, and quality of
      life.
