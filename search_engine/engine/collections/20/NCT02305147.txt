      controls, and subjects at risk to develop PD (idiopathic Rem Behavior Disorder -iRBD, and
      probants of patients with PD genetically confirmed).

      All subjects will be comprehensively assessed at baseline and every year thereafter. Subjects
      will undergo clinical (motor, neuropsychiatric, sleep, ocular and cognitive evaluations) and
      imaging assessments. Blood (including a DNA sample), stools, skin biopsy and cerebral spinal
      fluid (CSF) samples will be collected.
