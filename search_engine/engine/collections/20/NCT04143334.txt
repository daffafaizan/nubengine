      visual impairment, blindness and major causes in adults age 50 years old and above in Chaonan
      County of Guangdong province, where one of the Project Vision Charity Eye center was founded

      cataract surgery service in Chaonan. we will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Rapid
      Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) comparison with conventional survey. . It will
