        -  Identify human colon neoplasia susceptibility genes in patients with colon cancer or
           adenomatous polyps.

        -  Correlate the inheritance of novel susceptibility alleles for adenomatous polyposis of
           the colon with colon neoplasia in these patients.

        -  Correlate colon neoplasia susceptibility with the presence of COX-2, sPLA2, and DNMT
           genes in these patients.

        -  Identify a novel gene that governs increased susceptibility to colon adenoma and cancer
           in the genome of these patients.
