    
      * Study type: Interventional. Randomized comparative clinical trial..

        -  Outcome measures:

             -  Primary study outcomes: Patient reported outcomes: 1. Pain score and use of
                painkillers, assessed with a numeric rating scale (NRS) of pain. 2. Treatment
                satisfaction, assessed with a NRS of satisfaction. 3. Health related quality of
                life, assessed with Dutch translated Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ)
                and EQ-5D questionnaire.

             -  Secondary study outcomes: 1. Number of patients with adverse events. Major
                complications: deep and superficial venous thrombosis (embolic events), nerve
                injury, skin burns, and (sub)cutaneous infections. Minor complications: ecchymosis
                and hyperpigmentation. 2. Obliteration of varicose vein and/or absence of reflux (>
                0.5 sec. of retrograde flow) along the treated segment of the GSV. This is measured
                using US examination.

        -  Outcome measures time frame:

      Follow-up of one year, with outcome measures at baseline, 1 week, 3 months and 1 year post
      treatment.

      * Focus of the study: Varicose great saphenous veins (GSV)

        -  Intervention information:

             -  Intervention name: endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)

             -  Intervention type: 1. EVLA with 940 nm Diode laser 2. EVLA with 1470 nm Nd:Yag
                laser
