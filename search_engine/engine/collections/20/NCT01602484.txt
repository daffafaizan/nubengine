      hour of OR time costs approximately $500, exclusive of supply and personnel costs. Many
      things contribute to the amount of time a surgical procedure takes. One of these is
      application of the post surgical immobilization required of almost all orthopedic surgery
      cases. Custom molded Plaster-of-Paris splints are used for immobilization after the vast
      majority of orthopedic foot and ankle procedures. They have many advantages including exact
      fit for each patient, low cost and excellent safety profile. Traditionally these splints are
      constructed from bulk supplies at the end of surgical cases. The collection, measurement and
      organization of the component materials require the circulating nurse or surgeon to devote
      time to these tasks. This necessarily precludes OR staff from performing other tasks in the
      OR and lengthens the overall case duration. By lengthening the duration of the case more cost
      is incurred. The total number of cases able to be completed in a single operative day may
      also be diminished by the aggregate increased case time. Recently, the investigators have
      started utilizing prepared splint packs containing all components necessary for single
      plaster-of-Paris splint applications. This alternative to the traditional method of splint
      application has minimal expense over that incurred with traditional methods. Pilot studies
      have shown that the use of these splint packs diminish the time of application by 50 percent.
