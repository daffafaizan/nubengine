      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sirolimus followed by durvalumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment II. To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus followed by durvalumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment for stage I, II, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus in combination with durvalumab as neoadjuvant
      treatment for stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC II. To evaluate response to sirolimus in
      combination with durvalumab in patients with PD-L1-positive versus (vs.) PD-L1-negative
      tumors III. To evaluate the association between blood mutation burden and response to
      sirolimus and durvalumab

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune-mediated effects of combination sirolimus and durvalumab II. To
      investigate tumor and immune microenvironment changes in tissue samples

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Starting on day 22, patients receive durvalumab
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour. Treatment with durvalumab repeats every 21 days for up to 2
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within a 2-3 week
      period after the second dose of durvalumab, but not earlier than two weeks after the
      administration of durvalumab, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
