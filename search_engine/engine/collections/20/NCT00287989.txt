        -  Compare the major objective response (complete and partial response) rates in patients
           with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with high- versus
           low-dose erlotinib hydrochloride combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

        -  Compare the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Characterize and compare the toxicities of these regimens.

        -  Determine the recommended phase III dose of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral high-dose erlotinib hydrochloride on days 1 and 2. Patients
           also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
           day 3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral low-dose erlotinib hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and
           carboplatin as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients will be accrued for this study.
