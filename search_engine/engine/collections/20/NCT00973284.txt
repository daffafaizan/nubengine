      vaccine. Norwalk VLP vaccine is being tested to prevent viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE).
      This study will look at the illness rate of AGE in people who are administered the Norwalk
      VLP vaccine.

      The study enrolled 98 patients and was conducted in 2 stages: the Vaccination Stage and the
      Challenge Stage. In the Vaccination Stage participants were randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Norwalk VLP Vaccine (100 Âµg VLP) intranasally

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive powder) - this is a powder that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient During the Challenge Stage participants were administered live
           Norwalk virus and were monitored for AGE.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 29 weeks Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and were
      contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
