      before implant placement . In this study we assessed the efficacy of tenting the periosteum
      and soft tissue matrix with titanium screws maintaining a space for the graft material in
      order to augment large vertical defects of mandibular ridge (anterior or posterior region)
      using data from 12 patients . After 6 months we assessed the increase in bone height and
      density.
