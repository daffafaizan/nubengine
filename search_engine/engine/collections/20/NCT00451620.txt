      in elderly people with diabetes than younger people and is the best predictor of mortality
      and morbidity. Studies in younger people with diabetes have shown that in response to a meal,
      insulin profiles are more physiologic and glucose levels are lower with GlucoNorm than with
      Glyburide. There is no data available that demonstrates this in elderly people with type 2
      diabetes.

      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Subjects will undergo 2 Standard Meal
      Tests with Ensure 325 ml separated by 15 - 30 days. Group 1 will receive GlucoNorm 1 mg
      during the 1st Standard Meal Test and Glyburide 2.5 mg during the 2nd Standard Meal Test.
      Group 2 will receive Glyburide 2.5 mg during the 1st Standard Meal Test and GlucoNorm 1mg
      during the 2nd Standard Meal Test.
