    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of two intranasal doses of LAIV
      A/17/California/66/395 (H2N2) in healthy adults in Russia. A(H2N2) viruses which are
      antigenically similar to the pandemic strain A/Singapore/1/57, continue to circulate in
      domestic and wild bird populations, as confirmed by routine moniÂ¬toring of avian influenza
      viruses.

      40 adults aged 18-40 will be enrolled. They will be randomized to receive vaccine or placebo.
      Blood and urine will be collected during the week following each vaccination and before the
      next vaccination to monitor safety. Blood samples will also be collected at several
      timepoints to assess the volunteer's immune response to the vaccine. The total duration of
      the study is 16 weeks for each volunteer.
