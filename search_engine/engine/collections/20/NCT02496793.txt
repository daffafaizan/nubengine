      maternal-to-child HIV transmission (MCH/PMTCT) services, the investigators conducted a
      community-based peer facilitator intervention study in Hurungwe District of Zimbabwe. Using a
      paired community randomized design, 16 health facility-linked communities were randomly
      allocated to the intervention or control condition, with a total of approximately 1,600
      pregnant and lactating women, (100 women in each community), recruited into the study. In the
      intervention communities, 24 trained peer facilitators (3 in each community) using
      participatory educational approaches were encouraging women to form antenatal and post-natal
      groups, and to utilize and adhere to MCH/PMTCT services and recommendations.

      Peer facilitators, by the definition of this project, were women from the community who were
      peers to pregnant and lactating women; who had recently been through the process themselves
      and could speak to their experience. A key activity of the community-based peer facilitators
      was the encouragement of the formation of women into groups, and the participation of these
      women into antenatal care (ANC), prevention of maternal to child transmission (PMTCT), and
      postnatal care (PNC) programs. The group process was enable solidarity and support among the
      women at the vulnerable times of pregnancy and lactation.
