      contributing factor to reduced exercise capacity, health related quality of life and
      increased mortality associated with this disease. Several structural changes in the limb
      muscles of patients have previously been reported and have been linked to the known
      reductions in muscle strength and endurance commonly reported in COPD. Muscle dysfunction,
      lower extremity muscle strength, and muscle fatigue also contribute to the intensity of
      dyspnea and the ability to sustain exercise mostly through stimulation of type III and IV
      muscle afferents. As such, many patients who primarily perform aerobic exercise training as
      part of pulmonary rehabilitation are unable to tolerate the intensity and/or volume of
      exercise required to achieve clinically important changes in exercise capacity or symptom
      relief. Resistance training (RT) is an attractive exercise modality for patients with COPD
      because it is efficacious and often more tolerable initially. To our knowledge no one has
      examined whether similar benefits to those elicited by longer RT programs can be attained in
      just 4 weeks using multi-joint, multi-muscle exercises and individualized progression. If a
      short term RT program can improve muscle quality, enhance endurance, and reduce type III and
      IV afferent activity then it would reduce the drive to breathe and thus dyspnea. These
      adaptations would likely translate into improved exercise tolerance making it feasible to
      "pre-habilitate" COPD patients with tolerable RT, allowing them to achieve a higher
      volume/intensity of endurance training, thus making pulmonary rehabilitation more effective.
