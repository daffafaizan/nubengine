      spinal needle can provide an acceptable flow rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when compared
      to the traditionally used 22 gauge needle.

      Smaller needles, according to The Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the
      American Academy of Neurology are 'associated with reduced frequency of post-lumbar puncture
      headache (Level A recommendation).'

      Given that flow rate of CSF is the limiting factor when choosing a spinal needle gauge, two
      previous studies have compared various needle sizes for adequacy of flow. These studies,
      however, have important limitations and have not led to a clear consensus in clinical
      practice. For instance, one study used a 0,9 % solution of sodium chloride at room
      temperature, the other used an 'artificial CSF solution' of unknown viscosity and nature.

      Patients referred to the neurological day center of the Montreal Neurological
      Institute/Hospital for lumbar puncture will be recruited to the study. Participants will be
      randomized to have the puncture with a Whitacre 22 or 24 gauge needle.
