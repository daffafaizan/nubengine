      in the cathlab. These measurements are performed on a daily basis. The following paragraph
      will explain these routine measurements briefly.

      Short description of the procedure Coronary angiography, PCI (if indicated), and physiologic
      measurements are performed completely according to normal routine. Physiologic measurements
      may include FFR, NHPR, IMR, CFR, absolute flow (Q) and microcirculatory resistance (Rmicro or
      MRR) measurement.

      Intention to measure Q and Rmicro are mandatory to be included in this registry.

      If there is failure to measure Q and/or Rmicro , it should be carefully noted including the
      reason for failure.

      Coronary physiologic measurements may be performed either prior or after PCI, if applicable.
      If they are performed before PCI, it is recommended (according to Good Clinical Practice) but
      not absolutely mandatory to repeat these measurements also after PCI.

      As said, the invasive procedure itself, including all measurements, should be performed
      completely according to clinical routine. Use of drugs either during or after the procedure
      should also exactly identical to normal routine.
