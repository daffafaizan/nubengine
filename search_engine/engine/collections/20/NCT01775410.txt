    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single arm feasibility trial of the
      Wolverine OCT guided atherectomy system. The trial is predominantly descriptive and, as such,
      not powered statistically although endpoint comparisons may be made to the published
      literature on peripheral atherectomy.

      The trial will enroll up to 50 subjects diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease of the
      lower extremities. The primary disease must be located in reference vessel diameters â‰¥ 3.0 mm
      which is significant enough to cause moderate to severe symptoms and warrant vascular
      intervention. Trial success is focused on short term safety including rates of major adverse
      events. An evaluation of efficacy will also be performed and will include an evaluation of
      technical success defined as the percent of target lesions that has a residual diameter
      stenosis <50% post the Wolverine device alone as assessed by an independent review at the
      time of treatment using quantitative angiography or visual estimate.
