        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of fludarabine when administered
           with UCN-01 in patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade or indolent lymphoid
           malignancies.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fludarabine.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 72 hours on days 1-3 alone during course 1 and over 36 hours
      on days 1-2 during courses 2-7. Patients also receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes
      beginning on day 1 and continuing for up to 5 days during courses 2-7. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every
      6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
