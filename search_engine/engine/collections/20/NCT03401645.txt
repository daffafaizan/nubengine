      consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recommendations have been published that
      encourage clinicians to include upper extremity retraining within the TBI population;
      however, very little research exists that will help inform treatments for this population.
      There is urgency to broaden the scientific evidence critical to informing upper limb
      rehabilitation for TBI survivors. The proposed study will do just that by using a
      task-specific visuomotor exercise protocol that emphasizes upper limb movements which can be
      practiced by patients in their homes. This new home-based arm and hand exercise (HAHE)
      protocol is expected to improve functional recovery and quality of life among individuals
      with chronic upper limb impairment after moderate-to-severe TBI.
