    
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open label, multi-center, safety, clinical activity, pharmacokinetic
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of combinations of avelumab, binimetinib and
      talazoparib in adult patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other
      locally advanced or metastatic KRAS- or NRAS-mutant solid tumors.

      The Phase 1b part of this study will initially assess doublet drug combinations to determine
      a recommended dose for further investigation. Following this, the recommended dose for the
      combination of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib (triplet) will be determined. The
      recommended doses for the doublet and triplet combinations will be used in the Phase 2 part
      of the study, which will assess the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the study
      treatments.
