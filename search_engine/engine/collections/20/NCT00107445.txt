      I. Correlate the level of EF5 binding with pre-treatment hemoglobin level and tumor grade and
      stage in patients undergoing surgery or biopsy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian
      epithelial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate pre-treatment tumor hypoxia (as measured by EF5 binding) with time to
      progression and time to recurrence in these patients.

      II. Correlate EF5 binding with CD-31 expression (tumor vasculature), Ki-67 expression
      (cellular proliferation), and erythropoietin signaling in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2Â½ hours on day 1. Approximately 1-2 days later, patients
      undergo tumor resection or biopsy. Patients' tumor tissue samples undergo
      immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to detect EF5 binding levels. Patients' blood is
      drawn immediately before and 30-60 minutes and 1-2 days after receiving EF5 to measure
      systemic EF5 binding levels.

      Patients are followed at 30-45 days after administration of EF5 and then every 3-6 months
      thereafter.
