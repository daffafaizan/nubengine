      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate final pathology post-operatively for histopathology confirmation of
      multiparametric MRI targets detected during treatment planning. This will be accomplished by
      using transperineal biopsies obtained prior to interstitial brachytherapy during the
      procedure, while under anesthetic just prior to the placement of the brachytherapy needles
      and sources.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the ability of the Uronav system in a transperineal setting to guide
      biopsy needle placement using the electromagnetic guidance system and transperineal
      ultrasound probe stabilization device and stepper.
