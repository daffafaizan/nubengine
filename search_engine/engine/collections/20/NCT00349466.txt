    
      At a Screening Visit, patients who provide written informed consent will have screening
      procedures performed, including a complete medical history, medication history, physical
      examination, including height, weight, sitting blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature,
      and clinical laboratory tests. Disease activity will be assessed using tear meniscus (TM)
      height, tear break-up time (BUT), fluorescein staining (FS), Schirmer test, and the Dry Eye
      Symptom Score (DESS). Doses of artificial tears must be stable for >2 weeks prior to the
      Screening Visit.

      Eligible patients will begin a 2-week run-in period, during which time they will be
      instructed to discontinue use of all topical ophthalmic medications except for lubricant eye
      drops. Patients who successfully complete the 2-week run-in period will be randomized to
      their assigned medication (CF101 1 mg or matching placebo) to be taken orally every q12h for
      12 weeks. Patients will return for assessments and a new supply of study medication at Weeks
      2, 4, 8 and 12, and at Week 14 for a final follow-up assessment.
