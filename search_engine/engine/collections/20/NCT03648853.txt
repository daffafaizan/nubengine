      random order in patients who are under general anesthesia. Tetanic stimuli are used routinely
      during general anesthesia to assess effectiveness of neuromuscular blockade. These tetanic
      stimuli are noxious stimuli that elicit a stress response which can be quantified using
      photoplethysmography. This study investigates if the magnitude of the tetanus induced stress
      response is dependent on the location of the tetanic stimulus as measured by
      photoplythysmography.
