      returning genomic aberration results in blood and/or tissue using the Oncomine Precision
      Assay in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Up to 200 patients with stage IIIb/IV
      NSCLC will consent to have their blood and tissue profiled on the Oncomine Precision Assay. A
      baseline plasma sample will be collected for all patients, of which up to 100 patients will
      have a tissue sample collected from pathology archives or planned biopsy or surgery.
