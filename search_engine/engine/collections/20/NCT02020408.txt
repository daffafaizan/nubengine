      appetitive behaviours in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), through effects on
      inhibitory and reward neural pathways. To avoid the confounding effects of malnutrition, and
      because they have behaviours and neural circuit alterations relevant for this study, we will
      study 25 recovered (REC) restricting-type AN, 25 REC bulimic-type AN (AN-BN), 25 REC BN, and
      25 control women (CW). This 5 year study, of women 18 to 45 years old, will employ positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging with radioligands for the 5-HT transporter ([11C]DASB) and
      DA D2/D3 receptors ([11C]raclopride).
