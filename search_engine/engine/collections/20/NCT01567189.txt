      usually develops by group in the hospital or in a gym, are problems of access to hospital,
      disgust for participating in a group activity and problems in reconciling their work and / or
      home with the program schedule. These problems could be overcome by outcome cardiac
      rehabilitation and thus could increase the number of patients benefit from treatment in
      either the environment extra or intra-hospital.

      Low and medium coronary patients sent to cardiac rehabilitation program at our center within
      the first 12 weeks after presenting with acute coronary syndrome or been revascularized will
      be included in the study. The prescription of intensity of effort is based on heart rate
      reached during the stress test for the initial evaluation in all cases, although at
      home-program heart rate will be monitored using heart rate monitor and / or by the Borg
      scale. In this way outpatient group patient could performed training sessions individually
      and at the time of day that best suits their capabilities. The other program components:
      control of risk factors, health education and counseling will be identical in both groups of
      patients.
