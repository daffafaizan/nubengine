      squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Results for the treatment of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus are conflicting.

      In this multicenter prospective registry among 7 French centers, all consecutive patients
      with early Barrett's neoplasia of 15 mm or more in size treated by endoscopic submucosal
      dissection will be included in the registry. The primary objective is to assess the quality
      of the resection by ESD of early Barrett's neoplasia (T1A or T1B sm1 or high grade
      dysplasia). Secondary endpoints are to assess the combined efficacy of a treatment
      associating ESD and radiofrequency ablation of the remaining Barrett esophagus, and to assess
      the durability of the results after 3 years.
