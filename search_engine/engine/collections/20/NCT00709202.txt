      individuals who have been psychiatrically stabilized on first or second generation
      antipsychotic medication, and have gained substantial weight during their treatment. Subjects
      were excluded if they have asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases which may be exacerbated by
      a histamine analog) or are prescribed medications known to affect body composition or
      metabolism other than those currently being studied. Subjects were randomized to receive
      either betahistine or placebo at a 1:1 ratio.
