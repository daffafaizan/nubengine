      and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits, as well as adapted cancer screening educational
      materials, by mail to 110 women who are out-of-date for both cervical and colorectal cancer
      screenings, recruited through federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in rural, segregated
      counties of Pennsylvania. Additionally, the investigators will conduct baseline and follow-up
      surveys to assess short-term changes in environment- and person-level factors associated with
      screening, and intervention feasibility (e.g., acceptability). A control group of 110 women,
      also recruited through FQHCs in rural, segregated counties of Pennsylvania, will be used for
      comparison; these women will receive standard-of-care reminders for cancer screening and
      complete the baseline and follow-up surveys.

      The hypothesis is that delivering self-sampling HPV tests and FIT, as well as adapted
      educational materials, to women in rural, segregated areas could help overcome environment-
      and person-level barriers and thereby increase cancer screening, reduce geographic cancer
      disparities, and improve public health.
