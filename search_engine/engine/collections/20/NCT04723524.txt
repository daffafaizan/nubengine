      day, in which 5th day and 10th day are follow-up points. The subject could check out at 10th
      day when the RT-PCR test becomes negative and asymptomatic. Patients will be assessed by
      using seven-category ordinal scale and clinical signs and symptoms on 1st, 5th and 10th day.
      If the subject recovers and checks out within 10 days, they will be recorded once before
      checking out. All effectiveness and safety inspection items will be done once before the
      trial and once at each follow-up point i.e. 5th or/and 10th day. In case of positive RT-PCR
      test on 2nd follow-up (10th day), 3rd follow-up for RT-PCR test on 15th day will be planned.
