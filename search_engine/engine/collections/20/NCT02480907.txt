      basis. This challenge seems to put a heavy burden on most caregivers. Schmidt and Treasure
      (2006) argued that obsessive compulsive personality traits, emotional avoidance,
      pro-anorectic beliefs and responses of close others like dysfunctional communication styles
      impair the outcome. The construct of expressed emotions reflects on the amount of criticism,
      hostility and emotional over-involvement expressed by relatives of psychiatric patients
      towards them. A special program for parents is developed to equip caregivers with knowledge
      and skills to change maintaining factors and therefore improve the patient's outcome.
      Furthermore coping strategies are provided to help carers to reduce their burden. We start a
      randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions with a conventional group. We compare
      Workshops (Intervention Group 1), Internet-based (Intervention Group 2) and Conventional
      (Control Group) CarersÂ´ Support Groups. Before starting the intervention (T0, baseline), at
      the end of the intervention (T1) and 1 year after the intervention (T2, follow up)
      assessments will be conducted via questionnaires and interviews. Parents of 48 children and
      adolescents within the age group of 10-17 years suffering from anorexia or bulimia nervosa
      will be involved in each group, resulting in an overall sample size of 144. The investigators
      aim is to equip parents with knowledge and skills in order to support their children's
      recovery, prevent relapse and improve their own wellbeing. The long term goal is to provide
      low-threshold, cost-effective, time-efficient and superregional support for parents in the
      future.
