      III breast cancer survivors with lasting cognitive impairments subsequent to their first
      chemotherapy regimen. The usability component will uncover technical issues in its usability,
      as well as its rating on perceived usefulness. Data will also be collected on the ease of
      remote monitoring of the subjects by clinicians.

      This portion of the study is intended to provide information pertaining to the usability of
      the experimental system for remote integrative (cognitive and motor) therapy of breast cancer
      survivors (Stage II or III) with lasting chemotherapy related cognitive impairment (CRCI)
      subsequent to first chemotherapy regimen, living in the community.

      Specific aims are:

        1. testing of a added biosensors, new technology acceptance and ease of use at home by
           these individuals;

        2. a therapist console module and enhanced automatic session report that will allow remote
           monitoring of patient exercising and offline data processing and review.

      Participants will each perform 4 usability evaluation sessions. At the end of each session
      participants will fill a custom evaluation form, using 5-point Likert scale scoring. At the
      end of the last session participants will also fill a USE standardized usability evaluation
      form.
