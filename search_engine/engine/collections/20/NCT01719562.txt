    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To design an automated MRI hardware/software platform for measuring and reporting left
      ventricular (LV) function (volumes, strain, and ejection fraction [EF]), T1 myocardial
      signal, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV).

      II. To determine if pre- to 3 month post-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) changes
      in our MRI platform generated measures of LV volumes, EF, strain, myocardial T1, and aortic
      PWV predict pre- to 24 month post-Anth-bC differences in these same parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRI scans for LV function, T1 myocardial signal, and aortic PWV at baseline,
      3 months, and 24 months.

      Exercise Capacity Addendum Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To provide critical participant enrollment data necessary to accomplish the R01
           submission, including:

        -  Feasibility of screening, enrolling, and randomizing 21 Non or Hodgkin lymphoma and
           stage I-IV breast cancer patients including the reasons for failed randomization,

        -  Identification of barriers for participating in, or adhering to the Patient ES-AI and
           the Healthy Living Control Group.

      Secondary Objective:

      â€¢ In these 21 patients, at study initiation then 3 and 6 months after initiating Anth-bC or
      other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies, to assess the ability to ascertain: peak
      exercise cardiac output, calculated arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-V O2) and VO2 (maximum
      rate of oxygen), and pre-exercise measures of left ventricular and cognitive function,
      health-related quality of life, six-minute walk distance (6min WD) and fatigue. Ascertainment
      of the left ventricular function and health-related rate quality of life will be attempted in
      a manner similar to ascertainment of these variables from 47 individuals with lymphoma in the
      parent study.
