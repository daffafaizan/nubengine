      pediatric trials of acute pain therapeutics in children who are 0 to <3 years of age from a
      clinician's perspective. To identify these endpoints and outcomes the investigators will
      conduct remote qualitative concept elicitation interviews with 27 clinicians who treat
      pediatric patients. These interviews will include verbal consent to participate, a
      demographics questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview which will last approximately one
      hour. Interview questions will address the participant's professional experience recognizing
      and managing pain in children between 0 and 3 years of age. Interviews will be audio recorded
      and transcribed with the participant's permission. Transcripts and notes will be coded and
      analyzed. This is a minimal risk study; the investigators are only using standard interview
      procedures and are not collecting any protected health information from participants. While
      the investigators do not believe that any information collected would jeopardize the personal
      or professional standing of participants, all information will be kept strictly confidential
      per Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
