      been investigated for major depression associated with traumatic brain injury.

      This will be a prospective double-blind randomized sham-controlled crossover study. Patients
      in the treatment group will receive 20 sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and low-frequency rTMS over the right DLPFC. The DLPFC
      will be identified as target by using individual subject-level resting state network
      estimation (Hacker et al, 2013). Patients in the control group will receive 20 sham
      treatments designed to be visibly indistinguishable from active treatment, and will
      subsequently have the option to be crossed over to receive active treatment with the
      aforementioned protocol. A subgroup of patients in each group will receive more detailed
      diffusion imaging (diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis imaging) and resting state fMRI
      scans before and after the treatment in order to assess for changes in white matter integrity
      and functional connectivity associated with the treatment.
