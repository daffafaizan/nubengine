      systems,comprised of a main body (Aortic Trunk) and two legs (Ipsilateral Leg Endoprosthesis
      and a contralateral leg endoprosthesis). In placement of the endograft the main body and
      ipsilateral limb are deployed from a retrograde common femoral artery approach. From the
      contralateral femoral artery, cannulation of the contralateral gate is required to deploy the
      contralateral iliac limb.Cannulation of the contralateral limb gate is the portion of the
      operation that requires the most "wire skills." Depending on the patients' body type,
      angulations of the aorta and the size and volume of the AAA, this portion of the procedure
      can be technically difficult. This portion may become lengthy and discouraging if the surgeon
      fails to cannulate the gate using a particular approach. Cannulation of the contralateral
      limb gate from a retrograde femoral artery approach is commonly achieved by first using a
      maneuverable guidewire and steerable catheter. Antegrade or crossover cannulation involves
      passing a guidewire from the ipsilateral limb to the contralateral limb gate of the
      endograft, which can be accomplished with a curved catheter. The wire may be retrieved on the
      contralateral limb using a snare device. The problem and why it is important -- difficulty in
      accessing the contralateral gate leads to increase procedural time and excess exposure to
      radiation. The standard of care is retrograde cannulation with the use of crossover snare
      techniques as a secondary adjunct if retrograde cannulation fails. In this study we will
      compare retrograde cannulation to primary snaring.
