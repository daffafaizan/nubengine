      lifetime, with recurrence in most cases. Several treatments have been proposed for these
      patients and the evidence is still not clear about the effectiveness of aquatic exercises
      when compared to other modalities of exercises in the water. This study will be a randomized
      controlled trial following the Consort-Statement principles. The subjects, aged between 20
      and 50 years, after signing the informed consent will be randomly allocated to one group
      treatment: aquatic exercises (AEG) or aquatic exercises associated to deep-water running
      (AEDWRG). The duration of the protocol will be set at 12 weeks, 3x-week.
