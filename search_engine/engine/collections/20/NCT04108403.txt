      mechanisms of massage are not well established. In this study, the investigators aim to
      determine the effect of expectations on massage related hypoalgesia. Individuals meeting
      eligibility criteria and agreeing to participate will attend one session that lasts
      approximately one hour. A myofascial trigger point (taut band of muscle tissue) will be
      assessed on the neck of the participant. Next, a baseline assessment of pressure pain
      threshold will be performed followed by random assignment to one of four study arms.
