      asymptomatic apart from anatomical defects, which can be seen on vaginal examination. They
      can be associated, however, with refractory constipation that may be best described by the
      terms "Outlet Obstruction" or "Obstructive Defecation Syndrome (ODS)". ODS is characterized
      by a symptom complex, including the feeling of incomplete evacuation associated with the need
      to strain excessively and for external assistance (digital, mechanical or positional
      maneuvers, enemas or suppositories) to aid defecation. Abdominal or rectal pain is also a
      common complaint. Obstetric trauma is also recognized as a contributing factor. However, none
      of these symptoms/factors can be singled out to be pathognomonic for this problem. ODS has a
      prevalence of approximately 12% in the general population.

      For individuals with ODS and related intussusception/rectocele, a variety of surgical
      techniques including abdominal, vaginal, transanal and perineal approaches have been devised.
      The impact of clinical studies to evaluate these techniques has been limited by variability
      of results and lack of comparators. Recently, a new surgical approach was developed by an
      Italian surgeon, A. Longo, and has been evaluated in several European centers. These early
      studies and observations indicate that this new procedure may in fact provide significantly
      better symptom resolution in ODS patients than other available treatments, and warrants
      further study. The procedure is referred to as "Stapled Transanal Rectal Resection (STARR)"
      and this study will assess its effectiveness in a United States population.
