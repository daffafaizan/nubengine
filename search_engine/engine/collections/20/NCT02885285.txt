      class, yoga class, dance class, or no exercise intervention. Classes will be conducted twice
      a week for 6 weeks total at times convenient for the patients. Patients will also be asked to
      complete questionnaires after exercise classes to see if the exercise intervention improves
      measures of fatigue, anxiety, and depression - and what exercise intervention may be
      superior.
