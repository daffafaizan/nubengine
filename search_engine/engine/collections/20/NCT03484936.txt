      death, while no specific treatment has been proven to improve functional outcome. As a
      result, new approaches need to be developed to treat intracerebral hemorrhage. Animal and
      human trials showed treatment with remote ischemic conditioning was safe for intracerebral
      hemorrhage. And repetitive remote ischemic conditioning has been shown to improve
      sensorimotor and neuropathological outcomes following experimental hemorrhagic stroke.
      Therefore, we hypothesize that repetitive remote ischemic conditioning could improve
      functional outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We design this prospective,
      multicenter, randomized controlled double-blind trial to determine whether treatment with
      remote ischemic conditioning is of sufficient promise to improve outcome before conducting a
      larger clinical trial to examine its effectiveness as a treatment for intracerebral
      hemorrhage.
