    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in subjects with Platinum-Resistant or
      Platinum-Refractory Relapsed Ovarian Cancer. At least 30 subjects will be recruited in this
      study. The subjects will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2 by an
      intravenous infusion (IV), every 21 days (q3w, 1 cycle). All patients will receive the
      treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxic reaction, death, or withdrawal by
      investigator or patient decision (a maximum of 8 cycles). Delays in drug administration is
      allowed from the cycle 2, however, the delays should be no more than 3 weeks. Dose
      adjustments after the cycle 2 is permitted, and the minimum dose is 12mg/m2.
