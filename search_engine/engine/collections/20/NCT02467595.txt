      ideal muscle relaxant requires intense neuromuscular block for optimal surgical work and
      complete recovery of neuromuscular function immediately after the end of the surgical
      procedure without postoperative morbidity. Rocuronium is an intermediate acting neuromuscular
      blockade. Reduced-dose rocuronium has been reported to provide optimal anesthetic induction
      without delayed recovery. The investigators aimed to compare the effect of no muscle
      relaxants and reduced-dose rocuronium on the anesthetic induction and emergence with fentanyl
      in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy.

      After Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent from the parents were
      obtained, 75 children (aged 3 to 10 years, ASA(The American Society of Anesthesia ) I or II)
      scheduled for adenotonsillectomy were included. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2.5 mg
      kg-1 , fentanyl 2 mcg kg-1, and rocuronium 0.15 mg kg-1 (R 0.15 group) or rocuronium 0.3mg
      kg-1 (R 0.3 group) or saline (S group). After mask ventilation with 5 vol% sevoflurane in
      100% oxygen for 2 minutes, tracheal intubation was done. The investigators assessed
      conditions during tracheal intubation as excellent, good or poor, using five variables; jaw
      relaxation, vocal cord position, vocal cord movement, coughing, and movement of the limbs.
      The investigators added rocuronium 0.3 mg kg-1 when there was more than one poor condition.
      The investigators recorded the time from discontinuation of sevoflurane to time to
      extubation.
