    
      This will be a Phase 2b, double-masked, multi-site study, in which a total of up to 100 eyes
      of up to 100 subject will be enrolled at up to 8 clinical sites in the United States. The
      study has 2 different treatment arms consisting of the following iontophoresis treatment
      regimen:

      Treatment Arm 1, up to 50 subjects will receive the following study treatment:

      40 mg/ml dexamethasone phosphate solution delivered by iontophoresis treatment consisting of
      4.5 mA-min at 3.0 mA on Day 0 (immediately following cataract surgery), Day 1 (24 hours'
      post-cataract surgery), Day 4, and a potential Day 7 treatment that will be administered for
      subjects who have ≥11 AC cells per high-power field on slit lamp examination.

      Treatment Arm 2, up to 50 subjects will receive the following study treatment:

      100 mM sodium citrate buffer solution (placebo) delivered by iontophoresis treatment
      consisting of 4.5 mA-min at 3.0 mA on Day 0 (immediately following cataract surgery), Day 1
      (24 hours' post-cataract surgery), Day 4, and a potential Day 7 treatment that will be
      administered for subjects who have ≥11 AC cells per high-power field on slit lamp
      examination.

      Subjects will come in for 6 visits over 28 days.

      The primary efficacy endpoint (PEP) will evaluate 1) the proportion of subjects with an AC
      cell count of zero on Day 7 and 2) the proportion of subjects with a pain score of zero on
      Day 1.
