      subarachnoid space of the brain can cause irritation of the cerebral blood vessels, leading
      to constriction of these vessels, a phenomenon known.as vasospasm. Cerebral vasospasm can
      cause stroke and possibly death. Of all the patients with SAH, approximately 20-40% will
      suffer from clinical vasospasm and more than 60% of those patients will never get back to
      their previous functional status. Tools to identify early vasospasm and thus early treatment
      could greatly decrease the morbidity and mortality following SAH.

      Cleaved tau protein is a neuronal marker that has been detected in blood and CSF of stroke
      patients early in its time course. Since vasospasm can lead to stroke, the purpose of this
      project is to determine whether increase in cleaved tau protein in blood and/or CSF can
      predict early stroke from vasospasm. Changes in brain oxygen tension measured by a brain
      tissue oxygen monitor and cerebral blood flow measured by CT perfusion will be correlated
      with cleaved tau protein levels and clinical status. Utilizing statistical analysis the
      levels of Cleaved tau protein, brain oxygen and blood flow during hospitalization will be
      correlated with patient outcome. Through this study we hope to identify increase in cleaved
      tau protein and decrease in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation as predictors of early
      vasospasm. Early detection and treatment of vasospasm could decrease the stroke rate in SAH
      patients and therefore be of great benefit to society.
