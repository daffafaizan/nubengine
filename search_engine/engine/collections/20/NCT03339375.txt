      directed therapy, dynamic parameters, like stroke volume and cardiac output, is important.
      Esophageal Doppler is one of device which provides dymanic parameters.

      In severe trauma cases, the effect of goal directed therapy is not known yet. So the aim of
      this study is comparing the results of goal directed therapy using esophageal Doppler and
      conventional fluid therapy.
