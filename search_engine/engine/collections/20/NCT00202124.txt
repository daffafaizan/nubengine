      randomized in a 2:1 ratio into groups A and B, respectively:

      Group A: TRP01 1g b.i.d. for 26 weeks

      Group B: placebo capsules b.i.d. for 26 weeks

      After the initial screening, clinic visits will take place at 0, 13 and 26 weeks. The
      blinding will be maintained until all patients have completed the 26-week trial. Any patients
      wishing to continue taking the medication upon completion of the trial will be provided a
      prescription for the drug and may purchase it at their own expense.
