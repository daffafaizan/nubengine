    
      The prospective registration of completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma patients
      treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in the adjuvant setting will be based on collaboration
      with 8 centers of excellence on melanoma patients treatment, according to their expertise and
      experience.

      Patients will be recruited from participating centers in the routine setting. This will be
      done only if the decision about starting treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib has already
      been made. All patients that comply with the inclusion criteria and that start treatment with
      dabrafenib+ trametinib during the recruitment period will be considered to participate in the
      study, at investigator discretion.

      Health related quality of life will be assessed by FACT-M and EQ-5D-3L questionnaire after
      treatment initiation in a quarterly base, according to clinical practice, including the first
      visit after treatment completion.
