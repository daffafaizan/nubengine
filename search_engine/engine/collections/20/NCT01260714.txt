    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the highest tolerated dose of two dosing schedules of azacitidine when
      combined with mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) and etoposide (A-NOVE) chemotherapy
      in poor prognosis older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response (CR) rate and using this regimen. II. To evaluate
      changes in topoisomerase II activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and DNA
      expression arrays in leukemia cells during azacitidine treatment, and to correlate these
      changes with responses to A-NOVE chemotherapy.

      III. To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving
      post-remission consolidation with A-NOVE in patients achieving CR. (OS follow-up discontinued
      as of 08/07/2014)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azacitidine.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD)
      on days 1-7, mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, and etoposide IV over 1 hour on
      days 4-8. Patients may receive up to 2 additional courses of the same treatment as
      re-induction or consolidation therapy beginning 35-60 days from the start of the previous
      course.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
