      received opaganib and Standard of Care (SOC) or SOC only. All patients were defined by the
      treating physicians at baseline as severe COVID-19. For the control cohort, IRB approval was
      granted to collect de-identified data. Both cohorts had similar median age and similar rates
      of diabetes, hypertension and obesity.

      The two treatment groups, opaganib and SOC vs. SOC were then analyzed for their clinical
      outcomes including baseline characteristics.
