      control (intensive to achieve a goal 24-hour systolic BP of < 130 mmHg or standard to achieve
      a goal 24-hour systolic BP of < 145 mmHg) for a total of 36 months. Similar antihypertensive
      regimens will be used in both of the treatment groups. Titration of antihypertensive
      therapies will be performed at monthly intervals for the first 3 to 6 months
      post-randomization to achieve goal systolic BP. The primary and secondary outcomes will be
      evaluated at baseline, and following 18 months and 36 months of therapy.
