      infectious complications, sepsis, and consequently organ failure and death. Glutamine
      supplementation to parenteral nutrition is one of the nutritional interventions that have
      been proven to be associated with improved survival rate, decreased infectious morbidity,
      costs, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay. However, glutamine supplementation
      in patients receiving enteral nutrition and its best route are still controversial. A number
      of trials investigated the beneficial effects of intravenous alanyl-glutamine supplementation
      in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. However, these trials were: pilot
      trials, investigated surrogate outcomes, or supplementation was for a short period of time.
      Therefore, a well designed trial is needed to investigate the effect of intravenous
      alanyl-glutamine supplementation in critically ill patients with multiple trauma receiving
      enteral nutrition on major clinical outcomes.

      Our hypothesis is that trauma patients receiving standard enteral nutrition supplemented with
      intravenous alanyl-glutamine will demonstrate improved clinical outcomes compared to patients
      receiving standard enteral nutrition without supplementation.
