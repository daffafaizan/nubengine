      marrow transplantation provides an opportunity to add the potential antitumor effect of
      marrow grafts to those of high dose chemotherapy. One potential strategy for enhancing a
      graft vs. tumor effect without aggravating graft vs. host disease would be to selectively
      target an immune response against a defined tumor-specific antigen. The idiotype of the
      rearranged immunoglobulin gene product of a myeloma can serve as a unique tumor-specific
      antigen for vaccine development. We are testing the hypothesis that tumor antigen-specific
      immunity can be adoptively transferred to BMT recipients by active immunization of marrow
      transplant donors with purified myeloma idiotype protein, conjugated to a carrier protein
      (KLH) and administered with GM-CSF as an immunological adjuvant.

      Patients under age 60 with an HLA-matched sibling donor, with minimal prior treatment,
      defined by less than six months prior chemotherapy, and who are in a minimal residual disease
      state prior to allogeneic BMT, as defined by the achievement of at least a PR, are eligible.
      HLA matched sibling donors receive a series of three vaccinations during an eight week period
      prior to bone marrow harvest. Recipients concurrently receive vaccinations pre-BMT, as well
      as three booster vaccinations at weeks 12, 16, and 24 post-BMT. Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is
      administered s.c. GM-CSF (250 micrograms/m(2)) is administered s.c. locally with the vaccine
      on the day of vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination. The
      objective of this protocol is to induce cellular and humoral immunity in marrow transplant
      donors and recipients against the unique idiotype expressed by the recipient's myeloma.
