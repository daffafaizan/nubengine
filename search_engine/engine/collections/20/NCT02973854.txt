      endometriosis on patients presenting with pain, infertility or both will be performed by the
      principal investigator at St. Mary's Hospital. We will be collecting preoperative, operative
      and postoperative follow-up data on all patients recruited for this study based on
      comprehensive preoperative questionnaires, which includes data collection on pain scores (by
      VAS scales) and standardized QOL scales, and the 6-12 month follow questionnaire. The
      surgical approach in the treatment of endometriosis is by excision only, so that all lesions
      (abnormal areas of peritoneum) are excised resulting in tissue specimens that are classified
      at a histologic level, which is the gold standard way to diagnose the presence of
      endometriosis.
