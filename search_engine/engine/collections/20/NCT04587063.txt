      system's mail-order pharmacy (from here, simply referred to as mail-order pharmacy) can also
      provide reduced costs for medications. Ongoing outreach efforts involve sending emails and
      other communications encouraging enrollment in Geisinger's mail-order pharmacy to eligible
      members of the system's health plan (i.e., those who take maintenance medications). The study
      will compare a standard promotional email from these outreach efforts, as well as three new
      emails with content informed by behavioral science research, against a no-contact control arm
      and each other.
