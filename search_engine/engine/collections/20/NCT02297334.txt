      contact of patients' blood with foreign surfaces like tubes or the oxygenator,
      ischemic-reperfusion injury and surgical trauma. Inflammation is modulated by cytokines,
      especially, interleukins. The extent of cytokine release is further related to the duration
      of bypass and the amount of operating field suction. This results in a systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome (SIRS) with the risk of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). Also in patients
      treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) an activation of the inflammation
      system is seen and accompanied with an increase of cytokine levels. The cytokine
      concentration correlates with the severity of the immune reaction and can be a predictor of
      the outcome of the patient. As severe SIRS and MOD significantly increase mortality, the
      attenuation of the inflammatory response is supposed to reduce morbidity and mortality after
      cardiac surgery.

      For adult cardiac surgery and patients who are treated with an extracorporal assist device, a
      tool for cytokine elimination and attenuation of the inflammatory response seems to be
      beneficial.

      In our study we are going to investigate if the use of the CytoSorb device can improve the
      outcome of patients undergoing elective coronar artery bypass and heart valve surgery.
