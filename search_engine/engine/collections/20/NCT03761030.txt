      (1) a DSM 5 depressive disorder, (2) significant depressive symptoms, and (3) decreased
      thinking or walking speed will receive 8 weeks of treatment with L-DOPA up to 450mg. We will
      test whether L-DOPA increases brain dopamine release using neuroimaging and whether it speeds
      up thinking and walking speed. Data collected in the proposed studies may help identify a new
      treatment for LLD, which could have large public health ramifications given the prevalence,
      frequent treatment resistance, and chronicity characteristic of LLD. This project also will
      elucidate the neurobiology of slowing at molecular, structural, and functional levels of
      analysis, increasing our understanding of the interplay between these aging-associated
      processes and the pathophysiologic changes underlying late life neuropsychiatric disorders.
      Exploring patient characteristics that predict response to L-DOPA may provide useful
      information to guide differential therapeutics and develop personalized medicine for LLD.
