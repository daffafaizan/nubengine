    
      Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a high-grade neoplasm, characterized by an aggressive
      clinical course with brief survival, and refractoriness to currently available local and
      systemic modalities of treatment. There is no standard therapy for ATC, and no randomized
      comparative trials have been known to be conducted in this disease. One potential strategy is
      to combine the anti-tumor activity of the vascular disrupting agent combretastatin with
      conventional cytotoxic agents. This study will compare the overall survival of ATC patients
      treated with the triplet combination of combretastatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin compared
      with the doublet treatment of paclitaxel and carboplatin.
