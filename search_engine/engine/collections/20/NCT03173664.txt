    
      This is a post-approval study of the KAMRA inlay performance and potential device-related
      issues in a broader population over an extended period of time after pre-market establishment
      of reasonable safety and effectiveness.

      Study objectives include:

        -  Evaluate the long-term performance (effectiveness) and safety of the device;

        -  Evaluate real-world performance of the device in subjects treated by refractive surgeons
           with a range of experience levels;

        -  Evaluate the performance of the device in racial/ethnic subgroups representative of the
           population for which the device is intended.

      In addition, the data from a subset of the first 105 subjects who have been enrolled in this
      study will be used to validate the KAMRA Inlay Patient Questionnaire (KIPQ) for the
      assessment of patients who have received the KAMRA inlay for the treatment of presbyopia.
