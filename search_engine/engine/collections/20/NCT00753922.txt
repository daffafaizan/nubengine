      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A premarket approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision patients.
      Every patient implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, and had to be offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant patients. In order to be implanted
      with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in a core clinical study.

      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the smooth and
      textured surface Mentor Round Low-Bleed Silicone Gel-filled Mammary Prostheses in women who
      are undergoing primary breast augmentation, primary breast reconstruction or revision.
