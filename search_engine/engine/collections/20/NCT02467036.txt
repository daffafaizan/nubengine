    
      The purpose of this application is to evaluate the acceptability and initial efficacy of
      consumption of an egg breakfast, compared to a cereal breakfast, in the context of
      Family-based Behavioral Treatment (FBT) with overweight and obese children and their parents.
      Investigators will randomize 66 parents and their overweight and obese child (85-99.9%BMI) to
      FBT+egg or FBT+cereal groups. Families will eat their assigned breakfast (eggs or cereal) 5
      out of 7 days during the 4 month FBT treatment. However, all other aspects of FBT will be the
      same in the two groups. Children and parents will complete assessments at three time points;
      baseline, post-treatment and 4-months post-treatment.
