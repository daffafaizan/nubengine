      engraftment with the reduced intensity protocol and a second infusion of stem cells on day
      42, 2) the mortality associated with transplant by day 100, 3) patient outcomes, based on
      differential imaging and biologic evaluations prior to transplantation and at designated
      points after transplantation (day 100, 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years). Additional biologic
      studies will include microarray analysis, and evaluation of blood parameters and genes that
      may be important in the disease process. In older patients, studies to evaluation osteoclast
      differentiation and function will also be offered.
