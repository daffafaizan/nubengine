        -  To determine the difference in nephrotoxicity between low-dose and weight-based
           intravenous acyclovir sodium as herpes simplex virus infection prophylaxis in patients
           with neutropenia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive weight-based IV acyclovir sodium every 8 or 12 hours.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive low-dose IV acyclovir sodium every 8 or 12 hours. Treatment
           continues for approximately 2 weeks unless clinical herpes simplex virus infection is
           confirmed or the patient is no longer neutropenic.
