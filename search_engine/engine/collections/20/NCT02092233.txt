    
      The ARIES HSV 1&2 Assay is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro
      diagnostic test for the direct detection and typing of herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 & 2) DNA
      in male external and internal anogenital, female external and internal anogenital (vaginal),
      oral and skin lesion specimens.

      The objective is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of ARIES HSV-1&2 Assay through a
      multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected, left-over de-identified, clinical
      specimens (i.e. all-comers accrued at enrolled clinical sites between pre-determined dates)
      as an aid in the diagnosis of herpes infection.
