      (Effezel) and the experimental group (Pirfenidone+M-DDO). Before screening, participants will
      undergo an informed consent process and they will sign an institutional review board-approved
      informed consent form. The study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices
      and the principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki (revised Seoul,
      Korea, 2008). Potential subjects with acne scars will be selected from the investigators
      practices and solicited from advertisements. To be included, subjects must have met the
      inclusion criteria. Demographics data and medical history will be registered on a monthly
      basis. Before treatment, all subjects with inflammation and scars will be evaluated in the
      face and back area using the InvestigatorÂ´s Global Assessment scale (IGA scale) and all the
      lesions will be counted. The face and back area affected will be mapped and photographed.
      Participants in the experimental group will receive topical Zaxcell (Pirfenidone 10% +M-DDO
      gel) two times a day on the face and superior back and patients in control group will receive
      Effezel (Adapalene 0.1%+Benzoyl peroxide 2.5%) once a day. Both groups will apply the topical
      treatment in acne on the face and superior back area for six months previous cleansing of the
      area with neutral soap. Two biopsies of skin will be taken at the beginning, at month one and
      month 3 from the back area where the treatment will be applied. After this time, only
      clinical evaluations and photographs will be performed. Participants will be evaluated at
      every month until 6 months after their last application.
