        -  Screening: in-person visit at the study site to confirm eligibility for proceeding

        -  Collection: autologous (self) blood stem cells are harvested at the study site, also
           known as apheresis

        -  Manufacturing of ST-400: no study participant activities expected

        -  Infusion: conditioning chemotherapy, followed by infusion of ST-400, occurs at the study
           site

        -  Follow-up: follow up at the study site to monitor for safety and effectiveness of the
           study
