      lumborum block for inguinal hernia repair unilateral intrathecal block is widely used
      nowadays for unilateral inguinal hernia repair, providing intense sensory and motor blockade.
      Limiting the block to the operative site by using small doses of hyperbaric solutions
      injected slowly through a directional needle and maintaining a lateral decubitus position for
      a certain duration has been proposed, to produce high quality, long-duration analgesia, with
      minimal hemodynamic adverse events.

      Previous case report studies stated that we can use Quadratus Lumborum Block as the sole
      anesthetic technique for open hernia repair.
