      decreased patient satisfaction, increased morbidity or postoperative complications, and adds
      significantly to the cost. The management of air leaks is primarily preventive and therefore
      starts in the operating room with surgical techniques that can minimize the occurrence of
      post-operative air leaks, such as the creation of pleural tents or use of suture line glues
      or sealants. Notwithstanding some patients will after a lung resection have PAL. Any minimal
      invasive method that helps to increase our ability to treat (reduce and/or stop) the air leak
      in these latest cases carries an enormous clinical as well as cost-saving potential.
      Bronchoscopic occlusion of a segmental or subsegmental bronchus using endobronchial valves is
      such a less invasive method which has shown in case reports to interrupt an air leak.
