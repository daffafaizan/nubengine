        -  Determine the efficacy of nonmyeloablative sibling allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and
           fludarabine IV on days -5 to -1. Patients receiving 5/6-mismatched cells also receive
           anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5 to -3.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC
           or bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive oral mycophenolate
           mofetil twice daily on days 0-30. Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally
           twice daily beginning on day -2 and continuing up to day 44-100 in the absence of GVHD.

        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion: Patients with partial or complete T-cell chimerism receive up
           to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of GVHD or progressive disease.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
