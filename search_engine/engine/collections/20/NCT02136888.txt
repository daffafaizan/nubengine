      double-dummy, parallel group, multiple-dose, up-titration study of the electrocardiographic
      effects of ponesimod in healthy male and female subjects with a nested cross-over comparison
      between moxifloxacin and placebo.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to Group A (ponesimod treatment group) or Group B (placebo
      treatment group) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in Group B will be further randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to one of the following sequences: 400 mg moxifloxacin followed by
      moxifloxacin-matching placebo or moxifloxacin matching placebo followed by 400 mg
      moxifloxacin.
