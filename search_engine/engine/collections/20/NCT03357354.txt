      mission to inform, screen, support and guide the access to care of people in targeted
      neighborhoods, said to be vulnerable, by the city's policy of Marseille. The health space, a
      place of welcome and care, is located at a distance from any hospital structure within the
      most vulnerable neighborhoods of the city.
