      contraception. According to Hubacher et al. predictors of increased pain during IUD insertion
      include nulliparity, age greater than 30 years, lengthier time since last pregnancy or last
      menses, and not currently breastfeeding. Allen et al. predicted pain to be greater based on
      history of no previous vaginal delivery, and difficulty of the procedure. Pharmacological
      interventions for pain control during IUD insertion include analgesics, local anesthetics,
      and the use of prostaglandins to soften the cervix; however, there is wide variation in the
      use of these methods . Misoprostol has also been proposed as an agent to ease IUD insertion
      and decrease procedure-associated pain .

      Nitrous oxide has been used for years for procedural analgesia in outpatient settings and has
      recently been investigated as an approach to pain management in the context of IUD insertion
      .

      Sewell and Vincent have been offering nitrous oxide for reducing the pain of IUD insertion
      and have had a positive response.
