      disease mechanism is not well understood. Among the factors that have been studied are the
      change in stool microbiota (dysbiosis), severe anemia, and transfusion. Studies suggest that
      dysbiosis occurs in neonates with NEC. Large studies and meta-analyses have shown a
      predominance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in Firmicutes, and decreased bacterial
      diversity in stool from infants with NEC. Studies do not support a relationship between
      transfusions and NEC since there are conflicting findings on this topic. There is a
      suggestion, however, that severe anemia may be associated with NEC though this requires
      further study.

      No studies have been done evaluating the relationship between anemia and change in stool
      microbiota, or blood transfusion and change in stool microbiota. This study aims to primarily
      evaluate the relationship between anemia and stool microbiota, and secondarily evaluate the
      relationship between transfusion and stool microbiota.
