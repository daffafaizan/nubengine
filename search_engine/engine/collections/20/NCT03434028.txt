    
      Primary Hypothesis: Restrictive (vs liberal) fluid treatment strategy during the first 24
      hours of resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypotension will reduce 90-day in-hospital
      mortality.

        1. We will emphasize early screening and protocol initiation, and enroll a maximum of 2320
           patients with suspected sepsis-induced hypotension.

             -  All patients will receive at least 1 liter of fluids prior to meeting study
                inclusion criteria (and no more than 3 liters prior to randomization).

             -  Patients will be enrolled within 4 hours of meeting study inclusion criteria

             -  Any type of isotonic crystalloid (normal saline, ringers lactate, or a balanced
                solution such as plasmalyte) is permitted.

        2. Restrictive Fluids (Early Vasopressors) Group

             -  Norepinephrine will be used as preferred vasopressor and titrated to achieve mean
                arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 mmHg and 75 mmHg

             -  "Rescue fluids" may be administered as 500ml boluses if predefined rescue criteria
                are met

        3. Liberal Fluids (Fluids First)

             -  2 liter infusion upon enrollment (may forego second liter if MAP/SBP and heart rate
                are normalized and clinical assessment if patient is fluid replete after the first
                liter).

             -  Administer 500ml fluid boluses for fluid triggers until 5 liters administered or
                development of clinical signs of acute volume overload develop

             -  "Rescue vasopressors" may be administered after 5 liters of fluid, for development
                of acute volume overload, or if other predefined rescue criteria are met
