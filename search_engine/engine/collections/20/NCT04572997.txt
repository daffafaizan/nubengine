      efficacy and safety of apremilast involving 21 patients with PPP. The screening period was up
      to 4 weeks and treatment took place over 20 weeks per patient. No follow up period took
      place. No extension was done.

      Recruitment period was 4 months; hence study duration from first patient in to last patient
      out was approximately 9 months. About 4-6 patients per center were recruited, assuming
      enrolment of both genders with distribution according to prevalence of condition.

      Patient recruitment took place at 5 centers in Germany. The investigators had relevant
      expertise in diagnosing and treating PPP or were specialized in dermatology. Patients were
      enrolled until approximately 20 patients were included into the study. One drop-out was
      replaced during the recruitment phase.

      Five visits per patient were performed including:

        -  Visit 1 at week -4 to -1 (screening)

        -  Visit 2 at week 0 (baseline)

        -  Visit 3 at week 4

        -  Visit 4 at week 12

        -  Visit 5 at week 20 (end of study)

      After the end of study participation the investigator ensured that the patient received a
      suitable therapy appropriate to patient's condition.
