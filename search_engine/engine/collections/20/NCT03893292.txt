      many of these patients are dissatisfied with the results, because they continue to experience
      pain postoperatively. This pain can be debilitating and can also be associated with decreased
      quality of life. Given the increasing number of patients undergoing total knee replacement
      and a dissatisfaction rate of 8-44%, improvements must be made in pain management protocols
      to help decrease pain in the immediate postoperative period following total knee replacement.
      Cooled radiofrequency ablation is a procedure that uses water-cooled technology to denervate
      the sensory nerves. It is widely used in the spine and is increasingly being used in the knee
      to treat osteoarthritis. Existing studies have shown that it can significantly reduce pain in
      patients with chronic osteoarthritis. In terms of its potential benefit as a preoperative
      measure to minimize postoperative pain, the literature is sparse. Results from this study
      will be used to generate hypotheses and power for future studies.
