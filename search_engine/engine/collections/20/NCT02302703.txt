      Aims: comparing the effects of low FODMAP diet versus gluten-free diet on IBS symptoms in
      children.

      Study design: prospective randomized, crossover trial. Study Population: we are aiming to
      recruit 40 children aged 6-18 years who answer the pediatric ROME III criteria for IBS.
      Children will be recruited to the study by physicians at pediatric gastroenterology clinics.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Other diagnosis (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease).

        2. Patient receiving chronic medical therapy.

        3. Patient already on a restrictive diet (e.g. gluten-free, lactose-free) All patients will
           document baseline diet - a diary of 7 days by parents/patient specifying exact contents
           of meals. They will document and score baseline symptoms including stool consistency and
           frequency, abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence. The baseline documentation will be
           performed by the child, or by his parents, according to the patient's age and ability.

      The patients will be randomly selected to one of the intervention groups. A clinical
      dietitian has created interventional diets. Half of the patients will start with the low
      FODMAP diet and half will start with Gluten free. After 7 days, the participants will return
      to a 7 days washout period of their regular diet. After this period, the groups will switch
      between the intervention diets, for additional 7 days. During the two weeks of intervention
      diets, the patients will document and score symptoms as described for the baseline
      documentation.

      -There will be special consideration to several dietary elements in the baseline diet, e.g.
      patients who may regularly consume high lactose, gluten or FODMAP in their daily diet.
