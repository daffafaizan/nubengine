      training in the EPIQ method and then develop, implement, and document evidence-based practice
      changes to reduce hospital-acquired infection. Compliance with practice changes and neonatal
      outcomes will be monitored. NICUs will receive quarterly feedback on their progress, as well
      as access to implementation support. Control NICUs (n = 12) will collect neonatal data and
      continue to provide standard care. Study subjects will be all preterm infants born at <34
      weeks' gestation and admitted to participating NICUs during the trial (estimated n = 5,200
      per year). Data analysis will be conducted to compare neonatal outcomes and health-care
      resources used between the intervention and control groups.
