    
      This study consists of two parts: healthy subjects and chronic hepatitis B patients. Healthy
      subjects will conduct a single-dose, multiple-dose and food effect study.

      I. Single-Dose Study：There will be a total of 6 dose cohorts（25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 400 mg,
      600 mg, 800 mg). 25 mg cohort as experimental cohort, plans to enroll 4 subjects (male or
      female) who will use HEC121120 tablets . The other else cohorts will include 10 subjects, of
      which 8 receives HEC121120 tablets and 2 receives placebo, regardless of gender. Each subject
      will only participate in one dose cohort. Each cohort will be divided into 2 group. The first
      group consists of 3 sentinels, two receiving active and one placebo. The second group will
      consist of the remainder of the cohort (6 active and 1 placebo) and, following review of the
      available safety data, will be dosed 24 hours after the sentinel group. Subjects can leave
      the pharmacy after their biological samples are collected on day 5. Subjects in each cohort
      will receive a single dose of HEC121120 or placebo in the fasted state on day 1, and safety
      evaluation is to be performed on day 2 and 5.

      II. Food effect: There will be 1 dose cohort (200 mg), only to be admitted to the 100 mg dose
      cohort if a single dose has been completed and is safe and well tolerated. A total of 18
      subjects were enrolled in this dose cohort, divided into two groups A and B (9 subjects in
      each group, 8 subjects in each group received HEC121120 and 1 received the placebo, with the
      ratio of male to female as close as possible. All subjects were required to participate in a
      single dose and food influence study on pharmacokinetics. Two cycles of cross-dose
      administration were performed, with a washout period of 7 days. Four sentinels were first
      enrolled in group A, and their safety indexes were evaluated by the investigator at least 24
      h after administration. If tolerated, the remaining 5 sentinels could be enrolled in group A,
      and the remaining 4 sentinels could be enrolled in group B. The safety indexes were evaluated
      by the investigator at least 24 h after administration, if tolerated, the remaining 5
      sentinels could be enrolled in group B.

      III. Multi-Dose Study: There will be 1 dose(200 mg) cohort which will consist of 12 subjects,
      of which 10 receive HEC121120 tablets and 2 receive placebo, with the ratio of male to female
      as close as possible. All subjects will receive HEC121120 or placebo for 5 consecutive days
      (study doses, administration method (fasted or fed), dosing frequency, and dosing period are
      all to be determined based on data from the single-dose study and multiple-dose study).
      Subjects can leave pharmacy after their biological samples are collected. Safety evaluation
      is to be performed on day 3 and 7.

      IV:Chronic hepatitis B patients: There will be a total of 3 dose cohorts (100、200、400 mg).
      Each cohort will consist of 14 subjects, of which 12 receive HEC121120 tablets and
      placebo(Entecavir simulation tablet), 2 receive Entecavir and placebo(HEC121120 simulation
      tablet). It is necessary to determine the administration method and dose for patients with
      chronic hepatitis B based on the results of the tolerance and PK study of healthy subjects.
      Each subject will only participate in one dose cohort.Initially, the drug frequency was set
      as once a day for 28 consecutive days. Safety and antiviral activity evaluation is to be
      performed on day 7, 14, 21±2, 29, 35±2.
