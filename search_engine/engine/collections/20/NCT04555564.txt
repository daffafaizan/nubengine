    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm pilot study for patients presenting with hemoptysis
      from lung cancers. Prior to a therapeutic bronchial artery embolization (standard therapy),
      Tc99m-MAA will be administered to the bronchial artery and an imaging will be obtained to
      determine the distribution of MAA.

      The primary objective will be quantification of Tc99m-MAA uptake within the tumor and
      surrounding structures (esophagus, bronchi, pericardium, spine). This is a purely descriptive
      study and no statistical comparison or correlation will be made. Dosimetry will be reported
      for each patient, as well as range and mean with standard deviation. Additional activity
      calculation methods and reporting metrics may additionally be used. Non-statistical
      comparison will be made to literature-reported external-beam radiation dose-related tumor
      response and adjacent-organ toxicities to develop a preliminary assessment of the potential
      for efficacy and anticipated safety-profile of Yittrium-90 bronchial artery
      radio-embolization.
