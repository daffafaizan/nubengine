      model in which syncope patients are provided with, and trained to use, a wearable
      defibrillator prior to discharge from the emergency department (ED). Observational data will
      be collected to assess the logistics of equipping patients with the device and providing
      training in the ED, and the ability of patients to receive follow-up care on an outpatient
      basis. In addition, data will be collected to confirm that the device meets expected safety.
      The experience gained from this stage of the study will be used to guide future studies of
      device's functionality enhancements and definitive device safety and efficacy.

      STUDY POPULATION Participants will be patients presenting to the ED following a syncope event
      which has been defined as cardiac, or potentially cardiac, i.e. undiagnosed in nature.

      INTERVENTION A wearable defibrillator optimized for short-term ambulatory use with adhesive
      electrodes will be prescribed for up to 14 days of use following emergency department
      discharge or until the physician responsible for the subject's care defines an alternative
      treatment plan.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a single-arm feasibility study.

      STUDY SIZE The study will enroll a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 80 subjects. A maximum of
      20 centers will be used for enrollment.
