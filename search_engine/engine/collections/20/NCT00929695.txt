      I. To determine whether a lower starting dose of prednisone for treatment of newly diagnosed
      acute GVHD results in decreased prednisone exposure without compromising overall survival.

      II. To estimate the magnitude of clinical benefit associated with the reduction in prednisone
      exposure.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (Low-dose; prednisone-equivalent dose at initiation of treatment of 0.5 mg/kg/day or
      1.0 mg/kg/day; stratified according to initial symptom severity): Patients receive low-dose
      prednisone or methylprednisolone once or twice daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (Standard-dose; prednisone-equivalent dose at initiation of treatment of 1.0 mg/kg/day
      or 2.0 mg/kg/day; stratified according to initial symptom severity): Patients receive
      standard-dose prednisone or methylprednisolone once or twice daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 year and then annually
      thereafter.
