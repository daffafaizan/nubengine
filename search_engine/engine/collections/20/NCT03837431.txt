      areas. Diagnosis of CL routinely uses invasive skin slits which are examined with microscopy,
      requiring trained staff and an equipped lab. A new rapid diagnostic test for CL which may be
      used in the field has been developed and validated in several countries where other
      Leishmania species are present. Less invasive tape sampling has also become available.
      Whether this new RDT and alternative sampling methods can be used in Ethiopia is unclear.

      The performance of the CL detect Rapid Test against a combined reference (microscopy and PCR)
      and alternative sample collection methods will be tested in CL suspected individuals in
      North-West Ethiopia in a cross-sectional study.
