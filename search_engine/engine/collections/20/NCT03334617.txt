    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, umbrella Phase II study in patients with metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on an anti-programmed cell
      death-1/anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) containing therapy. This study
      is modular in design, consisting of a number of treatment cohorts, allowing evaluation of the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple treatment arms. There is currently no
      established therapy for patients who have received immune checkpoint inhibitors and
      platinum-doublet therapies, and novel treatments are urgently needed.

      This protocol has a modular design, with the potential for future treatment arms to be added
      via protocol amendment.
