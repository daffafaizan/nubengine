      also one of the key risk factors for development of intestinal failure associated liver
      disease (IFALD). Despite of many commercially available ILEs with hypothetically different
      impact on liver, a direct comparison of them has never been performed. Therefore the aim of
      the study was to analyse the influence of ILEs on liver function during long term PN. Ths
      study is a continuation of the previous trial, NCT03044639.
