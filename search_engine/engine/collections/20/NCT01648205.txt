    
      LQT3 mutations in the LQTS Registry will be studied using in vitro expression studies to
      determine whether ranolazine causes a decrease in late sodium current, slower recovery from
      inactivation and/or changes in time course of inactivation, ameliorating the causative
      functional effect of each individual mutation.

      Individuals with select LQT3 mutations already studied in vitro will be invited to
      participate in a short term (2 day) study in the Clinical Research Center studying the
      effects of an oral dose of ranolazine on QTc duration and other ECG, echocardiogram and
      Holter-derived parameters.

      The same individuals, as well as other individuals with the same mutation, will be invited to
      participate in a 6-month study involving ranolazine and matched placebo, to help evaluate the
      long-term effectiveness of ranolazine in the population. Periodic ECGs and 24-hour Holter
      recordings will be obtained for evaluation of QTc duration and other ECG and Holter-derived
      parameters.
