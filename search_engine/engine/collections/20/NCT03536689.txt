      digestive tract and respiratory system. The quantity of amniotic fluid can be measured by
      ultrasonography, measuring the deepest pocket in 4 quadrants of uterus then summarize as one
      value known as "amniotic fluid index"(AFI). The AFI has the normal range between 5-25 cm. The
      low AFI (< 5 cm) is associated with abnormal fetal heart rate, and the abnormal AFI does
      affect to the treatment during the antepartum and intrapartum phase. However , there is the
      study shown that when compared to the single deepest pocket (SDP) , AFI could detect the
      oligohydramnios more which might led to the unnecessary labor induction or operative delivery
      without the significant change of perinatal outcome. To increase the accuracy of AFI, we
      theorize that maternal position change might affect the amniotic fluid position which would
      increase the visual of the amniotic fluid as well.
