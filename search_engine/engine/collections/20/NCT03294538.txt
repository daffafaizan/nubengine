      effectively treat symptoms of atrophic vaginitis but bear undesirable side effects including
      increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, endometrial cancer, and breast cancer. Topical
      therapies (creams and transvaginal delivery systems) provide low doses of estrogen to the
      vaginal mucosa to provide local relief for the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, while reducing
      the unwanted side effects associated with systemic delivery systems. Low dose, topical
      estrogen therapy is considered most appropriate and convenient for the treatment of vaginal
      symptoms associated with menopause, particularly when other symptoms including bone loss or
      vasomotor dysfunction do not need to be targeted.
