      cortical areas involved in the masticatory circuit and superior cognitive functions.

      Objective 2: To determine the functional and brain connectivity changes associated with
      malocclusion and oral health.

      Objective 3: To correlate the anatomic and functional changes associated with malocclusion
      and oral health with the performance of cognitive tasks representative of those executed in
      daily life.
