    
      Evaluation of the usage of platelet-rich fibrin dressing in the management of free gingival
      graft and donor site palatal wound by evaluation of pain score, healing tissue in both donor
      and receiving sites, coverage of gingival recession, and the gain of attached gingiva.

      A total of 20 subjects will be invited to participate in this study from the patients seeking
      treatment at the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Damascus University.

      The study has been approved by the investigator's local Review Board. Subjects will be
      recruited according to specific inclusion criteria. After completion of medical and dental
      history questionnaires, patients will sign a consent form after being advised about the
      nature of the study.

      Patients will be allocated into two groups (10 patients each). A Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF)
      dressing will be used in both donor and receiving sites in the test group, while a
      non-eugenol-based (Coe-Pakâ„¢) dressing will be used in both donor and receiving sites in the
      control group .

      Donor site working time, bleeding (BLE), colour match (CM), pain and re-epithelization (EP)
      will be evaluated.
