      and increasing patients' ability to engage in daily activities. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate whether CBT can be enhanced with specialized neuromuscular training, in the new
      fibromyalgia integrative training (FIT Teens) intervention, to produce stronger pain
      reduction than CBT alone. Neuromuscular training originates from the field of pediatric
      sports medicine and has been successfully used for injury prevention but has never before
      been utilized for pain management in JFM. This type of training emphasizes education and
      proper training in fundamental movement skills prior to the initiation of more vigorous
      physical activity and exercise. It is expected that the neuromuscular training integrated
      with established CBT techniques will enhance patients' ability to engage in exercise and to
      achieve better JFM pain control. Adolescents with JFM will be randomly assigned to receive
      either the 8-week FIT Teens intervention or an 8-week CBT program with assessments at
      baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up.
