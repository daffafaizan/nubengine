      resistance that may be responsible for most of cirrhosis complications. Indeed, the potential
      use of this drug may ameliorate the HVPG and azygos flow. Portal hypertension is responsible
      for most of the cases of death in cirrhosis. The esophageal varices, ascites and hepatorenal
      syndrome are the most harmful consequences of cirrhosis that should be prevented. In that
      way, simvastatin appears as a promising therapy.The study will include two groups of patients
      using aleatory randomization and one group will receive simvastatin while the other will
      receive placebo blindly. At the start and at the end of the study the patients will be
      submitted to HVPG measurement and azygous vein flow measure.

      The endpoints will be the normalization of HVPG or lower significantly(20% or more.

      The patients will be followed for 6 months after the end of the study.
