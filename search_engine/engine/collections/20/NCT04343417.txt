      diseases will be created. Clinically, kidney diseases are detected by blood and urine
      laboratory tests. However, the underlying cause of kidney disease is often not clear on blood
      and urine tests. In such cases, a clinician may choose to perform a kidney biopsy to
      establish the diagnosis. Patients who are scheduled to undergo a kidney biopsy will be
      invited to participate in this proposed study.
