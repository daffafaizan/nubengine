      post-transplant. They we be made NPO at midnight prior to the biopsy per routine. On arrival,
      they will have standard of care pre-biopsy bloods drawn along with baseline study labs
      including serum enzymatic creatinine (1mL of blood), cystatin C (1.5 mL of blood), and 1mL of
      blood collected pre-iohexol infusion. Two IV's will be started, one for iohexol
      administration and fluids, and the other for blood draws. Study patients will be started on
      1x maintenance intravenous fluids. The patient will then have their standard of care protocol
      biopsy in the ultrasound suite. After the biopsy 5 mL Iohexol (Omnipaque 300) will be
      administered over 1-2 minutes, with epinephrine, solumedrol, and diphenhydramine on hand in
      the event of a reaction although this is very unlikely. The patient will be observed and
      vital signs will be taken 10 minutes post-infusion. After biopsy, maintenance fluids will be
      continued until completion of the study. Blood for determination of Iohexol levels (1mL) will
      be drawn at 10, 30, 120, and 300 minutes post iohexol infusion when patient is being observed
      post biopsy. At completion of the study at 300 minutes post iohexol infusion, serum
      creatinine (1mL of blood), cystatin C (1.5 mL of blood) will be drawn again. The total volume
      of blood drawn for the study will be 10mL.

      Creatinine (enzymatic method) will be determined on the Olympus system, and Cystatin C
      (Gentian assay) will be determined on the AU400 Olympus System at the UCLA Department of
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Outreach Laboratory. Iohexol GFR will be determined at the
      University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Schwartz's laboratory. Kidney biopsies will be
      graded by updated Banff criteria, and reviewed by blinded pathologist.
