      in healthy female volunteers. The effect of a tablet containing hydroxychloroquine sulphate
      on hedonic food intake in overweight female individuals has not been studied to date. The
      primary outcome of the current study is to evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine sulphate
      on hedonic food intake, assessed by ad libitum food intake of a chocolate milkshake one hour
      after dosing. The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded cross-over study.
      Forty overweight females will be recruited. An acute dose of 400 mg hydroxychloroquine
      sulphate will be administered. Blood samples will be collected at regular time points to
      measure gastrointestinal hormone release and whole blood glucose levels. Appetite-related
      sensations will be scored at regular time points on visual analog scales.
