      effect than Clopidogrel in both healthy subjects and stable coronary artery disease patients.
      Moreover, Asian subjects exposed higher active metabolite and stronger pharmacodynamics
      response than European subjects with same oral dose of antiplatelet agent. However, previous
      report comparing the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor and Clopidogrel in healthy Asian
      ethnicity is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      responses of a lower Ticagrelor dose using laboratory platelet function tests in healthy
      Korean volunteers.
