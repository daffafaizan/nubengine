      currently being treated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at University of Texas MD
      Anderson Cancer Center. The survey includes questions about socioeconomic characteristics
      (age, gender, race, income, and education level), patients' diagnosis and patients'
      perceptions about their prognosis, physicians' information and permission for patients' use
      of CAM, patients' use of CAM (yes or no), decision-making (purpose of CAM use), resources and
      types of CAM.

      Patients will be asked to drop the questionnaire into a box in a specified location after
      completion of the questionnaire. Accrual is expected to be 50-100 patients per month. This
      survey is expected to finish in 6 months.
