    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised trial with subjects receiving subcutaneous
      (s.c.) monthly injections of degarelix depot. All patients will be treated with a one-month
      starting dose of 240mg on Day 0. Subjects are then randomized to receive either nine or three
      maintenance doses of one month duration. The primary objective is to determine the effect of
      degarelix therapy on the length of the off treatment interval (defined as serum
      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increasing to 5 ng/ml) following completion of the androgen
      deprivation therapy. The trial will also assess the effect of degarelix therapy on PSA
      kinetics (specifically PSA doubling time), PSA nadir, and effect on quality of life as well
      as other measures. The efficacy and safety of these two treatments will also be reported.
