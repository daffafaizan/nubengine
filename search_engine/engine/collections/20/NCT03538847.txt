      surgery in which trauma is limited and pain is not investigated as patients are often
      discharged from the hospital within a few hours. Good POP management can improve clinical
      outcome and patients' satisfaction and constitutes essential criteria for hospital discharge
      after day-case or ambulatory surgery. Little data are available particularly for POP after
      vitreoretinal surgery (VRS).

      The investigators will conduct a 1-year retrospective study on patients undergoing VRS at
      "Careggi Hospital" , a teaching University Hospital in Italy. The aim of the study will be to
      observe the amount of POP after VRS, its time course, factors associated with its appearance
      and finally the efficacy of the pain protocol that is in use.

      Pain will be evaluated according to the "Numerical Rating Scale" (NRS), a 11-point numeric
      scale ranging from '0' which represents "no pain" and '10' which represents extreme pain at
      several intervals after surgery. Analgesic consumption (in terms of type and amount of
      analgesics) and the efficacy of the analgesic protocol in use will also be recorded.

      Factors possibly associated with POP (such as duration of surgery, presence of comorbidities,
      ASA physical status, age, type of anesthesia (locoregional or general anesthesia)) will be
      analyzed.

      The associations between the principal outcome (amount of POP) and risk factors will be
      evaluated using a simple and multiple logistic regression model.
