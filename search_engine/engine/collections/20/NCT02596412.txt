    
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of the use of a module with augmented reality (Mini-Docs)
      on pain during botulinum toxin injections in children with cerebral palsy aged from 3 to 8
      years

      Method: Randomized controlled trial comparing a group of children receiving the module with
      augmented reality of the Mini-Docs and drug pain management (nitrous oxide and medications),
      with a group of children receiving the usual care of pain management that combines drug pain
      management (nitrous oxide and medications) and distraction techniques. The device with the
      augmented reality module allows the child to add virtual content to the real images of the
      care. The pain will be assessed for each child 10 minutes after the injections, using a
      self-assessment scale (the Faces Pain Scale - Revised) or a heteroevaluation scale (the Face
      Legs Activity Cry Consolability scale given by the nurse). The study will be conducted in two
      centers of physical medicine and pediatric rehabilitation of the French Red Cross (Paris and
      Lyon).

      Expected Results:

        -  Decreasing children's pain during botulinum toxin injections

        -  Decreasing anxiety in children and parents during injections

        -  Increasing coping skills in children

        -  Facilitating of the achievement of the therapeutic goal during injections
