    
      This is a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm, single-site study. The purpose of this
      exploratory study is to gain longitudinal insights into the relationships between the
      inflammatory profile, symptoms, lung function, and reliever use in subjects with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      The study will include a minimum of 8 clinic visits and consist of a Screening Visit (Visit
      1), a 4-week run-in period, a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and a 12-week observational period,
      including 6 visits scheduled every 2 weeks. To standardise the use of COPD medications all
      subjects will receive maintenance Duaklir and reliever Ventolin for the duration of the
      study. During the observational period, additional visits may occur if subjects experience a
      worsening of their COPD symptoms. For each individual subject, the duration of participation
      in the study will be 16 weeks.

      Estimated study duration is approximately 20 months including approximately 50 patients.
