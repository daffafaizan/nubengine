      tumor or lymphoma for which standard therapies have been exhausted. Part 1B will further
      assess safety and evaluate PK of FPA144 in gastric cancer patients.

      Part 2 patients will be enrolled and treated in order to further characterize safety and
      preliminary efficacy in a selected cancer patient population with the greatest potential for
      clinical benefit from FPA144 treatment.
