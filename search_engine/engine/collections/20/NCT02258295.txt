    
      Patients will be randomized and blinded into one of the two arms. Patients will receive 3
      injections total spaced over a 4 week period. After the injections are completed, patients
      will return for evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial injection. A total of 72
      patients will be divided into the 2 groups. The questionnaires will be administered by a
      research assistant blinded to the randomization. Three different outcomes measures will be
      collected, all patient-oriented including the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE),
      Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain while at rest and with maximum grip, and the short form
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (quickDASH).

      The primary outcome measure will be the VAS for pain at 3 months from the initial injection.
      All measures will be evaluated at baseline then again at 12 months from the initial
      injection.

      HA formulation will be Intragel (IBSA) which include 2cc with a concentration of 16mg per
      2cc. The molecular weight with Intragel averaging 800-1200 kiloDaltons.

      The syringes will be coded and the injections blinded. The injections will be given 1cm
      distal to the lateral epicondyle at the site of maximum tenderness. The needle will be
      introduced to the depth of the bone then withdrawn 1-2mm. The injection will be given in two
      locations in and around the point of maximum tenderness.
