      into two groups. Group A will receive one dose of Betamethasone at least 24 hours before
      scheduled C-section. Group B will receive placebo. The maternal and neonatal outcomes will be
      studied in order to assess the effect of Betamethasone on respiratory morbidity of the
      newborn infant.
