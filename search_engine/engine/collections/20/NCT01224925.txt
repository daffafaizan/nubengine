      in cases with pulpal exposure as a result of dental trauma both in animal and clinical
      studies. However, in carious exposures, follow-up studies of direct pulp capping performed
      with CH based materials have shown increasing failure rates and the outcome has been
      considered uncertain. Direct capping of carious exposures still remains a controversial
      treatment for mature teeth.

      A new material, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was introduced for root end filling material
      almost two decades ago. It is also suggested for pulp capping. MTA cement has showed good
      sealing ability and bio-compatibility in animal studies. Results from studies in humans
      corroborate the results from animal studies.

      Although the overall results of pulp capping in human studies using MTA are very positive,
      well designed and controlled clinical studies, especially involving carious exposures on
      adult teeth are lacking.At the time the present study was launched, there were no RCTs
      comparing MTA and CH as DPC materials and the histological evaluations have primarily been
      based on healthy teeth, thus undermining the generalizability of the results to adult
      patients with carious exposures.
