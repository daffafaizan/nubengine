      kidney disease is high blood pressure. Traditional approaches to control of hypertension
      (HTN) have mostly included pharmaceuticals targeting different mechanisms that contribute to
      HTN. However, adequate control of Blood pressure continues to remain a major problem.

      Sleep Apnea is currently being recognized as a modifiable risk factor for resistant HTN.
      Sleep disordered breathing represents states of increased sympathetic drive and vagal tone
      withdrawal, along with significant episodic hypoxia. There is increasing evidence that sleep
      apnea is highly prevalent in subjects with hypertension and may be a frequent cause of
      drug-resistant hypertension.

      We propose that we compare strategies for treating subjects with Resistant Hypertension who
      have SDB as detected by ambulatory multi somnogram and treat subjects using:

        1. Ambulatory Autotitrating Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) plus Standard medical therapy
           OR

        2. Traditional Polysomnogram and Traditional PSG guided titration of Continuous Positive
           Airway Pressure (CPAP) plus Standard medical therapy

      Our hypothesis is that in subjects with Resistant HTN, who have SDB, using the treatment
      approach of ambulatory multisomnography for testing and then treating with APAP will be
      noninferior to the traditional polysomnography plus CPAP approach in the amount of reduction
      of mean systolic and diastolic 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure, when treated for 90 days.
