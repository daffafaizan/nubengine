      the mainstay of cancer pain management,their efficacy in neuropathic pain seems to be less
      then optimal,and adjuvant drugs, mainly anticonvulsants and antidepressants,are often
      combined with opioids in the analgesic regimen of patients with neuropathic cancer pain. This
      approach is suggested by well-established guidelines, but the analgesic benefit and the
      safety of pregabalin and oxycodone in combination is not yet documented.

      The aim of this study is to assess the activity and tolerability of the addition of
      pregabalin to oxycodone in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain due to neoplasm.
