      adults ages 55 to 85 with symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. The Memory Boot Camp program
      incorporates neurofeedback, heart rate variability biofeedback, memory and cognitive
      training, and one-on-one coaching to encourage behavior change in diet, sleep, physical
      fitness, and stress reduction. Participants are evaluated via neurocognitive assessments,
      questionnaires, quantitative electroencephalography parameters, and heart rate variability
      parameters at four time points: baseline, pre-program, post-program, and follow-up. The trial
      included a 12-week waiting period between baseline and pre-program, such that each
      participant acts as their own control, and follow-up takes place six months after completion
      of the program.
