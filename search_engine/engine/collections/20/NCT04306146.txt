    
      This study will be conducted in two Parts. Part 1 will consist of Single Ascending Dose (SAD)
      cohorts that will be randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CAD-9303. Part 2 will consist of Multiple Ascending
      Dose (MAD) cohorts that will be randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled to assess
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CAD-9303. The effects of CAD-9303 will be
      explored on event-related potential (ERP), and on sensory and cognitive function. The first
      SAD cohort will be in healthy volunteer subjects. The remaining cohorts will be in
      participants with schizophrenia. Participants will meet specified eligibility criteria.

      SAD Cohorts will be comprised of 8 subjects; 6 subjects will be administered CAD-9303, and 2
      subjects will be administered matching placebo. MAD Cohorts will be comprised of 12 subjects;
      9 subjects will be administered CAD-9303, and 3 subjects will be administered matching
      placebo.

      Potential subjects will undergo a screening period (up to 28 days), baseline assessments on
      Day -3, -2 and -1, and dosing on Day 1 for SAD and Days 1 - 14 for MAD. A follow-up visit
      will occur 7 days after the last dose. The total duration of individual subject participation
      may be up to 5 weeks for SAD and 7 weeks for MAD, depending on the duration of the screening
      period.

      The study will assess safety by adverse events, vital signs, laboratory parameters (including
      chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) and electroencephalogram (EEG); pharmacokinetics of
      CAD-9303; and exploratory efficacy measures effects on neurophysiological biomarkers,
      cognitive and negative symptoms.
