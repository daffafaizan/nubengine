      sedation interruption protocol and routine continuous sedation in mechanically ventilation
      (MV) children.

      The study will be conducted in the twelve beds Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at the
      Montreal Children's Hospital, a pediatric tertiary care and teaching hospital.

      Patients will be enrolled prospectively within 24 hours of intubation and MV. After obtaining
      written consent patients will then be randomized to interrupted sedation or standard sedation
      protocol. The investigators will randomize using a computer-generated sequence of random
      numbers.

      A Sedation protocol will be used for both groups to adjust continuous infusions of
      sedatives/analgesics to a targeted Comfort-Behavior scale. In the intervention group,
      sedation infusions will be interrupted daily at 8:00 AM, this interruption will be continued
      until the patient is under-sedated according to the Comfort Behavior scale goals or in the
      presence of symptoms of hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress. Then the patient
      will receive a bolus of sedation and the infusion will be restarted at a dose 50% less than
      the previous dose to return to the Comfort Score goal.
