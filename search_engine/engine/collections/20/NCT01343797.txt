      subjects consume either 50 g of glucose in water (3 glucose response tests) or portion of
      syrup supply the equivalent of 50 g of glycaemic carbohydrates (2 syrup response tests).

      Experimental sessions last 3 hours with 9 veinous and capillary blood taking. The
      experimental meals are served at t0 and are consumed between 12 and 15 minutes maximum. At
      time -5, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes, glucose is measured out on capillary
      blood and insulin is measured out on venous blood.

      The glycemic index and Insulinemic index determination of the 2 syrups start by the
      calculation for each glycemia and insulinemia responses of the AUC over 120 min. The
      AUC(0-120min) is computed following the FAO recommendation (cf. FAO/WHO 1998), i.e. using the
      trapezoidal incremental method and not taking into account the area beneath the fasting
      concentration. then GI and II values expressed in percentage are calculated by dividing the
      AUC(0-120min) for test syrup products by the AUC(0-120min) for the glucose reference and
      multiplying by 100.
