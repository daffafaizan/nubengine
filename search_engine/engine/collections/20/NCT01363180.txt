      are (1) trauma group (3 levels: Control, Trauma Exposed with, and without PTSD) and (2)
      exposure to stress (2 levels: yes and no). To decrease intra-group variability, trauma type
      will be limited to interpersonal trauma. Potential participants will be screened over the
      phone. Those meeting basic eligibility criteria will complete an assessment at the MUSC
      Institute of Psychiatry, and those meeting final eligibility criteria will be scheduled for
      the laboratory session to be completed at the Clinical and Translational Research Center
      (CTRC).

      Half of each trauma history group will receive the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST); the other
      half will receive a no-stress control condition. Baseline and post-stress objective and
      subjective measures of stress reactivity will be collected. Following the stress task, all
      participants will be given a priming dose and subsequently presented with an alcohol taste
      test. The primary analyses will examine the effect of trauma group membership on response to
      stress and subsequent voluntary drinking. Based on power analyses using preliminary data from
      similar samples, a sample size of 240 participants (40 per cell) is required.
