    
      This is a prospective, paired, randomized, cross-over design, with two groups: current
      standard of care using the USAISR Burn Center insulin titration nomogram (Appendix A) and
      insulin management using EndoTool™ (MD Scientific, LLC) decision support software. Patients
      will thus serve as their own controls.

      Upon admission to the burn ICU, patients expected to require continuous insulin infusion for
      a minimum of 7 days will be placed on EndoTool™ CDSS for the first 24 hours of glycemic
      management. At the 24 hour mark the patients will be randomly assigned to either the CDSS or
      standard of care group in pairs. Thus, the first subject will be randomized to a group and
      the second subject will be placed in the alternate group. This method will ensure equal
      numbers of patients are enrolled in each group to eliminate bias of timing of intervention
      due to the effect of increasing insulin resistance over time demonstrated in the burn
      population (Pidcoke, unpublished, USAISR).
