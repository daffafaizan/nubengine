      Extension Phase (48 weeks). During the Randomization Phase, participants received either
      Troriluzole 140 mg or matching placebo up to 8 weeks. Participants who agreed to enter the
      Extension Phase continued dosing of Troriluzole 140 mg for 48 weeks. The study was
      subsequently amended to follow participants for a total of 192 weeks in the Extension Phase.
