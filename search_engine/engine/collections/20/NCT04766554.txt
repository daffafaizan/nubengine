      care of patients with heart disease and the development of new surgical techniques,
      neurological dysfunction continues to be one of the complications of the greatest concern in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Brain injury can manifest
      itself through permanent or temporary injury, contributing to the increase in-hospital
      mortality, in the length of stay in intensive care, in the length of hospital stay, to a
      higher incidence of motor dysfunction requiring rehabilitation, and consequently, to reduced
      quality of life.

      Even though the causes of brain injury are multifactorial, perioperative cerebral
      hypoperfusion, tissue hypoxia, and thromboembolic events are among the main factors related
      to neurological dysfunction.

      Several clinical studies have indicated an association between cerebral desaturation and the
      increase of neurological complications. Cerebral oximetry monitoring using near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique used to estimate regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation (rSO2) and has been associated with diminishing the incidence of neurological
      complications.

      There is no consensus in the literature about its real benefit, mainly due to the absence of
      well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that cerebral desaturation associated with
      intervention measures to improve rSO2, are related to the prevention of neurological
      dysfunction in adult cardiac surgery.

      The study hypothesis evaluates whether continuous monitoring of cerebral oximetry improves
      the neurocognitive outcome in coronary artery bypass surgery when associated with early
      interventions to optimize rSO2.
