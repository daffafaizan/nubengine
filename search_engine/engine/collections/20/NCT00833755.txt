        1. Chronic pain patients on chronic opioids would have a lower pain threshold and lower
           pain tolerance when compared to opioid na√Øve patients (patients with chronic pain with
           non-opioids treatment)., as measured by QST in a non-affected neutral limb;

        2. Chronic pain patients on chronic opioids would have an increased response to painful
           stimulation, so called "windup" as demonstrated by QST;

        3. Both "wind-up" and altered pain threshold and tolerance would be indicative of the
           presence of opioid-induced hyperalgesia;

        4. Intravenous ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, could be used to differentiate
           between opioid-induced hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance.
