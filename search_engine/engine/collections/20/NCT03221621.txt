    
      The primary objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial in a real life setting is
      to evaluate the cost-utility of limumab monotherapy (Group A) with the combination of
      adalimumab and a maximum of three surgeries (Group B) years of treatment in adult patients
      with moderate to severe HS.

      Patients in group A will be treated with adalimumab monotherapy according to normal clinical
      practice and will be given the possibility to crossover into Group B when they do not achieve
      the HiSCR after 6 months of treatment. Additionally patients will be offered treatment with
      infliximab, according to clinical practice, until the last surgery. Patients in group B will
      receive adalimumab combined with a maximum of three adjuvant excisions of active lesions,
      both according to routine clinical practice.
