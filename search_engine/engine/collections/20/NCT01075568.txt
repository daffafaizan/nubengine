      The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two meals, 48 gram Okara or 40 gram
      (similar caloric value) semolina in two occasions (two visits). After the eating, the subject
      will stay in a closed room, without watch or any irritation. After three hours, the patient
      will fill a VAS questionnaire, and will get a standard meal. The meal will be weighed before
      and after.

      Okara is a natural water extracted food grade soy product, contains approximately 35% protein
      (mfb), and about 43% of dietary fibers.
