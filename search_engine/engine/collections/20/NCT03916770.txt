    
      Patients with a stroke of at least 1 month before and with a history of ankle plantar flexion
      spasticity will be included in the study. Conventional rehabilitation program will be applied
      to all patients (n=48).The intervention group (n=24) will be applied for 4 weeks, 2 days a
      week, a total of 8 sessions with the WBV powerplate pro5 device.(Vibration frequency: 30
      Hertz(Hz), amplitude: 2.2 mm and duration 1x10 seconds (starting period) + 3x30 seconds).The
      Sham control group (n=24) will have 8 sessions WBV in total, the same time,.with the same
      frequency but 99.5% weakened amplitude.The surface Electromyography (EMG) and degree of
      spasticity of soleus muscle will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the all sessions.
      Soleus T-reflex and soleus H-reflex will be recorded with surface EMG.To obtain the H-reflex
      response, the posterior tibial nerve in the popliteal region will be stimulated by using a
      stimulator (FE155 Stimulator HC ADInstrument, Oxford UK) with 1 ms-pulse current. The records
      will be taken with the Ag / AgCl electrodes (Kendall Â®Coviden, self-adhesive electrodes)
      placed on skin according to the SENIAM protocol. To obtain T reflex response, an electronic
      reflex hammer (Elcon 100-150 Germany) will be used.The degree of spasticity will be measured
      as a soleus muscle tone torque on a fixed angular velocity moving platform.The data will be
      recorded with the PowerLab data acquisition device
