      diagnosis, treatment and surveillance. Although exploring tumour clonal heterogeneity and
      microenvironment can help understand cancer evolution and impact therapeutic outcome, study
      is still lacking in this field on MPLC. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are short DNA
      fragments, which can be obtained conveniently and non-invasively, providing comprehensive
      views of the tumor as were shed by tumor cells from multiple tumor regions. Therefore, we
      design a prospective study of patients with surgically treated MPLC, aiming to use ctDNA
      technique to define the evolutionary landscape of MPLC through inter-tumor and intra-tumor
      heterogeneity by multi-region sampling and genetic analysis. We will also explore the the
      microenvironment by RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. This study may help
      understand the genetic evolution and microenvironment of MPLC, and provide evidence for the
      diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of these patients.
