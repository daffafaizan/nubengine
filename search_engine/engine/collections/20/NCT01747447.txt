      VITAL. This study has enrolled a sub-cohort of 771 VITAL participants at the NIH-sponsored
      Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC). The following measurements
      will be performed at baseline and 2 years post-randomization to determine whether high-dose
      vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo: 1) produces small increases or reduces bone loss in
      spine, hip, and total body areal bone density as assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA);
      2) reduces bone turnover as assessed by biomarkers of bone resorption and formation; 3)
      improves (a) volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and measures of bone structure as
      assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and (b) bone microarchitecture
      as assessed by high resolution pQCT (HR-pQCT) at the distal radius and tibia as well as
      trabecular bone score (TBS) at the spine; and 4) results in changes in body composition as
      assessed by DXA. Parallel assessments of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids will be
      performed. This study may elucidate the mechanisms through which high-dose vitamin D may
      prevent age-related fractures and provide new insights into the role of vitamin D on skeletal
      health and body composition.

      We are currently analyzing the effects of daily dietary supplements of fish oil (1 gram of
      omega-3 fatty acids) vs. placebo on skeletal health and body composition.
