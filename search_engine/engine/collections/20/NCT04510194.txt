    
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading viral
      infection causing COVID-19 disease. There currently is no definitive preventive or early
      outpatient treatment therapy for Covid-19. Six observational studies have found decreased
      severity of Covid-19 disease among persons with metformin use before diagnosis with Covid-19:

        1. Cariou et al, Diabetologia, adults with diabetes (DM) in France: OR mortality 0.59
           (0.42, 0.84)

        2. Crouse et al, medrxiv.org adults with DM at Univ of Alabama Birmingham: OR mortality
           0.33 (0.13-0.84)

        3. Bramante et al, Lancet Healthy Longevity, females with DM or obesity, claims data from
           50 US5 states: OR mortality 0.759 (0.601, 0.960) by propensity matching; OR 0.785
           (0.650, 0.951) by Cox model.

        4. Lou et al, Am J Trop Med, adults with diabetes in China, OR for survival: 4.36
           (1.22-15.59)

        5. Bramante et al. Under review, in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and
           +SARS-CoV-2, OR for admission: 0.42 (0.18-1.01, p=0.05).

        6. Bramante et al. Under review, in adults with Covid-19, OR for admission 0.46
           (0.27-0.80), p<0.01; mortality, OR 0.49 (0.26-0.94); and metformin was associated with
           lower IL-6 (non-significant) lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and CPR, and equivalent
           lactate and bicarbonate as non-metformin.

      Kow, J Med Virol conducted a meta analysis, with an overall odds ratio for mortality of 0.62
      (0.43-0.89).

      Gordon et al found decreased SARS-CoV-2 and increased cell viability with metformin in vitro.
      (Gordon et al, Nature). While anti-viral activity may be contributing to the observational
      associations of reduced severity of Covid-19, metformin has a proven history of beneficial
      immune-modulatory effects, including on CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, neutrophil extracellular
      traps, and improved T cell immunity. Outpatient metformin use has now been associated with
      lower IL-6, CRP, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in persons with Covid-19.

      While vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has been promising, there may be reduced willingness
      among the public to receive a vaccine developed so quickly. This is a substudy with
      laboratory outcomes (70 patients will be enrolled). The intervention is metformin, a
      biguanide, administered in its immediate release formation, 1,500mg daily.
