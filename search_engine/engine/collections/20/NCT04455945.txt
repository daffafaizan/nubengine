      cancer in our clinic between January 2017 and December 2018 will be evaluated for suitability
      for the study. During the preoperative examination, patients will be informed about the study
      and their written consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomized between open and
      laparoscopic groups in the ratio 2:1, depending on the type of surgery. Clinical data of
      patients will be analyzed from the hospital database programme.

      The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29 questionnaires prepared by The European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) will be used to evaluate the quality of life after
      the operation. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be completed by examining the patients'
      daily observation notes. EORTC QLQ-CR29 will be completed with face to face interviews in the
      first year after surgery.

      In this way, it will be aimed to compare the early and long-term quality of life (HRQoL)
      results of open and laparoscopic approach in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer.
