      in obese children and adolescents with marked obesity. This condition tends to progress to
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) at an alarmingly rapid tempo. The increased prevalence of
      childhood and adolescent obesity and greater risk of IGT, and progression to diabetes, in
      this population set the stage for a series of studies aimed at understanding the metabolic
      phenotype and natural history of pre-diabetes in obese youth. The investigators found that
      obese children and adolescents with IGT are characterized by marked insulin resistance
      related to altered lipid partitioning, favoring lipid deposition in the visceral and
      intramyocellular compartment. Furthermore, the investigators found an impairment of the acute
      insulin response in these youngsters. Follow-up revealed a rapid deterioration from IGT to
      frank diabetes. Based on these studies, there is a strong rationale for changing the balance
      between visceral and subcutaneous fat and muscle lipid content in a more favorable pattern in
      order to improve insulin sensitivity.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine, in a group of ethnically diverse
      children and adolescents with IGT, whether treatment with rosiglitazone leads to improvements
      in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Secondary objectives are to determine whether
      rosiglitazone is safe and well tolerated.
