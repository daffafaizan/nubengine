      vegetables. Real-time incentives for purchasing fruits and vegetables are promising
      strategies to improve families' diets and health.

           on FV consumption among adults and their children ,shopping habits, home food
           environments, diet quality, and weight/BMI

        3. To adapt mobile platform technology to provide regular feedback to participants to
           motivate use of the incentive program to increase purchases and consumption of fruits
           and vegetables

        4. To evaluate participant satisfaction with real-time healthy food choice incentives
           technology in both SNAP participants and income-eligible non-SNAP participants
