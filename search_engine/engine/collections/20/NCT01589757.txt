      Association in treatment of type 1 and 2 DM, but is not included in the clinical practice
      guidelines(CPG) for management of GDM. Data collected to date support use of low GI in
      treatment of GDM, but more data are needed to influence CPG. In this study the effect of a
      low GI diet on maternal and neonatal markers of glycaemic control and postpartum diabetes
      risk in mother and baby will be determined. This study will also assess the role that
      maternal oxidative stress may play in this relationship.

      Hypothesis: The use of low-GI foods in the management of GDM reduces postprandial BG and
      oxidative stress; thereby reducing maternal and infant perinatal complications.

      SUB-STUDY: Breast milk (BM) is accepted as the optimal source of nutrition for infants. A
      wealth of literature on BM composition exists. This work includes measurement of antioxidants
      in BM. Women diagnosed with gestational hyperglycaemia have decreased antioxidant capacity in
      comparison to normoglycaemic pregnant women. A direct relationship exists between
      postprandial glycaemic response and oxidative stress. Low GI carbohydrate is converted to
      blood glucose (BG) more slowly than medium to high GI carbohydrate

      Hypotheses: Breast milk (BM) of women with GDM consuming a low GI diet will have higher BM
      antioxidant than women receiving the medium to high GI diet. BM of women with GDM will have
      lower anti-oxidant capacity than that of women without GDM.
