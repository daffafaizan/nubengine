    
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a condition of several causes resulting in the
      backward flow of gastric contents into the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter.
      The prevalence of GERD in the pediatric population is increasingly becoming recognized and
      documented. It is a disease that may persist through adulthood, with symptoms in older
      children and adolescents similar to those seen in adults.

      Younger children generally present with extra-esophageal manifestations, regurgitation, and
      epigastric pain, while older children and adolescents typically present with adult-type GERD
      symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment for GERD is aimed at improving symptoms
      and healing esophageal inflammation.

      Takeda Global Research & Development Center, Inc. (TGRD) developed dexlansoprazole delayed
      release capsules as a new therapy for treating acid related disorders including symptomatic
      non-erosive GERD, healing of erosive esophagitis (EE) and maintenance of healed EE.

      Dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules have not been studied in subjects younger than 12
      years of age. This study is designed to evaluate the safety of dexlansoprazole delayed
      release capsules in the pediatric population (1 to 11 years old) and to determine if the PK
      profile of dexlansoprazole in subjects 1 to 11 years of age is similar to that in adults
      given a similar dose.

      Subjects who satisfy the screening evaluation and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria may be
      enrolled in the study. Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of three treatment groups.
      Attempts will be made to enroll an equal number of male and female subjects in each treatment
      group.
