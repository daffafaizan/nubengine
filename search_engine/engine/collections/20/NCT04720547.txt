      apnea (CSA). However, evidence regarding the efficacy of zolpidem and the underlying
      mechanisms involved in its effect on CSA are not well-studied. Furthermore,
      respiratory-related arousals are hypothesized to contribute CSA symptoms and severity. The
      aim of the study is to determine the effect of decreasing respiratory-related arousals on the
      propensity to develop central apnea. The investigators hypothesize that administration of the
      nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem will decrease the frequency of respiratory-related
      arousals, lower the central apnea-hypopnea index, and widen the CO2 reserve during sleep in
      patients with CSA compared to no treatment. Participants will complete a night study on a low
      dose of zolpidem and another night study without zolpidem in a crossover manner. The order of
      night studies is randomized. The results will help unveil the role of arousals in CSA and the
      acute effect of zolpidem on CSA severity and the propensity to CSA.
