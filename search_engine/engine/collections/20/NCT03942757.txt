      treatment of jaundice in the preterm infant.

      This study is a prospective, monocentric, observational study. Preterm infant < 35 weeks of
      gestation with a jaundice requiring phototherapy according to NICE guidelines can be included
      for the duration of the phototherapy treatment.

      The decrease in bilirubin serum level before and after phototherapy treatment will be
      measured.

      This decrease in bilirubin serum level will be assessed for two consecutive periods before
      and after an educational program on jaundice management of the preterm infant.

      The investigators aim at demonstrating that an educational program could improve phototherapy
      management and result in a higher decrease in bilirubin serum during treatment of the preterm
      infant with jaundice.
