      patients admitted into a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory illnesses have
      been identified as the leading principal admission diagnosis in every age group, accounting
      for 37.9% of patients under 12 months of age and 28.5% of PICU patients across all age
      groups. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is important for the guidance of
      respiratory support escalation and de-escalation decisions in the PICU. A clinical metric
      that has been suggested as a signature of breathing effort is thoracoabdominal asynchrony
      (TAA), the non-coincident motion of the rib cage and abdomen during breathing. A reliable,
      objective assessment tool for continuous monitoring of respiratory effort could allow for a
      more complete understanding of patients' real-time respiratory status and provide an
      additional indication or contraindication for the utilization of various levels of
      respiratory support. Limiting the use of invasive ventilatory support by early detection of
      respiratory distress would decrease clinical risk to patients and has the potential to
      decrease the cost of patient stays in the PICU. The investigators have developed a
      non-invasive TAA-sensing device designed for use by clinicians to indirectly quantify
      respiratory effort among pediatric patients (henceforth referred to as the "TAA-monitoring
      device"). The device utilizes motion-tracking sensors that capture data that is then
      processed to provide a quantitative indication of a patient's respiratory status. Given the
      promising yet inconclusive nature of the evidence supporting the use of TAA as an indicator
      of respiratory effort, clinical validation of this device is a necessary step to take to
      support its continued development.
