    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose study
      to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and exploratory efficacy of JK07 in
      HF subjects 18 to 80 years of age with LVEF â‰¤40%. Subjects must have been maintained on an
      optimal HF medical regimen for at least 3 months prior to enrollment and remain on the same
      treatment regimen throughout the course of the study, per the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA) treatment
      guidelines.

      At screening, eligible subjects will undergo a physical examination, 2-dimensional
      transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE), ECG assessment, blood sampling for laboratory
      parameters, and urine testing. Safety assessments at screening will include hematology,
      biochemistry, coagulation, liver, and thyroid function.

      Subjects will be observed in the hospital on continuous telemetry from the time of hospital
      admission until shortly before discharge approximately 48 hours later. During this time, they
      will additionally have safety labs, vital signs, PK and biomarker samples collected, and ECGs
      and 2D-TTEs performed.

      Only a single dose of the investigational product will be administered and only a single
      hospital admission is planned per subject during the study. Subjects will complete follow-up
      visits through 180 days after administration of the investigational product.
