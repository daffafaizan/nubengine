      with moderate to severe acute pain, and require intravenous pain medication. Participants
      will be double-blinded and randomized to one of the two treatment groups.

      Investigators aim to determine if ketamine 0.15 mg/kg IVPB is non-inferior to ketamine 0.3
      mg/kg IVBP for the treatment of acute moderate to severe pain in the Emergency Department
      (ED). Study investigators hypothesize that in adults presenting to the ED with moderate to
      severe acute pain, SDK administered at 0.15 mg/kg will provide similar pain relief to SDK at
      0.3 mg/kg, with reduced adverse effects.
