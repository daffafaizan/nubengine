    
      TREATMENT:

      Patients will be randomised 1:1:1 to one of the following groups:

      Group I - Ferinject ® and EPO treatment group 25 patients will be randomised to the Ferinject
      and EPO treatment group.

      For each patient, the cumulative total iron requirement will be calculated using the formula
      of Ganzoni [Ganzoni et al, 1970]:

      Iron deficit [mg] = b.w. [kg]† x (target Hb - actual Hb) [g/L] x 0.24†† + depot iron [mg]

      † In patients with a body mass index (BMI = weight [kg] / (height [m] x height [m])) >25, a
      normalised weight will be used to calculate the iron deficit. Normalised weight [kg] = 25 x
      height [m] x height [m].

      †† Factor 0.24 = 0.0034 (iron content Hb = 0.34%) * 0.07 (blood volume = 7% of b.w.) * 1000
      (conversion g to mg) Target Hb: 150 g/L Actual Hb: Value obtained at screening visit Depot
      iron: 500 mg

      Patients will receive a first dose of 1000 mg iron as Ferinject® 21 days prior to the
      scheduled surgery. Patients will receive Ferinject® once weekly for up to two occasions (Day
      -21 and Day -14) until the calculated cumulative dose is reached for that individual. The Day
      -14 infusion may not be necessary, depending on the calculated total iron requirement for
      each patient. Patients in treatment group 1 will get additionally a single 10000 IU dose of
      EPO together on treatment day -14.

      Group II - Ferinject ® treatment group 25 patients will be randomised to the Ferinject
      without EPO.

      For each patient, the cumulative total iron requirement will be calculated using the formula
      of Ganzoni [Ganzoni et al, 1970]:

      Iron deficit [mg] = b.w. [kg]† x (target Hb - actual Hb) [g/L] x 0.24†† + depot iron [mg]

      † In patients with a body mass index (BMI = weight [kg] / (height [m] x height [m])) >25, a
      normalised weight will be used to calculate the iron deficit. Normalised weight [kg] = 25 x
      height [m] x height [m].

      †† Factor 0.24 = 0.0034 (iron content Hb = 0.34%) * 0.07 (blood volume = 7% of b.w.) *1000
      (conversion g to mg) Target Hb: 150 g/L Actual Hb: Value obtained at screening visit Depot
      iron: 500 mg

      Patients will receive a first dose of 1000 mg iron as Ferinject 21 days prior to the
      scheduled surgery. Patients will receive Ferinject® once weekly for up to two occasions (Day
      -21 and Day -14) until the calculated cumulative dose is reached for that individual. The Day
      -14 infusion may not be necessary, depending on the calculated total iron requirement for
      each patient.

      Group III - Control group 25 patients will receive the standard treatment for this patient
      population (no anaemia treatment).

      Primary Efficacy Endpoints

      • Hb increase from baseline till day of surgery

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

        -  Percentage of patients reaching an Hb of > 12 g/dl (women) or of > 13 g/dl (men) at any
           point in time during the study

        -  Change in Hb level from baseline to highest Hb level during the study

        -  Change in Ferritin value from baseline to highest ferritin value during the study

        -  Change in Tsat value from baseline to highest Tsat value during the study

        -  Transfusion rate

        -  Infection rate

        -  Days until discharge from hospital

        -  Days until rehabilitation therapy

      Secondary Safety Endpoints:

        -  Adverse events: type, nature, incidence and outcome

        -  Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and heart rate)

        -  Clinical laboratory panels (haematology/coagulation, clinical chemistry, except Hb and
           iron status, which are considered to be efficacy endpoints)

      Laboratory parameters:

      Hematology/coagulation parameters to be analysed are Hb, haematocrit (Hct), red blood cell
      count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC) with differential and platelet count, mean
      corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin
      concentration (MCHC).

      Clinical chemistry parameters to be analysed are alkaline phosphatase (AP), gamma-glutamyl
      transpeptidase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
      C-reactive protein (CRP), endogenous erythropoietin.

      Iron status parameters include serum iron, serum ferritin, serum transferrin and TSAT.

      Additional parameters - folic acid, vitamin B12 and beta-HCG will be analysed at baseline
      only, creatinin, soluble transferrin receptor and total bilirubin will be analysed at all
      visits.

      Statistical Methods:

      Summary statistics will be provided for safety and efficacy parameters as well as for the
      patients' demographic characteristics. Data will be presented per visit, if appropriate. The
      test for the primary endpoint is confirmative. Statistical tests of secondary endpoints will
      be employed for exploratory purposes to highlight interesting comparisons (e.g., baseline
      versus end of study) that may warrant further consideration. Unless otherwise specified, the
      significance level of all statistical tests will be 5% with a two-sided alternative. If
      appropriate, corresponding 95%-confidence intervals will be calculated. The sample size
      estimation is based on t-test calculation.

      Continuous variables will be summarized as mean +/- SD and median with range where
      appropriate. Continuous variables will be compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
      pairwise Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni-correction. Nominal variables will be compared
      using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Changes within groups of
      nominal variables will be analyzed using McNemar test.

      Changes within groups of continuous variables will be analyzed using the Friedman test
      followed by pairwise post hoc comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni
      correction. Prevalence of anaemia will be presented with exact confidence interval (CI).
      Continuous variables will be transformed to normal distribution, and CIs for the mean will be
      computed. The limits of these CIs then will be retransformed to the original units and
      interpreted as CIs for the median.
