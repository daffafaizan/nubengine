      of a normal day-night rhythm negatively influences metabolic and cardiovascular health,
      possibly leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An important hallmark of
      obesity and T2DM is a decreased skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Interestingly, recent
      research indicates that also skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is under the influence of
      a day-night rhythm. In this study, the presence of a day-night rhythm in skeletal muscle
      energy metabolism (in particular mitochondrial function) of overweight prediabetic
      participants will be investigated. During this study, subjects will stay at the research unit
      for 44 hours, with standardized meals and sleeping time. Five muscle biopsies (v. lateralis)
      and frequent blood draws will be taken. In addition, indirect calorimetry measurements will
      be performed.
