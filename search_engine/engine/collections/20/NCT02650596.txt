      peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and has direct
      effects on the cardiovascular system. In our previous study, the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide
      could improve left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
      However, the effects of GLP-1 on chronic heart failure patients with type 2 diabetes remain
      unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on left ventricular
      function in chronic heart failure patients with type 2 diabetes.
