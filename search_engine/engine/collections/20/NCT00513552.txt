    
      Clinical remission will be determined by a decline in the Crohns disease activity index to
      <151; clinical improvement will be examined using the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      quality of life questionnaire; and endoscopic improvement will be examined using a Crohn's
      disease endoscopic activity index. All individuals must have had colonoscopy within 3 months
      of enrollment. An estimated 20 individuals will be enrolled in this protocol. Each patient
      will be treated for 6 months with a combination of rifabutin, clarithromycin, and
      clofazimine. At the end of 6 months of treatment for each patient, the Crohns disease
      activity index will be recalculated, each patient will again complete the IBD quality of life
      questionnaire, and each patient will undergo repeat colonoscopy.
