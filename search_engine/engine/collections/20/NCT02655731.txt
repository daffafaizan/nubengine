      substrate (e.g. low-voltage areas; LVA) is a matter of controversy.

      Results of studies investigating the impact of LVA may have been confounded by
      PV-to-left-atrial (LA) reconnection due to non-durable ablation. Therefore, the true
      contribution of LA-LVA to AF recurrences remains unknown.

      Meanwhile, new ablation technologies such as the HeartLight™ laser balloon (LB) ablation
      system providing near complete chronic PVI rates have been developed.

      Aim of the present prospective, single-centre study is to determine the outcome after pure
      PVI using HeartLight™ in 100 patients with different extents of LA-LVA.

      The latter will be assessed by an electro-anatomical voltage map using a commercial 3D
      mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster).
