      lower their immune systems to help protect the donated kidney. The medications have improved
      over the years and as a result the donated kidneys are generally working longer. This allows
      the Transplant Team to focus more on the long term complications of kidney transplantation
      such as cardiovascular disease.

      There have been few prospective (looking forward) research studies looking at kidney
      transplant recipient cardiovascular risk factors after transplant.

      We know that immunosuppressive medications have a number of serious side effects that can
      increase cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, high lipids (fats
      in the blood), and high blood sugar. Medications such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine and
      prednisone work well to protect the donated kidney but are also known to increase the risk of
      developing or worsening cardiovascular disease.

      CellCept is another type of immunosuppressive agent. CellCept is not associated as much with
      the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

      This is a pilot study being done to collect information about cardiovascular risk factors in
      kidney transplant recipients and to see if adjusting the immunosuppressive medications can
      help to lower the overall risk for developing heart disease in the future.

      This research study plans to enroll 45 participants from 2 different transplant centres in
      Canada: St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon. The study
      duration is approximately 7 months per participant. The study will be looking for
      participants who are 30 years of age or older and who are at least 6 months after the
      transplant operation.
