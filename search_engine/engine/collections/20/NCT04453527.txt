    
      This study is an observational cross-sectional and cohort study to assess whether there is
      evidence of increased complement activation and/or LTB4 levels and other parameters of
      inflammation and a pro-coagulative state in adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19
      compared to healthy controls and also whether these measures differ with increasing severity
      of respiratory failure.

      Blood samples (serum and plasma) will be obtained from each participant at the time of
      recruitment into the trial, to assess the profile of complement activation, cytokines/
      chemokines, leukotrienes (specifically leukotriene B4) and markers of coagulation and
      inflammation in patients with COVID-19.

      Participants within the cohort study will be recruited at the point of admission or as close
      to it as possible. Baseline sampling will be performed at time of recruitment. There will be
      up to 2 additional sampling points (with not more than one sample per day) if there is any
      worsening of the participants respiratory failure (i.e. deteriorating from mild to moderate
      or moderate to severe disease).

      Patients just admitted to hospital will be asked to consent for both the case control and the
      cohort study

      Data will be collected at baseline for all participants and then again at each further
      sampling point for the participants within the cohort study.

      Patient status will be measured at 14 days from the last point of sampling.
