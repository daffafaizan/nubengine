      mutation is F508del, which is found in >85% of patients followed in the US CF Patient
      Registry. Two CFTR corrector drugs (elexacaftor and tezacaftor) plus the potentiator
      ivacaftor have been developed and approved as a triple combination therapy for CF patients
      (12 years old and above) with one or two copies of the F508del mutation. We predict that over
      90% of pediatric CF patients (age 6-11 y/o) will be eligible for highly effective CFTR
      modulator therapy in the U.S.

      The PROMISE Pediatric Study is designed to measure the direct and indirect CFTR dependent
      anion secretion by collecting and analyzing clinical research outcomes and biomarkers on
      pediatric patients both before and after they begin treatment with ETI. This study will
      investigate the impact of ETI across a wide range of CF disease manifestations and organ
      systems. While specific biomarkers of special interest have been selected for detailed
      analysis in this study, an additional important goal is to collect blood, urine, stool, and
      airway epithelial cell specimens for long-term storage in a biorepository to enable future
      research. These samples can be made available for research beyond the current scope of work.
      The PROMISE Pediatric Study will provide a coordinated collection of clinical research
      outcomes data that can be linked with these specimens.
