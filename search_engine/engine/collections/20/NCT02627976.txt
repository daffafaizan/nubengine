      and/or radiotherapy for breast cancer are offered treatment with a compression vest. These
      patients will be followed for 6 months. Recruitment will continue until 20 active vest users
      are participating.

      Primary endpoint is the course of patient reported pain over a 6 month period. Secondary
      endpoints are the course of degree of breast edema and quality of life over a 6 month period.

      Patients who are wearing the vest may experience relief of breast edema related symptoms. In
      terms of burden, they might experience a tight feeling on the skin while wearing the vest,
      which could also be the case when treated with compression therapy and taping by a physical
      therapist. This tight feeling can be overcome by changing the vest to a larger size. All
      patients will fill out questionnaires upon inclusion, at 2 weeks, and 1, 3 and 6 months. This
      will take approximately 10-15 minutes per follow-up moment. Patients will have to visit the
      hospital at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after they started wearing the vest (i.e. 25
      minute consult with physical examination, photo documentation of the breast and short basic
      follow-up questions), and it is expected that additional measurements for fitting a new
      compression vest will need to be taken 2-5 times during participation in the study. Those
      fitting measurements will be performed at a location as desired by the patient (e.g. UMC
      Utrecht or at patients' home).
