        -  Determine the objective response and duration of objective response in patients with
           advanced small cell lung cancer treated with nitrocamptothecin.

        -  Determine the probability of objective response as expressed by the response rate in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease status
      (sensitive vs refractory).

      Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily for 5 consecutive days each week for 3 weeks.
      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) receive up to
      4 additional courses past SD. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response
      (CR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses past CR or PR.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of another
      antitumor treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for the sensitive disease
      stratum and a total of 19-24 patients will be accrued for the refractory disease stratum
