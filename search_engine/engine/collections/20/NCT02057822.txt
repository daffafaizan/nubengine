      keratoconjunctivitis. It has been shown that inflammatory cytokines produced by the cells
      themselves and the constituent cells of the target organ, are the main factors that cause
      inflammation. The main objective of our study was to compare the concentration of 40
      cytokines in vernal keratoconjunctivitis and in control subjects.
