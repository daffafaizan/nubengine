    
      Prostate Cancer (PCa) is a complex disease and not all patients respond to every treatment
      available.

      This study aims to investigate new clinical tests based on simple and routine blood tests to
      allow men with PCa and their doctors to choose the correct treatment for their metastatic
      PCa.

      In this way, only men likely to respond to the specific treatment will be chosen, sparing
      unnecessary or prolonged treatment for those who will not respond and allowing them to avail
      of alternative therapies likely to have more benefit. This is termed personalised therapy.

      The study will perform research on biological elements present in the blood including
      deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and circulating tumour cells
      (CTCs) which are cancer cells that have spread beyond the prostate gland and can be found
      floating in the blood. Clinical data will be correlated to research findings to form
      conclusions on personalised therapy.

      Additional optional sub studies include; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a biopsy of
      another tumour in a different site of their body such as bone, lung or liver (metastatic
      biopsy), metastatic biopsy only and biopsies of the fluid of solid part of the bone. These
      optional components provide more detailed information on prostate cancer and how men are
      responding to treatment. The research results from these optional sub studies will be
      correlated with the research analysis from the blood samples and clinical data and will help
      to make treatment decisions.
