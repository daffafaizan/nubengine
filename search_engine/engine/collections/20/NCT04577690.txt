      infiltration by the EP cardiologist or a Pectoral nerve block (PECS) on an ad-hoc basis
      depending on the anaesthesiologist on a case by case basis. It is not known whether one
      technique provides better post- operative pain control and fewer adverse events than the
      other. In either case, the patient receives opioids as required during and after the
      procedure. Patients typically go home with a prescription for opioids to be taken for the
      first few days after surgery.

      The PECS block is a recognized effective anaesthetic technique used for both intraoperative
      and postoperative pain control in adult breast surgery, chest wall procedures as well as one
      case report for CIED implantation and a small series in paediatric cardiac surgery. The
      advantages of the PECS block in these surgical procedures includes improved analgesia and
      reduced opioid use.

      The investigators plan to conduct an RCT with two groups.

      Group 1 will receive a PECS block (using 0.8 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:
      200000 divided in two equal volumes between the two planes) by the anaesthesiologist and
      local infiltration (up to 0.2 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200000) by the
      surgeon.

      Group 2 will receive local infiltration (up to 0.8 ml/kg 0.25 % bupivacaine with epinephrine
      1:200000) by the surgeon alone.

      Both groups will be given opioids as rescue analgesics as deemed necessary during their
      procedure and as rescue analgesia postoperatively, so that no patient will have untreated
      pain.
