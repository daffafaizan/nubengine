    
      Non invasive neuromodulation therapy for children with the overactive bladder syndrome is a
      highly under investigated topic in medical literature.

      Only 2 studies ( Patidar et al. and Boudaouid et al.) investigated the use of tibial nerve
      stimulation with adhesive electrodes.

      1) In the first trial the superiority of TTNS vs.Sham therapy for the therapeutic management
      of children with OAB naive to any pharmacological treatment will be examined.

      Clinical outcomes will be assessed by the use of daytime and nighttime bladder diaries.

      Assessment of outcomes at baseline, after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment, and
      investigation of mean time to partial or complete relapse following 6 weeks observation.

      After a wash-out period of 6 weeks, patients from the part I Sham group will be able to be
      included for TaPaS part II.
