    
      Subjects will undergo three weeks (two intervention, one washout) of testing during which
      they will participate in two conditions: 1) prolonged sitting (~14-hours/day) with a 1-hour
      bout of acute exercise at 65% of pre-intervention VO2max and 2) prolonged sitting
      (~14-hours/day) without an acute bout of exercise. During each intervention week, subjects
      will have 2 days of dietary and activity control, followed by 4 days during which prolonged
      sitting will occur. On the evening of the 4th day, subjects in the exercise group will
      perform the acute bout of exercise. On day 5, all subjects will undergo a lipid tolerance
      test to determine the body's ability to clear triglycerides from the blood as well as
      insulin/glucose response and substrate oxidation. Blood samples will be assayed for the
      previously mentioned substances and postprandial gas collection will be analyzed via indirect
      calorimetry.
