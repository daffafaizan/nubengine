      as myopic optic neuropathy (MON) and glaucoma. It was estimated that there were 163 million
      people who have high myopia in 2000, and the population with high myopia would increase to
      almost one billion (9.8% of the world population) worldwide by 2050.

      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide while it is difficult to
      distinguish glaucoma among MON in high myopia eyes. However, there lack longitudinal study to
      illustrate the natural course interpreting the distribution and natural history of MON.

      In view of the above problems, this is a longitudinal registry cohort study to observe the
      long-term changes of structural and functional parameters of MON in high myopia, and to
      investigate the natural course and associted risk factors that influence the progression in a
      Chinese adult population.
