        -  Determine the feasibility of video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection (VAR) followed
           by radiotherapy in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer and cardiopulmonary
           dysfunction.

        -  Determine the incidence of locoregional recurrence in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the overall and disease-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the technical feasibility of ipsilateral lymph node sampling and complete
           resection with VAR in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of conversion to open thoracotomy in these patients.

        -  Determine the short- and long-term complications associated with VAR in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of adjuvant radiotherapy after VAR in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. Surgeons attempt sampling and
      identification of all ipsilateral, mediastinal, and hilar lymph nodes. When accessible, lobar
      lymph nodes must also be sampled. If the tumor margins are positive, further resection of the
      margins must be attempted. Open thoracotomy may be required for technical reasons.
