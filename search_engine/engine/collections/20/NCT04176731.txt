      hybrid closed-loop phase.

      Subjects will undergo a 14-day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects, or their caregivers, will manage their diabetes at
      home per their usual routine using the study continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and
      remain on current multiple daily injections (MDI) or pump therapy. This will be followed by a
      14-day hybrid closed-loop phase conducted in both a hotel/rental house setting and an
      outpatient setting.

      The hybrid closed-loop phase will begin on Study Day 1.

      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects will be divided into two groups. The first
      group of subjects will commence the hybrid closed-loop phase in the hotel/rental house
      setting. On Study Day 3, subjects will transition to an outpatient setting for the remaining
      12 days. After all subjects from the first group have completed the 2-day hotel/rental house
      phase, the second group of subjects may commence the hybrid closed-loop phase in an
      outpatient setting for 14-days.

      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, all subjects will participate in specific target blood
      glucose (BG) challenges.

      After each subject in the prepivotal study has successfully completed 14-days of
      hybrid-closed-loop, they may immediately transition to and enroll in the pivotal study.
