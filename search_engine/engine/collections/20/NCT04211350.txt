      Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) or NightBalance Sleep Position Therapy for a three month
      period. Participants are sent home with instructions to use that device nightly at home for
      three months. After three months of using the first device, they return to the doctor for
      assessment of the efficacy of the device using a sleep test and the compliance read from the
      device. Upon conclusion of the first three month treatment period, patients receive the
      alternative treatment for a further three months. At the end of the second three month
      period, participants return to their doctor again to assess the efficacy of the last device
      and read the compliance. Before any treatment and after each treatment, patients undergo a
      sleep test and complete some questionnaires. During each treatment period, patients complete
      a healthcare utilization diary and report any problems.
