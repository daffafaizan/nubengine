      group-based supportive After Care (AC) for moderate and high risk FESW ATS users using a
      stepped wedge randomized cluster design. The trial tests the CCT+AC intervention in 10
      Cambodian provinces (clusters). Outcome Evaluation (OE) data is collected at 1 time-point
      prior to implementation of the CCT+AC program (Baseline), and 3 time-points after the
      intervention (OE-1, OE-2, and Post-OE) at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline in each
      province. CCT+AC is followed by a linked economic capacity building opportunity. Women who
      are ATS-free, including those negative at baseline and those who successfully complete the
      CCT+AC intervention are eligible for referral to a MicroEnterprise (ME) program. The ME
      program combines financial literacy education and referral to a Cambodian registered
      microfinance organization (Chamroeun) for loan applications that may support alternate
      economic options for participating eligible women.
