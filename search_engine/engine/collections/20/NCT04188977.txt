      design. The study's purpose is to examine the effectiveness of Implementation Facilitation
      (IF) to prompt participating Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) to utilize interim methadone
      treatment and other approaches to reduce OTP admission delays. Interim methadone treamtent is
      an evidence-based practice permitted under federal OTP regulations to provide methadone
      treatment without routine counseling for individuals requesting methadone treatment who
      otherwise would not be able to be admitted to such treatment within 14 days of request. The
      study will be conducted at six OTPs in the US that are unable to admit individuals within 14
      days of their request for methadone treatment. The OTPs will participate in a baseline
      Pre-Implementation Phase, an Implementation Phase, followed by a Sustainability Phase. OTPs
      will be randomly assigned in groups of two to the order in which they will initiate the
      Implementation Phase. IF will be delivered at the level of the OTP staff and their state
      health department official responsible for OTP oversight. OTP staff and state health
      department officials will be interviewed regarding facilitators and barriers to implementing
      interim methadone and other approaches to reduce admission delays. De-identified data will be
      gathered from the OTPs on the effectiveness of IF in prompting the implementation of interim
      methadone and reducing admission delays.
