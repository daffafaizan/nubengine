      by chronic and recurring respiratory tract infections. Frequently, depending on the
      underlying cause, these infections involve the entire respiratory tract resulting in sinus,
      ear, and lung disease. This condition used to be more common in children prior to
      immunizations for childhood infections. It continues to be a significant problem in
      developing countries and in specific groups of individuals in the U.S. Cystic fibrosis (CF)
      is the most commonly associated genetic condition and tremendous strides have been made in
      recent years in understanding the mechanisms of this disease that are leading to a multitude
      of emerging novel treatment strategies. The mechanisms of other causes for bronchiectasis
      have not evolved to this degree, and many of the disease-specific treatments being assessed
      for cystic fibrosis may not be effective for non-CF bronchiectasis. Often bronchiectasis can
      be associated with chronic infections from environmental germs such as the nontuberculous
      mycobacteria.
