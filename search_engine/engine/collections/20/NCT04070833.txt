      more prevalent cause of disability in the future as the population ages. Understanding risk
      factors which may prospectively influence stroke outcomes may help to reduce the morbidity
      burden of stroke.

      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) examined the impact of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day
      cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] +
      docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) on stroke incidence. However, the parent trial did not examine
      the impact of these supplements on stroke outcomes. Even if they do not significantly reduce
      stroke incidence, these supplements may still reduce stroke severity and improve outcomes
      post-stroke. Given the high morbidity burden of stroke, the impact of these supplements on
      stroke outcomes is of substantial scientific and public health importance.

      The first aim of this study is to test whether vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid
      supplementation reduces the risk of poor functional outcomes as measured at hospital
      discharge and 6- and 12-months post-stroke. The second aim is to determine whether chronic
      cerebrovascular changes (white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral microbleeds) mediate
      the effect of vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on stroke outcomes.

      Individuals enrolled in VITAL who experience a non-fatal stroke event will be mailed
      additional questionnaires assessing functional limitations, physical disability, and social
      disability. Responses from these questionnaires will be used to determine the effect of
      vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on post-stroke outcomes.
