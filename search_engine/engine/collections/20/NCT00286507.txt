    
      Idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) is an important cause of loss of central
      vision, usually leading to severe visual impairment. Up to 20% of affected people will
      develop a FTMH in both eyes. There is uncertainty in the literature and among vitreo-retinal
      surgeons about the balance of potential benefits and adverse effects of ILM peeling in FTMH
      surgery for stage 2-3 holes.

      FILMS is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with stage 2-3 FTMH less less than
      18 months duration investigating whether ILM peeling improves the anatomical and visual
      outcome of macular hole surgery and the quality of life of patients with this retinal
      disease. Cost-effectiveness is also being addressed.
