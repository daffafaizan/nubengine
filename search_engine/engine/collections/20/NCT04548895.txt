    
      1. Building the algorithm for early, pre-symptomatic DETECTION OF RESPIRATORY VIRAL
           INFECTION and for predicting eventual DETERIORATION.

        2. Create an APP that AUTOMATES these algorithms and clearly REPORTS ACTIONABLE RESULTS to
           users, i.e., to medical professionals and citizens-at-large in near-real time. If
           alerted to a possible - and likely still asymptomatic - COVID-19 infection, they can
           self-isolate or be quarantined, get confirmatory COVID-19 testing done promptly, limit
           transmission to others, and stay safe knowing that if they are likely to deteriorate,
           the algorithm will alert the participants and their caregivers to the need to obtain
           medical attention promptly.
