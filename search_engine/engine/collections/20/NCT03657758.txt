      of these treatment in patients with in-stent neoatherosclerosis has not been clarified.

      So, the investigators conducted LINK IT study. This study showed that eicosapentaenoic
      acid(EPA) and rosuvastatin therapy improve lipid index in patients compared with rosuvastatin
      alone therapy.

      However, it was insufficient to directly evaluate the efficacy of additional effect of EPA
      for neoatherosclerosis. Because, statin dose of two groups was different and type of stent
      was variety.

      Therefore, the investigators designed a new prospective, randomized OCT study. The OCT
      operators randomly assigned 75 patients who were detected neoatherosclerosis on follow-up OCT
      examination after implanted everolimus eluting stent to three groups; 5mg/day of rosuvastatin
      therapy (low dose statin therapy group) or 10mg/day of rosuvastatin therapy (high dose statin
      therapy group) or 10mg/day of rosuvastatin and 1800mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid therapy
      (EPA and statin therapy group). Serial coronary angiography and OCT were performed at 9
      months after baseline OCT procedure.

      This study aim is to evaluate the additional effect of eicosapentaenoic acid and dose up
      effect of rosuvastatin for neoatherosclerosis in coronary artery disease patients by
      comparing 3 groups.
