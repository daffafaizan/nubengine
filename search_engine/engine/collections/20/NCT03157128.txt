    
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study in participants with advanced solid
      tumors, including RET fusion-positive solid tumors, MTC, and other tumors with RET
      activation. The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: Phase 1 (dose escalation - completed) and
      phase 2 (dose expansion). Participants with advanced cancer are eligible if they have
      progressed on or are intolerant to available standard therapies, or no standard or available
      curative therapy exists, or in the opinion of the Investigator, they would be unlikely to
      tolerate or derive significant clinical benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy, or
      they declined standard therapy. A dose of 160 milligrams (mg) twice a day (BID) has been
      selected as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Approximately 950 participants with advanced
      solid tumors harboring a RET gene alteration in tumor and/or blood will be enrolled to one of
      seven phase 2 cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Advanced RET fusion positive solid tumor for participants who progressed on or
           intolerant to first line therapy (open)

        -  Cohort 2: Advanced RET fusion positive solid tumor for treatment naïve participants
           (open)

        -  Cohort 3: Advanced RET-mutant MTC participants who progressed on or intolerant to first
           line therapy (closed)

        -  Cohort 4: Advanced RET-mutant MTC participants who are treatment naïve (closed)

        -  Cohort 5: Advanced RET-altered solid tumor for participants otherwise ineligible for
           cohorts 1-4. See details in inclusion/exclusion criteria (open)

        -  Cohort 6: Participants otherwise eligible for Cohorts 1-5 who discontinued another RET
           inhibitor due to intolerance may be eligible with prior Sponsor approval (open)

        -  Cohort 7: RET fusion positive early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
           participants who are candidates for definitive surgery. Participants will receive
           selpercatinib in a neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Participants will be followed for
           disease recurrence for up to 5 years from the date of surgery (open in US only)
