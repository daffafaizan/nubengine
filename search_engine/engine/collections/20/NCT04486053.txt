      to the emergency department since they are the most frequently injured part of body following
      head in pediatric and adolescent population. Although upper extremity fractures and
      contusions are the main reasons of pediatric hand injuries, tendon injuries are not also
      uncommon. While extensor tendon injuries have been reported to be most frequent than flexor
      tendon injuries for all age groups, the ratio of flexor to extensor tendon injuries is higher
      in pediatric population than adults and in children younger than 10 years old flexor tendon
      injuries are more common than extensor tendon injuries.Despite some challenges in the
      treatment of flexor tendon injuries of children, the outcomes have been reported to be better
      in children than adults since they have better blood supply, more rapid tendon healing and
      better remodeling ability of scars and adhesions. However, there is still a risk of permanent
      morbidities such as significant scarring and stiffness which can cause worse functional
      outcomes.There are limited data in the literature about the long-term results of children
      with flexor tendon injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term
      functional outcomes of children with flexor tendon injury.
