      I. To recommend a phase 2 dose for the combination of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) and everolimus,
      given with octreotide long-acting release (LAR) (octreotide acetate), in patients with
      advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of IMC-A12 given once every 21 days in combination with
      everolimus and octreotide LAR.

      III. To evaluate pharmacodynamic markers in blood, and tumor tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of IMC-A12 and everolimus with octreotide LAR.

      II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of IMC-A12 and everolimus as
      defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate and
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore baseline molecular marker and drug-induced molecular marker changes that may
      predict clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cixutumumab.

      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes and octreotide acetate
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
