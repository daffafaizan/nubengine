      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients is well established. However, there are numerous
      patient's and program factors that influence the benefits gained (e.g. exercise intensity and
      frequency, goal setting, non-exercise modalities, compliance, social support and
      supervision). The investigators aim to explore the possibility of a real-life program that
      will allow the patient the freedom to perform exercise in their own environment. The
      BioGradient system allows both goal oriented, supervised exercise prescription, and the
      ability to adapt to the patient's schedule and preferences. The system also provides as
      needed human involvement for encouragement and supervision.

      The investigators hypothesize that the primary outcome (the six-minute walk test, see
      Outcomes section) will not change significantly in active participants and measures of
      quality of life and adherence will be higher than reported in the literature in similar
      publications. Moreover, data collected may provide opportunity to explore the factors that
      might influence the primary and secondary outcomes, and in particular hospitalizations and
      exacerbations.

      The current study is a patient blinded, randomized control trial, comparing usual care to
      goal oriented supervised post PR program. After recruitment the patient will be randomized to
      usual care arm or supervised exercise arm. The study duration will be 1 year (per
      participant), and the minimal time for each participant to be included in the final analysis
      will be 3 months (with at least two outcome measurements). At the end of the study each
      patient will be scheduled a short interview with the research coordinator for assessment of
      outcome measurements and spirometry testing.
