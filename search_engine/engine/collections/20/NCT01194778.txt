      vegetables, K2 is of microbial origin. Lactic bacteria produce a mixture of higher
      menaquinones, including menaquinone-7, menaquinone-8, and menaquinone-9. Higher menaquinones
      not only have very long half-life times (over 3 days rather than 1 hour for vitamin K1); K2
      vitamins are also transported to extra hepatic tissues such as bone and vessel wall whereas
      K1 is preferentially transported to the liver. Nothing is known yet about the efficacy of
      bacterial K2 vitamins for in vivo K function (carboxylation of essential proteins). This
      study describes a dose-response experiment for different dosages of bacterial K2 which are
      compared with one selected dose of K1 and placebo. The efficacy is concluded from the
      carboxylation of the bone Gla-protein osteocalcin and of the vascular Gla-protein matrix-Gla
      protein (MGP).
