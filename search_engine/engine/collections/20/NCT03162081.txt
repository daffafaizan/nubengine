      age-related multifactorial morbidity, cognitive function, polypharmacy, dependence and
      multiple prescribers with suboptimal communication. Centrally active pain killers and
      sedative/hypnotic medications give increased risk of addiction, adverse drug events, reduced
      physical and/or cognitive function.

      The project comprises diagnostic accuracy, descriptive screening, cross-sectional and
      case-control studies, with aims to: i) assess diagnostic utility of instruments for elderly
      patients; ii) describe risk factors for medication misuse and dependence; iii) describe
      consequences of the use of centrally active medications among elderly compared to a control
      population.

      Moreover, the investigators aim to examine the association between medication misuse and
      changes in cognitive function, focusing on deficits in specific domains of cognition. An
      additional aim is to explore the possibility of dissociating such cognitive changes from
      other causes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) associated with development of dementia.
