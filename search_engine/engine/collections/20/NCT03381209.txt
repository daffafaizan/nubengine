      morbidly obese patients using three doses of sugammadex; based on ideal body weight, adjusted
      body weight, and actual body weight. Reversal Time: time from administration of Sugammadex to
      train of four (TOF) ratio â‰¥ 0.9 will be used as primary outcome.

      Time need for extubation (time from administration of sugammadex to extubation), and duration
      of stay in post anesthesia care unit (PACU), will be used as secondary outcome.
