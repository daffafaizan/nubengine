      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of adoptively transferred interleukin (IL)-21 modulated
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) targeting a melanoma associated antigen in patients following
      cyclophosphamide conditioning.

      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred IL-21
      modulated CTL and factors contributing to immunopotentiation in patients receiving IL-21
      modulated CTL following cyclophosphamide conditioning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptively transferred IL-21 modulated CD8+
      antigen-specific CTL following cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion IL-2.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2 followed by an
      infusion of IL-21 modulated, melanoma antigen recognized by T cell (MART)-1 specific CD8+
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes over 30-60 minutes on day 0. Beginning within 24 hours of T-cell
      infusion, patients receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 8-10 weeks.
