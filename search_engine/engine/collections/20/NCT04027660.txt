      is known about titanium implants but little in zirconia implants

      In patients that require a tooth extraction anywhere in the oral cavity except 3rd molars are
      candidates fo the study. Once clinical conditions are establish and medical clearance is ok,
      the decision for an immediate implant is taken.

      Patient will undergo for an intraoral Scanner (IOS, Trios 3Shape) to get an STL file of the
      previous situation.

      On the day of surgery an atraumatically tooth extraction is performed (without rasing a flap)
      and a Zirconia implant is inserted on the alveolar socket.

      The jumping gap (distance from crystal bone to implant body will be filled with a zenograft
      type of biomaterial) no sutures or membrane will be used.

      A provisional crown or an individualized healing abutment will be placed. After 3 month
      healing an IOS will be made for crown fabrication and a second STL file generated.

      After 15 days final crown will be placed, and 3 month after a 3rd IOS made to get the 3rd and
      final STL file.

      An STL software will then make the correlation between the volume behavior in those 3 stages.

      The control group, patients go for tooth extraction but no immediate implant and undergo with
      a classic protocol for implant placement. In this case the STL files are taken pre-operatory,
      before implant placement 3 month after tooth extraction, 2 month after implant placement (at
      final impression level), and 3 month after crown placement.
