      their older counterparts and experience unique physical and mental challenges associated with
      their cancer treatments. Depression, anxiety, and poor body image are common in young breast
      cancer survivors. Research in older breast cancer survivors has shown that physical activity
      can decrease cancer recurrence and mortality, and improve many aspects of quality of life.
      Few physical activity intervention studies have been conducted in young breast cancer
      survivors, despite the fact that young survivors would be best served by age-specific
      interventions designed to target their needs. Remotely-delivered, technology-based
      interventions may be important to help young breast cancer survivors overcome unique barriers
      to increasing physical activity and improving quality of life.

      The study aims are: 1) Explore the feasibility and acceptability of a technology-based,
      remotely-delivered, peer-moderated physical activity intervention for young breast cancer
      survivors; 2a) Assess the invention's impact on change in physical activity; and 2b) Measure
      the intervention's effect on multiple aspects of quality of life
