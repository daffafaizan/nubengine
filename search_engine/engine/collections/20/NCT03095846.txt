      means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic
      properties of the tissue. This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to
      the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Despite increasing evidence that
      indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not
      fully understood.

      Cold induced brown fat activity will be measured by skin temperature measures by means of
      infra-red thermography imaging and skin temperature.

      15 healthy male winter swimmers and 8 healthy male non-winter swimmers (controls) will be
      included in the study.
