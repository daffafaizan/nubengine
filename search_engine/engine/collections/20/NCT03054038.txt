      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of combination afatinib and necitumumab therapy in
      EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have progressed
      following first- and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

      II. To determine the efficacy and safety profile of afatinib and necitumumab combination
      therapy in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients who have progressed following
      first- and third-generation EGFR TKIs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive afatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and necitumumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
