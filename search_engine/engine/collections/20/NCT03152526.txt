    
      This trial uses a Simon's two-stage design to estimate the complete remission rate at day +42
      post NK cell infusion. The trial includes an initial randomized sub- study of 24 patients
      during stage 1 to choose which of the enriched NK cell products (CD3-/CD19- versus
      CD3-/CD56+) should be used to complete the trial based on successful in vivo NK cell
      expansion. This parameter is defined as 40% donor DNA and 40% of lymphocytes are NK cells at
      day 7 post infusion OR 20% donor DNA and 20% of lymphocytes are NK cells at day 14 post
      infusion. Twelve patients will be randomized to each product.

      Enrollment Plan:

      Stage 1: Enroll 24 patients with 1:1 randomization for NK cell processing (CD3-/CD19- versus
      CD3-/CD56+) Stage 2: Enroll an additional 17 patients using the optimal NK cell product
      identified during stage 1.

      If neither product achieves success at the end of stage 1, the study will stop and the
      platform redesigned
