      Rating scale for Depression, HAMD â‰¥ 15). Patients don't have any experience concerning
      repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).

      Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were assigned to two treatment groups in
      addition to their current pharmacotherapy regimen : one group received 5 active-rTMS before
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and the other one received sham-rTMS before ECT. The
      depressive symptoms and the cognitive functions are evaluated before rTMS, after 5 rTMS and
      after 5 ECT.
