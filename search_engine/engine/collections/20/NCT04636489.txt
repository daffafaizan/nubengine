      associated with multiple health benefits. However, its protective role in subjects with
      hyperglycemia are remain unclear. This study aims to examine the effect of 8-week prebiotics
      supplementation on glucose management in subjects with hyperglycemia. By understanding the
      mechanism by which prebiotics exert the beneficial effects, we can better control the rising
      prevalence of hyperglycemia, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.
