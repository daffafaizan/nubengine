    
      This is a phase I/II open label, randomized, interventional clinical trial. Study eyes will
      receive one preoperative intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) <21 days but >7 days prior
      to vitrectomy and one intraoperative intravitreal aflibercept at end of surgery followed by
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio into either 4 mandatory postoperative q4weeks IAI followed by
      mandatory q8 weeks IAI for 52 weeks follow-up (q8 week Group) or 2 mandatory postoperative
      q4weeks IAI followed by mandatory q16 weeks IAI for 52 weeks follow-up (q16 week Group).

      Follow-up visits occur 1 day and 1-2 weeks, and 4 weeks postoperatively and then every 4
      weeks from the first postoperative IAI for 52 weeks. One preoperative visit and every
      postoperative visit (except day one postoperatively) will include ETDRS Best Corrected Visual
      Acuity (BCVA), Intraocular Pressure (IOP) measurement, Slit lamp biomicroscopy, Indirect
      ophthalmoscopy, Heidelberg Spectralis Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)
      (no OCT for preoperative visit) and evaluation for systemic and ocular adverse events. Seven
      standard field photographs and Optos wide-field fluorescein angiography will be performed at
      postoperative visits at 4, 16, 28, 40,and 52 weeks. Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing (30-2
      and 60-4 test patterns) will be performed at postoperative visits at 4 and 52 weeks.
      Preoperative B scan echography will be required standard of care(SOC) to assess for macular
      traction, non-macular traction, retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage(VH).
      Identification of traction macular detachment will exclude the patient from the study.
