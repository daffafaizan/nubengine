      (0.8 mcg/m^2) NGR-hTNF or standard chemotherapy alone, through a centralized randomization
      process using the following stratification factors: performance status (0 vs 1) and histology
      (squamous vs non-squamous). In both arms the choice between the two chemotherapy regimens
      will be based on the histologic subtype: in patients with squamous histology (including also
      generic diagnosis of NSCLC without further subtype classification) is recommended
      cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen, in patients with nonsquamous histology (including
      adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma) is recommended cisplatin/pemetrexed regimen.
