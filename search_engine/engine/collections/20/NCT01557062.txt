    
      Patients were attended at the Psychobiology and Exercise Studies Centre 5 times a week for 3
      weeks between 6:00pm and 8:00pm for passive body-heating interventions for 30 min each
      session. The patients were accompanied by a researcher to a therapeutic water bath (Barritz
      Hydrotherapy Appliance, Germany) and were comfortably positioned in a supine position with
      their necks supported by an inflatable floating pillow to keep the body relaxed and safe
      during the intervention. The room temperature at the laboratory was maintained at 23±1 ºC,
      and the water temperature was 36±1ºC.
