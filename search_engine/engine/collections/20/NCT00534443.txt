      particularly in terms of the degree and speed of gastric acid suppression. Few data are also
      available about their effect of the pathophysiological mechanisms of gastritis and peptic
      ulcer disease.

      Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is a recently discovered receptor
      expressed on the surface of neutrophils and monocytes. Engagement of TREM-1 has been reported
      to trigger the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. A soluble form of TREM-1, named
      sTREM-1, was observed and identified at significant levels in serum samples from patients
      with disease of the gastrointestinal tract inflammatory bowel disease. rendering interest
      about the implication of sTREM-1 in their pathogenesis.

      sTREM-1 was also found elevated in the gastric juice of patients with peptic ulcer disease
      being correlated to the degree of the infiltration of the gastric mucosa by neutrophils.

      Published data of our group elicit that sTREM-1 secretion is a crucial parameter for
      evolution from chronic gastritis to peptic ulcer disease. Samples of biopsies of gastric
      mucosa were cultured in the absence/presence of endotoxins showing that the inflamed mucosa
      was a potent secretor of sTREM-1 whatever ceased to exist post-antisecretory treatment.

      Aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of therapy with esomeprazole or
      rabeprazole on the mechanism of pathogenesis of gastritis and particularly on the pattern of
      release of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines associated to peptic ulcerative process by
      the gastric mucosa.
