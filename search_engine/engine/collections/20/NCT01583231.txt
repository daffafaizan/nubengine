      prevention of intraoperative infection. The use of the brushless surgical hand hygiene has
      been used since the CDC stated in 2002 that using a brush and sponge is no longer necessary.
      Empirical literature supports the reduction of the incidence of bacteria or OR personnel
      hands with the use of alcohol-based products.

      An annotated integrative search of the literature was conducted and conflicting information
      regarding the use of a prewash prior to the brushless scrub was found. This study can help us
      utilize the brushless scrub to the fullest capacity and prevent surgical site infections.

      The time point at which the outcome measure will be assessed at an individual level will be
      immediately pre-intervention and also 1.5 minutes after the intervention. For example, within
      15 seconds prior to brushless scrub, or prewash, a sample swab will be collected and then
      another sample swab will be obtained 1.5 minutes later for postintervention measure. The
      study should take approximately 4 months to complete to get an adequate sample size of
      individuals for statistical power. The data will be aggregated and presented at a staff
      in-service within 3 months after data collection and analysis is completed.
