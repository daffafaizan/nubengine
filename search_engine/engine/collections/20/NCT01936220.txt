      treatment from first episode psychosis till the end of the initial phase schizophrenia is
      still insufficient. Randomized trials with a treatment duration of six months to two years
      with favorable symptomatic and psychosocial results disappeared at five year follow-up. Other
      studies suggest that specialized treatment should last 5 years in order to be able to prevent
      instead of only delaying clinical and psychosocial deteriorating.

      In this study we examine both the symptomatic (relapse) and psychosocial outcome of a three
      armed five year randomized trial in the initial phase of schizophrenia.
