    
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by an
      irresistible urge to move the legs. Persistent difficulties with all phases of sleep are
      common in patients whose RLS symptoms are resolved with treatment. Multiple potential causes
      for treatment-refractory sleep disturbance exist, including activating effects of dopamine
      agonists (which are first-line RLS treatments), conditioned insomnia and poor sleep habits as
      a result of chronic RLS-related sleep disturbance, and comorbid medical and psychiatric
      illness. Suvorexant provides an important therapeutic option to treat insomnia in the context
      of RLS. It has demonstrated long-term efficacy, particularly in shortening the duration of
      nocturnal awakenings and increasing total sleep time. Similarly, it has a comparatively
      benign side effect profile compared to many other agents typically prescribed to treat
      insomnia. The investigators aim to determine the effect of suvorexant on
      actigraphically-derived total sleep time, as well as actigraphically-derived wake after sleep
      onset, Insomnia Severity Index score, subjective sleep endpoints, and RLS symptom severity.
