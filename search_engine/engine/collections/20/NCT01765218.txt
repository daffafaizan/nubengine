      that affects 1.5-2.6 per 1000 live births. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy has a mortality
      rate of up to 30% and survivors are at significant risk for adverse long-term outcomes,
      including seizures, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. The investigators propose a
      randomized controlled study comparing therapeutic hypothermia alone, or therapeutic
      hypothermia combined with topiramate. The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant therapy
      with topiramate will reduce short term severity of HIE including seizures (the primary
      outcome), a composite HIE severity score, and reduce the time of normalization of the
      amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG). The investigators further hypothesize, that it will improve
      longer term outcomes such as developmental outcome. The primary hypothesis is that seizures
      before hospital discharge (or before 4 weeks post-natal age (which ever is earlier)) will be
      significantly reduced in the topiramate group compared to the control group
