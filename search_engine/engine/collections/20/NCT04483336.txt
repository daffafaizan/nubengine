    
      Design and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted including healthy, and
      cooperative 6-12-year-old children, with no known allergy and/or sensitivity to local
      anesthesia who are currently in need of nonemergency dental treatment under local anesthetic
      infiltration by one of the postgraduate or interns at the pediatric dentistry students, were
      eligible for the study. Patients with history of epilepsy and anxiety disorder were excluded
      from the study

      Methods and Material: In the test group, subjects received BIA while being distracted using
      VR goggles; in the control group, subjects watched a cartoon video on a regular screen.
      Subjects' heart rate (HR) was measured at baseline and at four different timepoints during
      BIA administration to assess anxiety. The face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC)
      Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale was scored by two calibrated investigators to assess pain.
      After BIA, subjects rated their pain using the Arabic version of Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating
      Scale.
