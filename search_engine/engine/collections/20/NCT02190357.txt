      increased intestinal permeability all leading to an increase in bacterial translocation and
      increased endotoxemia. Cirrhotics with bacterial translocation and endotoxemia manifest
      hemodynamic derangement with lower systemic vascular resistance, higher cardiac output, and
      lower mean arterial pressure. Moreover, endotoxins may increase portal pressure by increasing
      vascular resistance which may be promoted through the cytokine-stimulated intrahepatic
      release of endothelin and cyclo-oxygenase products.

      Indeed, bacterial infections are common in cirrhotic patients and have approximately 30%
      mortality at one month and a further 30% mortality at 12 months as documented in a systematic
      review comprising almost 12 000 patients. It follows that altering gut flora to decrease
      endotoxin levels may lead to improved prognosis in cirrhosis. Rifaximin is an antibiotic that
      is virtually non-absorbed after oral administration and exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial
      activity against both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms
      within the gastrointestinal tract. It has been suggested that oral prophylactic antibiotics
      or bowel decontamination might improve long-term outcomes in patients with cirrhosis, not
      only by reducing the risk of infections but also by reducing hepatic vein pressure gradient
      (HVPG).

      The aim of this study was to explore the effect of rifaximin on the complications of advanced
      cirrhosis.
