    
      To evaluate by a randomized study in a group of people with DM 1 the influence in parameters
      of oxidative stress of the treatments with the different current analogs of

      Insulin by analyzing:

        1. - The circulating levels of oxidative stress markers: A) Anti oxidation: Total
           antioxidant capacity (CAT), B) Oxidation: 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-iso-PGF2Î±),
           acid reactive substances Thiobarbituric (TBARS) and LDL-oxidized.

        2. - The relationship between glycemic control variables (HbA1c and mean glycemia) and
           variability (Standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and MAGE (mean
           amplitude of Glycemic excursions) and oxidative stress parameters analyzed.

      Goal 2:

      Study the activation of cellular pathways associated with processes and oxidation states, by
      means of a Array of expression of up to 50 genes encoding oxidative stress response genes as
      CPT1a (Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1a, mitochondrial oxidizing b limiting enzyme), TAS
      (Fatty acyl synthetase), acetyl-coA carboxylase, Acadm (medium chain acyl dehydrogenase),
      Acadl (long chain acyl dehydrogenase), Acadvl (long chain acyl coA dehydrogenase), SOD1,
      Hmox1 and Glutamine-Cysteine ligase (Gclc).
