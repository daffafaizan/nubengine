      preventing the life-threatening infections when used for patients with AIDS and Kaposi's
      sarcoma. The MTD of combined chemotherapy is being determined so that the information will be
      available for future studies, when the relative effectiveness of the two doses of AZT has
      been learned.

      AMENDED: AZT by mouth. If the treatment is well tolerated, subsequent groups of patients are
      started on increasing doses of doxorubicin combined with the same dose of bleomycin and
      vincristine. After determination of the MTD of chemotherapy in combination with AZT, the 2nd
      phase begins in which AZT is given and the first group of patients is given bleomycin and
      vincristine only. If this combination is well tolerated, then the subsequent groups are
      started on increasing doses of doxorubicin with the same dose of bleomycin, vincristine and
      AZT. The MTD of chemotherapy in combination with AZT is then determined. Patients achieving
      maximum response to the tumor are maintained on AZT alone. This is an outpatient study, and
      patients are seen every 2 weeks for evaluation, with a physical examination every month.
      Original design: The combination of chemotherapy and AZT is given to groups of four patients
      each, the first group beginning with bleomycin and vincristine, without the addition of
      doxorubicin. The chemotherapy is given intravenously every 2 weeks. This is combined first
      with AZT by mouth.
