      approach to improving trichiasis surgery outcomes: perioperative topical anti-inflammatory
      therapy. Inflammation-whether induced by the trachoma disease process or surgery itself-most
      likely contributes to progressive cicatrization leading to failure of lid rotation surgery in
      a clinically important proportion of TT cases. The investigators hypothesize that adjunctive
      topical fluorometholone therapy following trichiasis surgery will reduce the risk of
      recurrent trichiasis and will be acceptably safe. The rationale for the efficacy aspect of
      this hypothesis is that interruption of inflammation postoperatively would reduce
      postoperative scarring/contracture driven by ongoing disease-driven inflammation and/or
      surgically-induced inflammation thus reducing the incidence of TT recurrence (post-operative
      TT) and other inflammation-related outcomes.
