      depression as medications for depression. CBT focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
      It focuses on the here and now, rather than the past. CBT offers concrete strategies and
      skills for coping with depression, PD, and other life problems. Previous research leads us to
      believe that this type of therapy may help people with PD cope with their depression.
