      skills through interventions with varying degrees of intensity (from the low intensity Basic
      intervention group, to the mild intensity Group Intervention group, to the high intensity
      Full Intervention group) results in improved transition readiness and self-care skills and
      improved successful transition to adult-based services for young adults with chronic health
      conditions. Secondary objectives include determining if the transition interventions enhance
      transition-related satisfaction among participants, their caregivers and the involved
      pediatric and adult providers.
