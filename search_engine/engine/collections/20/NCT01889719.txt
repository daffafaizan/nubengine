      safe and whether they will boost immune responses generated by immunizations with a dendritic
      cell (DC) targeted protein vaccine, DCVax-001, plus poly ICLC in healthy HIV-uninfected
      volunteers. Investigators propose to assess the quality of immunity elicited by immunizations
      with MVA-CMDR only or by booster immunizations with MVA-CMDR in volunteers previously
      immunized with a DC-targeted HIV vaccine. This vaccination regimen can provide the
      proof-of-concept that DC targeted protein vaccines can prime strong immune responses and
      therefore be valuable in combination with other vaccine modalities against HIV or other
      diseases.
