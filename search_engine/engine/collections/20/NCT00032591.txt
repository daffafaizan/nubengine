      normalized ratio (PT INR) versus conventional monthly high quality anticoagulation management
      (HQACM) from an anticoagulation clinic with a minimum two years follow-up.

      Primary Hypothesis: Compared to conventional monitoring in the clinic, PST of anticoagulation
      intensity will decrease the number of events of thromboembolism (strokes), bleeding, and all
      cause deaths and improve the quality of anticoagulation.

      Second Hypothesis: PST and conventional monitoring will be comparable in terms of health care
      utilization and cost.

      Primary Outcomes: Event rates (thromboembolism or bleeding episodes), time to first event,
      time within therapeutic range for anticoagulation intensity, and total health care cost
      (including price of PST monitors) and utilization.

      Study Abstract: Since home monitors of prothrombin time (PT) may potentially improve the
      safety, quality, and convenience of chronic anticoagulation management, it is likely that
      there will be demands from providers, patients, and manufacturers to make home monitors
      available to VA patients. The rationale for PST is that it would permit more intense
      monitoring and increased patient participation in his/her own care, resulting in increased
      precision in anticoagulation control and thus fewer events.

      Original plan was for a study at 32 sites with a total sample size of about 3,200 patients
      and a length of three years (one for recruitment and two years of follow-up). Final status
      was 28 sites that randomized 2922 patients in 2.75 years of recruitment with a minimum of two
      years of follow-up.
