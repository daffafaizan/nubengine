      people who have advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will determine the MTD or RP2D for
      TAK-659 in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine,
      lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. The study will enroll approximately 96 participants.

      Participants will be assigned to one of the 5 combination cohorts:

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort A: TAK-659 + Bendamustine

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort B: TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort C: TAK-659 + Gemcitabine

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort D: TAK-659 + Lenalidomide

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort E: TAK-659 + Ibrutinib This study comprises 2 phases: a
           dose escalation phase and a safety expansion phase. Participants in all 5 cohorts
           (Cohorts A-E) will participate in the dose escalation phase of the study. Approximately
           12 additional participants with advanced FL or MZL will be added to Cohort B, in the
           safety expansion phase.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic and will be followed up for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study
      drug.
