      young adult home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients and family members over handheld
      personal computers. Effects on health status, QoL, and fatigue will be assessed over time
      between groups of study subjects from the ages of 13 through 30 randomized to one of two
      groups. Group One (intervention group) will receive mConnect, integrated evidence-based
      interventions (skill-building games, restorative naps & peer support) via mobile iPad and
      Internet delivery plus two real-time audiovisual encrypted connections with multidisciplinary
      professionals and peers. Group Two (control group) will receive healthy activity information
      via mobile iPad and Internet delivery plus one real-time audiovisual encrypted connection
      with professionals and peers.
