      examinations. 50 laboring female participants will be enrolled with 25 randomly assigned to
      the control arm and 25 to the treatment (DilaCheck) arm. Each participant will receive two
      cervical dilation examinations from two separate physicians. The main outcome measure is
      agreement between the two cervical dilation measurements. Secondary outcomes include ease of
      use of the device and pain levels.
