      domains. The observed cognitive deficits in the substance abuse population include, but are
      not restricted to, attention, concentration, verbal and nonverbal memory, problem solving and
      abstract reasoning. Our recent studies (IRB Protocol # 3998) demonstrated that in cocaine
      dependent participants such cognitive deficits have been shown to: 1) negatively effect
      retention and 2) impede the ability of the drug abuser to benefit from cognitive behavioral
      therapy- relapse prevention (CBT-RP) that requires participant to attend to novel stimuli,
      integrate new information with existing stores, and translate information into behavior
      change (Aharonovich, Hasin & Nunes, 2003; Aharonovich et al, in press). Furthermore, the
      toxic effects of cocaine together with withdrawal symptoms, such as fatigue and hypersomnia
      make it difficult to fully engage in any psychosocial intervention including CBT-RP.

      Recent findings indicate that cocaine dysregulates reward-related glutamate pathways (Dackis
      & O'Brien, 2003; Kalivas et al, 2003). Modafinil is a medication known to improve attention,
      increase wakefulness, energy, and alertness in part by increasing glutamate levels. In light
      of this work and the negative affect of cognitive impairments on treatment outcomes, testing
      cognitive enhancing medications that act on glutamate pathways is a novel promising strategy
      for improving treatment for cocaine dependence. Modafinil is approved for sleep disorders and
      is a relatively safe medication for cocaine-dependent participants as it has a low abuse
      potential and has shown promise in a double blind placebo controlled trial for cocaine
      dependence (Rush et al, 2002; Jasinski, 2000, Dackis et al, 2005). We therefore propose a
      double blind placebo controlled 12-week exploratory pilot study of modafinil, a "wakefulness
      agent," in conjunction with sessions of CBT-RP enhanced with motivational interviewing
      components.
