      will guide individuals who have intellectual disabilities and a Learning Partner (LP - care
      provider, relative, group home staff) in developing a comprehensive Individual Response Plan
      (IRP) that can be used before, during, and after an abusive event. Behavioral skills training
      and behavioral relaxation training -- two instructional approaches with evidence for
      effectiveness in this population -- will be included to address the unique learning needs of
      people who have intellectual disabilities and to maximize opportunities for skill-based
      learning. Video and workbook activities will train the LP to effectively implement the abuse
      prevention and response strategies, thus increasing the potential for generalization in the
      natural environment and long-term maintenance of skills.
