      tiagabine) have now been suggested to have acute antimanic or more long-term mood stabilizing
      properties. Carbamazepine and valproate have gained a widely recognized role in treatment
      algorithms of bipolar illness, and lamotrigine has shown promising antidepressant effects.
      Levetiracetam (KeppraÂ® (Registered Trademark)) is the most recently approved anti-epileptic
      drug available, and deserves pilot exploration in bipolar illness for a variety of reasons.
      These include: its positive side-effects profile; it is a derivative of the nootropic agent
      piracetam which has memory-enhancing properties in animal studies; it likely has a unique
      mechanism of action since it is not active on most of the traditional excitatory and
      inhibitory neurotransmitter systems; it is not active on traditional anticonvulsant models
      such as pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or maximum electroshock (MES) seizures, but is able to stop
      both the development and completed phase of amygdala-kindled seizures; and it is not
      metabolized by hepatic enzymes and thus has few adverse pharmacokinetic interactions.

      We propose pilot exploration of levetiracetam as an adjunctive agent in patients with bipolar
      illness who are inadequately responsive to routine psychopharmacological agents for bipolar
      illness. At the NIMH we will study a maximum of 10 acutely depressed, 10 manic, and 10
      cycling patients enrolled in Protocol 97-M-0039. We would start at Levetiracetam doses of 500
      mg/day, and not to exceed 4000 mg/day. Response will be based primarily on the percentage of
      patients showing "much" or "very much" improvement on the GCI-BP score in each of the three
      groups as augmented by the percentage decrement on cross-sectional scales such as the
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in
      conjunction with prospective ratings on the NIMH-LCMp. Should preliminary evidence of
      efficacy be observed in this open add-on clinical trial, more systematic controlled studies
      will then be designed for confirmation of promising target areas of efficacy.
