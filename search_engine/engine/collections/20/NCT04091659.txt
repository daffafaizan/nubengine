      randomized to either offer community members the virtual reality training or the standard
      educational offerings (e.g. handouts, online videos). Volunteers will be asked to complete
      the brief, anonymous, and validated Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale prior to receiving an
      education intervention (pretest) and then again immediately after (posttest). Neither
      participants nor investigators will be blinded. Library patrons who do not participate in the
      study will be offered current standard training materials. Regardless of the library's
      randomization, to either virtual reality or standard training, all patrons completing pre and
      post test surveys will have the opportunity to view the virtual reality training or other
      public health department materials.
