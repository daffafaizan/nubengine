    
      Endurance athletes with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation undergoing primary
      pulmonary vein isolation will be prospectively enrolled prior to PVI.

      Patients will undergo metabolic exercise stress testing as well as resting CMR 1-4 weeks
      prior to PVI. Metabolic stress testing and CMR will be repeated at 6 month follow-up. Quality
      of life questionnaires will also be collected at pre- and post-PVI visits. Metabolic
      treadmill stress testing will follow standard protocol and measure hemodynamics with
      escalating metabolic output and characterize peak exercise capacity (METs) and oxygen
      consumption (VO2 max).

      CMR evaluation will include standard anatomic imaging of pulmonary vein and left atrial
      anatomy at rest. Additional cine CMR sequences willbe included for focused evaluation of
      dynamic pulmonary vein cross-sectional area. 3D navigator whole heart imaging and MRA (single
      gadolinium dose) will be obtained to measure pulmonary vein flow. CMR sequences to
      characterize left atrial function, including phasic volumes and emptying fractions (total,
      passive, active) will also be performed.

      Data on heart rate variability will additionally be collected at pre- and post-PVI clinic
      visits, as well as the morning after PVI (hospital day 1).
