      to receive i.v. normal saline (control group) or AVP 0.05 or 0.07 U kg-1 (AVP group, n = 15
      each) 2 min before moving into BCP. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), jugular
      venous bulb oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2)
      are measured before (pre-sitting in supine position) and after patients assumed BCP.
