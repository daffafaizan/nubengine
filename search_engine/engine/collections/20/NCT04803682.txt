      I. To evaluate the feasibility of training selected eleventh grade high school student
      volunteers to provide an intervention involving mentoring combined with social support
      activities.

      II. To increase ninth grade high school student well-being, which would ultimately influence
      tobacco related knowledge and resistance skills regarding tobacco uptake among ninth grade
      high school program participants.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Mentor ability, confidence, and intention (ACI) to address tobacco use and dependence and
      providing anti-tobacco advice to mentees.

      II. To determine the scores on mentoring competencies. III. To determine the influences of
      social support and self-esteem by mentors. IV. To determine the quality and satisfaction with
      the relationships among mentors and mentees.

      V. To determine level of knowledge about nicotine and tobacco products among mentees.

      VI. To determine susceptibility to tobacco use among non-smokers. VII. To determine
      progression through stages of change among smokers.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete online ASPIRE course over 3.5-4 hours.

      HIGH SCHOOL MENTORS: Eleventh grade high school students receive mentor training over 4-5
      hours on how to mentor ninth grade students.

      ALL STUDENTS: Mentors and mentees are paired up so that eleventh grade high school students
      mentor the ninth grade high school students over 30 minutes for 7 sessions about the
      different types of tobacco products (such as cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and so on) and the
