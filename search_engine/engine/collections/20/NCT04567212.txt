      worldwide. Even if there is a specific drug treatment for each stage of disease (From mild to
      severe) in some patients it is not efficacy and it culd be reated to the gender difference
      Polymorphisms seems to be involved in asthma (allergic or not) even if no data have been
      published concerning the role of gender in this clinical manifestation. The role of
      polymorphisms in susceptibility to allergic asthma has been partially investigated but no
      study has analysed gender subgroups separately, neglecting a their potential predictive role
      in symptomatological and functional variations in the allergic asthma in both sexes. The aim
      of this study is to assess whether genetic variations involved in the genes encoding the two
      key leukotriene enzymes, ALOX5 and LTC4S, and CysLTR1 are implicated in the sex difference of
      allergic asthma in a well-characterized patient cohort.
