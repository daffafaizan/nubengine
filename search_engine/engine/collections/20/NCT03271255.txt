    
      Firstly, screen eligible mCRC patients for enrolment. Our CRC clinical nurse specialists will
      document medical history of patients including diagnoses, first-line chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6
      or CAPOX),bevacizumab dosage,toxicities,PFS on previous therapy.In the
      meantime,chest-abdonimal-pelvic CT and blood tests are to be examined to assess base-line
      measurable lesions and guarantee adequate organ function prior to enrolment.If all the values
      meet the criteria for enrolment, consent will be signed.

      Secondly, randomise patients into two arms: Arm A-apatinib plus FOLFIRI regimen and arm
      B-bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI regimen.A software which is alike the procedure of coin flipping
      is used to randomise eligible patients.According to the selected regimen in specific
      arm,patients will be given full-dose drugs or reduced dose drugs if serious toxicities (
      CTCAE v4.0 criteria grade 3/4) are complained since previous cycle of treatment.Symptoms and
      blood test results (including CEA and CA199) before each cycle will be recorded and the
      consultant oncologist, who is responsible for individual participants, will decide whether to
      continue next cycle chemotherapy with apatinib or bevacizumab based on the assigned
      arm.Radiological assessment consisting of chest-abdonimal-pelvic CT will be performed every 2
      months.Notably,the monitor will check with physicians and nurse specialists for the accuracy
      and completeness of all data.

      Thirdly, follow up participants and analyse primary end point (PFS) and secondary end points
      (OS,ORR and DCR).The causes of confirmed missing data in the trial should be recorded in
      detail to determine the mechanism of missing data and choose the suitable missing data
      handling methods.
