    
      This randomized controlled trial will deliver two interventions: (1) telephone call reminder
      and (2) text messaging reminder.

      Participants who meet study eligibility criteria based on intake assessment will be recruited
      and complete baseline assessment immediately after they receive acupuncture treatment. There
      will be 40 participants in each of the two intervention groups and the no intervention
      control group.

      Participants will be adults who visit the Emperor's College Acupuncture Clinic for a new
      treatment consultation on the date of the enrollment.

      The telephone call and text messaging intervention is a one-time reminder system delivered to
      the participants based on the study random assignment, three days after the initial visit. A
      research assistant will be contacting the participants based on the assigned interventions.

      There are three data collection points, 1) baseline (during initial visit), 2) 10 days after
      the initial visit, and 3) 30 days after the initial visit. Data will be collected via a
      tablet (baseline) and online survey (Day 10 and Day 30) through a secure online survey
      platform. Baseline assessment will occur prior to randomization, and post-intervention
      assessments will occur at 10 to 30 days after the initial visit.

      Number of follow-up treatments for the same health concern will be collected for all enrolled
      participants from the participants' clinical record.
