      collected as follows: Gestational age, birth weight, sex, delivery mode, type of maternal
      diabetes, other maternal diseases, feeding mode. Glucose levels as were recorded according to
      newborn protocol (1,2,4,6 hours after delivery, and then every 8 hours for total of 48
      hours). Data of hypoglycemia treatment, if given, will be collected.

      the "safe" time and glucose levels to stop monitoring.
