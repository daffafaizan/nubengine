      populations including neuromuscular and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as in age and
      height matched controls.

      Researchers will use EIT to determine changes in regional ventilation with pulmonary
      interventions including airway clearance and invasive and noninvasive ventilation in a
      pediatric respiratory disease population.
