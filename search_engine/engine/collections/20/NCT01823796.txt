      intrinsic physiological ageing and underlying chronic disease interacting with the external
      and challenging environment. Disturbances in physical function, muscle strength, range of
      motion, poor balance, affectation in sensory system, a loss of proprioception, alteration
      concerning visual and vestibular aspects, dizziness, decreased endurance and cognitive and
      mobility impairment are the most common risk factors for falls. Postural control in a dual
      task setting is especially relevant to daily life situations. Attending to that, we propose
      an assessment based on these parameters in women with fibromyalgia.
