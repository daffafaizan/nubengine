      awareness (i.e., mindfulness) of one's experience in a non-judgmental or accepting manner
      (Kabat-Zinn, et al., 1990). Mindfulness programs may facilitate recovery from cancer.
      However, most prior mindfulness investigations for women with breast cancer focused on cancer
      survivors, well beyond the acute period of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, few of
      these studies evaluated immune measures with relevance to cancer.

      Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3) will be enrolled.
      Eligible women will be identified after completion of their breast surgery and when surgical
      pathology reports are available. Women will complete psychometric instruments and study
      questionnaires. They will provide blood for immune measures and saliva for cortisol diurnal
      rhythm. Measures will be done at five separate time points. These are pre-, mid-, and
      completion of either the MBSR or the attention control program, as well as at 1- and 6-months
      post-program. Demographic information and information about health behaviors will be
      collected by self-report. Wrist actigraphy for an additional assessment of sleep quality will
      be done in an exploratory manner. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to compute
      multilevel model for change, based on full maximum likelihood estimation (Raudenbush, S. W.,
      and A. S. Bryk. 2002). Hierarchical linear modeling will be applied to examine
      intra-individual and inter-individual differences in initial status (baseline) and
      trajectories of change over time.
