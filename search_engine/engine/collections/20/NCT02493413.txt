      Institute of Microbiology and Immunology at the Medical Faculty of Ljubljana/University of
      Ljubljana in a clinical setting as an observational type. In the group of examinees the
      investigators chose only those obese without detectable complications of coronary heart
      disease while admitted. Obese patients with angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, valvular
      heart disease and congestive heart disease had been excluded from the research. Since
      personality is the major determinant of chronic stress, according to the investigators
      hypothesis, further division on two global traits Negative affectivity (NA) and Social
      inhibition (SI) structured by Denollet has been positioned in the study. A total of 30
      patients with CHD were divided in two groups. Participants who were obese with high DS14
      score matched obese controls with normal DS14 score. In all subjects the investigators also
      observed white blood cell counts with a detailed lymphocyte analysis using flow cytometry and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) as the indicator of inflammation. Besides body mass (BM), body mass
      index (BMI) systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and heart rate
      variability (HRV) were measured before and after three months period, while all subjects had
      been already exercising 4 times weakly (moderate walking of 5km/h) for an hour. Additionally
      STAIX-1, SWLS and QOLLTI-P questionnaires had been used.
