    
      1. To evaluate the safety of treatment with the Arctic Front® Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter
           System, including the Freezor® MAX Cardiac Cryoablation Catheter by assessing the
           continuous survival of subjects free from one or more primary safety outcome
           measures-Cryoablation Procedure Events (CPEs) and Major Atrial Fibrillation Events
           (MAFEs), in adult patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who have failed one or
           more Atrial Fibrillation Drugs (AFDs).

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with the Arctic Front® Cardiac CryoAblation
           Catheter System, including the Freezor® MAX Cardiac Cryoablation Catheter by assessing
           the continuous survival of subjects with success in the primary effectiveness outcome
           measure of Long Term Clinical Success (LTCS) in adult patients with paroxysmal atrial
           fibrillation who have failed one or more Atrial Fibrillation Drugs (AFDs).

        3. To evaluate the acute performance of the modified Arctic Front® Cardiac CryoAblation
           Catheter System for comparison with the Arctic Front® Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter
           System used in the PS-023 STOP AF Pivotal Trial.
