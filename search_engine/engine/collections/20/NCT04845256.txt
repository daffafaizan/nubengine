      complete, participants will undergo immediate breast reconstruction per the surgeon's typical
      protocol. Surgeon will place up to two (2) drain(s) per breast as customary without changing
      their technique at the end of the surgical procedure. SOMAVACÂ® 100 Sustained Vacuum System
      will be attached to the end of the drain(s) on one side of the subject and standard of care
      manual suction bulbs attached to the other side. Subjects will return to the clinic every 72
      hours for visits for the first 1 to 2 weeks, until the drain drops below 25mL, or as
      instructed by the physician. Each visit will take about 30 minutes. Subjects will have
      routine phone calls with the clinic to provide their drain output information to help
      determine when the drains should be removed. This is a study where the standard techniques of
      closed suction drainage are used for the removal of fluid from a surgical site. Hence, an
      increased risk related to post-operative care is not anticipated.
