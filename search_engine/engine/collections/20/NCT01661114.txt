      inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme needed for synthesis of deoxynucleotides,
      and 5-FU interferes with dTTP synthesis by inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS). It is
      likely that concomitant administration of gemcitabine and 5FU results in increased
      cytotoxicity by reducing intracellular dTTP thru two different mechanisms, thereby inhibiting
      DNA replication and repair. Platinum compounds lead to cell death by forming DNA adducts and
      causing double strand breaks. By inhibiting DNA synthesis and repair, both gemcitabine and
      5-FU potentiate the activity of cisplatin. These interactions underlie the clinical synergism
      that has been observed with platinum/5FU and platinum/gemcitabine combinations.
