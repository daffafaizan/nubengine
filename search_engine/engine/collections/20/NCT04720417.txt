    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the potential efficacy of the combination of defactinib hydrochloride
      (defactinib [VS-6063]) and Raf/MEK serine/threonine kinase inhibitor RO5126766 (VS-6766) in
      patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effectiveness of defactinib in combination with VS-6766 in patients with
      metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM).

      II. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of defactinib and VS6766.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacodynamic profile of defactinib in combination with VS-6766 in
      pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment tumor biopsies.

      II. To investigate mechanisms of resistance to the combination of defactinib and VS-6766.

      III. To investigate the potential efficacy of circulating cell free deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) for prediction/monitoring.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive defactinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and VS-6766 PO twice a week (BIW)
      (Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday) for 3 weeks in every cycle. Cycles repeat every
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until death or up
      to 2 years after the last patient is enrolled.
