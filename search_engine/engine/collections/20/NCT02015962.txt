      unit (CICU). The development of ventricular arrhythmias related to hypokalemia can lead to
      sudden cardiac death. Thus, potassium replacement therapy is the cornerstone therapy for
      hypokalemia.Though intravenous potassium replacement (IVPR) in hypokalemia is the preferred
      route in most intensive care settings, it is associated with known safety risks.
      Inappropriately administered, IVPR can lead to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death 1, 7, 8.
      Given these risks, IVPR is considered a "high-alert medication" by Institute of Safe
      Medication practice.

      Enteral potassium replacement (EPR), with its superior safety profile may be a better
      alternative to IVPR. A retrospective review showed that the efficacy of EPR was comparable to
      IVPR in pediatric patients after congenital heart disease.

      The investigators seek to explore this comparison between EPR and IVPR in a randomized
      prospective trial
