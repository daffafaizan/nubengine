      adductor canal block (ACB) versus ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block (LPB) in patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty aiming at decreasing post-operative pain, helping in early
      mobilization and better physiotherapy.

      This study hypothesizes that ACB, compared with LPB, will exhibit less motor, weakness, fewer
      opioids consumption with the same or better pain score.
