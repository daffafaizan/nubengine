        -  Feasibility: to validate and determine the applicability of a pre-specified algorithm
           for managing conduction disturbances in consecutive patients undergoing TAVR, also
           evaluating the percentage of patients included in each group of the algorithm strategy.

        -  Efficacy: (i) to evaluate the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation in-hospital and
           at 30 days compared to that of the year prior to the implementation of the protocol,
           (ii) to determine the incidence of sudden death at 30 days and at 1-year follow-up.
