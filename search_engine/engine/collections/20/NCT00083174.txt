      Primary

      Previously: To determine if exemestane reduces the incidence of invasive breast cancer
      compared with placebo.

      Currently: To determine the frequency of serious adverse events for post-menopausal women at
      high-risk of developing breast cancer who choose to receive 5 years of exemestane as
      preventative therapy.

      Secondary

      Previously: (same as is currently listed in PDQ) Currently: To address the Trial Committee
      and Sponsor's commitment to allow women who are randomized to the MAP.3 trial to receive 5
      years of exemestane therapy.

      OUTLINE: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study.
      Protocol-specified analyses were performed in April 2011. The results of these analyses are
      posted in the Results section. Following the amendment of May 2011, the study is now
      open-label and all eligible patients are receiving exemestane from participating sites for a
      total of 5 years. After exemestane is stopped, there is no further follow-up.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:There were 4560 women from the United States, Canada, Spain and France who
      took part in this study.
