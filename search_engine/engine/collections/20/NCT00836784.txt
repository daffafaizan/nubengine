      amount of wearing the 3-month-old brushes will determine by measurement of brushing surface
      areas using NIH imaging software. The outcomes will be measured after 3 month. The tooth
      brush which used in this study is "Jordan" with the following specifications: Length: 128 mm,
      9 rows of bristles, 27 tufts, 24 monofilaments per tuft, height of monofilaments 10 mm and
      diameter of filaments 0.3 mm. The students will attend on two occasions following 48 hour
      periods of no oral hygiene. Following plaque scoring, students will brush with a new tooth
      brush at one visit and with a brush that they had used previously for 3 months at the other
      visit. Brushing time was 60 seconds. Plaque then will be re-scored and the percentage
      reduction in plaque score will be calculate using the Turesky plaque index. All plaque
      scoring will be performed by one examiner who is blind with the groups allocations.
