      MRI signal intensity (SI) at three defined post-implantation stages: short, mid and long
      term. The SI of ProFlor has been compared to the SI of the neighbouring muscles and fat. As
      additional proof, histology of tissue specimens excised at the identical post-implantation
      stages from porcine models in the fame of a previous experimental attempt were also
      evaluated. The results of this experimental trial have ben already published in 2011 - ref: A
      new prosthetic implant for inguinal hernia repair: its features in a porcine experimental
      model. Artificial Organs 2011;35(8):E181-E190
