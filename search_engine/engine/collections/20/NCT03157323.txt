      exceeding 90%. However, treatment-related toxicity remains a clinical challenge during and
      after treatment. Evidence-based, nutritional interventions may minimize the development of
      nutrition-related toxicities, such as bone morbidities, hypertriglyceridemia, and obesity. To
      date, no effective interventions are available to prevent nutrition-related morbidities in
      children with ALL. Clinical studies evaluating the glycemic indices in other pediatric
      conditions have been encouraging. It is plausible that reducing the glycemic indices of diets
      during cancer treatment may have a profound clinical effect in this vulnerable pediatric
      population. Prior to the design and implementation of randomized, controlled trials,
      epidemiological data describing the Glycemic Index (GI) and Glycemic Load (GL) and the
      association with clinically important outcomes is needed. Additionally, the feasibility of a
      dietary intervention must also be explored within the setting of pediatric cancer. This study
      aims to determine the feasibility, measured by compliance to a low-GI diet, of a 6-month low
      glycemic dietary intervention in children and adolescents undergoing treatment for ALL. The
      proposed work will be used for the design and implementation of a multi-center nutritional
      intervention aimed at improving dietary intake during treatment and its effect on clinically
      important outcomes. Importantly, the information will be used to drive the formation of
      evidence-based nutritional guidelines for children with cancer, which will expand into the
      emerging field of individualized medicine for patients with cancer.
