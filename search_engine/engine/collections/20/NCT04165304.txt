      drinks. A high sugar diet associated not only with the increase in overweight children, but
      also with type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.

      In many schools, cold drink vending machines with different fillings are available offering
      various sugary drinks.

      Participating schools will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1:1 into three groups. In one
      intervention group, the vending machines will be re-equipped to contain 60% drinks containing
      a maximum of 6.7g sugar/100ml, 20% drinks containing more than 6.7g sugar/100ml and 20%
      water. In the second intervention group, the vending machines offer 80% water, 20% products
      with a maximum of 6.7g sugar/100ml. In the control group, the range of products offered by
      the vending machines remains unchanged. Information of the students drinking habits, total
      fluid intake and sugar intake in the form of food and drinks will be collected. In addition,
      data such as body height, body weight, physical activity and socio-democratic or
      socio-economic data will be accumulated. The sales figures of the drinks in the vending
      machines will be recorded and information about the surroundings of the schools (fast food
      chains, supermarkets, etc.) will be collected.

      The survey of students and data collection will be repeated three times. In a sub-study,
      demographic data and the frequency of consumption of sugared beverages and water are
      collected from 2 focus groups. In addition, participants will complete a questionnaire on
      general attitudes towards sugary drinks or water, obstacles to and incentives for reducing
      sugar consumption by liquids or increasing water consumption.
