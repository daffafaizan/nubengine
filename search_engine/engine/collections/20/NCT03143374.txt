      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells, including Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease and Frontotemporal degeneration. [18F]T807
      (also known as 18F-AV- 1451) is a specialized radioactive PET tracer that sticks to the tau
      protein in the brain. In this study, researchers will use [18F]T807 to form images of tau
      binding in the brain. [18F]T807 is an investigational or experimental imaging agent that has
      not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in brain imaging.

      In this study, researchers want to find out how accurate and useful [18F]T807 is in imaging
      patients who have problems with thinking, remembering, speech, and visual activities, and may
      be diagnosed with different types of neurodegenerative disease. This study will help test how
      imaging measures may provide information that could be used to determine diagnosis for
      patients in the future. The results of the PET/CT scan will be compared with other
      information obtained under related protocols, including brain magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), spinal fluid and cognitive test results.
