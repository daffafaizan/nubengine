      incontinence, and demonstrated a poor reproductibility of urodynamic parameters for a part of
      the studies and a good reproductibility for the others. There is only three studies
      investigating the reproductibility of repeated cystometries in patients with overactive
      detrusor and neurogenic lower tract dysfunction. The most common etiology in these studies is
      spinal cord injury. Only one article includes MS patients with lower urinary tract symptoms
      (22 patients among 226 with other etiologies).

      The aim of this study was to assess the short term reproductibility in multiple sclerosis
      patients with qualitative and quantitative urodynamic data.

      The authors conducted a prospective analysis in our Neuro-urology department of a University
      Hospital . All patient with Multiple Sclerosis referred for urinary disorders, coming for a
      urodynamic evaluation with multiple cystometries during the study were included if they had a
      detrusor overactivity for a filling of 300 ml or less on the first cystometry. The main
      exclusion criteria were a significate difference between the filling volume during the study
      and the volume truly of water truly collected after catheterization, an urinary tract
      infection, or an other acute disease.The investigators performed a first cystometry and
      looked for a detrusor overactivity, if the investigators discovered an involuntary detrusor
      contraction for a filling of 300 ml or less, the authors realized two others cystometries
      (filling rate of 50 mL/min) after informed consent. The volume and pressure at which the
      first and the maximal involuntary detrusor contraction, MCC were documented.
