      warfarin based on the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhagic strokes (safety) and
      ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and myocardial infarction (effectiveness). Secondary
      objectives comprise the assessment of the mentioned risks in subpopulations of patients with
      renal impairment or diabetes, mortality rates, and drug utilisation as well as patient
      characteristics before and after the first intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic stroke.
