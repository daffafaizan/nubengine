      calcified atherosclerotic coronary lesions. It aims at fragmenting calcium deposits into
      microscopic particulates to allow less hazardous coronary revascularization and stenting. The
      main drawback associated with the procedure is the subsequent enhancement of platelet
      aggregation which promotes the distal embolization of micro-thrombi and atherosclerotic
      fragments. In order to limit these complications, a double antiplatelet therapy is required
      (generally Clopidogrel + Aspirin) when RA procedures are performed. Clopidogrel inhibits the
      protein P2Y12 which is a cornerstone in platelet aggregation. It is characterized by a slow
      and variable transformation of a prodrug into an active metabolite and by a remaining risk of
      thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Ticagrelor is a new antiplatelet agent that provides
      faster and greater P2Y12 inhibition than Clopidogrel. It is currently indicated to reduce
      risk of cardiovascular events in patients hospitalized for coronary revascularization after
      an acute coronary syndrome. Ticagrelor has never been evaluated so far in stable coronary
      patients treated with rotational atherectomy prior to angioplasty.
