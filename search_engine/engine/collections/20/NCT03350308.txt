      spectral analysis of heart rate variability (CHU of Clermont Ferrand only) and a measurement
      of intracellular and extracellular volumes by bioimpedancemetry. During the next 9 sessions,
      the decrease in the VSR will be recorded using an optical haematocrit measurement system.
      Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured every 30 minutes using an automatic blood
      pressure monitor and whenever the patient's nurse deems it necessary.
