      (high ammonia levels) and fall into coma often causing brain damage. For these children to be
      able to benefit maximally from available long-term treatment and solid organ transplant,
      outcome of the neonatal onset crisis must be improved. Animal experiments and small clinical
      trials have indicated that hypothermia protects the brain during hyperammonemia. This pilot
      study investigates whether adjunct hypothermia therapy in addition to standard of care
      treatment is feasible and safe in babies with high ammonia levels in coma.
