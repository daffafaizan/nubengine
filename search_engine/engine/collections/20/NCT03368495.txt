      yellow fever and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines be administered on the same day or
      at least 4 weeks apart to prevent interference between live vaccines. In 2011 a Brazilian
      study demonstrated lower seroconversion against yellow fever, rubella, and mumps when the two
      vaccines were administered on the same day compared with administering them separately. WHO
      urged that additional studies be conducted to examine this issue.

      This Phase IV study aims to determine if seroconversion against measles, mumps, rubella, and
      yellow fever after administration of MMR and yellow fever vaccines on the same day is
      non-inferior to seroconversion after sequential administration 28 days apart in health
      12-month old children.
