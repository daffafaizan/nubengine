      evaluate the efficacy of fluvoxamine on change from baseline to the last observation visit in
      the JCY-BOCS 10-item total score. Eligible patients will be allocated to the fluvoxamine
      group or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio using the experience of fluvoxamine treatment and age
      as stratification factors (dynamic allocation). The first phase consists of a screening
      period of 1-2 weeks, a forced titration dose period of 2 weeks, a dose adjustment period of 4
      weeks, a maintained dose period of 4 weeks, and a tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks.

      The 2nd phase will be conducted in an open-label manner in participants who completed the
      first phase to evaluate the long-term safety of fluvoxamine. The 2nd phase consists of 3
      periods; a forced titration dose period of 2 weeks, a flexible dose period of 50 weeks, and a
      tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks. After the last dose of study drug (including tapering dose
      period) or the early termination visit, participants will be followed for up to 30 days.
