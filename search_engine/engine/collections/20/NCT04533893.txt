      University students without prior knowledge of basic life support protocol. 11 Participants
      (44.0%) were male, 14 (56.0%) were female. The participants were informed about the study and
      signed consent forms before participating the study. After a brief introduction of the
      serious gaming module, the participants were asked to choose the self-test mode of the
      serious game module. The participants' number of attempts was not limited. Following serious
      game based training, the hands-on training module combining OSCE scoring criteria with sensor
      data retrieved from the simulator's sensors was used for hands-on performance evaluation.
      After familiarization with the system using self-training mode, the participants were asked
      to proceed the BLS Hands-on training app with the simulator under the supervision of the
      educator. The simulation sessions were also recorded in order to use these recordings for
      conventional OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) performance evaluation.
      Conventional OSCE score of each participant was obtained by watching the recorded sessions of
      BLS trainings.Spearman's rho correlation test was used for calculating the correlation
      between serious gaming, hands on training module with including sensor data from the
      simulator and OSCE scores.
