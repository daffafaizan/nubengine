      both ranking the 2nd among malignancies in China. Surgery is the only possible way to cure
      gastric cancer, however, over 80-90% of gastric cancer patients in China are in advanced
      stage. Locally advanced gastric cancer could be cured by multi-disciplinary therapies
      including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can increase the
      resectability of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival. However, the therapeutic
      effects remain unsatisfactory.

      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric
      cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce
      recurrence rate. Camrelizumab in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for
      injection which has been approved for melanoma and Hepatocellular carcinoma .This study is a
      single center, open-label, randomized comparative phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety
      and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally
      advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Differences in T cell
      expression were detected by single cell RNA sequencing to screen people who were more
      sensitive to immunotherapy.
