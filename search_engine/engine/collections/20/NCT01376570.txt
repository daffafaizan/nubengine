      abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention compared with a control condition
      (Performance Feedback) on HIV viral load suppression. The investigators will enroll 202
      opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals who are receiving opioid agonist treatment with
      buprenorphine or methadone, who continue to use opiates, oxycodone or cocaine (drugs that are
      consistently associated with poor HIV treatment outcomes), and who are prescribed
      antiretroviral medication, but with suboptimal viral load suppression. The contingency
      management group will have the potential to receive compensation in vouchers over the 16-week
      intervention based on drug-free urine. Participants will be followed for 28 weeks, with
      research visits occurring twice weekly during the Baseline Period (weeks 1-4) and
      Intervention Period (weeks 5-20), then every two weeks during the Post-Intervention Period
      (weeks 21-28). Data sources will include blood tests (viral load and CD4 count), urine
      toxicology tests, questionnaires, pill counts, and medical records. The primary outcome will
      be change in HIV viral load, and secondary outcomes will include CD4 count, antiretroviral
      adherence, and abstinence.
