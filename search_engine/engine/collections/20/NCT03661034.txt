      assess two different dose levels (randomly assigned). Based on initial outcomes in Cohort 1
      at Interim Analysis, the doses for Cohort 2 will be escalated or decreased. Subjects will
      participate in 1 year (48 weeks) of daily therapy dose using the non-invasive,
      non-significant risk sensory stimulation medical device.
