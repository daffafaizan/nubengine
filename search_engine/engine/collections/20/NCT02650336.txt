      persistently high rates of mortality and morbidity. With an ever-increasing number of
      patients receiving intravascular injection of iodinated contrast media worldwide, contrast
      induced nephropathy (CIN) has become the third leading cause of hospital-acquired AKI.
      Approximately half of these cases are in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization
      procedures.

      The prevention and early intervention of CIN has been hampered mainly by the lack of a
      consensus definition and the paucity of early predictive biomarkers to accurately identify
      high-risk patients. CIN is most frequently defined as an increase in serum creatinine (sCr)
      by 25-50% above the baseline, generally occurring within the first 24 h after contrast
      exposure, in the absence of other causes. However, sCr is an unreliable indicator during
      acute changes in kidney function, and alterations in sCr levels are not particularly
      sensitive or specific for small changes in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)e, gender,
      race and intravascular volume. Biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and
      neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) have been used for the early diagnosis of
      AKI, although with no definitive results.
