      disabilities. Data from animal studies have shown protective effects of hyperbaric oxygen
      therapy to impaired brain. Recently research priorities have moved from bench to bedside.
      Several studies have shown a trend for brain protection of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has
      emerged as a promising treatment for HIE. Therefore,the investigators organized a
      multi-centered randomized controlled trial of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in HIE newborn
      infants.
