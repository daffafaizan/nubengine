      (www.longlastingmemories.eu), which was funded by the European Commission (Information and
      Communication Technologies Policy Support Program (ICT-PSP) for a three year period
      (2009-2012). It used a pre-post-test design with the between-participant factor group
      [intervention vs. passive control]. Post-test was conducted within 2 weeks after completion
      of the exercise period. Interventions were carried out in Athens and Thessaloniki (Greece)
      within day care centers, hospitals, senior care centers, a memory outpatient center, local
      parishes, at university campus facilities (university community installations), and at
      participants' homes.

      Institutions had to provide at least 5 exercise weeks, with a frequency of at least 1
      physical and 2 cognitive exercise sessions per week, resulting in at least 5 physical and 10
      cognitive exercise sessions in total.
