      80mg/day and 100mg /day will be tested in the dose escalation phase. At least 3 patients will
      be enrolled at each dose level and at least 6 evaluable patients required to be treated at
      the recommended Phase II dose(RP2D)/MTD dose. After dose escalation the 80mg/day and the
      100mg /day dose levels will be expanded to evaluate up to approximately a total of 15
      patients each (if 100mg is determined as the RP2D/MTD).
