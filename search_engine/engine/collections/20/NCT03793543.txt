      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) using 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT for detection of tumor
      burden and perform a lesion-based head-to-head comparison with a subsequent near-term (one to
      seven days) 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT follow-up scan, to assess test-retest reproducibility of this
      second-generation PSMA-targeted compound. Second, as it has not been specifically
      investigated with this compound before, intra-observer agreement as well as inter-scan
      variability will be assessed.
