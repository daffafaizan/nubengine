    
      Strattera (atomoxetine) is a non-stimulant presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in child, adolescent and adult
      patients with ADHD. Atomoxetine is a potent inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine
      transporter with minimal affinity for other noradrenergic receptors or for other
      neurotransmitter transporters or receptors. Thus, Strattera could be a viable alternative
      treatment for ADHD individuals who do not respond to stimulants.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      Strattera in youth, ages 6-17 years with ADHD who failed to respond to an adequate trial of
      stimulant treatment. If this initial study shows proof of the concept, we will follow-up the
      study with a randomized clinical trial.
