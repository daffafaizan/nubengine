      contracture. Surgeons are taught that by everting wounds' edges with well-placed dermal
      sutures, there is less depression of the resultant scar. A prior study conducted by us at
      this center found that wound eversion was not associated with better cosmetic outcome (1).
      However, it was noted that most of the procedures were performed off the head and neck,
      places where the effects of eversion were thought to be most beneficial (2) Thus our goal is
      to now study the effects of eversion exclusively on the face and neck.
