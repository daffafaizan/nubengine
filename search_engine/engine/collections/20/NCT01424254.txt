    
      Background: The introduction of the wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) may dramatically alter
      the management of patients with small bowel disease such as chronic gastrointestinal bleeding
      of obscure origin (CGB). Yet, to date, this non invasive technique has undergone widespread
      diffusion in the absence of properly designed prospective comparative cost-effectiveness
      evaluations.

      Objectives: To examine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of a novel approach
      employing WCE compared to that of push enteroscopy (PE).

      Hypothesis: WCE is more cost-effective than PE in patients with CGB. Study design: We propose
      a randomized clinical trial comparing WCE to PE. Study population: Patients with CGB having
      undergone initial normal assessment with gastroscopy, colonoscopy and radiological
      examination of the small bowel.

      Outcomes: Primary objective: To compare the detection rates of "clinically significant" small
      bowel lesions using WCE versus PE in CGB patients randomized to either modality. Secondary
      objectives: To determine the "cure rate" for each technique after 6 months, the
      cost-effectiveness of WCE versus PE, the type of small bowel lesions most likely to impact on
      clinical care, inter-rater variability in reading WCE examinations, the feasibility of WCE
      interpretation by a dedicated technician, the safety of each imaging modality, and to compare
      patient satisfaction and quality of life between the two groups.
