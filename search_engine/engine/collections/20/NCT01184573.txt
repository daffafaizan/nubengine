      billion in health care costs. The incidence rate of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is rapidly
      increasing and may be related to expanded alcohol abuse. Advanced CP can be easily detected
      by imaging techniques. However, mild to moderate CP presents a more difficult challenge for
      clinicians. Imaging techniques fail to recognize less advanced CP cases about 40% of the
      time. The gold standard for monitoring early stage CP is the secretin stimulation test.
      However, the secretin stimulation test is only done in a few US centers.

      The investigators have developed the Pancreatic Breath Test (PBT) as an alternative to the
      secretin stimulation test. The breath test uses a tracer dose of sodium 13C-bicarbonate to
      detect the amount of bicarbonate released after stimulation of the pancreatitis by a meal
      (liquid Ensure). A normal pancreas releases unlabeled bicarbonate upon stimulation,
      decreasing the ratio of 13C/12C of exhaled carbon dioxide. This ratio will change much less
      in a diseased pancreas.

      A case-control study in 25 mild to moderate CP patients and 25 healthy controls will be
      utilized to show feasibility of the new breath test.
