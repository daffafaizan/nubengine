      of choice for many years. However, stent obstruction is a major limitation of this approach.
      Studies have shown that the conventional tubular type polyethylene stents (CS) with side
      holes accumulate significant sludge and their mean patency is approximately 90 days.

      Thus patients requiring longer term stenting need to undergo stent exchanges every 2-3
      months.

      Recently, a stent with a star-shaped cross-section has been developed for biliary
      applications. This FDA approved biliary Wing stent (WS) (ViaDuctâ„¢) is a novel plastic biliary
      stent that lacks a lumen, and is designed to allow bile to flow on the outside of the stent.

      The stent which is star shaped in cross section, channels fluid along its winged perimeter.

      It has been proposed that the winged stent design with a lack of central lumen obviates the
      risk of luminal occlusion and that the risk of occlusion, given the presence of multiple
      external drainage channels, is smaller. Longer term biliary drainage without the need for
      stent exchange should therefore be possible with these stents.

      The primary aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the patency rate of the winged
      stent in up to 90 days for patients with benign biliary obstruction.
