    
      This study will be a randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind (Investigator and Subject),
      single and repeat ascending dose protocol, in multiple sclerosis patients. The study is
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and any potential for
      immunogenicity of GSK1223249 (a monoclonal antibody raised against Nogo-A), given
      intravenously in Multiple Sclerosis patients. The study will also evaluate exploratory
      endpoints including para-clinical activity via magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal
      fluid pharmacokinetics, and effect of repeat dose administration of GSK1223249 on disability.
      Furthermore MS symptoms, such as relapses and individual symptom severity will be closely
      monitored.
