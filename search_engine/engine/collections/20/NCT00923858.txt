        1. To determine the probability that an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear will become
           symptomatic over time.

        2. To determine which epidemiological factors correlate with symptomatic progression.

        3. To determine if symptomatic progression correlates with enlargement of the rotator cuff
           tear as determined at sonography.

        4. To determine the value of routine sonographic scanning of the asymptomatic shoulder.
