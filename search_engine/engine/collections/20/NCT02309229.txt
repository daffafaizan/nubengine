      score for respiratory and other symptoms.

      Primary analysis will focus on the predicting value of sputum purulence on exacerbations.
      Secondary analysis will evaluate symptoms on exacerbation prediction. A third subanalysis
      will focus on correlation of daily pollution fluctuations and sputum purulence or symptoms.
