      blindness with or without acute attacks. Different from open angle glaucoma (OAG), the main
      principle of treatment for AACG is not only to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) but also to
      protect the anterior chamber angle from closing. Previously, the most common and classical
      treatment for AACG was trabeculectomy. However, both doctors and patients are not satisfied
      with this surgery because of its limited success rate due to fibrosis of the filtration
      pathway. Besides, trabeculectomy has various complications, such as shallow anterior chamber,
      choroidal effusion, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, malignant glaucoma, and bleb leakage
      associated endophthalmitis. In addition, patients who underwent trabeculectomy will have
      decreased visual acuity in a couple of years due to accelerated development of cataract.
      Since a thickened and anterior-positioned lens could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis
      of AACG, cataract surgery has also been used. Accumulative evidence shows lens extraction
      alone is an efficient way in treating the early stage of ACG but has limited success rate in
      AACG. Lens extraction combined with goniosynechialysis (LEG) has been proved to be better
      than lens extraction alone in re-opening the anterior chamber angle for ACG patients with
      extensive peripheral anterior synechia and possibly have better effect than trabeculectomy as
      well from our preliminary data, which has not been proved yet. Thus, this investigation is
      designed to compare the effect of LEG and trabeculectomy in AACG patients prospectively in 3
      years of follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that LEG could have better IOP control and
      better visual function than trabeculectomy in long term for AACG patients.
