      of 5 h should be kept between dosing of safinamide and medicinal products that are BCRP
      substrates with a Tmax ≤ 2 h (e.g. pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate,
      topotecan, diclofenac or glyburide).

      Following a specific request of FDA, the present interaction study in healthy male and female
      volunteers will be conducted in order to determine if multiple dose administration of
      safinamide with the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin alters the plasma exposure of rosuvastatin in
      vivo. Orally administered rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
      reductase inhibitor, developed for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, represents a sensitive
      probe to assess the magnitude of BCRP inhibition. In PK trials in healthy volunteers,
      rosuvastatin Tmax ranged from 1.7 to 5 h after administration of 10-80 mg doses.
