      Stick) Specimen Collection as compared to samples obtained by standard venipuncture (blood
      taken from the arm vein). The information and data obtained will be used to finish
      development of a convenience kit that allows doctors to provide their patients a method to
      have their blood tested for clinical laboratory tests in the convenience of their home
      without having to visit the doctor's office or clinic.
