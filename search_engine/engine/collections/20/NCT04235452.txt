      control subjects. Electrophysiological study was done for all patients by Somatosensory
      Evoked Potential (SSEP) and Electroencephalography (EEG) while the control group underwent
      SSEP. SSEP was studied in the patients and control group by stimulation of right and left
      median nerves.
