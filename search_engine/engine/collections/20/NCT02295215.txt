      disease. Since a majority of patients with these changes progress to dilated form with
      ventricular dysfunction with all its serious consequences, it is interesting to better
      understand the pathophysiology of the disease at the stage where there electrocardiographic
      changes and preserved ventricular function. And besides, search strategies to slow the
      progress, or even prevent the chronic phase of the disease. For this reason the investigators
      will evaluate the effects of exercise training in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy without
      ventricular dysfunction.
