    
      The purpose of this confirmatory safety and efficacy study (GP15-302) was to demonstrate
      equivalence in efficacy and similarity in safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and Enbrel
      (EU-authorized) in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis and to
      evaluate the effects of repeated switching between GP2015 and Enbrel on efficacy, overall
      safety, and immunogenicity. Since only EU-authorized Enbrel was utilized in this study, the
      use of the term "Enbrel" throughout this report describes EU-authorized Enbrel only.
