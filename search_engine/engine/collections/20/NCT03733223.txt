      of stroke symptoms will be recruited in this study. All participants will be divided into two
      groups according to whether intracranial hemorrhage occurred within 3 days after treatment
      with alteplase for analysis. Differences in FVIII, t-PA/PAI-1, and MMP-9 levels before and
      after thrombolytic therapy will be examined in both groups. This study will be conducted at
      Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical
      University, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University.
