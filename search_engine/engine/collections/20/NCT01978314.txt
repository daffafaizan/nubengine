      kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for assessment of impairment, diagnosis,
      and prompt treatment. FAST BioMedical is an emerging technology company whose mission is to
      quantify clinically meaning ful physiological parameters that have been difficult or
      impossible to measure. GFR is the most clinically relevant metric for understanding renal
      function, as it is the rate by which the kidney is able to filter waste products in the
      bloodstream. The FAST mGFR is for direct measurement of GFR that relies on reading the ratio
      of fluorescent markers attached to different size dextran molecules introduced into the
      bloodstream. The test is intended as an adjunct to current methods utilized to assess kidney
      function.
