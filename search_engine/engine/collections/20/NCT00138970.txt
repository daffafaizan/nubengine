    
      Primary Objective To compare renal function (51Cr-EDTA clearance) 12 months posttransplant,
      in primary renal allograft recipients (from cadaveric donor) at low immunogenic risk, 0 DR
      mis-match, receiving immunosuppressive therapy with A) Zenapax® (5 doses), CellCept® (1.5 g
      bid., aiming for TDM for total trough concentrations of 2-6 mg/L) and prednisolone or B)
      Sandimmun Neoral® (full dose), CellCept® (1.0 g bid.) and prednisolone.

      Secondary Objectives To compare the two treatment groups with regard to: patient and graft
      survival (12 months), biopsy-proven and presumptive rejection episodes (3 and 12 months),
      posttransplant (12 months) incidence and severity of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose
      intolerance, incidence of infection and tolerability and "success rate" of TDM guided
      CellCept® dosing in a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive protocol over 12 months.
