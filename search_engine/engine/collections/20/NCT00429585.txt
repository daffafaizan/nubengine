      fracture of the proximal metaphysis of the tibia will be operatively managed by one of two
      strategies. The first strategy involves fixation of the fracture with a reamed, interlocking
      intramedullary nail (Nail Group). The second treatment strategy involves open reduction and
      internal fixation of the fracture with a locking periarticular plate (Plate Group). The null
      hypothesis of the study is that there will be no difference in the two groups with respect to
      the primary and secondary outcome measures. To the degree possible, patients in the two
      groups will receive post-operative care according to the same standards and protocols.
