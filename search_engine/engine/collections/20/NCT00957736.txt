        -  To determine and define the biological basis of different subtypes of chronic
           graft-vs-host disease using a targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms approach in
           patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Two important aspects of the methodologies that will be employed for the analysis of
      SNPs associated with GVHD are throughput efficiency to be able to perform the assays on a
      reasonable number of samples as well as having the ability to add or remove SNPs to the assay
      panel. While a genome-wide association study to identify variants associated with GVHD would
      offer an unbiased approach, our patient cohort size would not allow significant statistical
      power in the study. Therefore, a more targeted approach using two established technologies is
      proposed.

      The Sequenome assay uses the unique combination of a single-base primer extension assay
      incorporating one of four modified nucleotides. The four modified nucleotides each have a
      unique mass that allows them to be distinguished from one another using mass spectrometry.
      Each SNP is determined analyzing the primer extension product from a PCR amplicon that
      surrounds the SNP of interest. The development of each assay involves designing flanking PCR
      primers and an internal extension assay using web-based software provided by Sequenome. The
      assays can be designed to analyze up to 30 SNPs in a single reaction, providing a
      customizable, efficient and high-throughput assay for SNPs of interest.
