      other half will begin the study taking a placebo (sugar pill). There is an equal chance of
      being placed in either group.

      After two weeks, the patients will stop taking their first batch of medication to allow it to
      completely leave their bodies. Then the patients will begin taking the other medication so
      that by the end of the study, each patient will have been treated with pantoprazole for two
      weeks and placebo for two weeks.

      At the end of each two weeks, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding
      their daytime sleepiness and reflux symptoms. Patients will also complete reaction time
      testing as a measure of daytime sleepiness.
