    
      Acne is a chronic disorder of the pilosebaceous glands characterized by

      inflammatory papules, pustules, opened and closed comedones, cysts and

      nodules. Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a condition in which an

      inflammation from a disease such as acne, trauma, or abrasion results in areas

      of the skin with increased melanin content compared to the surrounding skin.

      There are several treatments available for acne, which include benzoyl

      peroxide,antibiotics (topical or oral), and topical retinoids (tretinoin,

      tazarotene, adapalene). Combination therapy, such as topical retinoid and

      clindamycin, has been shown to be more effective than monotherapy in

      addressing all pathogenic factors of acne.
