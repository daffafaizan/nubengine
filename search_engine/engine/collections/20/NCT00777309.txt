    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind phase 2 study designed to compare
      treatment with ARQ 197 plus erlotinib to erlotinib plus placebo in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer. The study will enroll patients who have had one prior chemotherapy regimen
      (other than erlotinib) for NSCLC. The study will evaluate progression-free survival between
      the two arms.

      A total of 154 patients will be enrolled.
