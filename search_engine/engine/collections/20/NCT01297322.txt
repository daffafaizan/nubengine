      safety and effectiveness of the study device in sealing femoral arterial access sites and
      providing reduced times to hemostasis and ambulation compared with manual compression at the
      completion of diagnostic or interventional endovascular procedures performed through 6 Fr or
      7 Fr introducer sheaths. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 treatment device to control
