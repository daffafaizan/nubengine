      patients with acute respiratory failure. One of the major advantages of high flow nasal
      canula oxygen is the possibility to maintain oxygenation during laryngoscopy and thereby
      providing high flow apneic oxygenation. In addition, and contrary no non-invasive
      ventilation, preoxygenation may be used in patients with neurological impairment. Finally,
      the interest of this device is that it is the same that is maintained throughout the whole
      management of the patient, from ICU admission to intubation.
