      esophagus. Studies in the past have shown that in healthy people, buspirone can improve the
      vigor with which the esophagus squeezes to propel food into the stomach. In patients with
      functional dysphagia, the esophagus muscles may be weak (as defined by manometry).

      Our two phase study will evaluate both symptoms of difficulty swallowing and the vigor with
      which the esophagus propels a bolus in patients after they 1) receive placebo pills and 2)
      receive buspirone pills.

      We hypothesize that the placebo pills will not affect the vigor of the muscles or the
      symptoms of difficulty swallowing, but that buspirone will improve both outcomes.
