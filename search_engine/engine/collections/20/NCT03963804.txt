      following injury. Subjects will come from the sports and other populations of concussed
      individuals. They will be matched with controls i.e. not head injured subjects who will also
      undergo the same set of tests and the same time intervals as the injured subjects. An
      additional pool of uninjured (not head injured) subjects will be collected who will be
      assessed at a single time point. This data will be used to populate a database for the
      purpose of deriving a multimodal concussion index.
