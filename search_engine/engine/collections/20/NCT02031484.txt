      recording vector combined with an easy-to-use long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring patch
      system, the CarnationTM Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System. The P-wave is a critical aspect
      of the electrocardiogram and a key finding for proper arrhythmia diagnosis. The CAM system is
      optimized for both ease of use and for maximum P-wave clarity for arrhythmia diagnosis.
