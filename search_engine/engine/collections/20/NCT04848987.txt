      inlays luted with three different resin cement strategies in MOD Class II restorations.

      Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted following the protocol, 40
      patients with three large cavities for each one that indicated for indirect MOD Class II
      restorations were enrolled in the current study. Then, 120 indirect resin composite inlay
      restorations (SR Nexco) were placed and luted with three different resin cement strategies;
      an etch-and-rinse (Variolink N), self-etch (Panavia F2.0) and self-adhesive (RelyX Unicem).
      Each resin cement was used for luting 20 inlay restorations. A single operator placed all
      restorations according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immediatelly after placement, the
      restorations were finished and polished. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline and at
      1, 3 and 5 years intervals after placement by two independent examiners using modified USPHS
      criteria. The changes in the USPHS parameters during the 5 years period were analyzed with
      Fredman test. The baseline scores were compared with those at the recall visits using
      Wilcoxon signed rank test, where the level of significance was set at pË‚0.05.
