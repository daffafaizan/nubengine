        -  A modified Mediterranean diet after liver transplantation results in weight loss,
           improvement of insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, blood pressure, BMI, and waist
           circumference in patients who adhere to the program.

        -  A modified Mediterranean diet after liver transplantation results in relative
           improvement in cardiovascular outcomes in patients who adhere to the program when
           compared to standard of care.

        -  A modified Mediterranean diet after liver transplantation results in relative
           improvement in 10-year ASCVD risk in patients who adhere to the program when compared to
           standard of care.

        -  A modified Mediterranean diet after liver transplantation decreases the risk of
           development of NAFLD/NASH/NASH fibrosis in patients who adhere to the program.

      Study Design:

        -  Single-center, prospective, randomized interventional trial

        -  All eligible post-liver transplant patients during the enrollment period will be invited
           to participate in the trial.

        -  All enrolled patients will be randomized to the Dietary Intervention (DI) arm or the
           Standard of Care (SOC) arm.

        -  All patients will be followed for 12 months.
