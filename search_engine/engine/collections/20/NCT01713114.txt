      food or meal. A number of dietary factors have been shown to influence satiety, including
      food volume, food weight, energy density, food palatability, and certain food ingredients.
      The nutritional composition of a meal appears to also play a significant role in an
      individual's feelings of satiety and ability to stay full until the next meal.
