      inability of smooth muscle to move food down the esophagus.

      Standard care for participants includes Heller Myotomy, a laparoscopic procedure that
      includes cutting the muscle layers in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) the valve at the
      bottom of your esophagus. A second procedure is then required to prevent reflux (acid
      entering the esophagus from the stomach) called fundoplication. Patients with the Heller
      myotomy will typically stay overnight in hospital. A new procedure, called the POEM procedure
      (per oral endoscopic myotomy) has been developed for achalasia. This procedure uses endoscopy
      and no incisions to cut one muscle layer. A fundoplication is not required with this method.
      This study treatment works by entering the surgical area through the mouth and then making an
      incision (cut) through the esophagus and placing flexible instruments along the outside of
      the esophagus and down to the LES through a tunnel. The instruments used in this procedure
      are standard endoscopic instruments that will be provided by one of the leading endoscopic
      instrument manufacturers, Olympus. The investigators have recently completed a small study
      showing this procedure is safe and feasible. One observation from this pilot study was that
      most patients had no pain and didn't need any pain medications. Due to this reason, the
      investigators think patient's may go home on the same day as their procedure.
