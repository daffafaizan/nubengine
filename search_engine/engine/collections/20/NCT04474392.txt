    
      The Specific Aims of This Study Are As Follows:

        1. Identify whether sputum anti-CCP predicts incident RA

        2. Determine the effect of inflammatory cytokines on the induction of NETosis in sputum
           neutrophils

        3. Determine the role of sputum macrophage phagocytosis in NET clearance <br> The knowledge
           gained from this study will improve the overall understanding of the development of RA.
           It is anticipated that these findings will improve the field's understanding of how best
           to screen for RA risk and target RA prevention. This study could support future
           lung-targeted prevention strategies for RA that could avoid the administration of
           systemic toxic therapies. Such potential prevention interventions could be implemented
           in subjects at risk for RA in order to prevent the irreversible joint damage that can
           occur in the later stages of clinically-apparent RA.
