      and kinetics as well as reduce pain and ameliorate functional outcome in patients with hip
      abductor deficiency of the gluteus medius following total hip arthroplasty (THA). The
      investigators used a gait analysis system based on reflective markers and force plates to
      objectively evaluate gait performance pre- and postoperatively.

      Methods Gait analysis was performed in 15 patients who underwent GMT and were examined with
      an optical tracking system before and at a minimum of 13 months after the operation. Mean age
      was 69 years (SD=11), all were females. Median follow-up time was 24 (13-60) months. The
      primary outcome was hip abduction moment (Nm/kg) during gait. The control group consisted of
      66 subjects without any gait pathology.
