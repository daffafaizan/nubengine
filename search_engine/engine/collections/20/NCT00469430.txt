      their lifetime. Surgery, open or laparoscopic, is the traditional treatment. A number of
      these patients don´t have appendicitis when operated on and the operation is therefore
      unnecessarily performed. It is also a risk for complications after surgery; for instance
      wound infection, postoperative small bowel obstruction.

      In our study we will compare antibiotic as the only treatment with traditional surgical
      treatment. Patients with "suspected appendicitis" are randomized to either surgery or
      antibiotics according to their birth date.

      Patients in "the surgery group" are treated according to standard routines. Patients in "the
      antibiotic group" are treated with intravenous antibiotics for at least 24h - this regime can
      be prolonged if clinical recovery doesn´t occur - and submitted from hospital with oral
      antibiotics. If patients in the antibiotic group deteriorate during the hospital stay
      (suspicious perforation) they will be operated.

      Parameters that will be analyzed are:

        -  primary healing in the antibiotic group

        -  frequency of relapse in appendicitis in the antibiotic group

        -  complications in both groups

        -  economical analysis (hospital stay, sick leave time, time off work) in both groups
