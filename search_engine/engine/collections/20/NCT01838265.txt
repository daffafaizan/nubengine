      Stratification will be based on Prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) (=< 0.15 vs > 0.15
      ng/mL per mL), and number of positive cores in the diagnostic biopsy (1 vs 2):

        -  Arm I: Active Surveillance Alone (AS). TRUS guided biopsies at start (within 6 months of
           enrollment) and at yearly intervals thereafter up to 36 months after the initial biopsy
           (maximum four biopsies).

        -  Arm II: MRI-Managed Active Surveillance (MRI-AS). MRIus or MRI-guided biopsies at start
           (within 6 months of enrollment) and at yearly intervals thereafter up to 36 months after
           the initial biopsy (maximum four biopsies).

      Patients will also complete Quality of Life (QoL) assessments to provide unique data on the
      effects of MRI monitoring for patients undergoing active surveillance on QOL. The
      investigators have selected a group of measures that have been used extensively in prostate
      cancer populations.
