    
      A single group intervention study of adults (18-80 years-old) with Parkinson's Disease and
      anxiety symptoms undergoing a 6-week intervention of 30-minute yoga classes delivered
      remotely through videoconferencing 2-3 times per week. Subjects with symptoms of anxiety as
      indicated by their score on the Parkinson's Anxiety Scale will complete yoga classes
      delivered at-home with videoconferencing, receiving one-on-one yoga instruction including
      breathing, postures, and meditation/relaxation for two-three times a week. Data collection
      will occur remotely via videoconferencing at 0-weeks, 6-weeks after a waiting period,
      12-weeks after the intervention, and 6-weeks after the last lab visit. Data collection will
      include demographics, mental health questionnaires, motor assessments, enjoyment, usability,
      and follow-up yoga status. Each yoga session will be video recorded to aide in recording
      adherence, adverse events, and challenges.
