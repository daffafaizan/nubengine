      primary brain tumors associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Despite
      aggressive treatment, the median survival rate for GBM is approximately 12 months, with
      two-year survival rates no more than 8 to 12%, while median survival for patients with AA
      ranges from 2 to 3 years from time of first diagnosis.

      RTA 744 is a close chemical analogue of the well characterized anti-cancer agent doxorubicin.
      Unlike doxorubicin, RTA 744 has shown ability to cross the blood brain barrier and to achieve
      high concentration in CNS tumor tissue in animal models. It will be administered by i.v.
      infusions either daily for 3 consecutive days repeated every three weeks, or once weekly for
      4 consecutive weeks repeated every 5 weeks. Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined , a
      new group of patients will be enrolled into the study to evaluate the tolerability and MTD
      when administered on an expanded schedule (once a week).
