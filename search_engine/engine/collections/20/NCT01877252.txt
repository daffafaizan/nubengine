      lasting more than 2 weeks. CLI is defined as rest pain or tissue loss (Fontaine stages III-IV
      or Rutherford classes 4 to 6) and/or ankle-brachial index < 0.40. Patient with acute
      limb-threatening ischemia, bone fractures in the relevant areas, nonatherosclerotic disease
      (e.g. arteriitis) and documented hypercoagulable diseases will be excluded from this study.
      There will be no experimental or control groups. The comparison groups will be:

      Group 1: Best endovascular treatment (angioplasty +/- stent) Group 2: Best surgical treatment
      [bypass (vein or prosthetic)] Group 3: Femoral artery patchplasty +/- profundoplasty (+/-
      endovascular treatment) Group 4: Best conservative treatment

      The proposed sample size amounts to 1200 patients.

      To be assessed for eligibility (n=1200) To be allocated to trial (n=1000) To be analysed
      (n=900)

      In CRITISCH registry, randomization or blinding is not feasible, because optimized standard
      care will be performed as established at each participating centre (best medical treatment).
      Data storage, validation, monitoring, update, backup and analysis will be performed centrally
      following established procedures. Web-based software will be used to develop a data model
      representing the data structure. The data validation will include standard data validation
      techniques such as the manual review of selected variables and the routine check of missing
      and outlying data points. Regional staff will be instructed and supervised by study nurse,
      who will perform the study monitoring. Assessment of relevant prognostic factors during the
      statistical analysis will prevent biased results due to the non-randomized design and the
      potential structural inequality.
