      training cohort will be developed from approximately 70% of included cases. It will be
      followed by a validation cohort with the remaining cases.

      Clinical data will be collected retrospectively using the Clinical Data Analysis and
      Reporting System (CDARS) and Clinical management System (CMS). A cluster-wide cohort (New
      Territories East Cluster, NTEC) consisting of patients with history of histologically-proven
      gastric IM and AG will be identified and included for subsequent analysis. The data
      collection period for the retrospective data will be 2000-2020.

      Histology slides will be retrieved retrospectively when available (within NTEC). Whole slide
      imaging technique will be utilized for the development of training and validation cohorts
      with machine learning algorithms in the pathology part.
