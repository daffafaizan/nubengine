    
      About 60 patients with staging Ⅱ-Ⅲ of NPC, after accepting concurrent radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy, will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment) or group B
      (just regularly follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will
      receive 2-3 cycles of DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks). Patients in group B will have
      no anti-tumor therapy.
