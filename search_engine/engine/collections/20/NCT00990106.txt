    
      This is a 15-week randomized parallel design, double-blind, placebo-controlled augmentation
      trial of prazosin to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of prazosin augmentation in the
      treatment of PTSD trauma-related nightmares, sleep disturbance, global function and sense of
      well-being, and other clinical features and comorbidities of PTSD. Participants will be 210
      OIF/OEF soldiers and veterans who have suffered war zone trauma. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to prazosin or placebo and all previous psychotropic medications and/or
      psychotherapy will be maintained constant. Randomization will be stratified by site and use
      of an antidepressant.
