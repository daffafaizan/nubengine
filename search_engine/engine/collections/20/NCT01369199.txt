    
      To determine the efficacy of treatment with 8 weeks of entecavir followed by 40 weeks of both
      entecavir and peginterferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in hepatitis B "e"
      antigen (HBeAg) positive adults who are in the immune tolerant phase.

      To evaluate safety and sustained responses after treatment with entecavir and peginterferon
      alfa-2a in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HBeAg positive adults who are in the
      immune tolerant phase.

      A single arm treatment study of 8 weeks of entecavir followed by 40 weeks of both entecavir
      and peginterferon alfa-2a in adults with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B with normal or
      near normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and high serum levels of hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) DNA ("immune tolerant" HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B). All participants followed
      for 48 weeks after treatment discontinuation (week 96 for those who completed treatment).
