      fortify rice and other foods as it causes no organoleptic changes to the food vehicles.
      However, it is only of low absorption in man and its absorption can be influenced by a
      variety of compounds. The effect of co-fortification of rice with ZnO respectively ZnSO4 on
      iron bioavailability in extruded rice fortified with FePP has never been investigated.
