      carcinoma. However some patients develop intestinal perforations for which the prognosis is
      poor.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk factors of intestinal perforations using a
      retrospective study scheme. Previous studies have shown a possible implication of drugs or
      medical history or intraoperative complications. The investigators aim to describe the other
      possible risk factors (such as portal vein clampage) and the type of surgery done after the
      diagnosis and its impact on survival as well.
