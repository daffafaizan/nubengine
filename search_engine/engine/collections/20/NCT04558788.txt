      patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Acute GVHD
      results from a complex multi-step crosstalk between extensive epithelial tissue damage in the
      patient and activation of the allo-reactive immune system transferred with the donor graft.
      The conditioning treatment prior to allo-HCT creates an inflamed microenvironment with high
      concentrations of pathogen-associated and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and
      DAMPs) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammation is perpetuated by activation
      of myeloid immune cells and recruitment of allo-reactive T cells to the intestine.
      Enterocytes are subjected to cellular stress and undergo apoptosis. As a result, patients can
      develop high-voluminous diarrhea, dehydration, intestinal bleeding, hypalbuminemia, and
      generalized infections.

      In this study, the investigators aim to analyze the expression of molecules related to
      different types of cellular stress in the intestine of patients with acute GVHD. The
      hypothesis is that some stress-related markers would be upregulated during GVHD. The results
      will be valuable to study the role of cellular stress reactions during acute GVHD
      pathogenesis or as potential biomarkers for disease activity.
