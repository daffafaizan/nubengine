      The study will involve 100 male patients undergoing aseptic surgery (regardless the
      procedure). Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group 1: control group, n=50 Group 2: Chlorhexidine group (Ch group), n=50

      Pre-operatively, urethral instillation with Chlorhexidine gel will be performed for the Ch
      group, while for the control group, instillation will not be performed.

      Chlorhexidine gel will be prepared according to an international product; Instillagel®, used
      prior to urethral catheterization as analgesic / anti-septic, with the following composition:

      6ml of Instillagel® gel contain: 117.6mg lidocaine hydrochloride, 3.1mg chlorhexidine
      digluconate, 3.8mg methyl hydroxybenzoate (E218), 1.6mg propyl hydroxybenzoate (E216) 11ml of
      Instillagel® gel contain: 215.7mg lidocaine hydrochloride, 5.8mg chlorhexidine digluconate,
      6.9mg methyl hydroxybenzoate (E218), 2.9mg propyl hydroxybenzoate (E216)

      The other ingredients are:

      Hyetellose, propylene glycol* (E 1520), sodium hydroxide and purified water.
      Intra-operatively, the Ch group will receive Chlorhexidine instillation again before surgery,
      while the control group will not.

      For both groups, skin sterilization will be performed according to the ISSM "International
      Society of Sexual Medicine" guidelines for skin preparation before penile prosthesis surgery
      (Darren J. Katz et.al 2012)

      After conclusion of surgery and with the patient on the operative table, the following swabs
      will be obtained:

        -  A penile skin swab.

        -  A urethral swab.
