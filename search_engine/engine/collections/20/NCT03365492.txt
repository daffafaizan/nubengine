    
      The purpose of this pharmacokinetic (PK) study is to characterize the maximum concentration
      (Cmax) and time-to-maximum concentration (Tmax) of Biolimus A9TM and its active metabolites
      sirolimus and everolimus in a cohort of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients following
      implantation of BioFreedomTM SS stent.

      The study will include up to 20 CAD patients following implantation of the commercially
      available BioFreedomTM SS stent in a single Spanish center. Venous blood samples will be
      taken up to 72 hours after implantation. Whole blood concentrations of Biolimus A9TM and its
      active metabolites sirolimus and everolimus will be determined using a validated liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. Mean, median and range of PK
      variables (Cmax, Tmax, and AUC) together with a Summary Statistics table will be generated as
      part of the PK analysis.
