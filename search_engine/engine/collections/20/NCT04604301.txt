      material for full contour CAD/CAM crowns is reported to offer a more translucent and esthetic
      high strength crown in a more efficient oven firing process. Celtra Quatro (Dentsply Sirona)
      is submitted to a high temperature matrix firing cycle in the SpeedFire oven (Dentsply
      Sirona) to achieve high strength in less than 5 minutes following milling. It has a reported
      flexural strength of 650 MPa compared to 450 MPa for lithium disilicate glass ceramic and >
      900 MPa for 3mol% full contour zirconia.

      Most glass ceramic materials have a recommended material thickness of 1.5 mm to maximize the
      strength potential of the material. Occlusal reduction resulting in a crown thickness of 1.0
      mm, equitable to the recommendation for full contour zirconia crowns, may be considered
      sufficient to maintain the desired high strength attained by the ZLS material. This would
      also result in a more conservative tooth preparation.

      Another potential advantage of high strength ZLS crowns to many clinicians is that they may
      be inherently strong enough to allow for conventional cementation. However, for less
      retentive preparations, it may also be possible to adhesively bond the crowns through the use
      of adhesive resin cements.

      It is the intent of this investigation to evaluate the clinical application and performance
      of the new high strength, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate material (Celtra Quatro) for
      CAD/CAM-generated chair-side crown applications. Patients will be recruited to have 60 Celtra
      Quatro crowns prepared and delivered during a single dental appointment using a chairside
      CAD/CAM system (CEREC/Dentsply Sirona). The crowns will be recalled at 6 months and then
      yearly for 5 years to evaluate long-term outcomes of the crowns.
