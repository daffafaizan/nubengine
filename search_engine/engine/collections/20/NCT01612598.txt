      I. Describe the feasibility of implementing a PCI for patients on phase I clinical trials
      (study accrual and retention).

      II. Describe the initial impact of a PCI on key patient outcome measures (quality of life
      [QOL], psychological distress, satisfaction with communication, symptom intensity, symptom
      distress, and patient satisfaction) over time.

      OUTLINE:

      PCI PART I: Patients undergo comprehensive palliative care (PC) assessment based on baseline
      data and complete goals of care discussion.

      PCI PART II: Following the first dose of phase I investigational treatment, patients meet
      with the interdisciplinary team (IDT), where PC recommendations are made. This is followed by
      two patient educational sessions that will cover QOL-related domains, including physical,
      social, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Supportive care referrals are made based on IDT
      recommendations.
