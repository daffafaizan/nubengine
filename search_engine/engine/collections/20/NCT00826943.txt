      to placebo than was cetirizine in separate trials. We plan to examine whether patients who
      did not tolerate cetirizine due to sedation are able to tolerate levocetirizine. This study
      will utilize a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial comparing levocetirizine,
      cetirizine, and placebo in regards to sedation and allergy symptom scores. Each patient will
      receive levocetirizine, cetirizine, and placebo in randomized order and thus serve as their
      own control.
