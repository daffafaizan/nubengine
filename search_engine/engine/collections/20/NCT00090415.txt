      understanding the social, linguistic, psychological, and physiological differences that
      distinguish between autistic children, developmentally delayed children, and children with
      typical development, researchers may be able to recognize autism early in life so that
      children with autism can be helped as early as possible and their long-term outcome can be
      improved.

      Children in this study will be enrolled for 2 years. They will receive annual evaluations
      throughout the two-year period. They will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and
      will complete various activities to determine brain functioning. In addition, children with
      autism will take part in intensive behavioral therapy at least 4 hours every day for the
      duration of the study. Communication and social behavior scales, an early development
      interview, observations of parent/child interaction, and neuropsychological, cognitive, and
      adaptive behavioral measures will be used to assess participants.
