      Classification were included in the study. Performance was assessed by measuring the distance
      in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the duration of timed performance tests; energy consumption
      by Physiological Consumption Index (PCI), and gait characteristics by footprint method on
      powdered ground at baseline. Kinesiology taping with facilitation technique was applied on
      bilateral quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles and the assessments were repeated 1 hour
      after application. The comparison between before and after taping was analyzed.
