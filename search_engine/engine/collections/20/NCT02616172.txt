      bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss.

      Subjects will come to Orlando for pretesting to include an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
      Auditory brainstem response (ABR), blood work: Complete metabolic panel (CMP), Complete blood
      count (CBC), Hepatic Function Panel, Prothrombin (PT), Partial thromboplastin time (PTT),
      International normalized ration (INR), Chest Xray, and a Speech and Language Evaluation.

      After pretesting, the subjects will undergo a bone marrow harvest and then receive their
      autologous bone marrow mononuclear fraction (BMMF) intravenously. The subjects will then be
      monitored for 24 hours post infusion. After 24 hours, the subject will undergo repeat blood
      work and a chest x ray. Subjects will then be discharged home. Subjects will follow up in
      Orlando at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year post infusion. Follow up testing will repeat the
      exams performed at pretesting.
