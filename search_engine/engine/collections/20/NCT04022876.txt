      practice on Days 1-5 of 21-day cycles. Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 initial
      ALRN-6924 dose levels, to be administered prior to each planned topotecan dose. The
      incidence, severity and duration of hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia,
      thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia, will be determined.

      The safety and tolerability of each ALRN-6924 dose level will be assessed during Phase 1b.

      If pre-determined criteria for safety and myelopreservation activity are met and the RP2D is
      identified, the Phase 2 portion of the study will be triggered. In Phase 2, patients with ED
      SCLC requiring 2nd line treatment with topotecan will be randomized 1:1 to either receive
      topotecan alone or topotecan with supportive ALRN-6924 treatment.
