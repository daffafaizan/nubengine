      integrated evidence-based family intervention, Multidimensional Family Therapy[MDFT](Liddle,
      2002).

      The study sample includes youth referred to the CCP throughout Miami-Dade county and who
      according to CCP screening are rated as high risk for re-offending. Youth are 12-17 years old
      with a first or second misdemeanor charge (excluding any gang, violence, or sex crimes
      charge). Nearly all (97%) of these youth are ethnic minorities (Hispanic and African
      American). They are at risk for school failure, substance use, and chronic delinquency due to
      drug availability in their communities, poor family functioning, peer drug use/delinquency,
      and school failure / disengagement.

      120 youth who enter the Civil Citation Program and are eligible for the study will be
      assigned to one of the two interventions: CCP+SAU or the experimental intervention, CCP+MDFT.

      The study asks a classical services research question(Compton et al, 2005) - does the
      addition of a family therapy intervention, multidimensional family therapy, into an existing
      diversion program significantly enhance the program outcomes in key outcome domains:
      recidivism, substance use, delinquency, school and family functioning.
