    
      Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune
      response of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this
      regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to the SARS
      coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) protein. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine. Secondary and exploratory objectives
      are related to the immunogenicity of the study vaccine.

      Product Description: VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP is composed of a single closed, circular DNA plasmid
      that is based on the S protein of SARS-CoV. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each
      DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle)
      using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System.

      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 50 years old) will be enrolled.

      Study Plan: Ten volunteers will be enrolled and receive 3 injections on the schedule shown in
      the schema. The protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up contacts.

      Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.

      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary immunogenicity
      endpoints are an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for SARS specific T cell
      responses and an assay for antibody-dependent enhancement of virus uptake. The principal
      timepoints for ICS are Week 0 (baseline) and Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12. ICS at other study
      timepoints, as well as other immunogenicity assays through Week 32, will be completed as
      exploratory evaluations.
