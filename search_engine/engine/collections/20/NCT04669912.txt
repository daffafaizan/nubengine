    
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data will be collected from the cloud-based platform,
      LibreView.

      Data will be collected for patients from Sud-Francilien hospital (Corbeil-Essonnes, France)
      and Kremlin-Bicêtre hospital (Kremlin-Bicêtre, France). Data related to glucose control and
      sensor usage will be collected from the Libreview platform. Data related to patients'
      characteristics, treatment and telemedicine visits (number of contacts with health
      professionals) will be collected from the medical record and confirmed with
      telephone-administered questionnaire.

      The lockdown imposed by the French government occurred from March 17 to May 10, 2020.
      Therefore, outcomes will be assessed 4 times: the month before lockdown, during the first
      month, the second month of lockdown, and one month after lockdown ended.

      Potential confounding factors will be studied: age, gender, type of insulin delivery
      (multiple daily injections, MDI; insulin pump), contacts with health professionals (physician
      or nurse).

      Descriptive statistics will include means with standard deviations, numbers of patients and
      percentages.

      Outcomes will be analysed with a linear mixed-effects regression model. Analyses will be
      performed with R studio version 3.5.0.
