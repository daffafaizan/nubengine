      aims to determine the efficacy of prophylactic IgM-Enriched IVIG in preventing EONS. A total
      of 70 very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates with risk factors for EONS including maternal
      factors of premature rupture of membrane (PROM), fever, urinary tract infection (UTI),
      chorioamnionitis, and neonatal factor of prematurity and resuscitation history will be
      collected. These neonates within 1 hour of life will then be administered either placebo or
      IgM-enriched IVIG 0.25g/kg/day for 3 days, in addition to first-line empiric antibiotic.
      Randomization is done using simple randomization. Triple masking (Participant, Investigator,
      Outcomes Assessor) is conducted.

      These neonates will then be clinically observed and evaluated for early mortality (mortality
      below 7 days), hemodynamics, length of stay, blood culture results, C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
      IT ratio, routine hematological examination, and IgGAME as parameters of improvement and
      prevention of EONS.

      STATA version 12 (Macintosh version) will be used for data management and statistical
      analyses. The variables will first be presented descriptively, continued with bivariate and
      multivariate analysis. Bivariate analysis will be conducted between independent and dependent
      variables using chi-square/Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis.
      Variables with p-values <0.25 will be included in the multivariate analysis using logistic
      regression. The investigators will use two-sided p-values in our analysis with a p < 0.05
      level of significance.
