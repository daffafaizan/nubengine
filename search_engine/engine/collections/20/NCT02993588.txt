      quality. Melatonin is suggested to have antioxidative effects which may contribute to
      improving the IVF/ICSI outcomes in this group of patients who expected to have poor outcomes.
      However, the expected beneficial effects of melatonin have not yet been investigated. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of melatonin administration on IVF/ICSI
      outcomes namely the total number and quality of the oocytes and embryos in the prospective
      poor responders. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is used to
      investigate the impact of melatonin on the IVF/ICSI outcomes.
