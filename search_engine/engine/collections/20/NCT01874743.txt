    
      Methodology Phase II pilot study; open-label; non comparative, bicentric, on-off design

      Estimated enrolment 40 subjects

      Outcomes Primary outcome :

      • Variation at month 3 in the proportion of CD8 T lymphocytes co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  Evolution of plasma/serum levels of CRP-HS, IL-6, soluble CD14 between baseline and
           month 3 and between month 3 and month 6

        -  Evolution of markers of CD4 T-cell activation (HLA-DR, Ki67) and CD8 T-cell activation
           (CD38, HLA-DR, Ki67) between baseline and month 3 and between month 3 and month 6 and
           evolution of the CD4/CD8 ratio between baseline and month 3 and between month 3 and
           month 6

        -  Evolution of CD4 T-cell count between baseline and month 3

        -  Evolution of HDL and LDL cholesterol between baseline and month 3 and between month 3
           and month 6

        -  Relationship between HDL cholesterol and CD4/CD8 ratio at baseline, month 3 and month 6

        -  Relationship between the levels of T-cell activation and of plasma HIV-RNA levels at a
           detection level of 3 copies/mL

        -  Adverse events grade > 2 Eligibility Inclusion criteria

        -  HIV-infected patients receiving a combination of antiretroviral therapy for at least 24
           months, unchanged since at least 18 months, exhibiting plasma HIV-RNA level below 20
           copies and circulating CD4 T cell count below 500/mm3

        -  No indication for a treatment with statins (LDL cholesterol < 4.1 mmol/L under stable
           diet).

      Non-inclusion criteria

        -  Patients receiving Maraviroc

        -  Patients receiving immune suppressing drugs

        -  Ongoing opportunistic, bacterial or viral infection

        -  CRP ≥ 10 mg/mL

        -  Co-infection with HCV (except if HCV cure), chronic HBV infection with active
           replication of HBV

        -  Indication for a treatment with statins

        -  Pregnancy

        -  CPK > 3x Normal values

        -  ALT or AST > 2x Normal values

        -  TG > 4 mmol/L

        -  DFG < 60 mL /min/1.73 m2

        -  Personal or familial history of genetic muscular disease

        -  History of muscular or hepatic toxicity with a statin or a fibrate

        -  Liver disease (TP < 70%).

        -  Hypothyroidism

        -  Concomitant treatment with : Kétoconazole, Itraconazole, Ciclosporine, Erythromycine,
           Cimétidine, Quinidine, Diltiazem, Vérapamil, systemic corticosteroids, Phénobarbital,
           Phénytoïne, Carbamazépine, Rifampicine, Lansoprazole

        -  Vaccination during the study

      Intervention Rosuvastatin (20 mg/d per os) Intervention duration: 3 months Follow-up for 3
      additional months

      Statistical methods Bilateral Two-sided paired Wilcoxon to analyze the variation in the
      proportion of CD8 T lymphocytes that co-express CD38 and HLA-DR at month 3 (primary outcome).

      The evolution of parameters of interest between 2 visits will also be analyzed using
      bilateral two-sided paired Wilcoxon test. Statistical significance will be considered for p<
      0.05.

      Substudies

      Estimated planning or Study / Trial timetable Trial/study start date: April 2012 Enrolment
      period: 12 months Subject participation duration: 6 months Total trial/study duration: 18
      months Estimated study/trial completion date: October 2013 [default date: date of last
      follow-up of last included patient, else justify the chosen date: date of "gel de la base de
      données", date of end of substudies analyses (think to delay for sampling transport, duration
      of technical analyses)]

      Study / Trial design Phase II open-label pilot bicentric non comparative study. Patients
      eligible will receive Rosuvastatin for 3 months while continuing antiretroviral therapy.
      Patients will be followed-up 3 additional months after stopping the study drug (on-off
      design)
