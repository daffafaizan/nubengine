      enters the ICU, the investigators induce moderate sedation (RASS -2~-3). End-tidal
      sevoflurane (etSEVO) concentration is adjusted to 0.5Vol% within 30 minutes. Sedation level
      is evaluated every 5 minutes. After 30 minutes, the investigators check that the sedation
      goal is achieved.

      Following the up & down method, if the moderate sedation (RASS -2~-3) or the deep sedation
      (RASS -4~-5) is achieved at the etSEVO concentration of 0.5vol% after 30 minutes of sedation,
      the next patient's target etSEVO concentration is reduced to 0.4vol%. On the contrary to
      this, if only light sedation (RASS above -1) is achieved, the next patient's target etSEVO is
      increased to 0.6vol%. This process is repeated to find the appropriate etSEVO concentration
      at the beginning of sedation, which induces sedation of RASS -2~-3.

      In retrospective analysis, the investigators compared the prospective study group with
      propofol intravenous sedation group.
