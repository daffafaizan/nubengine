      graft-versus-host disease with contraindications to high-dose immunosuppressive therapy
      treated with beclomethasone. II. Determine the frequency of adverse events related to the use
      of this drug in these patients. III. Assess the natural history and outcome of the medical
      problem for which high-dose immunosuppressive therapy was a contraindication.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beclomethasone 4 times daily for 28 days. Treatment may repeat
      for an additional 28 days as needed. Patients are interviewed weekly to assess treatment
      success and adverse events. Patients are followed at 1 and 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
