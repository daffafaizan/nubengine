      fractures, only two randomised controlled published in the 80s attempted to determine the
      effects of different methods for conservative treatment for middle third clavicle fractures.
      Thus, a pragmatic trial design has been chosen as it can directly inform clinical practice;
      our inclusion criteria will reflect the variety in patient presentations that would be
      encountered by general orthopaedic surgeons in the clinical setting. The current trial
      includes design characteristics known to minimise bias. Participants will be assigned using a
      concealed random procedure, assessments and data analysis will be blinded and we will use the
      intention-to-treat analysis.
