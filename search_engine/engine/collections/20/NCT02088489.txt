      conventional irrigated catheter, with the same safety. We could hypothesize porous tip
      irrigated catheters are more effective than conventional irrigated catheter, reducing
      procedure time and RF ablation time.We realize a randomized comparison study.

      For that, 70 patients with an indication for isthmus-dependent atrial flutter ablation will
      be randomized to conventional irrigated catheter ablation or porous tip irrigated catheter
      ablation. A ECG-Holter examination will be done at 1 month follow up after catheter ablation,
      6 and 12 months.
