      device devised by local engineers for subacute hemiplegic stroke patients for gait
      rehabilitation. This device incorporates patient automated variable speeds and feedback,
      increased safety features with patient support harness and visual feedback providing
      ambulatory gait monitoring data. Methodology: 10 stable subacute hemiparetic stroke subjects
      will undergo supervised treadmill training using this device targeted at improving gait speed
      and walking independence. Outcomes will be measured at 4 time points pre and post training
      using clinical scales and temporal-spatial gait measurements. Importance of research to
      medicine: This study tests the possibility of patient initiated control and closed loop
      sensing feedback system to provide increased intensity, reduced risk of gait destabilisation
      and fall risk which are associated with current fixed treadmill training. Potential benefits
      with new device: Ability to train at self selected variable speeds including fast speeds,
      improved hemiplegic leg swing initiation and stride length, less assistance required from
      physiotherapist and reduced fall risk due to overhead safety harness and treadmill sensing
      and increased patient confidence. Possibility of ambulatory gait speed and force loading
      during treadmill training. Potential risks: Minor risks of fall are minimised as there is a
      safety harness and supervision by physiotherapist. Anticipated risks related to repetitive
      treadmill training with regards to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal side effects will be
      mitigated with strict patient inclusion and exclusion criteria.
