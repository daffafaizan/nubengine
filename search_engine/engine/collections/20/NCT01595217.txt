      combined with MRCP of 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of suspected
      malignant bile duct diseases. People with suspected Biliary Tract Neoplasm based on clinical
      symptoms (such as jaundice and thinness with unknown reasons) and CA-199 value raises are
      included.Diagnosis divided into two steps: the first oneï¼Œonly provide conventional MR
      sequences and MRCP images to make a diagnosis; the second step,provide the DWI images
      additionally, combining the image data before to make a diagnosis. Hypothesis is that DWI
      sequence should be regularly added into MRCP examination for improving diagnosis rate of
      Biliary Tract Neoplasm.
