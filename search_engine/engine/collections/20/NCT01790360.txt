      61% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden,
      with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less
      frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more
      likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in
      substance-using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed
      engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and
      high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as
      the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing
      HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy
      priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US.
