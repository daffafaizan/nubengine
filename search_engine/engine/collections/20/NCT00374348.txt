      studies suggest that obsessive-compulsive symptoms may be present in 7.8-46% of schizophrenic
      patients and who seem to be poorly responsive to drug therapy. The serotonergic medications
      in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy stil remain the preferred treatment for OCD
      symptoms. There are controversial data regarding effect of neuroleptics on symptoms of OCD.
      It was noted that the use of Risperdone, Quatiapine and Clozapine might aggravate OCD
      symptoms. Serotonin antagonism of these neuroleptics is believed to exacerbate
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia. On the other hand, Pourovsky M. at(2000)
      reported three cases of Schizophrenia with symptoms of OCD successfully treated with
      Olanzapine.One of our patients with Schizophrenia and co-morbid symptoms of OCD who was
      unsuccessfully treated with various neuroleptics in combination with anti-obsessive
      agents,demonstrated significant improvement in both Schizophrenic and obsessive compulsive
      symptoms after she was switched to Aripiprazole. This result encouraged us to initiate pilot
      study of effectiveness of Aripiprazole in the treatment of specific population of
      schizophrenic patients with symptoms of OCD.
