      block performed with ultrasound assistance and paravertebral block performed with traditional
      technique in terms of twenty - four hour hydromorphone (dilaudid) consumption and visual
      analogue pain scores at rest or with deep breathing at twenty - four hours. This study will
      determine if ultrasound technique used for placement of paravertebral catheter facilitates
      safety of paravertebral catheterization and improves therapeutic effect of paravertebral
      blockade for pain control after thoracotomy. The investigators will also examine if
      ultrasound assisted paravertebral blockade improves pulmonary status in post-thoracotomy
      patient.
