      Patients assigned to PECS group will receive 30cc of ropivacaine 0,375% where 10cc will be
      injected between pectoralis major and pectoralis minor and 20cc between pectoralis minor and
      serratus anterior muscle under ultrasound guidance. Patients assigned to surgical
      infiltration group will receive 30cc of ropivacaine 0,375% injected by the surgeon. Local
      aneshetic is administered in both groups after the induction of general anesthesia and before
      incision. Pain will be assessed at 1, 12, 24h after surgery and at three months after surgery
      communicating by telephone. Post operative analgesia includes paracetamol 1gr, parecoxib 40
      mg (as required) and tramadol as rescue analgesia (1 mg/kg iv up to 3 times daily). Chronic
