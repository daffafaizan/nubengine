      (ICU){1}.

      The day of extubation is a critical time during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay because in
      case of postextubation failure {2},which reach to 25 - 40% from extubated patient associated
      with VAP and barotrauma, mortality rate and hospital stay will increase , we use Adjuvant
      oxygen therapy to prevent these undesirable event like COT ,NIV and High-flow nasal cannula
      (HFNC) which can be used as an initial weaning strategy from IMVdue to its physiologic
      benefits [3-4].

      HFNC devices supply between 30 and 60 L/min of a controlled mixture of actively warmed (32-37
      Â°C) and humidified (up to 100% relative humidity) oxygen and air through modified nasal
      prongs. producing {5-6-7}:

        1. moderate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) .

        2. HFNC might help prevent extubation failure through different

      Mechanisms:

        1. First, the controlled oxygen concentration may reduce transient hypoxemic episodes .

        2. Second, the high flow washes the nasopharyngeal dead space, thus reducing CO2
           re-breathing; this effect reduces respiratory rate and minute ventilation .

        3. Third, the small amount of PEEP may reduce lung collapse . c)enabling better gas
           exchange and reduced work of breathing. d)in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
           disease (COPD), this level of PEEP may counterbalance auto PEEP, further reducing the
           work of breathing.

      e) humidification may improve mucus drainage and reduce mucus retention, alleviating the
      associated atelectasis.
