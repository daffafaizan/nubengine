      the clinical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) environment when subjects receive MRI scans up
      to 2W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) without positioning restrictions (MRI scans may occur
      anywhere on the body). Long-term device effects, such as long-term lead integrity, will not
      be assessed in the China Evera MRI® study.
