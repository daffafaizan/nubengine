      now a global pandemic affecting more than 3 millions of people. Droplets and close contact
      are the most common routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and aerosol transmission may be
      another route. Researchers have detected SARS-CoV-2 in samples of respiratory tract, saliva,
      stool, gastrointestinal tract, urine, tears and conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients.

      Vertical transmission from mother to infant has been suspected, but not confirmed to date.
      Information about localization of SARS-CoV-2 in the genital tract or shedding is poorly
      documented and the results of these studies were discrepant. One of two studies have reported
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen from six infected patients. However, there is no data on the duration
      of the seminal excretion of the virus, its viral load and infectiousness and on its
      localization in semen compartments (cells, seminal plasma, spermatozoa).

      The purpose of this study is to seek the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, to determine its
      localization and infectiousness and to assess the efficiency of spermatozoa processing
      methods to obtain virus free spermatozoa.

      This is a prospective study involving 50 patients, with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and a
      positive RNA detection. Men will give semen, saliva, urine and blood specimens following
      RT-PCR diagnosis and 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after. SARS-CoV-2 RNA will be detected in seminal
      plasma, native semen cells and processed spermatozoa.
