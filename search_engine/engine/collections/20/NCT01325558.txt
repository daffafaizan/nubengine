      have suggested a key role for TF in the development of cancer-associated thrombosis, tumor
      growth, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. ALT-836, a recombinant human-chimeric
      monoclonal antibody, is designed as a direct TF antagonist to block TF displayed by cancers
      and to inhibit cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis and
      tumor metastasis. In numerous pre-clinical studies in laboratory animals, including non-human
      primates, ALT-836 exhibits potent anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory
      activities with a remarkable safety profile. In humans, ALT-836, administered as a single
      bolus and monotherapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute lung
      injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), is safe and exhibits anti-coagulant
      and anti-inflammatory effects. A Phase II study using a multi-dose regimen of ALT-836 is
      being conducted in patients with ALI/ARDS. In the dose-escalation study described in this
      protocol, the investigators will assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of ALT-836 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced malignancies known
      to overexpress TF and in which venous thromboembolism is a major complication.
