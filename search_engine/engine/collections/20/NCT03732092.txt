      disorders of consciousness. Then, the aim of the present study is to know the prognostic
      value of olfactory stimulation and the diagnosis for DOC patients. DOC patients were
      recruited (standard diagnosis procedure is 5 times CRS-R testing within 10 days). The
      different stimuli were as follows: 1) 1-octene-3-ol, odor. 2) pyridine, odor. 3) water. We
      presented these stimuli randomly, and we recorded the patient's CRS-R scale behavioral
      response and response to olfactory stimulation. Analyze the behavioral response of patients
      with disorders of consciousness through olfactory stimulation, compare the response of
      olfactory stimulation in patients with different consciousness, and analyze the impact of
      olfactory stimulation on diagnosis; After the first, third, and sixth months of initial
      enrollment, the recovery of prognosis was tracked by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revision
      (CRS-R).
