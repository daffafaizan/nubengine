        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered sequentially
           with temozolomide during radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
           multiforme.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy (may be intensity-modulated) on days 1-5. Patients also receive
      arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, and oral temozolomide on days 1-7. Treatment
      with radiotherapy, arsenic trioxide, and temozolomide repeats every week for up to 6 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may then receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
