        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide in children
           with advanced or refractory somatostatin receptor-positive tumors.

        -  Determine the short-term and long-term safety and the serious adverse-event profiles of
           this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine any potential antitumor effect of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate level of somatostatin receptor type 2 expression with response in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly after each treatment course, 6 weeks after the last course, and
      then every 6 months thereafter for life.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
