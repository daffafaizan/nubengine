      injection of 2500unit/m2 PEG-ASP at three different sites.The regimen was repeated every 3
      weeks.Stage IE/IIE patients underwent four cycles induction chemotherapy, followed by
      involved-field radiotherapy after got complete remission ,partial regression or stable
      disease.Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was done by linear accelerator at 2.0 grays
      (Gy) per daily fraction with 5-6 weeks. The involved-field radiation (IFRT) dose was 50-56
      Gy.Stage IIIE/IVE patients were given for a maximum of six cycles.Refractory/relapsed
