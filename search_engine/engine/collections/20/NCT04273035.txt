      with an incidence as high as 50%. Especially (mask)induction of anesthesia is considered one
      of the most stressful experiences for a child undergoing surgery. A common practice worldwide
      to diminish the level of anxiety prior to anesthesia is premedication with the benzodiazepine
      midazolam in order to improve cooperation during induction.

      Premedication with midazolam has a primary purpose to reduce preoperative anxiety and has
      inherent to a benzodiazepine its sedative effects. Although these effects are implied,
      negative effects of premedication: respiratory complications, paradoxical negative behavior
      has been reported. Although alternative medications have been studied, studies for
      non-pharmacological anxiety-reduction remain limited.

      Non-pharmacological anxiety-reduction by distraction including Tablet or IPAD-multimedia
      might be a readily available alternative for midazolam premedication. Potentially limiting
      the use of psychoactive agents, limiting the need for preoperative sedation and therefore
      possibly decrease secondary respiratory complications in pediatric surgical day-care.

      Objective:

      The first goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety between anxiolysis by
      multimedia-distraction with an IPAD versus anxiolysis by premedication with midazolam prior
      to the mask-induction of anesthesia. Secondly to evaluate the need for midazolam
      premedication in pediatric day-care surgery patients induced by inhalational anesthesia.
