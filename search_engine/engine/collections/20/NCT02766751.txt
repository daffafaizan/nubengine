      (n=236) with chronic pain and depression will be recruited at primary care HIV Clinics
      through posted advertisements in the waiting rooms of the PCP offices and by physician
      referral. After an initial phone study screen, research staff will meet with interested
      individuals in their PCP offices for informed consent, baseline interview and randomization
      into one of two study groups (Health Education or HIVPass Counseling). Seven intervention
      sessions (HE or HIVPASS) will occur during the first 3 months of study participation. For all
      participants, the first session is a collaborative in-person joint session with the
      participant, his/her PCP and the study BHS. Session 2 is conducted immediately after this
      collaborative session, and is also in-person. Sessions 3-7 are conducted by phone. Follow-up
      assessment interviews will be at months 1, 2, 3 (post-intervention), 4, 6, 9 and 12.
