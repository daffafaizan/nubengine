      qualitative information. Specifically, this study aims to gather the following information
      from Veterans with HIV/AIDS: a) information regarding disease acquisition; b) psychosocial
      stressors; c) social supports; d) protective factors; and e) previous suicidal ideation and
      behaviors. Further, additional exploratory questions will be asked regarding proposed
      modifications to the Suicide Risk Assessment Guide Pocket Card, an existing VA tool, so that
      it can be modified for use by local and national HIV/AIDS providers.
