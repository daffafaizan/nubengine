      Artesunate/Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum
      infections in Nangarhar, Kunar, Thakhar, Faryab malaria control centers in Afghanistan.

      This is an observational study. Patients will receive the recommended treatment for P.
      falciparum malaria in Afghanistan (Nangarhar, Kunar, Thakhar, Faryab malaria control
      centers). The participants will be febrile children above six months of age and non-pregnant
      adults with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Patients will be treated with
      AS+SP according to standard dosing regimens. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be
      monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The study will be
      conducted during the transmission season of falciparum malaria, i.e. October 2009 to January
      2010 and September-December, 2010. Patients will be assessed clinically and via laboratory
      tests, particularly focussing on whether recurrences are recrudescences of the original
      infection or reinfections. All bio-medical findings will be recorded in specific patient case
      record forms and the electronic form of analyzed data as well as a final report will be sent
      to WHO-Afghanistan and National malaria control program offices for further actions. The
      patients will receive reasonable transportation costs for follow-up visits as well as one
      insecticide treated bed-net at the end of enrolment. The results of this study will be used
      to assist the Ministry of Health of Afghanistan in assessing the current national treatment
      guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
