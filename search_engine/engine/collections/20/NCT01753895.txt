      inter-observer variations, both among nursing staff and physicians. These differences are
      further complicated by variables such as cuff selection and application, incorrect cuff
      positioning and rapid cuff deflation rate, inadequate rest period, and lack of repeated
      measurements. The blood pressure measurement obtained by an automated device is not as
      dependent on observer training and competency as the manual mercury device, yet its use
      requires careful patient evaluation for caffeine or nicotine use, cuff position, and proper
      wrist positioning, and instructing the individual not to move or talk if accurate blood
      pressures are to be obtained. If one performs the automated readings and manual blood
      pressure measurements under standardized conditions, the mean values will be quite similar;
      however, this possibility has not yet been fully tested.

      Therefore, there is a need to assess systematically if there is in fact a difference in the
      two blood pressure monitoring approaches under controlled conditions. The goal of this study,
      then, is to examine our current practice of obtaining manual blood pressure measurement using
      a mercury sphygmomanometer compared to an automated wrist-mounted blood pressure device.

      A possible implication of this study is if the blood pressure measurements using the
      automated blood pressure device are comparable to the measurements obtained using the mercury
      sphygmomanometer, than the mercury devices can be replaced by the more environmentally
      acceptable automated devices in our clinical research setting.
