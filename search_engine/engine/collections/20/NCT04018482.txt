      Medicare. One of the main problems with this procedure is the postoperative discomfort due to
      the need to disinfect the eye with Povidone Iodine (PI). This disinfectant lowers the risk of
      endophthalmitis, but is very rough on the corneal epithelium, producing a type of corneal
      abrasion in many patients that is very uncomfortable in the first few days after injection.
      Many patients refuse the PI disinfection even though avoiding it increases the risk of
      endophthalmitis with the procedure. Recently another disinfectant has been FDA approved
      specifically for the eye to treat blepharitis and dry eye. Avenova (Av), a dilute solution of
      hypochlorous acid, is used several times a day for these conditions. Some practices have
      begun using it for PI sensitive patients before an intravitreal injection as it is
      FDA-approved for disinfecting peri-ocular structures. A recent in vitro study was published
      showing that it is superior to PI in kill times for bacteria cultured for endophthalmitis
      cases. Some physicians say it is superior to PI with respect to patient comfort, however, to
      date, there is little literature about its use for intravitreal injection. The objective of
      this study is to assess comfort levels between the two FDA-approved disinfection options and
      to compare disinfection rates between PI and Av. The hypothesis is that Av will be as
      effective or more effective in elimination ocular pathogens as PI and will be significantly
      more comfortable for patients.
