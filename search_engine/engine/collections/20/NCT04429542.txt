    
      This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label study, which consists of dose escalation parts (Part A)
      followed by expansion cohorts (Part B) for both single agent BCA101 and combination BCA101
      plus pembrolizumab.

      The study population in dose escalation (Part A) of single agent BCA101 consists of subjects
      with EGFR-driven advanced solid tumors refractory to standard of care or for whom no standard
      of care is available. Dose escalation (Part A) of combination BCA101 and pembrolizumab
      consists of subjects with either Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (HNSCC) or
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal (SCCAC) whose tumors are refractory to standard of
      care or for whom no standard of care is available.

      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended dose (RD) of single agent BCA101 is
      determined, the study will continue with expansion cohorts (Part B) with select tumor types.
      Planned expansion cohorts for single agent BCA101 include 1) PD-L1 negative, EGFR-amplified
      Squamous Cell Lung Cancer (SqCLC); 2) RAS wild-type, microsatellite stable Colorectal
      Carcinoma (RAS wt, MSS CRC); 3) EGFR-amplified Triple Negative Breast Cancer; and 4) any
      solid tumor with either a KRAS G12D or G13D mutation. Planned expansion cohorts for the
      combination of BCA101 and pembrolizumab include: 1) HNSCC and 2) SCCAC.
