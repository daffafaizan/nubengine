    
      This is a multicentre randomised phase II trial. Patients are initially registered either
      before or during induction chemotherapy, their response to which will be used to determine
      whether they are eligible for randomisation. All patients will be asked to consent to
      archival tissue collection for translational analysis and to provide a translational blood
      sample. The second consent will precede randomisation to one of two groups of maintenance
      therapy (olaparib or placebo) with 1:1 randomisation if they have had an objectively measured
      complete or partial response following standard chemotherapy.

      Randomised patients will receive olaparib or placebo until disease progression. They will be
      monitored by CT scan every two cycles until disease progression, where they will be managed
      according to local practice. Follow up will be for a maximum of 12 months from the point of
      randomisation or until disease progression.

      All randomised patients for whom we have a baseline translational blood sample will be asked
      to provide a follow up blood sample upon randomisation and again at radiological progression.
      Registered patients with progressive disease after the initial induction chemotherapy will be
      asked to provide a follow-up blood sample at the end of induction chemotherapy.
