      cervical surgery. Although many experts have acknowledged that dysphagia is often
      incompletely understood and defined, there is a significant amount of literature to support
      the significance of this clinical entity. This is the first randomized study to examine the
      use of topical steroids for the prevention of dysphagia postoperatively after anterior
      cervical discectomy and fusion.

      Study Design: This study is a single site, double blinded randomized control trial. All
      individuals undergoing 2-4 level ACDF that meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to
      either:

        1. treatment arm or

        2. control arm.

      Both arms will undergo their planned surgeries and will receive the exact same procedure and
      standard of care as if they were not enrolled in a study. The only difference is that the
      treatment arm will receive 40 mg of Methylprednisolone Acetate delivered with one Hemostatic
      Matrix Kit injectable delivery vehicle prior to closure in the prevertebral soft tissues. The
      control group will receive only Hemostatic Matrix Kit prior to closure in the prevertebral
      soft tissues.

      Outcomes: Patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires that assess dysphagia, general
      swallowing difficulty, and how neck pain impacts their quality of life. Additionally
      Radiographic images will be obtained at set time points to evaluate soft tissue inflammation
      and bony fusion.
