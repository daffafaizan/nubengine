      been associated with cognitive decline after hospitalization. Developing perioperative
      management strategies to prevent delirium may also reduce potential cognitive decline in
      older adults after surgery. The choice and dose of anesthetic and sedative drugs are known
      risk factors in the development of delirium. Excessive doses of anesthetic and sedation drugs
      during surgery have been associated with poor outcomes that occur after surgery. Currently
      depth of anesthesia can be measured by an additional monitoring technique called Bispectral
      Index (BIS).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if light sedation with spinal anesthesia reduces
      the incidence of delirium compared to receiving general anesthesia during spinal surgery in
      older adults. Previous studies have shown that using light sedation and spinal anesthesia
      during surgery may reduce the incidence of delirium up to 50%.
