    
      This was an open-label, single-dose, parallel-group, in-patient, nonrandomized study
      conducted in 8 patients with moderate chronic hepatic impairment and in 8 healthy matched
      subjects matched by origin, age, sex, weight, and smoking habits.

      Each hepatic impaired patient and matched healthy subject participated in the study for
      approximately one month, including a 21-day screening period and a 4-day/4-night inpatient
      period. The inpatient period covered the period from Day -1 to Day 4 morning (through 72
      hours after administration). The final study evaluation was performed for all subjects in the
      morning of the day of discharge, Day 4.
