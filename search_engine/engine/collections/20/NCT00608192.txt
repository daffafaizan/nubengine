      site and participants receive on site theory-based HIV and hepatitis education, counseling,
      and case management to promote adherence to HIV and HCV evaluation; in TEC hepatitis
      screening is done on site, but vaccination and medical care will be provided by off site
      referral. Primary aims are to assess the impact of the HCC intervention on adherence to
      hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination and attendance at an initial
      appointment with an HIV and/or HCV care provider. Secondary aims include examining
      intervention effects on HIV and hepatitis knowledge, risky behaviors, alcohol use; follow-up
      with later stages of HIV and hepatitis C care; to identify psychological mediators of
      intervention outcomes; and to estimate the incremental cost of the HCC intervention to
      facilitate fuller economic evaluations of the intervention if proven effective.
