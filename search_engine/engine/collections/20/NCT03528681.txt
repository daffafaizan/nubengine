      randomized to the double-blind phase, they will receive open-label ZS for 24 or 48 hours
      during the initial phase. It is expected that approximately 490 patients will need to be
      enrolled, to have approximately 280 patients entered into the open-label initial phase
      resulting in 250 patients being randomized in the 28-day treatment study phase. Enrolment
      will be stopped when 250 patients have been initiated with the 28-day randomized treatment
      study phase.
