      efficacy and safety of mono-drug therapy with oral anticoagulant compared to combination
      therapy with antiplatelet drug, in ischemic stroke patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation and atherothrombosis. Target sample size is 400. The primary outcome is a
      composite endpoint of ischemic cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke,
      myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, ischemic events requiring urgent revascularization)
      and major bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis(ISTH)
      criteria within 2 years after randomization.
