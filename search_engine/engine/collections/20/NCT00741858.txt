      is made out of bovine pericardium, and the other - from bovine collagen derived from bovine
      achilles tendon. Both materials are routinely used form this intervention (duraplasty), but
      the question of superiority of one over the other remains open. This study follows patients
      with Chiari malformation from the time of surgery to the time of their discharge from the
      hospital and then another 3 months of follow up care.
