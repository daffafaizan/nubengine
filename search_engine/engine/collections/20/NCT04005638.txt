      autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA), and about thirty patients for autoimmune neutropenia and
      erythroblastopenia. The number of new patients per year is about 50. The investigators are
      working since several years on different research topics concerning ITP and AHA.

      In the field of ITP, the investigators are working on abnormalities of megakaryopoiesis
      present in a particular subgroup of patients. The investigators seek to identify the
      molecular mechanisms underlying this platelet-forming disorder. This research is done within
      the INSERM U1034 unit of the University of Bordeaux.

      In AHA, The investigators are working on the role of regulatory CD8+ T lymphocytes and the
      interest of low doses of Interleukin-2 in their treatment. This part is carried out within
      the CNRS unit UMR 5164 ImmunoConcept. The biological collection the investigators wish to
      create will be available for basic research projects and may be available to the
      pharmaceutical industry as part of the development of new molecules.
