      advanced age and ill health. A better understanding of how muscles regulate their size will
      help design treatments to slow wasting in disease and to promote active aging. We plan to
      study a group of older men, ~70yrs, the age at which muscle bulk starts to decrease, to
      observe how the muscles respond to feeding. We will provide a drink that contains the
      digested products of proteins from which muscles are built. Taking blood samples and some
      tiny biopsies of muscle (done under local anaesthesia) will allow us to measure muscle
      turnover and we will be able to measure for how long after a meal muscles actively take in
      nutrients before becoming "full". We will also measure how long the muscle remains "full"
      before it returns to a state where it can again be stimulated to take in nutrients. We will
      also explore if leucine, one of the component parts of protein (especially in meat and dairy
      products) and a food widely used supplement, can promote the early re-stimulation of muscle
      by eating.
