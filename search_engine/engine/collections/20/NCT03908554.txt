      Hospital. Progressive relaxation training, posture and breath exercises and ergonomic
      suggestion as a WHPP was applied to the intervention group (n=15) during the five weeks.
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to determine the pain, fatigue and stress levels of the
      nurses. Brief COPE and the Professional Quality of Life Scale, Version 4 (Pro-QoL) were used
      to evaluate the coping skills and quality of life. The evaluations were performed three times
      on all the participants as; before and after training and the one-year follow-up.

      Inclusion criteria of this study were working actively and at least 40 hours working in a
      week. Participants who have psychiatric illnesses with or without medication, prior training
      or current use of relaxation therapy and participants without consent were excluded.

      Eighty nurses aged between 18 and 65, working in a hospital have been informed about the
      study. Forty-three nurses who met the criteria and signed consent forms were included in this
      study. WHPP was PMR training, posture and breath exercises, and ergonomic suggestions.
