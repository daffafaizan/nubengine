      studied, and there is no doubt that both daily and sporadic dietary consumption of caffeine
      has substantial biological effects on the nervous system. The current opinion is that
      caffeine both can cure and trigger headaches. Caffeine is a component of many combination
      drugs marketed for the relief of headaches, but on the other hand it is strongly incriminated
      as a risk factor for developing chronic headache. Withdrawal may cause symptom constellations
      similar to the migraine syndrome. Further, caffeine consumption may affect sleep and
      alertness, possibly influencing the risk of migraine attacks. .
