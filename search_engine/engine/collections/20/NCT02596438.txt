      associated with testing for hepatitis B viral (HBV) testing among foreign-born Asian and
      African adult residents of Sacramento county, characteristics of those infected with HBV, and
      the efficacy of follow-up and linkage to care for those infected with HBV, and develop a
      research platform for future studies. Thus, what the investigators want to do is 1) test 2000
      foreign-born Sacramento county residents for HBV and (2) counsel at least 90% of those whose
      screening results are positive for HBV. The investigators want to better characterize factors
      associated with HBV testing and factors that may differentiate those determined to be free of
      infection, infected with HBV, and those with resulting primary liver cancer.
