      attention, orientation, memory, anomia, and pragmatics. Behavioral treatment of these
      deficits falls within the domain of speech-language pathology. While no efficacy studies have
      emerged to demonstrate the benefit of speech-language therapy for individuals who suffer
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), data are emerging which support the positive effects of memory and
      communication intervention in this population. Phase I and Phase II investigations are
      beginning to provide evidence that such intervention should focus on the development of
      innovative strategies to help patients compensate for the disabilities resulting from the
      disease rather than on traditional rehabilitation of impairment. The benefits of
      cholinesterase inhibitors for improving cognitive function in persons with AD have been
      demonstrated, and data continue to emerge on specific drugs and specific changes in cognitive
      processes. The purpose of the proposed investigation would be to collect pilot data on the
      effects of behavioral intervention for memory and communication deficits in conjunction with
      cholinesterase inhibitors, as compared with the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors used in
      isolation. Participants will be individuals with AD who are recruited from the Alzheimer's
      Disease Center at The University of Arkasas for Medical Sciences Medical Center. All
      participants will be taking cholinesterase inhibitors, and half of all participants will be
      randomly selected to receive intervention by a speech-language pathologist. Intervention will
      consist of 16 treatment sessions (one hour each) over a two month period and will focus on
      strategies for enhancing memory and functional communication.
