      doses of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab to ensure that the doses are safe and
      tolerable. In stage 2, patients will be enrolled into either cohort A, where they will be
      treated with a 7-day run-in of binimetinib, followed by pembrolizumab, bevacizumab, and
      binimetinib combination treatment in 21 day cycles, or they will be enrolled to cohort B,
      which does not include the 7-day run-in of binimetinib. Treatment in cohort B will include
      combination therapy of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab from first day of
      treatment.
