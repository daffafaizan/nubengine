      (SC) in a first-of-a-kind ED randomized controlled trial. Studying an urban adult (â‰¥ 18 y/o)
      Latino ED population, the objectives are to demonstrate the superiority of AB-CASI compared
      to SC in: 1) reduction of alcohol consumption (Aims 1), 2) reduction of negative health
      behaviors and consequences (Aim 2), and 3) increasing 30-day treatment engagement (Aim 3).
      The investigators will also explore variation of the AB-CASI intervention on alcohol
      consumption, alcohol-related negative health behaviors and consequences, and 30-day treatment
      engagement by Latino subpopulations (Puerto-Rican, Mexican-American, Cuban-American,
      South/Central American) as well as other potential modifiers (age, birthplace, gender,
      preferred language, reason for ED visit, and smoking status). English and Spanish speaking
      Latino adults presenting to the Bridgeport Hospital ED will be screened using the study
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.
