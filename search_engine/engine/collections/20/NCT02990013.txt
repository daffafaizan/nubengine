    
      A total of approximately 30 eligible participants will be identified with clinically-acquired
      information by Dr. Wendy Lee, an oculoplastic surgeon and aesthetic treatment specialist at
      Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, during regular clinic visits.

      Part One: Patients will have their skin swabbed and then cultured for various skin flora
      agents. The petri dish will then be swabbed with Avenova to see what percent of skin flora
      microbe is killed.

      Part Two: Patients will have their skin divided into 4 quadrants. The area will be
      pre-swabbed to monitor microbe growth. Each of 4 quadrants will be cleansed for one minute
      with AvenovaTM , povidone-iodine 5% solution, 4% chlorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol, then
      swabbed to monitor for microbe growth.

      The swabs will be placed in thioglycollate broth to monitor for bacterial growth. If growth
      if observed in the thioglycollate, the samples will be cultured on blood agar plates and the
      bacterial specie(s) identified.
