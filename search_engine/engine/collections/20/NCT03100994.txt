      Blanco in 2007. The nerves to the lower abdominal wall can be anesthetized by injecting local
      anesthetics between the quadratus lumborum muscle and latissimus dorsi muscle, which is
      called quadratus lumborum type II block. 〝 Transmuscular quadratus lumborum block
      demonstrates that injectate spreads over the posterior abdominal wall to the psoas major
      muscle and includes the upper branches of the lumbar plexus.〞described by Adhikary in 2016.
      However there are no published reports comparing the 2 techniques. In our study, compared of
      ultrasound-guided QL2-blocks with transmuscular quadratus lumborum block to investigate
      analgesic consumption, pain level, opioid related side effects and mobilization.
