      adjustments (manipulation) as well as surface condition (hard surface vs rocker board) on
      multisegmental postural control as represented by postural sway. Using a rocker (tilt) board,
      the participant cannot stand still, but has to adjust posture continuously to maintain
      balance. Body sways are considered to be self-induced because the design of the rocker board
      creates a natural instability without any external perturbation. This task provides a
      self-driven sensorimotor condition in addition to amplifying the sway dynamics. Because the
      rocker board has only one degree of freedom of motion, anteroposterior and lateral sways were
      considered separately on the device.

      The investigators had the following hypotheses.

      Hypothesis 1: Lower extremity adjustments will lead to reduced postural sway magnitude
      compared to upper extremity adjustments.

      Hypothesis 2: Lower extremity adjustments will reduce sway variability of the rocker board,
      trunk and head compared to upper extremity adjustments.

      Hypothesis 3: Lower extremity adjustments will facilitate the organization of sway behavior
      as assessed by the chaotic structure of sway.
