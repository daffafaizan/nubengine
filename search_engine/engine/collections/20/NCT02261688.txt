      an active role in a number of detrimental diseases including hypertension and cardiovascular
      complications. Additionally, in the developed world, there has been a steady increase in
      autoimmune diseases. Type 17 helper T cells (Th17) have been shown to play an active role in
      the development of autoimmune diseases.

      Serum glucocorticoid kinase (SGK1) has been shown to influence sodium transport and salt
      homeostasis in many cell types (Wulf, J. Clin. Invest. 2002; Salker, Nature Med 2011). Prior
      in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that an increase in salt concentration in the media
      or dietary salt intake in mice induces SGK1 expression and enhances TH17 cell differentiation
      and worsens experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), animal model for multiple
      sclerosis (Kleinewietfeld, Nature 2013; Wu, Nature 2013).

      The findings in this study can substantially increase the investigators understanding of
      environmental factors that modulate the development of autoimmunity in humans. In animal
      models the worsening effects of a high salt diet on EAE are dramatic. To the investigators
      knowledge, the proposed study will be the first to determine if salt intake has the same
      adverse impact in humans. If documented, one could envision the development of a novel
      treatment approach for human autoimmunity via the regulation of salt intake. Thus, the
      overall goal of this study is to evaluate the association between sodium and TH17 cells in
      human subjects. In addition to measuring TH17 cells by flow cytometry the investigators will
      also measure interleukins such as IL-17a, IL-17f, IL-23 that are important in TH17
      differentiation and production.
