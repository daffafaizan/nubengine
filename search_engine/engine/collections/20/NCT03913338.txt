    
      This is a controlled study of the safety and efficacy of the KXL System and VibeX Xtra
      (Riboflavin Ophthalmic Solution, Avedro, USA) for performing crosslinking in eyes undergoing
      LASIK for high myopia or myopic astigmatism. Each subject will have bilateral LASIK performed
      and one eye will be randomized to undergo LASIK followed by crosslinking.

      Subjects will undergo bilateral LASIK. Following randomisation one eye of each subject will
      be treated with VibeX Xtra (Riboflavin Ophthalmic Solution) following LASIK and will be
      irradiated with the KXL System at 30 mW/cm2 intensity for 90 seconds continuous UV-A light
      treatment for a total radiant exposure of 2.7 J /cm2.

      All eyes will be assessed at 1 day, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment.
