      prevalent during the current pandemic than they were before. Possible reasons for that
      include higher levels of known risk factors such as cognitive, emotional, and physical
      demands at work; new stressors such as risk for moral injury and worry about personal safety;
      and diminished protective mechanisms, which include recovery opportunities and psychological
      detachment. Thus, frontline healthcare workers should be given priority in access to
      psychological support.

      Despite the urgent need for it, a rapid implementation of psychological support for
      healthcare workers has proved to be challenging during previous crises and the current
      pandemic. Guidelines published thus far underline the necessity of close real-time monitoring
      in order to early identify at risk populations and individuals, who should be referred to
      seek professional support. However, appropriate tools for efficient real-time monitoring of
      stress responses and early screening for possibly pathological reactions among healthcare
      workers are currently lacking. Available tools focus either on tracking of stress indicators
      e.g. sleep disturbances, or on teaching strategies to better cope with stress e.g.
      mindfulness.

      In this study, the investigators will test whether a separate use or a combination of these
      different functions may be the most efficient in managing work-related stress symptoms among
      healthcare workers. The study has a factorial design in order to closely investigate the
      functionalities focused on real-time monitoring of emotional responses and the
      functionalities based on evidence-based strategies to improve workers' recovery, as well as
      the possible interactions among them.
