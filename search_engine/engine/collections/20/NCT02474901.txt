      influenza virus that will replicate in the nose and stimulate an immune response in
      recipients that should protect them if they are infected with one of those strains of
      influenza in the future. A couple of studies have shown an increase in duration that the
      viruses remain in the nose in immunocompromised people. Those studies were done using the
      trivalent vaccine, so the investigators would like to evaluate the quadrivalent vaccine, and
      there is still a need for additional data to help understand the duration of shedding. If
      shedding is prolonged in HIV-infected children and young adults, it would be important to
      know for contacts of those individuals who are very immunocompromised. Shedding will be
      measured by looking for influenza RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs taken at baseline, 2-5 days,
      7-10 days and 14-21 days after the intranasal immunization.

      The live-attenuated influenza vaccines have been shown to have increased effectiveness in
      children and they stimulate the immune system in a different way than the inactivated
      influenza vaccines (TIV or QIV). In this study, the investigators will have the opportunity
      to compare the immunogenicity of QLAIV, measured at baseline and 14-21 days post-vaccination,
      in HIV-infected and uninfected children, adolescents and young adults. Although prior studies
      of LAIV in HIV-infected and other immunocompromised children and adults have not shown any
      increase in serious adverse events, safety will be actively monitored for the first 30-45
      days through a study-specific questionnaire administered at each clinic or phone visit and by
      asking the subjects to keep a diary of side effects. Safety will be monitored passively
      throughout the course of the study.
