      flow rate was altered to be 350 ml/min in the first hour of the session then decreased by 50
      ml/min hourly for the 4-hour dialysis session. blood flow rate profiling was continued for 9
      dialysis sessions (21 Days). Patients were asked to grade their washed-out state on a scale
      from 1 (no washed-out state) to 5 (severe washed-out state) before and after blood flow rate
      profiling. Paired t=-test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test were used in appropriate context to
      compare washed out scale before and after together with urea reduction rate and other blood
      chemistry tests.
