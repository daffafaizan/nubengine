      atherosclerosis is a inflammatory disease, and endothelial dysfunction is one of the key
      factors that initiates the inflammatory response. Accumulating studies indicate that
      endothelial homeostasis plays a primordial role in the development of atherosclerosis.

      Coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) is the standard treatment of three-vessel or left main
      coronary artery disease, and its long-term benefits is apparent. Saphenous vein is the most
      common graft in CABG, however, the long-term patency is only about 50% in one year, as a
      result, it is urgent to discover a solution to improve the long term potency of vein grafts.

      Conventional harvesting technique dissects the perivascular tissue and inject saline to check
      leakage, which causes damages to the endothelium of the vein, initiating inflammatory
      response. No-touch technique is a atraumatic, non-distended harvesting technique. According
      to the criteria, we will randomize the patients into two groups, the conventional and
      No-touch group, the vein will be used in sequential anastomosis, by comparing the 3 months
      patency rate assessed by CTA, we aim to compare the clinical outcomes of the two different
      vein harvesting techniques.
