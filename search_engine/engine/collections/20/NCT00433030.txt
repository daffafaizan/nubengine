      health coverage system, it is crucial to document and learn from pilot antiretroviral
      treatment programs, in particular the medical outcomes and logistical, and organizational
      issues faced by hospital teams and patients in order to adapt the ARV delivery and monitoring
      system to various local settings.

      Specific objectives

        1. Analyze data collected in patients participating in the PHPT antiretroviral treatment
           program, in accordance to national and international guidelines, with no experimental
           interventions.

        2. To determine factors associated with treatment outcome including immune status,
           virologic factors and antiretroviral drugs levels

        3. To study the operational aspects of integrating comprehensive HIV care into the existing
           care system with regards to new activities generated at the hospital level (counseling,
           referral systems, biological monitoring), the impact on other health activities,
           mobilization of human and financial resources, affordability and sustainability.

      The population of the study consists of approximately 2,000 consenting HIV-infected patients,
      including one-third of children, receiving HIV care as part of the GF-ATM or OXFAM Access to
      Antiretroviral programs, presenting at any of the PHPT network hospitals.
