      determine if lanreotide is beneficial for patients with paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.

      Given the rarity of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma that precludes the conduct of a randomized
      clinical trial in a timely manner, a novel method for assessing efficacy is being proposed.
      Efficacy will be assessed by estimating the tumor growth rate while a patient is enrolled on
      study and comparing the growth rates on lanreotide to the pre-enrollment growth rates. The
      method of analysis that will be used has been previously described. For this assessment a
      minimum of three tumor measurements will be required.
