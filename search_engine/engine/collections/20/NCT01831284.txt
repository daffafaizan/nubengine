      way to measure this is by looking at the blood and the gut, or gastrointestinal tract at the
      same time. It is thought that activating the immune system by injection drug use may increase
      destruction of immune cells in the gut. To test this theory, the investigators are enrolling
      HIV-negative injection drug users, HIV-negative people who do not use drugs and HIV-negative
      former injection drug users.
