      effects of a novel intervention, the Mealtime PREP, which has a dyadic focus on both the
      young child and the parent participants. The investigators will collect video recorded child
      meals in the home during a baseline period (under normal circumstances), during
      parent-training (while parents are practicing skills learned), and following parent training
      (when therapist support is withdrawn). This in depth examination of child meals will provide
      valuable information to guide the optimization of this intervention approach for future
      trials.
