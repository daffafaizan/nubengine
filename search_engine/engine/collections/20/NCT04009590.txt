      I. To evaluate whether smokers randomized to Quit4Health are more likely to quit smoking and
      remain tobacco-free at 6 months than subjects randomized to the education only control group.

      II. To evaluate whether non-smokers who are randomized to Quit4Health are less likely to
      initiate tobacco usage and remain tobacco-free at 6 months than non-smokers randomized to the
      education only control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether well-established predictors of susceptibility and barriers to
      cessation (e.g. self-efficacy, knowledge about associated risks, normative beliefs,
      attitudes, resistance skills, peer pressure) and recently identified predictors of tobacco
      use (e.g., depression, nicotine dependence, alcohol use, risk-taking propensity) will mediate
      the effect of the intervention on both onset (for non-smokers) and cessation (for smokers) of
      tobacco use.

      II. To evaluate whether, at the end-of-treatment (EOT) assessment, participants (both smokers
      and non-smokers) in Quit4Health will report a significantly better perception of Quit4Health
      (message relevance, tailoring to specific needs based on tobacco use status, motivation to
      quit, etc.) compared with their counterparts in the education only control arm.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants utilize Quit4Health intervention that includes interactive features,
      coping strategies and games related to cigarettes and other tobacco products for 1 month.

      GROUP II: Participants read an educational booklet about cigarettes and other tobacco
      products for 1 month.

      After completion of study, participants are followed at 3 and 6 months.
