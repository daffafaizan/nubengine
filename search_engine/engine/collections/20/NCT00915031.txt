      underwent RARP. During this period, perioperative data, including postoperative functional
      outcomes, were prospectively collected using a customized database; our ethics committee
      approved the data collection. Erectile function was assessed using the sexual health profile
      for men (SHIM) score at 3, 9, 15, and 24 months and then annually after surgery, and the
      duration of pad-free continence recovery was asked by a non-physician third party. In our
      institution, RH was applied during RARP for all patients from February 2008 to March 2015
      (consecutively between the 671st and 1459th cases). Among the recruited patients, 789 men
      (52.6%) underwent HP, leaving the other 711 (47.4%) as controls.

      The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) bilateral nerve-sparing RARP (over
      70%) and (2) a minimum follow-up of 15 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
      men with a history of salvage radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy after RARP
      (n=98) and (2) the presence of a high-risk disease with an initial prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) level over 20 ng/ml or biopsy Gleason score over 8, which may influence the refining
      surgical plane around the neurovascular bundle (NVB), thereby affecting the degrees of
      nerve-sparing strategy at the time of surgery (n=275). Further, (3) the initial 100 cases
      were excluded to avoid potential bias from the learning period. From a cohort of 1,503
      patients, 59 (3.92%) men whose potency outcome within 15 months was not assessed were also
      excluded from the study. Finally, 930 patients were selected for the analysis; half of the
      procedures (n=466, 50.1%) were performed under RH and the remaining other half (n=464, 49.9%)
      as normothermal controls.

      2. 2. Endpoints of the Study The primary endpoints of this study were the SHIM score and the
      rate of potency regain, which was defined as a SHIM score >17 in the RH and control groups 15
      months after surgery. Considering the proven impacts of age and preoperative SHIM scores on
      the recovery of potency, the groups were further divided into the young and potent (YP: age
      <65 years and SHIM score ≥22, n=409, 43.9%) subgroup and susceptible for impotency (SI: age
      ≥65 years or SHIM score <22, n=512, 55.1%) counterpart and investigated the sexual function
      of the YP subgroup. The secondary endpoints were the duration of pad-free continence regain
      and the rate of continence recovery within 3 months after surgery, especially in the YP
      subgroup.

      2.3. Surgical Protocol for RH All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. RH was
      achieved by devising an endorectal cooling balloon system (ECB) as previously reported [2, 4,
      5]. In brief, a 40-cm, 24-F, 3-way latex urethral catheter was placed inside a 5 × 2.5-inch
      elliptic latex balloon that distended at a low pressure and conformed to the rectal wall
      without excessive deformations. The lubricated ECB was inserted just inside the anus and
      anchored by inflating the catheter balloon to 20 ml. The ECB was then distended and cycled
      continuously with cold saline (4°C) by gravity 40 cm above the patient. The ECB volume was
      ~200 ml. A 9-F esophageal probe (Smiths Medical ASD, Rockland, MA) was used to obtain the
      intracorporeal temperature readings directly along the anterior surface of the rectum/NVB.
