      a brief, theoretically-guided, "Prevention Care Advocate" intervention with HIV-positive
      crack users. Study participants will be recruited from the HIV inpatient hospital wards of
      two inner-city hospitals that serve a similar population of HIV-positive patients: Jackson
      Memorial Hospital (JMH) in Miami, Florida and Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta,
      Georgia.

      This 8-session, multi-component, skills-building intervention adapted from strategies used in
      prior studies encourages participants to advocate prevention and receipt of primary care
      services for themselves and their peers. We will employ a randomized experimental design to
      compare the intervention's efficacy with an attention-control group.

      SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief, theoretically-based intervention in
      reducing unprotected sexual intercourse by HIV-positive crack users recruited from the
      inpatient/hospital setting. The impact of the intervention on secondary outcomes including
      the increased use of HIV primary outpatient care and readiness for and entry to drug
      treatment, will also be evaluated.

      Aim 2: To examine whether knowledge, motivation and perceived self-efficacy are impacted by
      the intervention, and if changes in these variables explain change in the behavioral outcomes
      of interest.

      Aim 3: To determine the extent to which behavioral outcomes are maintained over time.
