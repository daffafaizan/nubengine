    
      OBJECTIVE: The present clinical trial was designed to investigate the clinical and
      microbiological effectiveness of systemic ayurvedic immunomodulator Septilin as an adjunct to
      scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis (CP).

      DESIGN: Sixty five subjects presenting at least twelve teeth with probing depth (PD) â‰¥4 mm
      were selected. 33 subjects were randomly assigned to full-mouth SRP + Septilin (group 1) and
      32 subjects were assigned to full-mouth SRP + Placebo (group 2). The clinical outcomes
      evaluated were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), clinical attachment level (CAL), PD
      and % of sites with bleeding on probing (%BOP) at baseline (B\L), 10 days, 1, 3 and 6 months
      interval and percentage of sites positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T.
      forsythia were recorded at B/L, 3 and 6 months using polymerase chain reaction.
