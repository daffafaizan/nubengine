    
      This study will be performed in two parts. The first part, Part A, is a dose titration study
      in healthy smokers with incremental cigarette consumption performed in confinement. The
      second part, Part B, is an observational study on healthy non-smokers in an ambulatory
      setting

      PART A (smokers only)

      A screening visit will be conducted within 4 weeks prior to admission to the investigational
      site. The 8-day confinement period consists of the admission day (Day1), 1 day ad-libitum
      smoking (Day0), 3 days of smoking abstinence (Day1-3), 2-day exposure period smoking 2 and 4
      cigarettes (Day4-5), and the day of discharge (Day6) followed by a 7-day safety follow-up
      period. Urine collection will be performed for each subject from Day0 to Day5 in 4 intervals.

      PART B (non-smokers)

      Screening visit will be conducted within 4 weeks prior to the ambulatory Visit 1 (collection
      of 24-hour urine and spot urine) to the investigational site. The minimum interval between
      the screening and Visit 1 is of 7 days.
