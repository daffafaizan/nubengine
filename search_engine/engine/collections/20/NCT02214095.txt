      chronic periodontitis. Glucosamine sulphate (GS) was proven to have anti-inflammatory actions
      with minimal side effect profile. Objectives; The main objectives of this study were to
      evaluate clinically the efficacy of GS; as a novel adjunctive host modulating agent in
      periodontal therapy and to investigate its effect on gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) level of
      IL-1β. Methods; Forty patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis (CP) were
      included in this study. They were randomly divided into two groups. Group I (G1) patients
      (n=20) received 500 mg GS capsules three times daily for 3 months following full mouth
      scaling and root planing (SRP), while group II (G2) patients (n=20) received a placebo for
      the same period following full mouth SRP. Clinical periodontal parameters and GCF IL-1β
      levels were analyzed at baseline and 3 months following therapy.
