      poorly understood in the clinical setting. Changes at the myocardial tissue level, such as
      scar formation and decreased contractility, have been implicated in the end stage,
      decompensated phase of this disease entity.

      Advances in cardiac MRI (CMR) have enabled non-invasive characterization of the myocardial
      tissue components, such as cardiomyocyte volume and extracellular matrix, and tissue
      contractility. These measures have been well validated in various cardiac pathologies with
      biopsy studies but only at single time points.

      In this study, adults with isolated chronic primary regurgitation will be followed
      conservatively over at least a year to determine the natural progression of these CMR-derived
      markers over time and to investigate the prognostic potential of these markers for clinically
      assessed functional capacity and symptoms. These participants may elect to undergo any
      valvular intervention at the discretion of their treating clinical team.

      Alongside this arm, similar adults with isolated chronic primary regurgitation will be
      recruited, who have elected upfront to undergo surgical repair. These patients will be
      similarly studied to determine reverse remodeling of these CMR-derived markers over time and
      to investigate the prognostic potential of these markers for the same clinical outcomes.
