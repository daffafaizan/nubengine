      programmable CSF shunt valve to active (open shunt group)(setting 4)(110 mm H2O) or placebo
      (closed shunt group)(setting 8)(>400 mm H2O)in a 1:1 ratio. By the time of the primary
      objective evaluation at four months, the closed shunt group will have zero months of active
      treatment, and the open shunt group will have four months of active treatment. At four
      months, shunts for subjects in the closed shunt group will be adjusted to setting 4. To
      maintain blinding, all patients will be adjusted/ mock adjusted to the active setting in a
      similar fashion. Patients from both groups will not be adjusted before four months of active
      treatment, unless judged medically necessary by the treating team. Following four months of
      active treatment, all subjects in each group will have shunt adjustments according to
      clinical standards at each center.
