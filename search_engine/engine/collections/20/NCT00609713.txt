      about the effects of both obesity and obesity treatment on bone development. Osteoporotic
      fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the aged. However, peak bone mass,
      achieved shortly after puberty, is the key determinant of lifetime osteoporotic fracture
      risks. The size and direction of effects of obesity and weight loss on bone health in
      childhood are unclear, partly because of bone ascertainment issues. Obese children and
      adolescents may have elevated fracture risks, contrary to expectations based on adult data.
      Objectives: Primary aims of the proposed study are to: 1) characterize and compare bone
      health of obese and non-obese adolescents using the most accurate methods available, and 2)
      investigate the impact of comprehensive behavior weight control program on the bone health of
      obese adolescents. Study Design: Aim 1 will use a case-control design to compare bone status
      measures of 88 obese adolescents (ages 10 to 14 years), to be recruited for a randomized
      obesity treatment trial, with the same measurements of 51 contemporary non-obese control
      adolescents. For Aim 2, the 88 obese adolescents will be enrolled in a 12-month randomized
      trial, with 1:1 assignment, of a comprehensive behavioral weight control program vs.
      individualized nutrition education (usual care). This randomized trial is the object of this
      registration. Study Measures: For both aims the primary outcome will be bone strength,
      estimated by stress-strength index, and measured by peripheral quantitative computerized
      tomography (pQCT) at the tibia, a weight-bearing site.
