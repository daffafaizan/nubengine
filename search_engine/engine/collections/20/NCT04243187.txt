      it is described that the content of stachyose between 3 varieties can be as different as 493
      mg, 865 mg or 1200 mg per 100 grams of dried beans (Slupski 2014). Along with this it has
      been described that the different culinary preparations of the legumes decrease the
      anti-nutritional factors, so, when soaking for 6 hours it shows 16.5% of undigested sugars
      reaching the small intestine, but it is possible to digest 95% in the colon (Noah 1998).
      Soaking for 16 hours, decreases 85% phytate content, 84% tannin content, 25% raffinose
      content, 25% stachyose and 41% verbascose (Hurtado 2001).

      The oligosaccharide content (raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose) would be responsible for
      gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, pain, meteorism), associated with legume consumption.

      This is because these sugars are galactooligosaccharides, which are not digested in the human
      intestine because it does not have an alpha-galactosidase enzyme (Hessels 2003).

      In our study, 25 varieties of Chilean bean are being evaluated, with nutritional analysis,
      resulting in a variation between 18 and 25 grams of protein per 100 grams dry (unpublished
      data), the oligosaccharide content still pending will be evaluated for Select the 3 varieties
      that contain more proteins and less oligosaccharides.

      These varieties with better nutritional "profile" will be selected, to be evaluated
      clinically.
