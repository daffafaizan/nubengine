      with multiple myeloma (MM), in most studies there appears to be a continuously declining
      event free survival following auto-transplant indicating that few patients will be cured with
      this approach. A high percentage of patients the relapse in the post transplant setting will
      not be candidate for additional chemotherapy. We therefore, are investigating novel
      strategies for controlling their disease in the post transplant setting. The key theoretical
      issue for this study is whether concomitant Trisenox would permit the use of less toxic doses
      of Velcade, resulting in a less toxic but equally effective regimen.

      Phase I of this study uses dose escalation to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of Arsenic,
      Ascorbic Acid and Velcade. Phase II is a subsequent treatment phase using the maximum
      tolerated dose from Phase I. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events,
      treatment may continue for 6 cycles, plus two additional cycles if patient has achieved a
      good response.
