      in guideline now. Several published studies has confirm the effect and safety of
      anticoagulation therapy in cirrhotic patients with PVT.The present studies are most
      observation studies with small sample size and low quality.We need more high-quality research
      such as randomized controlled trials. This is a Zelen-designed randomized controlled trial.
      Patients will randomly enter into two groups:the anticoagulation group or the control group
      and then we will make sure wether their are fond of the group and make decision by
      themselves. The recanalization rate and complications will be analyzed
