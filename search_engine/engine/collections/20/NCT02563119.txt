      microbes communities, collectively termed the "intestinal microbiota". This amazingly complex
      and poorly understood group of communities has an enormous impact on humans. Indeed,
      microbiota is considered to play a number of key roles in the maintenance of host health,
      including aiding digestion of otherwise indigestible dietary compounds, synthesis of vitamins
      and other beneficial metabolites, immune system regulation and enhanced resistance against
      colonization by pathogenic microorganisms. Conversely, the intestinal microbiota is also a
      potent source of antigens and potentially harmful compounds. Schematically, humans can be
      considered to exist in a state of natural balance with their microbial inhabitants. A shift
      in the balance of microbiota composition such that it may become deleterious to host health
      is termed "dysbiosis". Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in numerous
      disorders, ranging from intestinal such as inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer
      to disorders with more systemic effects such as diabetes, obesity, insulin resistance and
      steatohepatitis. The link between the microbes in the human gut and the development of
      obesity, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes, is becoming
      clearer but, because of the complexity of the microbial community, the functional connections
      are less well understood.

      In humans and animals, bariatric surgery (mainly gastric bypass surgery) lead to alterations
      of gut microbiota, which seem to be favourable. In this study the investigators aim to
      examine the effect of different bariatric procedures on composition of gut microbiota.
