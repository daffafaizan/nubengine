      the Western countries. In France, 45.000 new patients develop colorectal cancer every year.
      The liver is the most common organ targeted by CRLM, representing 50%. Approximately, 15-25%
      of colorectal cancer patients have synchronous CRLM at initial workup, and 20-30% patients
      sustain subsequent liver metastases within few years following diagnosis.

      The strategy for colorectal cancer liver metastasis resection and liver cancer has evolved to
      a parenchymatic sparing procedure. This technic aims to minimize surgical margins width while
      removing the tumor. Therefore, the current standard for resection margins is a margin width
      superior to 1mm. However, there is still a debate concerning the margin width. Indeed, with
      modern chemotherapy, several studies reported no statistical differences in the overall
      survival between R0 patients and R1 patients treated with chemotherapy. However, in order to
      preserve patients from chemotherapy treatments' adverse effects an intra-operative
      microscopic assessment of surgical margins should be set up in order to reduce R1 margins
      occurrence.

      Ex vivo study:

      Surgical specimens obtained during hepatectomy will be imaged to generate an atlas of pCLE
      images.

      In vivo study:

      Intraoperative characterization of sub-capsular hepatic masses and surgical margins will be
      assessed.
