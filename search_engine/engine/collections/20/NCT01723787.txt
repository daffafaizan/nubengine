    
      Primary Aim 1: Apply whole-exome sequencing to determine possible causes of cryptogenic IS
      and evaluate adding whole-exome sequencing to standard practice for determining causes of IS.
      Sub-aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of whole-exome sequencing in suggesting
      disease-modifying genes that may contribute to triggering IS.

      Primary Aim 2: Determine genes, through whole-exome sequencing, that may play a role in
      determining ACTH responsiveness for IS. Sub-aim 2: Correlate genes or genetic factors
      (haplotypes) associated with ACTH responsiveness and disease modification.
