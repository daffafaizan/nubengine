      quadruple-combination therapy (LDQT; including candesartan 2 mg, amlodipine 1.25 mg,
      indapamide 0.625 mg, and bisoprolol 2.5 mg) will lower automated office blood pressure and
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure at 12 weeks more effectively, and with no increase in side
      effects, compared to initiating standard dose monotherapy (candesartan 8 mg) in adults with
      raised blood pressure (SBP>130 mmHg or DBP>80 mmHg) and without cardiovascular disease. Our
      preliminary data from a short-term (4-week) crossover trial of 18 participants suggest that
      LDQT lowers office blood pressure by 22/13 mmHg on average compared with placebo with no
      difference in serious adverse events. Effects on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were
      similar.

      The investigators will perform this phase II, single site, randomized controlled trial in a
      network of federally qualified health centers in Chicago because this population bears a
      disproportionate burden of blood pressure related diseases, and the investigators have
      previously successfully conducted clinical studies in this population.

      While the investigators hypothesize this intervention will be easily implemented and
      efficacious for all patients and clinicians, the investigators will explore variation in
      treatment effect by potential moderating variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
      health literacy level. Beyond examining efficacy, the investigators also plan to assess
      feasibility of implementing this intervention in a clinical setting by simultaneously
      evaluating implementation outcomes of acceptability, preferences, and lessons of LDQT among
      patients and clinicians.
