      Primary

        -  To study the toxicity of reduced intensity conditioning comprising fludarabine
           phosphate, busulfan, and anti-thymocyte globulin followed by allogeneic hematopoietic
           stem cell transplantation in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  To study the tumor response in these patients.

        -  To study the incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease in these patients.

        -  To study the incidence of infectious complications in these patients.

        -  To study relapse- or progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To study the biological mechanisms (i.e., taking graft, immunological recovery,
           antitumor activity, and chimerism).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive reduced intensity conditioning comprising fludarabine IV on days -5 to -1,
      oral busulfan on days -4 and -3, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -2 and -1. Patients
      undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every month for 6 months and then
      every 3 months for 1Â½ years.
