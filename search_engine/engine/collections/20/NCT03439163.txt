      Windows) (www.sdmproject.com) was used for meta-analysis.

      For the validation, fMRI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance scanner (Trio
      system; Siemens Magnetom scanner, Erlangen, Germany) with gradient-echo echo-plannar imaging
      sequences. Whole brain fMRI scanning was carried out. All participants were instructed to
      keep their eyes closed, relax, remain motionless, not think of anything in particular, and
      not fall asleep. Foam pads were used to minimize head motion.
