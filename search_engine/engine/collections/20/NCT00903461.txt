      injections of EGFR antisense. Please see eligibility criteria.

      Treatment plan

      EGFR AS will be administered by direct intratumoral injection using direct visualization,
      endoscopy, or imaging-guidance (ultrasound) as clinically determined . Patients will receive
      a total of up to 7 weekly intratumoral injections of EGFR antisense (or less if there is no
      identifiable tumor) starting 2 weeks prior to radiation. Patients will receive standard
      radiation 70 Gy/200 cGy/daily, 5 days/week,excluding weekends and holidays, with concurrent
      cetuximab 250 mg/m2, after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 2 weeks prior to starting radiation.

      Statistical Design and Sample Size The study will be conducted in two-stages. In the first
      stage, 11 patients with stage IVA-C or recurrent disease will be evaluated for safety. If the
      regimen is deemed safe, a total of 31 patients with stage III or IVA-B, previously untreated
      SCCHN will be enrolled in the second stage of the study.
