      for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Notably, more than half of the new HCC
      cases and deaths develop in China. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been proposed
      as the first-line therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC.
      However, TACE has several limitations itself which might be potentially associated with tumor
      metastasis and relapse.

      Recent studies have demonstrated that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) can act as the first-line
      therapeutic option in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thereafter, several
      small studies in China showed promising clinical benefits when As2O3 is administrated among
      the HCC patients. With these preliminary results, the investigators are planning to carry out
      a multicenter randomized controlled trial through which to explore the potential efficacy and
      safety of adjuvant As2O3 treatment for HCC patients.
