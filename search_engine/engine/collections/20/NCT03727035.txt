      chronic periodontitis patients with and without diabetes mellitus. A total of 80 subjects
      with generalized chronic periodontitis were selected and divided into two groups. Group I
      comprised of 40 subjects who were diagnosed with generalized chronic periodontitis without
      any systemic conditions. Group II comprised of 40 generalized chronic periodontitis patients
      with type II diabetes mellitus. Demographic variables such as age, weight, height, BMI and
      income and the clinical parameters such as plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket
      depth and clinical attachment level were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were collected
      from both the groups.The collected samples were subjected to further molecular analysis for
      the CD163 expression using RT-PCR and for the CD163 quantification using ELISA. The elevated
      levels of CD163 in the subgingival plaque samples of generalized chronic periodontitis
      subjects with diabetes is expected and the early identification of patients at risk for
      diabetes mellitus and periodontitis.
