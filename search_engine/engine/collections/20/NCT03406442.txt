      approaches were limited by the resultant skull base defects .

      Access to the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) is a surgical challenge due to its deep location in
      the mid-third of the face and its complex array of vascular and neural structures. An
      important aspect of the PPF is its topographical relation to the orbit and cranial cavity.

      The philosophy behind the transpterygoid approach centers on the maxillary sinus as the
      primary corridor, displaces the contents of the PPF and removes the pterygoid process
      partially or completely to reach to the lateral extent of the endonasal technique.

      The endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid approaches classified into five types. Type A
      involves thinning of the pterygoid process to gain access to PPF. Type B involves removal of
      the medial and anterior aspect of the base of the pterygoid process to access the lateral
      recess of the sphenoid sinus. Type C involves dissecting the vidian nerve to identify the
      petrous ICA and removing the base of the pterygoid plates to reach the petrous apex, Meckel's
      cave, or cavernous sinus. Type D requires a variable removal of the pterygoid plates to
      access the infratemporal fossa. Type E requires removal of part or even the entire pterygoid
      process, and the medial third of the Eustachian tube to provide exposure of the lateral
      nasopharynx.
