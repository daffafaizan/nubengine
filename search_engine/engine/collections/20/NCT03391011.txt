      Biophotonics and Bioengineering Lab (BBL) surgical navigation prototype, when registered with
      pre-operative imaging (CT or MRI), can accurately estimate subsurface anatomy and allow
      tracking the position of surgical instruments in real-time, using an intraoperative
      non-contact optical imaging system during spinal surgical procedures.
