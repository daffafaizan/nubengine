    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE), is the most common complication occurring in association with knee and hip
      arthroplasty procedures due to an activation of the clotting cascade during bone and
      intramedullary canal preparation.DVT rates ranging from 4% to 15 % and PE rates ranging from
      0.83% to 3% have been reported, with fatal PE rates reduced with the use of postoperative
      anticoagulation. The high risk of thromboembolic disease has led to recommendations that
      pharmacoprophylaxis be considered routinely. â€¢ The combination of short duration outpatient
      anticoagulation, early mobilization, and mechanical prophylaxis has recently been studied at
      our institution (Barnes-Jewish Hospital) and has been effective in prophylaxis against VTE.
      Current American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guidelines recommend that a longer
      duration of outpatient anticoagulation following TKA / THA surgery may further reduce the
      risk of VTE.

      Shorter patient hospitalizations and earlier discharge require an outpatient VTE prophylaxis
      regimen that is simple, effective, easy to monitor, predictable, and has a high patient
      compliance. Currently, "routine" risk patients receive a combination of ASA 325mg BID (twice
      daily) for a period of 6 weeks, and portable, mobile pneumatic compression devices (MCDs) for
      a period of 10 days post- surgery.The study is testing to see whether the use of ASA alone
      can be equally effective versus the use of ASA with MCDs in "routine" risk patients following
      total joint arthroplasty.Patients are enrolled fpr 6 months following surgery, and data
      collection occurs pre-surgery, 14 days after surgery, at the 4-8 wk visit and finally, at 6
      months post surgery. We are evaluating the stated outcomes over this 6 month period.
