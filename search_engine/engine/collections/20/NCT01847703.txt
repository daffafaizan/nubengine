      safety as conventional abdominal surgery (AS) for high risk endometrial cancer (EC).

      Methods: Women with high risk EC (defined as high grade endometrial, clear cell or serous)
      are randomized to either RAL or AS. Both groups will undergo complete surgical staging
      (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortal lymphadenectomy)

      Primary endpoint: Number of harvested lymph nodes per station Secondary endpoints:
      Recurrences up to 3 year after surgery. Lymphatic side-effects, quality of life, cost,
      surgical morbidity.
