      FDG-PET scan and MRI after the end of the treatment. On a basis of patient, comparison
      between PET and MRI will be done tumoral site by site. Sensitivity, Specificity will be
      estimated for both techniques. In case of discrepancy, another imaging method or biopsy (if
      easy to perform) will be serve as standard of reference. Kappa coefficients and Mc Nemar test
      will be performed to compare the two methods. FDG = fluorodeoxyglucose FLUCIS®
