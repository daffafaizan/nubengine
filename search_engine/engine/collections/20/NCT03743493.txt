    
      This is a two phase retrospective study. The goal of Phase I is to assess the utility of
      PCORnet Common Data Mode (CDM) data to study risk factors, processes, and outcomes related to
      opioid use, misuse, and abuse. Based on the results of the Phase I feasibility examination,
      Phase II will be conducted and will analyze the relationships between patient- and
      provider-level risk factors and policies, and opioid-related outcomes over time and within
      geographic regions.

      The study will leverage the existing data PCORnet data infrastructure and resources to
      achieve its objectives and answer its research questions. Standardized analysis programs will
      be distributed to participating sites within the PCORnet Distributed Research Network. Sites
      will return aggregate, descriptive counts and summary statistics from regression analyses.
      When data are unavailable or analysis is determined infeasible, results will be reported as
      such.

      The Aims of Phase I are:

        1. Generate counts and proportion of patients with exposure (or potential exposure) to
           opioids though prescription or dispensing records within a health system.

           a. Compare results to CDC.

        2. Characterize data elements in PCORnet data and assess suitability for opioid
           surveillance.

             1. Identify the relevant data elements

             2. Examine data completeness and validity

             3. Identify data limitations and gaps that limit surveillance

      The Aims of Phase II are:

        1. Examine whether and to what extent patient-level risk factors, provider processes, and
           policies are associated with declines in outcomes of interest.

        2. Examine whether and to what extent prescribing guidelines, related policies, processes,
           and/or care procedures are associated opioid-related outcomes.
