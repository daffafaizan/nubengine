      by medical or surgical treatment. For more than two decades various groups have tried using
      modified cell transplants for curing this disease. Earlier results with use of fetal
      mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe
      side effects.

      Current interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing
      neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found
      encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other
      data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the
      efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone
      marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the
      striatum of the patient.
