      early treatment method for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients on invasive mechanical
      ventilation (IMV) to compensate for or reduce muscle mass losses and muscular atrophy.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of early mobilization with neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation in critical care patients on invasive mechanical ventilation.

      Methods: Randomized clinical trial to be conducted in the ICU at the hospital de clínicas of
      Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, with two groups, one intervention group (conventional physiotherapy
      and NMES) and one placebo group (conventional physiotherapy and placebo NMES). Patients on
      mechanical ventilation who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited and the intervention
      will be administered using a 4-channel Ibramed® Neurodyn Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) machine, every day for thirty minutes until extubation or death. Outcomes will be
      muscle thickness of pectoral and abdominal muscles and diaphragm excursion measured with
      ultrasound, before intervention, on the seventh day of intervention and soon after
      extubation. Additionally, blood lactate and heart rate variability will be assessed.
      Statistical analysis will be conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
      (SPSS) 20.0 and the significance level will be p<0.05.
