      both ranking the 2nd among malignancies in China. Surgery is the only possible way to cure
      gastric cancer, however, over 80-90% of gastric cancer patients in China are in advanced
      stage. Locally advanced gastric cancer (cT3-4aN+M0) could be cured by multi-disciplinary
      therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can
      downstage T and N stage, increase the resectability of tumor, and finally improve the
      long-term survival. However, the therapeutic effects remain unsatisfactory. PD-1 antibody has
      demonstrated its efficacy in metastatic gastric cancer and has been proved to be effective in
      neoadjuvant setting in lung cancer and melanoma. Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody
      and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer could be a novel therapy to increase
      response rate and resectability and reduce recurrence rate. JS001 in this study is a Chinese
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma. This study
      is a multi-center, open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate tolerability,
      safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally
      advanced gastric cancer.
