      for 8.1% of the Global Burden of Disease. The need for interventions that can prevent mental
      health conditions, particularly among children, cannot be overemphasized. This study will
      determine whether zinc supplementation improves the mental health and school performance
      among children in Guatemala.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive daily supplements of either zinc or placebo
      for 6 months. Participants will be assessed at study entry and after the 6-month treatment.
      Participants and their parents and teachers will complete questionnaires about the
      participants' symptoms of depression and anxiety, concentration and activity levels, school
      performance, and any environmental stressors to which the participants may be exposed to.
