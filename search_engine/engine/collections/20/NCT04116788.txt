      hearing rehabilitation for deaf people was given priority over the potential constraints of
      imaging. Investigator team find less than 10 articles with a search of following keywords on
      the pubmed database: Artifacts AND MRI AND cochlear implants. Only one of these articles
      deals with demagnetization. There is only one article dealing with artifacts with the
      Bonebridge implant. There are no studies with the Attract implant and a recent one with the
      new Synchrony mobile magnet implant, but by removing the magnet which implies a minimum
      response time and therefore not compatible with emergency care.

      In total, the literature is quite poor mainly considering the priority of auditory
      rehabilitation on the realization of subsequent imaging.

      However, the current "democratization" of hearing implants and their increasing use in
      children and adults requires reflection on not only the safety of examinations of healthy
      volunteers, but also of the implant itself. also on the relevance of the interpretation of
      imaging especially cerebral.

      The pilot study done, suggested that the placement of the implant (in this case the
      Bonebridge) has an influence on the size of the artifact and the possibilities of
      interpretation.

      It seems appropriate to continue this protocol of analysis, both on the implants in bone
      conduction, and also on the cochlear implants to demonstrate the impact of the implant on the
      MRI images and also the impact of the magnetic field on the implant itself, and possibly
      publish recommendations for clinical practice.
