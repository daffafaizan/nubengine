        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of fludarabine and thalidomide in patients with newly
           diagnosed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete and partial) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study of thalidomide followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Beginning on day 1, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for up to 6
           months. Beginning on day 7, patients also receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily
           for 5 days. Treatment with fludarabine repeats every 28-35 days for up to 6 courses.
           Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of thalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive fludarabine and thalidomide as in phase I at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months for 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 45 patients (≥ 9 for the phase I portion and ≤ 36 for the phase II
      portion) will be accrued for this study within 8 years.
