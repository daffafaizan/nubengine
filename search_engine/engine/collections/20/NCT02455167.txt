      interferon-free combination of 12 weeks of simeprevir (SMV, Simeprevir), sofosbuvir (SOF,
      Sofosbuvir), and ribavirin (RBV) in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and early
      decompensation of cirrhosis. Early decompensation is defined by clinical complications or
      laboratory deterioration but with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 10 or
      less.

      The primary objective of this trial is determination of hepatic functional improvement as
      measured by the HepQuant (HQ) test during and after
      Simeprevir(SMV)/Sofosbuvir(SOF)/Ribavirin(RBV). Standard laboratory tests, clinical models
      (MELD, CTP), liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), and other imaging tests
      are insensitive, invasive, or nonspecific.

      They may not adequately assess the liver's improvement after viral eradication. In contrast,
      HepQuant (HQ) tests (Systemic Hepatic Filtration Rate (HFR), Portal HFR, SHUNT,single point
      cholate concentration (STAT), and DSI) are noninvasive, sensitive, specific, and target an
      endogenous function, the hepatic uptake of cholate. HQ tests uses serum sampling over a time
      period of up to 90 minutes to quantify the systemic circulation, portal circulation, and
      portal-systemic shunt and to derive a disease severity index (DSI) in intact human subjects.
      The primary endpoint in this treatment trial will be improvement in hepatic function measured
      by HepQuant (HQ) tests that occurs during and after successful
      Simeprevir(SMV)/Sofosbuvir(SOF)/Ribavirin(RBV).
