      intensive care units, but has several demerits. Proportional assist ventilation with
      load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) is a promising mode with better patient synchrony and
      weaning advantages. However, weaning outcome of PAV+ in patients with prolonged mechanical
      ventilation has not been evaluated before. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled
      trial in a tertiary medical center. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness between
      PAV+ and PSV for weaning adult patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
