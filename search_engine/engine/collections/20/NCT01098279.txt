      followed by an extensive baseline phenotyping session, which together are expected to take
      approximately 2.5 hours to complete. Participants will be provided with breaks as needed
      during the clinic visit. The eligibility screening session is intended to collect the
      minimally sufficient data to confirm eligibility, so that the extensive baseline phenotyping
      session is initiated only for participants highly likely to be confirmed after the 48 hour
      urine culture results are known.

      Participants who enroll in the study and complete a baseline clinic visit will be followed up
      with bi-weekly and bi-monthly internet-based questionnaires, as well as in-clinic visits at 6
      and 12 months.

      Participants will provide self-reported symptom data using web based internet tools on a
      bi-weekly basis. These questions are expected to be completed within 5-7 minutes.

      A more extensive set of questionnaires will be administered to each participant every two
      months during the 12-month study period. The bi-monthly assessment will also be administered
      via the internet, and the questions are expected to be completed within 10-15 minutes.
