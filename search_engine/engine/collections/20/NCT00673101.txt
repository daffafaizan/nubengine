      patients with Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis which may induce liver
      fibrosis with high cumulative doses. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a new non-invasive
      rapid, reproducible and bed-side method, allowing assessment of liver fibrosis by measurement
      of liver stiffness. A preliminary study (Laharie et al, Alimentary Pharmaceutical
      Therapeutics 2006) had shown that significant liver fibrosis was rare in Crohn's disease
      patients treated with a high dose of methotrexate. FibroScan was a reliable non-invasive
      method to detect liver fibrosis which could be recommended in these patients. Therefore,
      liver biopsy could be performed only with patients with high FibroScan values and/or with
      chronic liver enzymes abnormalities. However, further longitudinal and prospective studies
      are mandatory to confirm these preliminary data, in patients with crohn's disease but also
      with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
