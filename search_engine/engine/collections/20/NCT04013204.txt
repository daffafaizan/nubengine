      effects of vascular EFT on the prescription of doctors and the application rate of mid and
      long-term secondary prevention medication in patients. If the results are positive, the
      sample size and observation time will be further expanded in Phase II to evaluate its impact
      on the cardiovascular events of patients, as well as its cost-effectiveness.
