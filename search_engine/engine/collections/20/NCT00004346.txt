      study for up to 3 weeks. The diet is free of cholesterol and cholestanol.

      For the next 4 weeks, patients return to their typical diet and are medicated with daily
      lovastatin and chenodeoxycholic acid.

      The feeding study is repeated for an additional 3 weeks, with the patient taking either
      lovastatin or chenodeoxycholic acid.
