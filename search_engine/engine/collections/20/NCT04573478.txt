      atrasentan or placebo daily for 132 weeks. Subjects receive a maximally tolerated and stable
      dose of a RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitor (such as angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor antagonist (ARB)) as part of standard of care. An
      exception will be made for subjects who are unable to tolerate RAS inhibitor therapy.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of atrasentan versus placebo on
      proteinuria as measured by UPCR. Secondary and tertiary objectives include evaluating the
      change in kidney function over time as measured by eGFR, safety and tolerability, as well as
      quality of life.

      Subjects will have assessments of safety and efficacy over 2 Â½ years. To facilitate study
      participation over this time period, where allowed by local regulations, options for remote
      study visits using telemedicine and home health may be offered.

      Subjects who complete the study may be eligible to enroll in an extension study to receive
      open-label treatment with atrasentan under a separate protocol.
