      into one of two groups. Patients in Group 1 will undergo general anesthesia with a
      post-induction, post-intubation, pre-procedural subcostal TAP block with 40 mL 0.25%
      bupivacaine on the ipsilateral side as the extraction site. Patients in Group 2 will undergo
      general anesthesia with a post-induction, post-intubation, pre-procedural subcostal TAP block
      with 40 mL sterile normal saline on the ipsilateral side as the extraction site.
      Investigators will be blinded to the randomization of these patients. Following performance
      of these blocks, patients will receive standard care for the surgery as well as during the
      postoperative recovery period. Data will be obtained from the EPIC electronic medical record,
      and from the anesthesia computer record. Patients will be asked postoperatively to assess
      items such as their nausea and pain scores. Patients will also be contacted by phone within
      1-2 days of discharge to obtain analgesic satisfaction scores. This data will be collected on
      the Redcap server.
