      TAK-123 intravenously at the dose level of 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium phenylacetate and 3.75 g/m^2
      of sodium benzoate.

      - TAK-123 as 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium phenylacetate and 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium benzoate

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
