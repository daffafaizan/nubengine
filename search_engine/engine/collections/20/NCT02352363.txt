    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b study in patients with PD
      (CVT-301-003) demonstrated clinically important, and statistically significant
      CVT-301-associated improvements in motor function at doses of 35 and 50 mg LD FPD, compared
      with placebo, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor
      assessment (Part 3); furthermore, CVT-301 was generally safe and well tolerated. A Phase 3,
      randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 35 mg and
      50 mg FPD as an adjunct to a CD/LD regimen in the treatment of OFF symptoms over 12 weeks
      (CVT-301-004) was conducted in parallel with this study.
