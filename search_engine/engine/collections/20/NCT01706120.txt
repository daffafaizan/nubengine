    
      MITO-16 - MANGO-OV2 is a single-arm, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter, phase IV
      study. Patients will receive a combination of bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin as
      first line treatment (in-label dose and scheduling). This is an exploratory study attempting
      to identify potential prognostic clinical factors(such as hypertension) and prognostic
      biologic factors. Overall, 2 types of biomarkers are considered. Dynamic biomarkers are those
      expressing the changing nature of the disease in relation to the treatment or simply the
      tumour progression, these are typically not inherited. Genetic biomarkers are typically
      inherited and are expression of some characteristics potentially able to interfere with the
      treatment effect (i.e. Pharmacogenomics).

      The safety of this regimen in routine clinical practice will also be described.
