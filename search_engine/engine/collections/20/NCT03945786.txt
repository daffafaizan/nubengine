      hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node resection). Lymph node
      metastasis rate in the early low-risk EC patients (histologically graded G1 and G2,
      myometrium invasion depth <50%, primary tumor diameter <2 cm) is low (<4%). Lymph node
      resection has no clear benefit on the prognosis of low-risk EC patients, but will bring
      greater trauma to the patients.

      Accurate preoperative assessment of EC staging plays a decisive role in the individualized
      surgical range for EC patients. Preoperative imaging can assist in optimal treatment
      planning. Through ultrasound, MRI, PET we always cannot accurately measure the depth of
      muscle infiltration, lymph node metastasis and extra-uterine lesions. The simultaneous hybrid
      PET/MRI technology combines the characteristics of MRI in high-resolution imaging of soft
      tissue and the advantages of PET in strong ability to identify tumor metastases, so it may be
      capable for more accurate staging.
