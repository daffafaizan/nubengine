      and opioids. However, these drugs may cause respiratory depression and circulatory
      instability. Combination will increase the risk of hypoxia and apnea.

      In China, most anesthesia for hysteroscopy and gastroenteroscopy is procedural sedation and
      analgesia(PAS) provided by anesthetists. Foester et,al. have been tested that IVL could
      significantly reduce propofol requirements „ÄÅpostoperative pain and fatigue scores in
      colonoscopy. Chen,et,al. find the same effect of IVL in elderly. However, there is no
      research reporting IVL used in hysteroscopy and diagnostic curettage. So, our main objective
      is to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on propofol requirements in patients
      undergoing hysteroscopy and diagnostic curettage.
