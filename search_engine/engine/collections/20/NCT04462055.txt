      sinusitis validate the fundamental role for IL-4 and IL-13 in the pathogenesis of these
      diseases, and add to the possibility that these cytokines are also critically involved in
      other related allergic/atopic (type 2 immune) diseases that are often co-morbidly associated
      with AD, such as food allergy.
