      unsatisfying. Combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological applications is
      recommended in treatment. Although the etiology of FM is not well known, characteristic
      findings such as hyperalgesia and allodynia suggest problems related to pain and sensorial
      processing in the central nervous system.

      It has been suggested that spinal manipulation can alter sensorimotor integration in the
      central nervous system and therefore can be used in the treatment of central sensitization
      syndromes. However, manual therapy applications, which were examined under the heading of
      chiropractic in the 2016 EULAR treatment recommendations, were not recommended due to the low
      quality (open-label, quasi-experimental) of the studies conducted so far. However, it has
      been suggested for future studies to investigate whether the combined use of pharmacological
      and non-pharmacological treatments is more effective than single modality management. But
      since then unfortunately a high level of evidence also could not be obtained related to use
      of spinal manipulation in FM due to reasons such as lack of reporting of the manual therapy
      methods used in detail, conducting studies involving mostly soft tissue techniques and not
      following CONSORT recommendations.

      This study is planned as a prospective, triple-blinding, randomized controlled and 3-arm
      parallel group design clinical study considering the concepts that have been lacking the
      literature.
