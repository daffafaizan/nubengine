      toes in a randomized blinded study of approximately 125 subjects. Right and left great toes
      are randomized to treatment or no treatment. Samples from infected areas are sampled and
      evaluated for presence of fungus with KOH, PCR and culture tests. Nail bed clearing and nail
      plate growth are measured from high resolution photographs by a blinded evaluator. Subjects
      will be evaluated at baseline and at 8, 16, 24 and 48 weeks for safety and effectiveness of
      study treatment.
