      equivalency of two different doses of dexamethasone when given intravenously as an adjuvant
      medication for postoperative pain management. Specifically, this study will investigate the
      prolongation of time to recovery of sensation following a lumbar plexus block in patients
      undergoing total hip arthroplasties. The investigators hypothesize that dexamethasone will
      prolong the sensory block time when compared to placebo and that similar results will be
      obtained in the 4 mg arm when compared to the 8 mg arm. The primary end point will be time to
      sensory recovery in the femoral nerve cutaneous distribution (part of the lumbar plexus) as
      determined by pin-prick sensation assessment. Secondary endpoints will include, but are not
      be limited to: time to first opioid administration, total opioid consumption over 30 hours,
      and rest and incident verbal numerical pain scores at 6,12,18,24 and 30 hours post block
      placement.
