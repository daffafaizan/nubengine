      under development as an inhaled treatment for asthma in children. This study will determine
      the PK characteristics and assess the safety and tolerability of the nebules formulation of
      GW870086X in healthy volunteers after 14 days of dosing.

      This is the first clinical study that will be assessing the nebules formulation. The purpose
      of this study is to ensure that the doses that have been selected have a good safety profile
      in line with what has been found in the previous DPI formulation studies, and to assess the
      PK profile after single (Day 1) and repeat dose (Day 14) to select appropriate doses for
      future studies with the nebules formulation. This study will also provide additional safety
      cover with the nebules formulation given over a longer duration than studied previously with
      the DPI formulation before moving into the paediatric programme. This study is designed to
      give at least 5-fold cover for the highest dose to be studied in future paediatric
      programmes. During this study cortisol production will be assessed by measuring 24 hour
      cortisol profile in serum and urine as well as performing an ACTH stimulation test. Two doses
      (5mg and 8.75mg) have been selected. These doses are 5 and 10 times higher than the
      anticipated maximum clinical dose. The doses have been selected to ensure sufficient safety
      cover in future paediatric studies as well as to confirm the absence of significant adrenal
      inhibition at doses that would be expected to cause complete inhibition of cortisol
      production with traditional steroids.
