      cholestatic liver disease. Taking advantage of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the outcome of
      patients with PBC has been improved, comparable to those in general population. However,
      pruritus, which is often a persisting and annoying symptom, may decrease the quality of life
      (QOL) of patients with PBC. Although anti-histamines are administered for this the efficacy
      is limited, and no drugs which was clearly proved to be effective for suppressing pruritus
      have been developed worldwide.

      Nalfurafine hydrochloride is a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist developed in Japan,
      and in January 2009 approved for pruritus in patients with renal failure and under
      hemodialysis. A phase 3 trial of nalfurafine hydrochloride for pruritus in patients with
      chronic liver diseases was completed, indicating the efficacy as well as safety was
      confirmed. Therefore, in May 2015 the use of nalfurafine hydrochloride was officially
      approved in Japan for pruritus in patients with chronic liver diseases including PBC.
      However, only 59 patients with PBC were included and therefore it is still unclear whether
      nalfurafine chloride is effective in all PBC patients or a part of them, whether the effect
      of this drug depends on coadministered drugs or other complications, or whether this drug may
      improve QOL overall in patients with PBC.

      In the current study, the investigators aimed to assess pruritus and overall QOL before and
      after administration of nalfurafine hydrochloride in patients with PBC, to answer the
      clinical questions described above. Furthermore, the investigators took serum sample from the
      enrolled patients and examine the association of pruritus with possible biomarkers.
