      The Primary objective for open label phase was to determine the safety and tolerability of
      lapatinib when administered in combination with both paclitaxel and trastuzumab. The study
      first enrolled an open label safety cohort of 20 patients to assess the tolerability of the
      triplet combination. This was a 1 arm, 3 cohort study stage.

      Open-label Phase: Patients were sequentially enrolled into three cohorts and received an
      open-label combination of paclitaxel, trastuzumab and lapatinib: Cohort 1 received paclitaxel
      80mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle, trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2
      mg/kg IV weekly, and lapatinib 1000 mg PO daily. Cohort 2 received paclitaxel 70mg/m2 IV
      weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle, trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg IV
      weekly, and lapatinib 1000 mg PO daily. Cohort 3 paclitaxel 80mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 weeks of
      a 4 week cycle, trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg IV weekly, and lapatinib 750
      mg PO daily.

      Randomized Phase: was terminated following the poor recruitment rate in the open-label safety
      stage. No subjects were enrolled into the randomization stage.

      In summary, at approximately 3.5 years the primary analysis which included demographics,
      efficacy and safety were conducted; at approximately 7 years protocol amendment 7 cancelled
      collection of efficacy endpoints, and only key safety endpoints were to be collected; the
      final analysis was performed at approximately 14 years.
