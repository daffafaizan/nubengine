    
      Background:

        -  SMM is a precursor condition to MM defined by the clinical parameters of M-protein
           greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to
           10% and absence of end organ disease.

        -  Risk of progression of high risk SMM at 5 years is 72-75% with median time to
           progression less than 2 years.

        -  The current standard of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until
           symptomatic MM develops. However, IMWG states Preventive clinical trials need to be
           considered for patients with high risk smoldering myeloma .

        -  MLN9708 is a new oral proteasome inhibitor with potent anti-MM effects

      Objectives:

      Primary Endpoint:

      -The primary objective of the study is to assess the response rate of MLN9708/low-dose

      dexamethasone in patients with high-risk SMM.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  To determine progression free survival (PFS)

        -  To determine duration of response (DOR)

        -  To evaluate toxicity of combination therapy (MLN9708 and low-dose dexamethasone).

        -  To evaluate biological activity of MLN9708 and correlate to clinical outcomes (gene
           expression profiling and proteasome activity and ubiquination assays, and effects on
           downstream signaling targets using pre- and post-MLN9708 exposure bone marrow samples)

      Eligibility:

        -  SMM according to the International Myeloma Working Group definition i.e.:

             -  Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cells
                greater than or equal to 10 %,

             -  Absence of anemia: Hemoglobin greater than10 g/dl

             -  Absence of renal failure: calculated creatinine clearance (according to MDRD)
                greater than 80 ml/min (or alternatively based on standard creatinine level
                criteria of 2 mg/dl)

             -  Absence of hypercalcemia: Ca < 10.5 mg/dl or less than or equal to 2.5 mmol/L

             -  Absence of lytic bone lesion

        -  Measurable disease within the past 4 weeks defined by any one of the following:

             -  Serum monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 1.0 g/dl

             -  Urine monoclonal protein >200 mg/24 hour

             -  Serum immunoglobulin free light chain >10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio
                (reference 0.26-1.65)

        -  High-risk SMM per Mayo Clinic or Spanish PETHEMA criteria

        -  Age greater than18 years

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

        -  Ability to give informed consent

        -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

             -  absolute neutrophil count greater than1.0 K/uL

             -  platelets greater than75 K/uL (Platelet transfusions to help patients meet
                eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study enrolment.)

             -  hemoglobin greater than 8 g/dL(transfusions are permissible)

             -  total bilirubin less than1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

             -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than 3.0 X institutional upper limit of normal

      Design:

      -Single arm pilot trial of combination therapy (MLN9708 and dexamethasone) for high risk
      smoldering multiple myeloma

        -  Patients will receive 12 cycles (28 days each) of induction combination therapy of
           MLN9708 and low-dose dexamethasone. After 12 cycles of MLN9708/low-dose dexamethasone,
           patients will receive MLN9708 maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Patients will have routine blood work with SPEP and free light chains monthly

        -  Pre- and post-treatment bone marrow biopsies will be obtained for confirmation of
           diagnosis and correlative studies

        -  Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at complete
           remission/completion of 12 cycles of therapy, using multi-parametric flow cytometry and
           FDG PET-CT

        -  This single arm pilot study will enroll 12 evaluable patients and determine M-spike
           levels on each patient immediately pre-treatment as well as after completing 12 cycles
           of treatment. The study aim is to find 9 or more patients (out of 12) with a partial
           response (PR) or better; which would provide strong evidence that the true probability
           of an overall response is consistent with 80% or more.
