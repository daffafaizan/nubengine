      and time-course of strawberry consumption in a population where dietary intervention may of
      particular benefit for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic
      disease. Participants will participate in a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      crossover trial. Following a 10-day run-in where no berries are consumed, participants will
      be randomized via Latin-square design, to three different daily strawberry powder conditions
      for 4-weeks at a time, with a 7 day washout between conditions.
