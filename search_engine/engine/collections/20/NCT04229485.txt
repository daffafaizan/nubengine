      complication of CKD. It involves kidney, bone metabolism, parathyroid gland, cardiovascular
      and cerebrovascular organs. It is an independent risk factor for progression of CKD to
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD), vascular and cardiac valve calcification, and cardiovascular
      and cerebrovascular events. However, less data concerning the relationship between bone
      metabolic index, such as high blood phosphorus and cardiovascular diseases, bone mass
      reduction and fracture is available in Chinese adult patients. This study is a multi-center
      prospective cohort study to explore the relationship between bone metabolic markers and other
      non-traditional risk factors with renal function progression, cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular diseases, and bone loss in patients with CKD G3-5ND. Based on the sample size
      estimation, 3360 subjects should be enrolled in this study. The primary outcome is
      progression to ESRD (start dialysis or kidney transplantation) or doubling of serum
      creatinine, as well as cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.

      At present, the follow-up and the management of complications of CKD patients are not enough.
      The popularity of mobile communication in China provide the possibility to strengthen the
      follow-up and complications management in CKD patients and save human resources. This study
      is to explore a new mode of collecting datas through mobile communication in chronic kidney
      disease patients.
