      therapy of sickle cell anemia and sickle ÃŸ0-thalassemia.

      The secondary purpose is to assess the effect of L-glutamine frequency of hospitalizations
      for sickle cell pain, frequency of emergency room visits for sickle cell pain; energy and
      appetite levels; narcotics usage.

      Methodology:

      By site, patients will be randomized to L-glutamine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio after a 4-week
      screening period. Patients will undergo 48 weeks of treatment with dosing BID orally, with
      dose calculated according to patient weight. Patient visits will occur every 4 weeks. After
      48 weeks of treatment, dose will be tapered to zero within 3 weeks. A final evaluation visit
      will occur 2 weeks after last dose.
