    
      ABY-035-204 is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study.

      The primary objective is to estimate the relationship between different dose regimens of
      ABY-035 and clinical response as assessed by Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International
      Society 40 (ASAS40) response at Week 16 in subjects with active AS.

      The study will include the following 3 periods:

        1. Screening Period: Up to 35 days prior to baseline randomization.

        2. Treatment Period 1: Day 0-Week 16 Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to
           receive 1 of 4 treatments (ABY-035 80 mg Q2W, ABY-035 160 mg Q4W, ABY-035 40 mg Q2W, or
           placebo).

           Treatment Period 1 ends at Week 16 after all trial assessments have been done and
           Treatment Period 2 starts at Week 16 with the IMP injection.

        3. Treatment Period 2 (Extension Period): Week 16-Week 52 Subjects will continue their
           original treatment of Treatment Period 1 in a double-blinded manner.

      Subjects who could not achieve an ASAS20 response from baseline are defined as non-responders
      and eligible for rescue treatment after Week 16 (Visit 9).
