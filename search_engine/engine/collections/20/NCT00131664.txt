      hydrochloride, with different but complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic
      control while reducing circulating insulin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. AvandiaTM
      and AmarylTM combine two antidiabetic agents, rosiglitazone maleate and glimepiride.
      Glimepiride is an effective antihyperglycemic agent which has a low incidence of
      hypoglycemia, symptomatic hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, and confirmed hypoglycemia.
      Subjects in this study who are inadequately controlled on diet, exercise and a submaximal
      dose of metformin or sulfonylurea (SU) will be randomized to either a combination of
      metformin plus rosiglitazone (AvandametTM) or a combination of AvandiaTM + AmarylTM or a
      Metformin monotherapy arm. As per the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guidelines, their
      fasting plasma glucose and A1C to be 7 (mmol/L / percent) or less throughout the study. If
      the subject does not achieve the target then either AvandametTM or AvandiaTM and AmarylTM or
      Metformin will be up-titrated in an effort to reach this CDA recommended target. This study
      will attempt to demonstrate that the either combination arm of rosiglitazone plus metformin
      (AvandametTM) or the other combination arm of AvandiaTM + AmarylTM will provide greater
      glycemic control while avoiding the side-effects associated with the use of maximal dose
      metformin.
