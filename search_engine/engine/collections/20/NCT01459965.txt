      gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, have an extremely poor prognosis. At the time of
      diagnosis the majority of these tumors will be unresectable with a median survival of 4-6
      months. Palliation is the goal for those patients with unresectable tumors and limited
      survival and for those at high risk for attempts at curative resection.

      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with endoscopic stent insertion is
      considered the method of choice for palliative treatment of malignant bile duct obstruction
      (MBDO). However, it can cause complications, such as pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation,
      cholangitis and stent migration in a significant proportion of treated patients. Clogging of
      plastic stents is a predictable consequence and requires periodic stent exchanges with
      attendant risks and costs. While endoscopic stenting is clearly indicated for relief of
      cholangitis or refractory pruritus, the role of stenting in patients with jaundice alone,
      abdominal pain, or failure to thrive due to malignancy is less clear. Given the risk for
      complications and costs, endoscopic therapy might be justified in these clinical scenarios if
      quality of life (QOL) is significantly improved. A few available studies have demonstrated
      improved QOL in stented patients. However, these studies include a small number of patients
      and/or are retrospective in design. Therefore, more evidence to support routine palliative
      biliary drainage in patients with MBDO is desired.
