    
      The P2Et extract will be self-administered by the participants on a daily basis (600 mg 1
      daily capsule, 2 daily capsules for 1,200 mg, 4 daily capsules for 2,400 and 8 daily capsules
      for 4,800 mg) 1 hour after meals and at the same time every day, from day 1 to day 30.

      In the event that the participants presents vomit within 15 minutes after taking P2Et, the
      participants should take another dose. Should the participant forget any scheduled dose and
      less than 6 hours have elapsed, the participant must take the dose immediately; if more than
      6 hours have elapsed, the subject must wait and take the next scheduled dose.

      Dose escalation will be performed to determine the P2Et maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      maximum dose toxicity (MDT). In the escalation phase, the P2Et daily dose will be escalated
      in the cohort of subjects with minimum dose of 600 mg daily to a maximum of 4,800 mg. Each
      cohort will be made up of around 3 and 6 subjects, at least 3 subjects will be enrolled in
      each dosage level. Should MTD is not observed in the first 3 subjects treated in the first
      month, escalation to the next dosage level will be undertaken. Should 1 or more MTD occur in
      any dosage level in a subject, 3 subjects will be added to that cohort.

      Any dosage level in which 2 out of 6 subjects experience a MTD will be considered intolerable
      and the previous dose will be considered the P2Et maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose
      escalation will be terminated. The 3+3 design will be used monthly for the P2Et dose
      escalation (up to a maximum of 4.8 g/day).

      The participants will be followed-up until withdrawal of the protocol therapy. The
      participants removed from the protocol due to unacceptable adverse events will be followed-up
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
