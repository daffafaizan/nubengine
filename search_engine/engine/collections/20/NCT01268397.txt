      fixation with a volar plate with closed reduction and plaster treatment in elderly patients
      with a displaced Colles' fracture in order to test the null hypothesis that the
      patient-perceived result is equal after conservative or operative treatment. Secondary
      outcomes are objective physical measurements.
