      inflammation that contributes to the postoperative outcome. Anesthesia is known to effect
      perioperative stress response. Regional anesthesia modifies stress response through afferent
      blockage whereas general anesthesia affects the stress response via central modulation. High
      sensitive C-reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio are used for evaluation of
      inflammation. The degree of systemic inflammation has been determined by numerous pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines.The cytokines control the release of C -reactive protein (CRP)
      which is an acute phase reactant produced by the liver. CRP is a widely used marker of
      inflammation and tissue damage. High sensitive C -reactive protein (hs-CRP), is a more
      sensitive assay for detection of inflammation measured by particle-enhanced
      immunonephelometry . A rapid increase in hs-CRP may indicate inflammation and tissue damage .
      Another well-known indicator of inflammation is neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). NLR
      correlates strongly with elevated plasma levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokineS. The
      aim of this study was to document the value hs-CRP and NLR in perioperative stress response
      in two different anesthesia methods applied to term pregnant women undergoing elective
      ceserean section (C/S).
