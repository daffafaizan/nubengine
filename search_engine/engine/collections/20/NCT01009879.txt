    
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to identify early B cell bone marrow
      emigrants in the peripheral blood of adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving
      etanercept.

      Hypotheses: We believe that the peripheral blood of RA patients contain early B cell bone
      marrow emigrants. We believe that these early B cell bone marrow emigrants are induced by
      TNFÎ±.

      Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint of the study is quantification of CD34+/CD19+ early B
      cell bone marrow emigrants in the peripheral blood of subjects.

      Study Design: Open-label, One Arm, Phase IV study of 12 RA patients with active disease
      receiving etanercept.
