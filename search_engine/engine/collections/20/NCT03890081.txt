      various forms of chronic pain, including musculoskeletal pain. CSQ aims to evaluate the
      frequency and success of coping strategies with cognitive and behavioral pain. The validity
      and reliability of the questionnaire was tested and satisfactory results were obtained and it
      became a widely used tool in pain studies. The aim of this study was to translate and
      culturally adapt the original English version of the CSQ into Turkish version and to assess
      the validity and reliability of this instrument in patients with chronic musculoskeletal
      pain.
