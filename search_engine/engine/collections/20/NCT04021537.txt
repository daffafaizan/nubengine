      asleep are common issues. Sleep difficulties are common in disorders such as Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder. Current treatments for sleep difficulties are not effective for everyone.
      Better treatments are needed. In this study, the investigators are testing two nerve
      stimulation locations that may impact brain function in such a way that sleep is improved.
