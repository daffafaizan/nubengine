      industrialized countries. Multiple molecular pathways have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Currently, the treatment relies on
      neutralization of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor). However some patients have an
      incomplete response to anti-VEGF treatment. A recent study suggested the implication of the
      mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the formation of CNV.

      The study (of investigators) aim is to evaluate the concentation of metabolites of MR pathway
      in the blood and aqueous humor of patients with CNV and compared them with patients without
      CNV in order to increase our understanding of CNV pathogenesis and find potential biomarker
      of response to anti-VEGF treatment.
