      superior for prevention of cardiovascular events, previous data are not enough for the
      patients who have more than one risk factor and for anti-atherosclerotic effects of ARB. In
      Japan, there were only a few large-scale trials for cardiovascular disease prevention, and it
      has not been clarified whether the evidence in Western countries could be unqualifiedly
      applied to Japanese patients as a long-range strategy. The KYOTO HEART Study is to assess the
      add-on effect of valsartan, an Angiotensin-Receptor Blocker, on top of the conventional
      treatment in high risk patients with hypertension in terms of the morbidity and mortality.
