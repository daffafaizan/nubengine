      due to insufficient medical services. SCD patients often visit emergency department and need
      hospitalization when they suffer from severe pain; however, they manage most of painful
      episodes at home. Appropriate pain management at home is, therefore, crucial to improve their
      clinical course and quality of life. Laying-on-of-hands may be a good candidate for home care
      management, because family member(s) can become a practitioner of laying-on-of-hands without
      difficulty and administer it to their loved one as an initial treatment whenever necessary.
      There are no reports concerning the effectiveness of laying-on-of-hands for the outcomes of
      SCD patients, as far as we have investigated.
