      decreasing symptoms burden in chronic disease. On the other hand, no study has been conducted
      to determine the effects of progressive relaxation exercise and mindfulness meditation on
      dyspnea, fatigue and care dependency in patients with COPD. The present study investigates
      the effects of progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation in a single-site,
      3-arm, assessor-blinded randomized, controlled study of 65 COPD patients. Arm 1: meditation;
      Arm 2: relaxation; Arm 3: Control.The investigators hypothesize that Progressive muscle
      relaxation and mindfulness meditation will decrease the severity of dyspnea, fatigue and care
      dependency.
