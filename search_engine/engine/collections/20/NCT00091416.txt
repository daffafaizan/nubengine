      successful vaccine for HIV prevention. The VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP adenoviral vector vaccine used
      in this study was developed to stimulate strong virus-specific CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL) responses thought to be crucial in an effective preventive HIV vaccine. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP vaccine
      boost given to healthy, HIV uninfected individuals who participated in HVTN 052, which
      evaluated the VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP DNA plasmid vaccine. In that study, participants received
      either 3 injections of vaccine, 2 injections of vaccine and 1 injection of placebo, or 3
      injections of placebo over a 2-month period.

      This study will last one year. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive vaccine
      boost or placebo by intramuscular injection. The injections will be given 6 to 9 months after
      each participant's first HVTN 052 study injection, preferably as close to 6 months after the
      first HVTN 052 injection as possible. After a screening visit, study visits will occur at
      enrollment (when the injection will be given), at Week 2, and at Months 1, 3, 6, and 12.
      Blood collection, physical exam, and medication assessment will occur at every study visit;
      urine collection will occur at selected visits.
