    
      Opioid-related abuse and overdose represent a growing national epidemic in the United States.
      Clinician practice patterns play an important role: opioid prescriptions impact the
      likelihood that patients will misuse or become dependent on these medications, with longer
      prescriptions leading to greater sustained use. In this study, we will evaluate a Sutter
      Health System quality improvement initiative using monthly individual audit feedback and/or
      monthly peer comparison feedback to clinicians to change opioid prescribing patterns. In
      partnership with Sutter Health System, this will be conducted using randomization to evaluate
      its effect. We will also conduct a process evaluation to understand factors associated with
      better or worse performance at the clinician level.
