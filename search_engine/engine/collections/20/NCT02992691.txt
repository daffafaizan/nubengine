      crossover design study in healthy participants. This study will evaluate the dose response of
      three experimental toothpastes (test product 1, test product 2 and test product 3) to remove
      plaque after a single brushing, compared to a positive control and negative control
      dentifrice. Plaque removal efficacy will be measured by Turesky modification of Quigley Hein
      Plaque Index (TPI).
