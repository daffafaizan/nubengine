      response rates to relapse chemotherapy: various chemotherapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel,
      liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, docetaxel, platinum, etoposide, ifosfamide, gemcitabine,
      and vinorelbine are available but result in response rates of 7-40%. Unfortunately, relapse
      therapy is not curative and treatment is only palliative. Recently two phase II trials
      demonstrated that anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab alone or in combination with
      chemotherapy in women with recurrent disease had response rates ranging from 16-24% with an
      acceptable toxicity profile. However, resistance can develop to VEGF inhibition. Therefore
      other novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as BIBF 1120, should be evaluated in the treatment
      of ovarian cancer.
