      ointment affect people who have breast cancer, and what impact that may have on those who are
      at risk of developing breast cancer in the future. The investigators hope that what they
      learn will lead to the development of a new medication for the treatment and prevention of
      breast cancer.

      Abnormal breast lesions can be benign, premalignant or malignant. These lesions are being
      targeted by the topical calcipotriene ointment. The investigators aim to determine whether
      this topical treatment can stimulate the immune cells against the breast lesion in ways that
      would prevent its recurrence after surgical removal.

      Calcipotriene ointment is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      psoriasis, but calcipotriene ointment is not approved by the FDA to treat breast cancer.
