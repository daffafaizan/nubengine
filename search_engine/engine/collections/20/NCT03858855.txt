      I. To determine if aromatherapy, specifically inhaled essential oil, is beneficial for side
      effects related to cancer treatments involving chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or
      immunotherapy administered intravenously.

      II. To describe the effect of inhaled ginger essential oil, German chamomile essential oil,
      and bergamot essential oil on nausea and anxiety of patients receiving chemotherapy, targeted
      therapy, and/or immunotherapy administered intravenously.

      III. To describe the effect of decreased levels of nausea and/or anxiety on levels of
      appetite and/or fatigue.

      IV. To evaluate the acceptability of using a personal inhalation bottle for inhalation of
      essential oils.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients inhale 7 drops of bergamot essential oil using a personalized inhalation
      bottle three times daily (TID) (morning, midday, and evening) for up to 7 days. Patients also
      use a journal to document symptoms, time of inhalation, and medication use TID for up to 7
      days.

      GROUP II: Patients inhale 7 drops of chamomile essential oil and complete journal as in group
      I.

      GROUP III: Patients inhale 7 drops of ginger essential oil and complete journal as in group
      I.

      GROUP IV (CONTROL): Patients inhale 7 drops of almond essential oil and complete journal as
