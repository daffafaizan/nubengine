      procedures in the U.S. in 2009. Many surgeons are moving away from full thickness corneal
      transplantation, also called penetrating keratoplasty (PK), because of risks involving
      rejection, irregular astigmatism and wound dehiscence. They are moving towards partial
      thickness (lamellar) transplantations of either the anterior or posterior (endothelial)
      layers, which can reduce these risks.

      The femtosecond laser has been used to create excellent tongue-in-groove junctions between
      the graft and host in full thickness PK.1 This technique, called IEK (Intralase-enabled
      keratoplasty), has now become a standard surgical procedure. The tongue-in-groove junction
      achieved at the circumferential edge of the graft and host leads to a continuous smooth
      anterior surface and strong wound healing.

      The new technique is called dovetail LALAK. In this technique, the femtosecond laser is used
      to create a 31% anterior lamellar graft with dove tailed side cuts. It is also used to create
      a shallow anterior lamellar dissection and beveled side cuts on the recipient cornea to match
      with the dovetail graft.

      In the new technique, the depth of the graft and donor dissections will be guided by OCT
      measurements. The proposed trial will test if the new technique can reproducibly achieve good
      visual outcomes without the risk of rejection. The outcome of the LALAK procedure will be
      compared to that of IEK.
