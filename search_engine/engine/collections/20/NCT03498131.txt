      6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SMT) collected for 24 hours in two twelve hour sessions. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the change in serum morning melatonin level. In addition, quality
      of life (QOL) measures will be assessed including the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS),
      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
      Clinical objectives include the number of relapses during the trial and a change in the
      Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) & Performance Scales (PS).

      The pilot study is a one-year randomized, rater- and dose-blinded trial evaluating the
      potential role of melatonin in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis who have been
      taking a stable dose of an oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) for at least 6 months. The
      oral DMTs include dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide. Thirty subjects with
      relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled at Providence Neurological Specialties in Portland, Oregon.
