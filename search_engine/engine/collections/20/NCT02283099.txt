      vaccine.

      An outbreak due to the Ebola Zaire (ZEBOV) strain of unprecedented magnitude and scope and
      with a high mortality continues to spread across West Africa. No vaccine is currently
      licensed.

      The specific opportunity at hand with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) is to achieve long-lasting
      protective immunity to ZEBOV on a time scale of weeks in humans upon a single-shot
      vaccination, offering a discrete benefit over prime-boost vaccination protocols. The current
      outbreak represents a global health emergency and the need for access to therapeutic
      intervention and vaccines is paramount.

      The vaccine investigated in this study might provide a critical tool to suppress future
      out-breaks of EVD in areas at risk.

      This study is 1 of 4 clinical trials currently conducted as part of the WHO-led VEBCON
      consortium, aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) vaccine
      candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.
