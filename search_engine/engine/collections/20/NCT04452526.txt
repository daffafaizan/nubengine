      I. Test the effectiveness of a multi-level intervention (MLI) directed at clinics, providers,
      and patients (parents of children aged 11-12) to improve HPV vaccine initiation and
      completion in health systems in four Appalachian states (Kentucky [KY], Ohio [OH], West
      Virginia [WV,] and Virginia [VA]) among children aged 11-12 and assess the effectiveness of
      the intervention program among subgroups, e.g., females versus (vs) males.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess sustainability of the intervention. II. Assess cost impacts of the intervention
      III. Assess changes in clinic practices that occur as a result of the intervention in terms
      of staff responsibilities for the vaccination process and reducing missed opportunities for
      vaccination.

      IV. Assess whether interventions focused on 13-26 year olds increases catch-up vaccination.

      V. Examine changes in knowledge and attitudes of providers via educational session pre-post
      surveys.

      VI. Satisfaction with the intervention at the multiple levels.

      OUTLINE: Health systems are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EARLY INTERVENTION): Health systems receive educational materials consisting of
      posters, brochures and table tents. Providers complete survey about HPV knowledge,
      participate in educational session over 1 hour and receive educational handouts on the HPV
      vaccine. Patients receive educational materials about HPV vaccine and reminder letters for
      HPV vaccination.

      ARM II (DELAYED INTERVENTION): Health systems, providers, and patients receive usual care for
      12 months, then receive multi-level intervention as in Arm I.
