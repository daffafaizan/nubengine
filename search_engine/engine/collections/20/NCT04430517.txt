      Unfortunately, decreases in NAD+ levels are associated with normal aging, and also with
      numerous diseases such as AD. Accumulating evidence suggests that NR can enhance
      mitochondrial function and help slow or reverse these age-related abnormalities. Numerous
      preclinical and clinical studies have been performed using NR and related compounds to boost
      NAD+ level in human subjects with various diseases or animal models. However, no studies to
      date have investigated in vivo metabolic and bioenergetic changes (target engagement)
      associated with NR supplementation. In this project, we aim to investigate the
      neurobiological mechanisms and clinical effects of NR in patients with MCI and mild AD using
      in vivo novel neuroimaging techniques.
