      Gaziantep Cengiz Gokcek Maternity Hospital, Gaziantep Turkey and Near East University,
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mersin, Turkey comprise the study group. The control
      group consists of age-matched healthy women who delivered in last 2 months.

      Dorsal clitoral artery Doppler examinations will be performed in both case and control groups
      regularly in the postoperative period in 3rd and 6th months, in order to evaluate the
      possible effects of BIIAL on clitoral blood flow. Ultrasound is performed using a Mindray
      DC-7 Ultrasound System (China) equipped with linear 7.5 MHz probe. Each woman was scanned in
      the gynecological position. The translabial probe is placed on the clitoris sagittally and
      transversely without applying any pressure force. After identifying the clitoral artery using
      colour flow mapping, the Doppler probe is positioned over the vessel and at least three
      sequential Doppler wave forms are obtained. The following parameters are analysed: peak
      systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), pulsatile index
      (PI) and systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio. The measurements are performed by the same
      radiologist.

      Finally a Female Sexual Fantasy Questionnaire (FSFQ) is performed.
