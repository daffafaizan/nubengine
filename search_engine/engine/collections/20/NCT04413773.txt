      that in times of increasing economic interests of the hospitals and the resulting necessity
      of economic working methods in the medical system, less time remains for human interaction.
      This creates areas of conflict, such as the patient's right to information regarding the time
      available to medical personnel. This in turn leads to significant stress factors in patients
      who are involved in the treatment and mostly on the communication level, such as "Missing
      information", "misunderstood visit", "missing partnership relationship" refer to what is
      reflected in patient satisfaction and fears. Studies show how important good perioperative
      psychosocial care is for reducing these circumstances in children, also and especially in the
      context of further development. The drug options for calming and reducing anxiety are already
      known, but there are also increasing numbers of non-drug approaches to reducing anxiety and
      stress in the literature. Painting therapy and clinic clowns are examples. However, access to
      such resources is limited and costs are permanently high. New technologies, e.g. mobile
      phones and tablets, with the associated media, increasingly finding their way into our
      society, are now inexpensive to buy and have become an integral part of most households. Such
      devices and media are increasingly used in clinical studies and patient care. Their use is
      tested extensively in modern medicine, e.g. to avoid unnecessary postoperative consultations
      in the emergency room or to increase cognitive learning for children. Even small children can
      use and understand these media early on. Videos are one of the most common media already
      understood by the smallest patients.
