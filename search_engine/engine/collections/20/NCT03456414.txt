      weeks of virtual reality exercise during hemodialysis and will carry on with a control period
      of 12 weeks. The second group will start with a control period of 12 weeks (no exercise) and
      will carry on with a virtual reality exercise period of 12 weeks.

      The virtual reality exercise will undertake up to 30 minutes of exercise. After warming up,
      participants will play to an adapted 'treasure hunt' game. Their legs movements will be the
      players projected into an individual tv that will give them feedback regarding their
      achievements. The aim of the game will be to achieve the higher possible score.They will move
      their legs to pick up coins and to avoid bombs. An adapted Kinect technology will be used for
      the game development. The exercise session will end-up with a cool-down period that will
      include simple lower limb stretching exercises.
