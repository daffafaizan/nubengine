      between the supply and demand for oxygen by cardiac myocytes. Epidemiological studies
      indicate that mental stress ischemia is common, occurring in 20-25% of patients with coronary
      artery disease (CAD) and portends a poor prognosis. The underlying mechanisms are thought to
      involve stress-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system and associated effects on
      cardiovascular function. But how neurobiological and cardiovascular factors interact to
      generate mental stress ischemia is unknown. Furthermore, patients with major depressive
      disorder, bipolar disorder, and other stress-related psychiatric conditions have elevated
      rates of cardiovascular co-morbidities, including sudden cardiac death, yet mental stress
      ischemia has not been studied extensively in these psychiatric populations. The purpose of
      project is to answer fundamental questions about the mechanisms underlying mental stress
      ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, mood disorders, or both, and to identify
      potential biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors associated with this condition.

      To achieve this goal, investigators will use cutting-edge cardiovascular and functional
      neuroimaging tools to study mental stress ischemia in a carefully controlled laboratory
      setting in subjects recruited from four patient populations: 1) patients who recently
      sustained a myocardial infarction; 2) patients undergoing non-emergent invasive coronary
      angiography (with and without known coronary artery disease); 3) patients with a diagnosis of
      major depressive disorder; and 4) patients with a diagnosis of bipolar 1 or bipolar 2
      disorder.
