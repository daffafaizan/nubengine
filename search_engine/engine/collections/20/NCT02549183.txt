      cord to achieve maximum reduction in neuropathic back pain as measured by average Numerical
      rating Scale.

      Twenty patients who suffer from back more than leg pain will be recruited into the study once
      they have satisfactory pain relief from both low and high frequency stimulations. Each
      patient will then receive stimulation at four different frequencies for 2-3 weeks in a random
      and blinded order. Their pain scores and function will be assessed using a variety of
      different tools. The data will then be used to estimate the optimal frequency.
