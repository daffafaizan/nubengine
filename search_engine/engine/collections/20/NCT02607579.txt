      pain management following total knee arthroplasty is imperative to facilitate early
      ambulation, mobilization and rehabilitation. The postoperative pain regimen should enhance
      functional recovery in addition to providing efficient analgesia with minimal side effects.
      To manage postoperative pain effectively, multimodal analgesia including acetaminophen,
      Toradol, Solu-Medrol, opioids and local anesthetics are used. Periarticular infiltration
      performed intra-operatively combined with ultrasound guided adductor-canal peripheral nerve
      blocks are effective in reducing pain following a TKA without causing quadriceps motor block
      which can impede mobilization. There are no published trials that the investigators could
      find to date, comparing adductor canal block with a single dose Exparel and adductor canal
      block with standard ropivacaine.

      A liposome is a manufactured spherical lipid vesicle that can be used to slowly release a
      drug thereby extending its duration of action. Exparel is such a compound that slowly
      releases bupivacaine. Local anesthetics block the conduction of all excitable tissue in a
      dose related fashion. The first tissues that are affected are nerves, which make these drugs
      of choice in neural block. Their local adverse effects include neurovascular manifestations
      are prolonged numbness, tingling, feeling of "pins and needles" or strange sensations. These
      effects are reversed with time. There are no additional potential risks or adverse effects
      due to the procedures or drugs being administered. The procedure is well established and the
      local anesthetics have a history of long term use in humans.
