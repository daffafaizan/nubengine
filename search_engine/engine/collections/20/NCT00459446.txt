      visualized using available imaging technologies. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      angiography (CE-MRA), X-ray computed tomography angiography (CTA), and invasive radiocontrast
      digital subtraction angiography (DSA) all rely on blood flow within arteries that are not
      totally occluded. Where the arterial lumen is totally occluded, contrast does not enter and
      the artery remains invisible. As a result, physicians have difficulty identifying a pathway
      or trajectory for catheter devices in order to improve blood flow using angioplasty.

      Gadofosveset, an albumin-binding MRI contrast agent that is commercially available outside
      the United States, may accumulate in the walls of occluded arteries through a mechanism that
      is not known.

      The goal of this protocol is to determine whether gadofosveset has value in planning catheter
      trajectories in totally occluded peripheral arteries. We propose to study the gadofosveset
      contrast enhancement patterns in occluded peripheral artery segments in up to 20 patients
      with known occluded iliac, femoral, and shoulder arteries being considered for catheter-based
      treatment.

      This research may have value in planning and conducting minimally invasive treatments using
      conventional X-ray guidance and possibly in the future using investigational real-time MRI
      guidance.
