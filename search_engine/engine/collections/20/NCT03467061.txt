      blood pressure. With aging, our ability to make nitric oxide gets worse and our blood
      pressure tends to increase. We can help the body produce more nitric oxide by supplementing
      the diet with vegetables, such as beetroot juice, which contains high amounts of nitrate.
      This has been shown to improve blood flow and blood pressure. The bacteria inside our mouths
      play an important role in helping convert the ingested nitrate to nitric oxide. The reason
      for this study is to find out whether there are differences in oral bacteria between young
      and older adults, and how the oral bacterial community and blood flow and blood pressure
      might change when diet is supplemented with natural, nitrate-rich beetroot juice and when we
      use antibacterial mouthwash. This study will help us understand how the bacteria inside our
      mouths might be useful for keeping us healthy.
