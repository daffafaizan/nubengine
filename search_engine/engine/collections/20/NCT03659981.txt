      allowing to a better understanding of its origins and its impact and disease severity. This
      study is a preliminary longitudinal study to precisely depict the kinetic of grey matter
      damage and the links with disease aggravation. Thirty MS patients without time and spatial
      dissemination criteria (only one symptomatic MRI lesion detected) but with oligoclonal bands
      detected on cerebro spinal fluid analysis will be included for a monocentric transversal MRI
      study at 7T to assess grey matter injury. Clinical and neuropsychological assessments will be
      performed in the population the same day of a multi-parametric MRI. A longitudinal clinical
      and MRI follow up will be performed during 2 years.
