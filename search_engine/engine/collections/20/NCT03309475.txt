      also show a lower ability to recognize, understand and benefit from social stimuli (i.e.,
      deficits in social cognition) than their pairs. Both deficits underlie the general functional
      impairment found across non-affective psychotic syndromes. Since currently available
      pharmacological strategies have not proven themselves effective in addressing this matter,
      new psychotherapeutic approaches should be developed. Investigators' main hypothesis is that
      a mindfulness-based social cognition group training (SocialMind) will improve social and
      general functioning, and that this improvement will be higher in the SocialMind than in the
      psychoeducation group. Given the association between oxidative stress and cognitive
      functioning, a relationship between oxidative stress biomarkers and intervention-related
      variables is also expected.

      A research team with more than ten mental health professionals and many collaborators will
      carry and oversee the assessment sessions. A Pharmacology Department will analyse the
      biological samples. Regulated-trained, well-experienced clinicians will design and administer
      both interventions. The whole team will take part in the process of scientific publication
      and results dissemination.
