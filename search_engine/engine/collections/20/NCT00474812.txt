      I. Determine the overall survival, including median survival, of patients with metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effects of this drug on quantities of circulating tumor cells in these
      patients.

      II. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine pre-
      and post-drug fat-free mass and gait speed in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Evaluate the toxicity of this drug in these patients. V. Evaluate objective response rate
      in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and during days 25-31. Samples are analyzed for
      quantification of circulating tumor cells. Patients also undergo analysis of fat-free mass
      and gait speed at baseline and at 1, 2, and 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
