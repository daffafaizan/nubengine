    
      A 3-month parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Eligible participants
      will be randomized to either the Low-carb High-fat breakfast (LCHF, n=41) or a low-fat
      "standard care" control breakfast (CTL, n=41), to be consumed daily for a period of 3 months.

      Due to COVID-19 pandemic, this study was adapted to be conducted remotely through
      video/telephone conference meetings between participants and study staff, along with mailing
      of study materials before and after the intervention for remote data collection.

      Each group will be provided with a menu of 8 LCHF breakfasts or 8 CTL breakfasts from which
      to choose each morning. Breakfast options (designed by a registered dietitian) will be
      controlled in macronutrient content and calories (~400-500 kcal), but allow for personal
      preference and autonomy to promote adherence.
