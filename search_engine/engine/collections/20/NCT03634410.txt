      the labour force by prolonging working life, i.e. increasing retirement age. The present
      study investigates push and stay mechanisms for labor market attachment among older workers
      or people who have recently retired. The study is a questionnaire survey, which is already
      funded. The ambition is to apply for further funding to do a cohort that is repeated every
      2-3 years, as well as long-term register follow-up in Danish national registers about health
      and work.

      The study has 4 target groups:

        1. employed

        2. unemployed

        3. early retirement

        4. disability pension

      The questionnaire survey is sent to 30,000 Danish citizens and contains the following 14
      areas:

        1. Basic information (demographics, employment status etc.)

        2. Broad overview of factors that may influence labor market attachment (health, working
           conditions, economic factors)

        3. Role of the workplace

        4. Age-discrimination

        5. Economy

        6. Specific questions about the possibility for 'early retirement' among employed and
           unemployed

        7. Gradual retirement (e.g. possibility for reduced time or responsibility)

        8. Competencies and continuing education/training of skills

        9. Return-to-work

       10. New technologies at the workplace

       11. Job satisfaction and well-being

       12. Working environment (physical, psychosocial etc.)

       13. Lifestyle

       14. Health and functional capacity

      The study is supported by a grant from TrygFonden
