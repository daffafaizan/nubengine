      preservation. Fifteen test patients will receive the flapless technique with an intrasocket
      cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial overlay graft using a bovine
      xenograft plus Alloderm GBR. The positive control group of fifteen patients will receive the
      flap technique with an intrasocket cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial
      overlay graft using a bovine xenograft plus Alloderm GBR. Approximately, four months
      post-surgery, a trephine core will be taken from the grafted site immediately prior to
      implant placement and submitted for histologic processing.
