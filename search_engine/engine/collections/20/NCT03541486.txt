    
      This phase 2 study is designed to determine the efficacy of adding pharmacological ascorbate
      (vitamin C) to standard chemoradiation. The ascorbate is infused before, during, and after
      the external beam radiation therapy treatment. Each ascorbate infusion is 75 grams (roughly
      the same amount of vitamin C from 1,000 oranges).

      For patients eligible for this trial, standard treatment for their cancer includes radiation
      therapy combined with weekly gemcitabine (a chemotherapy).

      Participants will:

        -  decide if they want to receive the investigational treatment (pharmacological ascorbate
           plus gemcitabine plus radiation) or standard treatment only (gemcitabine plus radiation)

        -  receive pharmacological ascorbate intravenously ascorbate during their daily radiation
           therapy treatments, if they choose the investigational treatment.

        -  receive gemcitabine (a chemotherapy) once a week for up to 6 weeks of therapy (all
           participants)

        -  receive radiation treatments are given once a day, Monday through Friday (all
           participants).

        -  have routine doctor's visits and be asked about any side effects they are experiencing
           (all participants).

      This is a phase 2 study to determine the effect, if any, adding pharmacological ascorbate
      will have on standard therapy for pancreatic cancer. The study will also record any side
      effects of adding ascorbate to standard therapy. Once the patient completes radiation, the
      ascorbate infusions are also completed. However, the patient will need to return for regular
      follow-up care at University of Iowa.
