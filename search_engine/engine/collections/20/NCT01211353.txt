      both the veterans themselves and those with whom they interact. The objective of this
      research is to better understand how to reduce hazardous drinking among this group by
      assessing the effectiveness of a low-cost, computer-delivered preventative program. It is
      hypothesized that an intervention that provides personalized feedback about drinking
      behaviors will be more effective than an education-only control condition at reducing alcohol
      use and negative alcohol-related consequences.
