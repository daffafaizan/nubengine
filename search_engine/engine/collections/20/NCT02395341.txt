    
      Eligible women are asked to complete a structured interview, questionnaires, a monthly
      menstrual diary, a brief physical examination, a blood test, and an abdominal or pelvic
      ultrasound at baseline and at 3 month intervals following start of chemotherapy through 6
      months post end of treatment.

      Within subject changes in continuous variables (hormones, urinary isoprostane levels, ovarian
      volume, AFC) will be compared using paired t-tests (nonparametric tests as appropriate).
      Non-Gaussian-distributed variables will be logarithmically transformed prior to analysis. In
      general, changes from baseline to every 3 month assessment will be compared individually as
      well as changes from baseline to post treatment. In addition, regression models for repeated
      measures will be used to describe the pattern of change in these outcomes over time.
      Additional models will be constructed to adjust for potential confounding variables including
      age, chemotherapy type, dose and duration of treatment, radiation treatment, gonadotropin
      releasing hormone agonist use, and hormone use. Finally, regression models will be used to
      evaluate the association between changes in urinary isoprostane levels over the study with
      changes in endocrine measures.
