      monitoring of inflammatory arthritis disease progression with 1.0T peripheral magnetic
      resonance imaging (pMRI) of the 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints of the worst-effected
      or dominant hand at baseline compared to conventional radiography of both hands and wrists,
      or standard of care, alters the frequency of pharmacological treatment escalation at two
      years. A sample size of 186 (62 per group) is required to determine mean differences in the
      rate of pharmacological treatment escalation between the three groups with 90% power at a 5%
      level of significance, assuming a 5% spontaneous remission rate, 15% missing data, and 5%
      annual attrition.
