    
      This is a Prospective pilot study that will be performed at the Fetal Care Unit at Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital.

      Ninety pregnant women will be recruited from the the Fetal Care Unit who will fulfill the
      inclusion criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study.

      All cases will be subjected to:

        1. Full history taking including patient's age, parity, last menstrual period, estimated
           gestational age by dates, past history of medical disorders, clinical examinations
           (General and abdominal).

        2. Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be done for all cases
           for assessment of fetal femur length .

      The FL at Two-Dimensional Ultrasound (Gold standard) will be made from the center of the 'U'
      shape at each end of the bone.

      The FL at Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be measured by Pressing Five-Dimensional
      Ultrasound long bone Button to extract Fetal Long Bones automatically.

      The estimation of gestational age by femur length by Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and
      Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be compared to gestational age calculated by accurate dates
      of the last menstrual period.
