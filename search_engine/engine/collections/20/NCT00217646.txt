      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib when administered in two different
      schedules in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes,
      or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the biologic
      effect of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, dose-escalation phase I study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib once or twice daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral sorafenib once or twice daily on days 1-14.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission or partial
      remission after 6 months may continue therapy at the discretion of the principal
      investigator.

      In both arms, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 patients are treated at
      the MTD.
