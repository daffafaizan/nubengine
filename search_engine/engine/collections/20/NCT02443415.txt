    
      Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and serious medical problem. Most cases occur when
      patients forget or stop insulin injections. Some patients require frequent admissions to the
      hospital with DKA after stopping insulin. Many patients do not know why they stop insulin
      therapy. The investigators will test if patients with one or more episodes of DKA have poor
      memory and brain changes that may lead to poor management.

      In this study, the investigators will perform memory testing and brain images in subjects
      with initial DKA episode and subjects with more than 3 episodes of DKA. The results will be
      compared to subjects with diabetes and no history of DKA and healthy (non-diabetic) subjects.
      Each subject with DKA will have an MRI and cognitive testing done shortly after hospital
      discharge, 1 month, and 3 months after hospital discharge. Diabetic subjects without DKA and
      healthy controls will only come in for a single baseline visit and have a MRI and cognitive
      testing done.
