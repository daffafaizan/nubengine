      Group A: intravenous infusion of paclitaxel (albumin binding) 260 mg/m2, intravenous
      infusion, carboplatin area under curve ï¼ˆAUC) = 6, intravenous infusion, starting from
      randomization, once every 3 weeks, for 4-6 cycles,or progression, or intolerance, or deth or
      start a new anti-tumor treatment, whichever occurs first.

      Group B: paclitaxel injection 175 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, carboplatin AUC= 6,
      intravenous infusion, starting from randomization, once every 3 weeks, for 4-6 cycles, or
      progression, or intolerance,or death or start a new anti-tumor treatment, whichever occurs
      first.The primary end point is overall response rate (ORR),the secondary endpoint is
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and Quality of Life (QOL).
