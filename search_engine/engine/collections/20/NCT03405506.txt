      calculation of the pressure drop in the vessel. 3D coronary models can be reconstructed based
      on two angiographic projections to obtain the geometric parameters, including vascular
      diameter or cross-sectional area. According to the lesion stenosis, vessel curvature, conical
      geometry and reference lumen characteristics, pressure drop can be calculated in real time
      based on its relationship with blood flow. There is no need for pressure wire and adenosine /
      ATP induced maximum hyperemia compared with FFR.

      The FAVOR Pilot Study and FAVOR II China Study showed promising results for diagnostic
      accuracy in consecutive patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy of QFR in specific tandem
      lesions needs further investigation. Furthermore, using the virtual stent technology to
      accurately assess the culprit lesion and choose the optimal treatment is significant in
      precisely guiding PCI surgery.
