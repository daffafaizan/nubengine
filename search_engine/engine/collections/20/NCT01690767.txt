    
      An estimated 10% of children 0-24 months of age that present to the emergency department (ED)
      with fever and/or vomiting have a urinary tract infection (UTI). An accurate diagnosis of a
      UTI ensures timely and appropriate treatment given to reduce the risk of renal scarring,
      which is the greatest in this age group. To ensure diagnostic accuracy, urethral
      catheterization is the preferred method to obtain a urine sample from a young child. In
      contrast to adults, most children do not receive local analgesia for urethral
      catheterization; despite growing recognition that children experience avoidable pain and
      discomfort during invasive procedures.

      Following informed consent, participants will be randomized by block randomization in a
      concealed fashion to receive either topical and intraurethral 2% lidocaine or standard of
      care using a computerized random number generator. The research nurse will access a
      sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelope that will contain the participant's group
      assignment. No adjunctive analgesic methods will be used. A research pharmacist will prepare
      2% lidocaine gel in a 3 cc syringe attached to a 24 gauge angiocath. Children < 7 kg and > 7
      kg will receive 1 cc and 1.5 cc, respectively (2).

      The entire procedure will be videotaped and participants pain will be scored using a brow
      bulging score and visual analogue scale by independent, blinded raters.
