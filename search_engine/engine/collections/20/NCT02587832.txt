      Success to wean with 24 hours to extubate. 4) Parental written informed consent for
      participation in the study obtained on admission into the hospital or prior to delivery.

      Exclusion criteria were: 1) Evidence of severe birth asphyxia. 2) Known genetic or
      chromosomal disorders. 3) Infants delivered to mothers with ruptured membranes of more than
      three weeks duration. 4) Potentially life-threatening conditions unrelated to prematurity. 5)
      Participation in another clinical trial of any placebo, drug, biological, or device conducted
      under the provisions of a protocol.

      Randomization A computer-generated block-randomization sequence with random block sizes was
      used. Infants who were part of multiple births underwent individual randomization. Clinicians
      opened consecutively numbered, sealed, brown envelopes immediately before extubation to
      determine the study-group assignment.
