      conditions. It affects the development and the function of the immune system (Th2, Th1 or
      Th17) by bacterial protein expression and by the composition of the bacterial population.

      Psoriasis is an immune related dermal disease. The trigger for this disease is currently
      unknown but, it is possible that intestinal bacteria are a factor in its development.

      Study design:

      Participants will be divided into 3 groups:

        -  Psoriasis patients treated with topical medications

        -  Psoriasis patients treated with IV or sub-cutaneous medications (e.g biological
           medications)

        -  Healthy participants (control group) Bacterial genomic DNA will be extracted from stool
           samples of participants. The intestinal bacterial populations will be compared in order
           to examine whether there are differences between the groups.
