      and issued a "call to action" to develop bone-health plans that:

        1. improve nutrition,

        2. increase health literacy and,

        3. increase physical activity.

      The purpose of this study was to use a comparative effective research model to compare
      6-month changes in bone mineral density (BMD)in two study groups. Both followed the same bone
      health plan that contained the three components listed above with the same plant-source
      calcium supplement, but enhanced with different levels of calcium, vitamin D3, vitamin K and
      magnesium.
