      to one of 2 groups. The supplementation doses 20mg/d (Group 1), and placebo (Group 2) will be
      consumed daily by the participant for a 4-month period. Pre-test and follow-up measures of
      lutein status and cognitive function will be assessed at baseline and at 4-month follow-up
      via laboratory visits.
