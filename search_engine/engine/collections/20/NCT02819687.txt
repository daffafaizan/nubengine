      po fasting. Each cohort of 8 subjects (6 RDX5791, 2 placebo) received a diet standardized fro
      Na+ content wile in the clinical pharmacology unit (CPU).

      The PK data from the 50-mg dose and the safety data from the 150-mg dose of the SAD study
      were evaluated prior to proceeding with the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) phase. Doses of
      RDX5791 are 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg administered once daily po fasting. Four cohorts of 10
      subjects each (8 RDX5791, 2 placebo) received a diet standardized for Na+ content while in
      the CPU.

      Safety assessments including clinical assessment and vital signs, clinical laboratory
      evaluations, ECGs, and AE monitoring were performed at regular intervals. Plasma was
      collected at regular intervals for PK analysis. The PD assessment included stool frequency
      and consistency, as well as changes in urinary Na+ excretion. All bowel movements were
      collected and analyzed for Na+ content outside this study protocol.
