      infection will have significantly improved proteinuria and eGFR after viral eradication with
      12 weeks of treatment Harvoni (LDV/SOF). This trial data will serve as the basis to support
      further study of LDV/SOF in patients with early CKD. Slowing progression of CKD is a critical
      goal, as the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD and end stage renal disease
      (ESRD) places significant health burden on patients and tremendous costs on our health-care
      system.
