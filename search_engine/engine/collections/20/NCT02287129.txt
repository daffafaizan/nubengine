      clinically-topographically divided into subtypes I-III according to the Siewert
      classification and show an increased incidence. Neoadjuvant and/or perioperative chemotherapy
      or preoperative radiochemotherapy is well established in the management of AEG. However, a
      significant number of patients do not respond to preoperative chemotherapy, suffering from
      toxicity and facing a worse outcome due to lower R0 resection rates. Previous results from
      the MUNICON-1 and MUNICON-2 trials have shown that PET-based therapy individualization can be
      successfully integrated in neoadjuvant treatment algorithms.

      Tumor-free resection edges (R0) constitute the greatest prognostic advantage in terms of
      overall survival. However, the R0 resection rates for patients who, according to early
      metabolic response evaluation, have not responded to the chemotherapy, have not been
      satisfactory, even after conversion to an - albeit moderate - radiochemotherapy in the
      MUNICON-2 trial. Thus, this patient population (so-called non responders) so far lack a
      beneficial neoadjuvant therapy modality.

      Based on these results, the primary goal of MEMORI study is to evaluate the R0 resection rate
      for patients with metabolically (ie, according to PET criteria) chemotherapy-resistant
      locally advanced AEG, who receive an intensified neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (INRCT).
      Secondary it is planned to investigate molecular and metabolic biomarkers in relation to
      their predictive and prognostic value by correlating them with histopathologic responses and
      clinical outcome in an exploratory approach.
