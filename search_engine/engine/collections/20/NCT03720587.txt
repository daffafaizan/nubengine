      outside of the hip. There is growing evidence to suggest that psychological barriers to
      recovery are present in patients with peripheral pain. The experiences and beliefs of
      patients suffering with GTPS are unknown. This study aims to explore the experiences, beliefs
      and expectations of patients with GTPS, using semi-structured interviews to inform the
      development of interventions for evaluation in future research.
