      aspects of surgical training and practice in the developed world 1, 2. In contrast,
      lower-middle-income countries like Pakistan lack awareness and strategies to counteract GD,
      which manifests as a lack of females in leadership and academic positions, and pay
      inequities. GD often occurs insidiously, as a result of complex interplay between societal
      norms, gender stereotypes and learned behaviors. Thus, our study identifies how GD is
      perceived and reported by surgeons in Pakistan.
