    
      In order to examine sympathetic nervous system function in neurocardiological disorders and
      catecholaminergic effects of dietary manipulations or neuropsychiatric drugs, the protocol
      calls for evaluations of the kinetics of 3H-norepinephrine or 3H-epinephrine in patients with
      hypertension, dysautonomias, or disorders thought to involve abnormal catecholaminergic
      function, and in normotensive normal volunteers. Apparent spillover and clearance rates are
      estimated based on the norepinephrine or epinephrine concentration during the infusion and
      their steady-state specific activities, under resting conditions and in response to
      physiological or pharmacological manipulations thought to affect sympathetic outflows.
