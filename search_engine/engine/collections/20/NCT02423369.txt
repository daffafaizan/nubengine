      neurodevelopmental outcome, compared to general population. The reasons may be complex, and
      patients at risk are unknown. Brain growth and central nervous system formation are extremely
      active in neonates and infants. Metabolic or circulatory derangement may have negative
      influence on the developing brain. Disease and perioperative period, both may further put
      this population at risk for physiological abnormalities. Near infrared spectroscopy was shown
      to be a convenient method for monitoring of cerebral tissue oxygenation during surgery.

      The great majority of anesthetics and sedative drugs, used in perioperative period, were
      shown to cause neuronal apoptosis in experimental animals. Some studies found that
      neurological marker S-100B increased in cerebrospinal fluid and blood immediately following
      anesthesia in animals. Several clinical studies supported this founding in children following
      cardiac and general surgery.

      The aim of this study is to assess the dynamics of S-100B protein pre- and during 72 hours
      after surgery in neonates and infants aged 1-93 days, operated for
      abdominal/thoracic/urologic malformations/disease. As S-100B in blood may have extracranial
      sources, we simultaneously assess other neuronal marker Neuron-specific Enolase.
