      incidence of 7 per 1000 exposure. After LAS, residual symptoms may persist leading to chronic
      ankle instability (CAI). This instability is believed to arise from dysfunctional postural
      control, defective proprioception, weak muscles, or reduced ankle range of motion (ROM).Thus,
      assessment of postural control is essential for proper clinical decision-making and treatment
      selection.

      With advances in technology, smartphone has been introduced as an assessment tool for the
      musculoskeletal system. For example, it was used in assessment of ROM and mobility in stroke
      patients and frail elderly conditions. Further, it was used to assess balance and falling
      risk in those population. In addition, it was used to assess balance in healthy and
      participants with chronic ankle sprain. These studies proved that smartphone is a valid and
      reliable tool that is light in weight and inexpensive. Yet, these studies have some
      methodological concerns. For example, the application was not validated against gold standard
      or was validated only in healthy volunteers rather than in patients with musculoskeletal
      dysfunction. Further, a few of these studies did not establish the application discriminative
      validity between patients and healthy controls. Thus, this study will try to answer the
      following question: "Is smartphone application a valid and reliable tool to assess balance in
      patients with CAI compared to gold standards?
