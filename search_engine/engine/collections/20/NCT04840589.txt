    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety/tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the BET
      inhibitor (BETi) BET Bromodomain Inhibitor ZEN-3694 (ZEN003694) when combined with nivolumab
      with or without low dose ipilimumab in solid tumors

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The efficacy of the triplet regimen will be evaluated in a cohort of patients with
      recurrent platinum-resistant BRCA wild type (wt) epithelial ovarian cancer.

      Ia. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. The impact of BET inhibition on the tumor
      immune microenvironment (TIME) will be characterized.

      III. Predictors of response and resistance to therapy will be explored.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ZEN003694.

      DOSE ESCALATION (DOUBLET TREATMENT): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on day 1 and ZEN003694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      DOES ESCALATION AND DOSE EXPANSION (TRIPLET TREATMENT): Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30
      minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1, and ZEN003694 PO QD on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 5, patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1 and ZEN003694 PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then every 3
      months for 1 year.
