    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial comparing combined
      rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandametä) to placebo in subjects with normal or intermediate
      fasting glucose (IFG) and stable coronary artery disease.Subjects meeting entry criteria will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or combined rosiglitazone/metformin
      (Avandametä) 4/1000 mg. Laboratory specimens including high sensitivity C-reactive protein
      (hs-CRP), glucose, HgbA1C, complete lipid profile, will be obtained after a 10 hour fast as
      specified by study visits. Subjects will return for repeat study visits at 2, 4, 6 and 8
      months for repeat laboratory evaluations, including safety labs consisting of serum
      creatinine, liver enzymes, and a CBC. Additionally, subjects will have IL-6 and TNF-a
      measured for research purposes at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits. All subjects will
      be followed for a minimum of 8 months. This pilot study proposes to evaluate the effect of
      placebo, or combined rosiglitazone/metformin onsurrogate blood markers of atherosclerosis
      activity among non-diabetic and pre-diabetic patients with known stable coronary syndromes.
