      out of the bone marrow space and into the blood, but the mechanisms of this process are still
      poorly understood. A better understanding of this process could greatly improve clinical
      results in transplantation, cancer treatment, and potentially genetic therapy of a wide
      variety of disorders. In this protocol, we will study two different mobilization treatments
      and compare how efficient they are at increasing the number of primitive cells in the blood
      in patients with multiple myeloma. These cells will be collected by apheresis, and used for
      autologous transplantation following high dose chemotherapy. This aggressive approach to
      treatment in multiple myeloma has been shown to improve remission rates and survival without
      active disease. The use of a larger number of blood stem cells may decrease the toxicity
      associated with the procedure. In the research laboratory, we will study a number of
      characteristics of the primitive cells in the blood and the bone marrow after treatment with
      the mobilizing drugs. These studies will help us to design future transplantation and genetic
      therapy protocols.
