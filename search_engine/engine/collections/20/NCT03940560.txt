      surgically created knot. When tissues are under tension, such as the closure of an abdominal
      wall after laparotomy, the sutures cut through the tissues in what is known as "suture
      pull-through" and create incisional hernias. The hernia rate after primary laparotomy depends
      on the patient population, but is over 10%. In some high-risk populations, even with a small
      3 cm laparoscopy incision, the hernia rate is over 30%. In primary hernia repair, use of
      sutures alone yields a 60% hernia recurrence rate at 10 years. Mesh has become commonplace in
      order to decrease incisional hernia recurrence rates in primary hernia repairs.

      A novel mesh suture, designed at Northwestern University (Chicago, IL) by Dr. Gregory
      Dumanian, has shown improved outcomes in pre-clinical animal models and these results are
      included at the end of this document. Dr. Dumanian has employed the concept of using a
      mesh-like suture already in his clinical practice. He has cut strips from an FDA-approved
      piece of hernia mesh, and used them as sutures, tying them with knots.

      Based on improved outcomes in pre-clinical and analogous clinical data in comparison to
      standard suture, Dr. Dumanian now proposes the use of a medical grade mesh suture of his
      design and fabrication in the load bearing internal tissue approximations. These are internal
      permanent sutures and will not be removed. They are made of the identical material
      (polypropylene) used in standard sutures.

      Mesh Sutures are larger than standard sutures and they automatically flatten to help resist
      suture pull-through. Tissue ingrowth around the filaments and into the suture improves their
      hold.
