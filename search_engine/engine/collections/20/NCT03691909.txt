    
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, single-dose study in subjects with active Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (RA). 12-15 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this
      study is to evaluate the safety profile of a single IV infusion of autologous adipose-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of RA. The primary
      endpoint of this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or
      severe adverse event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is
      to evaluate the ability of HB-adMSCs to alter RA-related inflammation via measuring levels of
      Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and Joint Count 66/68 after a single infusion of
      autologous HB-adMSCs for up to 12-month post-infusion.
