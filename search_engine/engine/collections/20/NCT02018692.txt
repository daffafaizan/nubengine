      starting in the rods. Its prevalence is 1:4000 people and is the fourth most common blinding
      disease in Israel in 2004 [7% of all blindness]. The investigators treated a non-progressive
      form of the disease [Fundus Albipunctatus] by oral therapy of the food supplement made from
      alga Dunaliella Bardawil composed of approximately 50% 9-cis β-carotene.

      The 9-cis β -carotene has been shown to be a precursor of 9-cis retinoic acid both in-vitro
      in human intestinal mucosa and in-vivo in a ferret, perfused with 9-cis b-carotene. The night
      vision, as measured objectively by electroretinography (ERG) more than doubled in six
      patients tested following treatment. The visual field was also improved significantly. In a
      more recent study the investigators treated 29 retinitis pigmentosa patients with the 9-cis b
      Carotene algae Dunaliella Bardawil in a double masked placebo control cross over trial.
      Significant improvement in retinal function was recorded in 34% of the patients.

      As a natural extension of this study we will perform a double-masked, randomized, crossover,
      placebo-controlled study for adolescent patients. Longer treatment duration will be tested: a
      24 week treatment with either the 9-cis β-carotene-rich capsules or placebo followed by an
      additional a 24 week treatment with the other capsules and a wash-out period of 24 weeks
      between this two type of treatments. We predict that with this study design a
      maximal/increased therapeutic effect as well as efficient washout will be achieved.
