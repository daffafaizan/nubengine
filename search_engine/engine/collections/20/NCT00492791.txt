      intestine adapted to its exploration by capsule among patients with crohn's disease secondary
      objectives:

        -  Study of the reproducibility of the detection of the lesions

        -  total evaluation of the severity of the small intestine (on an ordinal scale with 5
           classes and on a continuous analogical scale).

        -  Study and validation of the sensitivity to the change of the score of severity
           (variation among patients after treatment by Infliximab or corticoids).

        -  Evaluation of the aptitude of the endoscopic score of severity to define the endoscopic
           cicatrization.

        -  Study of the correlation between the endoscopic score of severity and a clinical marker
           of activity: Crohn' S Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and a marker of inflammation: serum
           level of C-Reactive protein (CRP).

        -  Validation of the utility of "Patency Agileâ„¢" used before the capsule. All the patients
           included will have before their endoscopic capsule an examination by patency. After
           validation, the patients will have an exploration by the video capsule. The readers will
           fill a grid with standardized lesions. The films will be read by two other independent
           readers. The patients treated by infliximab or prednisone will have one second capsule
           afterwards 10 weeks.
