      proanthocyanidins derived from grape seed, pine bark, bilberry, citrus and red wine extracts,
      to determine effects on endothelial function, lipoproteins and inflammation. The primary
      outcome measure will be endothelial function as assessed by digital response to hyperemia
      using peripheral arterial tonometry, measured both in the fasting state and after a single
      standardized high-fat meal, when transient dysfunction is expected to occur. Secondary
      outcome measures will be the lipid profile, hs-CRP, and Lp-PLA2. The recruitment population
      will be healthy volunteers. The design will be a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, cross-over trial lasting 10 weeks.
