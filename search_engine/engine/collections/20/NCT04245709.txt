      40-80 micrograms twice daily for 24 weeks. In person visits will occur at weeks 0, 4, 12 and
      24. Telephone visits will occur at weeks 1, 6, 16 and 20. During these visits several safety
      and efficacy outcome measures will be performed for research purposes including safety labs,
      thyroid functions, pregnancy testing, ALSFRS-R, FVC, and muscle strength testing (myometry).
      The critical test of treatment efficacy will be the comparison of the ALSFRS-R slope during
      treatment to the estimated pre-treatment slope. All participants will continue to have
      standard follow up care for their ALS at Duke (for patients followed here) or their local ALS
      clinic
