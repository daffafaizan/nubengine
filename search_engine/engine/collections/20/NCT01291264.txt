      obtained: 1) reason for exam, 2) subject's signs and symptoms and 3) clinical assessment.

      For each subject enrolled in the study, two clinician-collected pharyngeal swabs, two
      clinician-collected rectal swabs, and a first catch urine specimen (approximately 25 ml) will
      be obtained. The collection order of the clinician-collected swabs will be randomized.

      Two pharyngeal swabs will be tested at the research laboratory using: 1) APTIMA COMBO 2®
      [AC2](Gen-Probe Inc, San Diego, CA); and 2) Abbott RealTime CT/NG [RealTime](Abbott
      Molecular, Des Plains, IL). Two rectal swabs will be tested at the research laboratory using:
      1) AC2; and 2) RealTime.

      A first-catch urine [FCU] specimen will be split out at San Francisco Department of Public
      Health laboratory and sent to the Chlamydia Research Laboratory for analysis using: 1)AC2;
      and 2) RealTime.

      All NAAT specimens are collected in the manufacturer's recommended NAAT transport medium.
      After specimen processing, samples will be frozen at -70ºC for discrepant analysis.
