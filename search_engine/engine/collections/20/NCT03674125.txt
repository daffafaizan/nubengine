      HCV infection and who have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR). This study will
      provide information as to whether GLS-6150 may be useful to prevent re-infection for those
      successfully cleared of HCV infection. GLS-6150 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the
      NS3/4A gene of HCV, NS4B gene of HCV, the NS5A gene of HCV and IL-28B. GLS-6150 will be
      administered at one of two dose levels (1 mg or 2 mg) and given as a 2 or 3 vaccination
      priming regimen with a boost vaccination given at 6 months. Immune T cell and serologic
      responses will be determined after each dose.
