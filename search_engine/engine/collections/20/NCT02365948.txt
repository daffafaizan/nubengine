      escalating dose study in healthy Chinese subjects. The primary objective of the study is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in healthy Chinese
      subjects after a single subcutaneous (sc) dose. The secondary objective is to evaluate safety
      of CZP in healthy Chinese subjects after a single sc dose. 36 healthy Chinese subjects (18
      male and 18 female) will be randomized to receive one of 3 dose levels of CZP (100 mg, 200 mg
      and 400 mg) or placebo given by sc injections. Each dose group begins treatment staggered by
      a minimum of 14 days. The total duration of the study will be approximately 71 to 94 days for
      each subject. This includes a 2 to 21 days Screening Period, 1 day of treatment and 70 days
      Observation Period after administration of a single dose of investigational medicinal
      product.
