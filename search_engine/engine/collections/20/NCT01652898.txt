    
      A single centre prospective, randomized, double blind study consisting of a local safety
      Pilot Phase and a triple-cross-over Main Study Phase.

      In the pilot phase, 3 subjects will be administered a bolus with AOP LDLA202 vs. placebo
      (0.9% saline) simultaneously (same vein on the other body side). Following treatment of the
      first subject per cohort and assuming no safety concerns arise, second and third subjects
      will be treated in safety intervals of at least 3 hours between doses in individual subjects.
      On Day 3 after dosing a safety follow-up assessment will be done and all adverse events will
      be reported to the sponsor's medical monitor. Assuming no safety concerns arise, the
      sponsor's medical monitor will give green light for conduct of the Main Treatment Phase in
      writing.

      In the main phase, 12 subjects will be treated with AOP LDLA202, ONO LDL50 and esmolol. Three
      doses per subject and day (=treatment period), all administered via big superficial veins,
      are planned with at least 1 hour observation period after each bolus injection. Each subject,
      if confirmed eligible, will complete three treatment periods in total in the main phase of
      the study.

      ECG, blood pressure, local tolerability and adverse events will be monitored.
