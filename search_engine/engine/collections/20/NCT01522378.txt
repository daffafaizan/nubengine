      (123I-MIBG imaging), whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) rebalances and improves
      the integrity and function of sympathetic nerve terminals in the failing myocardium. The
      study will test the hypothesis that resynchronization of biventricular contractility
      attenuates excessive sympathetic drive, and improves autonomic function and cardiac
      performance.

      The Specific Aim #2 of this study is to determine the relationship between 123I-MIBG labeling
      of sympathetic activity and physiological measures of cardiopulmonary and autonomic function.
      This aim is to test the hypothesis that impaired cardiac sympathetic activity, determined by
      123I-MIBG imaging will be associated with poorer submaximal exercise gas exchange (higher
      ventilation - carbon dioxide (CO2) slopes, low end tidal CO2, reduced oxygen pulse and a more
      rapid frequency response) as well as reduced heart rate power spectral frequencies, a blunted
      response to positional changes and a delayed heart rate recovery.
