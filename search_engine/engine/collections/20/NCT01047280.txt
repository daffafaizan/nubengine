      blood lipids, a double-blinded, 3-phase crossover trial will be conducted in moderately
      overweight (BMI=25-40 kg/m2), borderline hypercholesterolemic (LDL-C ≥ 2.5 mmol/L) men
      between the ages of 18-60 years. During three 8-week phases separated by 4-week washout
      periods, and under supervision to ensure compliance, 28 subjects will consume in random order
      (i) Control: 3.5 g/d of safflower oil, (ii) Clarinol G-80®: 3.5 g/d of 50:50 mixture of t10,
      c12 and c9, t11 CLA and (iii) c9, t11: 3.5 g/day of c9, t11 CLA. Body weight, fat mass and
      lean body mass will be measured at beginning and end of each phase by dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA). Baseline and endpoint blood samples will collected to determine blood
      lipid profile, and different safety parameters, including insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR
      index), and concentrations of inflammatory (hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6) and oxidative (Oxidized-LDL)
      biomarkers. Effect of CLA consumption on fatty acid oxidation will also be measured.
