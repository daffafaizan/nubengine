      experts regarding the prophylaxis of recurrence urinary tract infections. Depending on the
      recommendation, the prevention of recurrence UTI should be used, not justified, or should be
      used in special cases. However, preparations that will be effective in preventing UTI and
      will not cause bacterial resistance are still sought.

      106 patients aged 3 to 18 years with recurrence UTIs (defined as: ≥2 infections in the upper
      urinary tract or 1 UTI in the upper urinary tract and ≥1 in the lower urinary tract or ≥3 or
      more UTI in the lower urinary tract in one year) or children with ≥1 infection in the upper
      urinary tract and ≥1 of recurrent UTIs risk factors (congenital anomalies of the kidney and
      urinary tract, constipation, bladder dysfunction, myelomeningocele, sexual activity in girls)
      will be randomly assigned to receive a 90-days prophylaxsis arm (probiotic UroLact containing
      Lactobacillus Rhamnosus PL1 and Lactobacillus Plantarum PM1) or a 90-days placebo arms.

      The primary outcome measure will be frequencies of recurrence of UTI during the 6 months
      after the intervention.
