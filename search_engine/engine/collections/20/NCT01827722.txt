      controlled clinical study with a 24 week treatment phase followed by a 24 week follow up
      phase. Subjects will be randomly assigned to Ozurdex every 16 weeks, Ranibizumab monthly, or
      combination Ozurdex every 16 weeks with Ranibizumab. Patients assigned to IV Ozurdex arm will
      receive a total of 2 intravitreal Ozurdex injections (in combination with monthly Ranibizumab
      sham) administered at 16 week intervals beginning on Day 1 and ending at Week 16. Patients
      assigned to IV Ranibizumab arm will receive injections administered at monthly intervals (in
      combination with Ozurdex sham beginning on Day 1 and Week 16). Patients assigned to IV
      Ozurdex with IV Ranibizumab will receive a total of 2 intravitreal Ozurdex injections
      administered at Week 16 intervals beginning on Day 1 and ending at Week 16 with an initial IV
      Ranibizumab injection administered on Day 1, then treated with Ranibizumab according to
      reinjection parameters assessed monthly through Week 20 (in combination with Ranibizumab sham
      if Ranibizumab reinjection parameters are not met). Treatment at end of study treatment phase
      Week 24 will be standard of care for all arms at the Investigator's discretion.
