      complication of migraine in the the International Classification of Headache Disorders.
      Patients with CM experience headache on 15 days per month. CM is associated with significant
      disability and reduced health-related quality of life. Approximately 1.3% to 2.4% of the
      general population suffers from CM, and one in five CM sufferers cannot work because this
      condition impacts their ability to lead productive lives. CM is frequently complicated by
      overuse of acute pain medications. Some drugs have regulatory approval for migraine
      prophylaxis; none are approved specifically for CM prophylaxis although recently, botulinum
      injection has been FDA approved for CM treatment with marginal treatment effects with many
      patients failing to have complete remission. The present study is being undertaken as a phase
      I study to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose derived mesenchymal stem
      cell preparations (MSC) for treatment of CM.
