      type of low-virulence (does not typically cause infection) bacterium called
      Propionibacterium. The most common bacterium of this family is P acnes, the same bacterium
      that is responsible for the majority of acne. There is increasing evidence that infection
      with P acnes and other Propionibacterium is a significant source of failure following certain
      orthopaedic shoulder procedures. However, information affecting hip surgery is currently
      unknown. Our personal experience leads us to believe that the numbers are actually quite
      high, since we are seeing an increased rate of Propionibacterium infection of hip replacement
      in the community. However, this type of study has never been done before, and therefore we
      simply do not know an accurate estimate for the average hip replacement patient's risk for
      Propionibacterium infection following hip replacement.
