      I. To tailor the National Fertility Barriers (NFB) Survey for women who have had
      gynecological and breast cancers.

      II. To administer the tailored survey and evaluate if utilization of infertility clinics and
      treatments is associated with pregnancies leading to live births after gynecological or
      breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate whether potential covariates are associated with utilization of infertility
      clinics and live births after gynecological and breast cancers (e.g. socio-demographic,
      clinical, psychological, lifestyle, and decision-making characteristics).
