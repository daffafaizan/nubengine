           forward-backward translation by two bilingual translators. The original German version
           is translated into Thai by two Thai native speakers, then the study team reviews the
           Thai-version UCT questionnaire for items comprehensibility and integrates the first
           consensus version which re-translated into German by German native speaker afterwards.
           The comparison between the backward German version UCT questionnaire and the original
           UCT is carried out to find out any misconception and mistranslation in the intermediary
           forward version of questionnaire. The second version will be tested on 15 chronic
           urticaria patients to detect any misunderstanding points. Finally, this Thai-version of
           UCT questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity, reliability,
           interpretability and minimal clinical important difference.

        2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of
           Urticaria Control Test, the severity of urticaria symptoms will be assessed by
           investigators and patients using UAS28, Patient's global assessment of disease severity
           (PatGA-LS), Physician's global assessment of disease control (PhyGA-LS), the UCT and
           DLQI questionnaire
