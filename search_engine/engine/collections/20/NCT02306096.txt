      Current patient and clinicopathological evaluation is imperfect for predicting outcome, which
      results in overtreatment for many patients, and for others, leads to death from recurrent
      disease. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to better personalize care and maximize
      treatment effectiveness and survival.

      The Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) study was initiated in 2010 as a
      multicenter prospective population-based observational study with longsighted aims to analyze
      breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research and
      integrated with healthcare; decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; utilize
      genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and
      establish real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and
      predictive tests. In the first phase, we focus on molecular profiling by next-generation
      RNA-sequencing. Gene expression profiles, mutational profiles, and transcript isoform-level
      data will be analyzed in the context of patient information, clinicopathological variables,
      and outcome, with the purpose to develop new molecular diagnostic assays for breast cancer.
      Additional genome-scale RNA, DNA, and protein analyses will be performed in the future.

      As of June 2020, over 15,000 patients have enrolled in the study, representing approximately
      85% of all eligible patients within the catchment region. Tissue and blood collection is
      integrated within healthcare routines and clinical information is provided from national
      quality registries.
