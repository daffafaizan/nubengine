    
      Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma is currently used as a standard treatment, with a combination
      of chemotherapy (R-CHOP), which includes Rituximab. However, the survival rate is very poor
      if the primary treatment is refractory or relapsed within a year or less. The duration of
      these patients ' lives is around one year and the five-year survival rate is 15-20 %. Thus, a
      new treatment strategy is needed to improve the survival of the patient with DLBCL, which are
      either refractory and relapsed.
