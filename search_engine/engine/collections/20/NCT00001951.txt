      experience ovarian failure around age 50. At least 1% of women, however, experience premature
      ovarian failure before the age of 40, but there have been no studies establishing optimal
      hormone replacement therapy regimens for these younger women. Available evidence suggests
      that the usual menopausal hormone replacement therapy is not adequate to protect young women
      with premature ovarian failure from developing osteoporosis. Women with premature ovarian
      failure have abnormally low circulating androgen levels, which may contribute to their risk
      for osteoporosis. We plan to compare physiological estrogen replacement with physiological
      estrogen plus androgen replacement in young women with premature ovarian failure to determine
      which regimen is more beneficial for bone mineral density and other metabolic parameters
      related to the risk for cardiovascular disease. This study employs transdermal estradiol and
      testosterone "patches" designed to deliver the same amount for each sex steroid normally
      produced by the ovary in young women in a physiological manner. Women with premature ovarian
      failure will be randomized to receive either estradiol plus placebo patches or estradiol plus
      testosterone patches. Both groups will receive cyclic progestin treatment. A group of
      age-matched women with normal ovarian function will serve as contemporaneous controls for
      bone density and other study measures. The primary outcome parameter is femoral neck bone
      mineral density, to be assessed at baseline, and after 1, 2, and 3 years of treatment. Other
      outcome parameters include lumbar spine bone mineral density, markers of bone turnover,
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, and cognitive function.
