      monitoring and evaluation of the prostate cancer.By compared with the conventional imaging
      methods (whole body bone scintigraphy and MRI) and molecular imaging methods (11C-choline
      PET/CT),we hope to find the advantages of 18F-PSMA PET/CT in the diagnosis and metastases of
      prostate cancer, and lay the foundation for the further clinical transformation.And make some
      comparison with those 3 methods.
