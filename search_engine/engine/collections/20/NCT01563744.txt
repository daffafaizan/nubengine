      was anticipated the day following EGD were consented and randomized to either standard prep
      by mouth (split-dose PEG) or intervention group (instillation of the first 2 liters of
      Nulytely solution through the channel of the endoscope into the duodenal bulb, then continue
      standard prep). Data is collected on quality of prep and patient satisfaction in both groups.
