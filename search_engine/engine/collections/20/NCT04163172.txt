      despite the evolution of surgical implants and techniques. Open reduction and internal
      fixation (ORIF) is often preferred as the first choice of treatment, but the results are
      varying, and sometimes disappointing. Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) has been widely used for
      fractures that are not amenable to ORIF in elderly patients, but the mechanical complications
      remain a challenge, especially in active patients. Elbow hemiarthroplasty (EHA) provides a
      modern alternative that might avoid the mechanical complications and weight bearing
      restrictions related to the linked articulation in semiconstrained TEA. There are no studies
      comparing the results of EHA to that of TEA or ORIF, but case series have reported promising
      results.

      In this study, forty-four patients with AO/OTA type C2 or C3 fractures of distal humerus will
      be randomized to either ORIF or EHA. The patients will be examined after the operation and at
      3 months and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years after the surgery. The main objective of this study is to
      investigate the best treatment option for distal humeral fractures in patients aged 50 years
      or above. This can be of value to future patients sustaining these complicated fractures.
