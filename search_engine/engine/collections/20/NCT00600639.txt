    
      Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) has been successfully used in Hypercapnic Acute
      Respiratory Failure (HARF) since endotracheal intubation (ETI) and invasive ventilation are
      associated to high morbidity and mortality rate.

      because of the lack of beds in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and the high mortality and
      cost associated with the increased of age, the "Elderly" patients affected by ARF due to
      chronic diseases are not always considered for ETI.

      The efficacy of NIMV to treat HARF has been widely demonstrated. However, in most of the
      studies performed in ICUs and in another facilities the mean age of the patients is usually
      less than 70 years (see tab1).

      A multicentric, randomized-controlled trial conducted in a group of "ELDERLY" patients with
      the mean age higher than 76 years, to compare the use of NIMV with Standard Medical Treatment
      (SMT) in the treatment of an episode of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure.
