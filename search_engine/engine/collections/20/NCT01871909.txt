        1. Compare physiologic waveform data obtained from bleeding and hemodynamically unstable
           trauma patients to existing data collected from LBNP subjects.

        2. Determine the accuracy of LBNP in approximating the physiologic changes that occur in
           bleeding and hemodynamically unstable trauma patients.
