      baseline status in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. II. Determine tumor
      response to Doxil as a corollary to clinical benefit. III. Evaluate the safety of Doxil.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, prospective, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin HCl liposome (Doxil) or daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in
      a 3:1 ratio. Both Doxil and DauonoXome are given every 2 weeks for 6 courses by intravenous
      infusion over 60 minutes into a peripheral vein.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 80 patients will be studied.
