      (RFDS) as a non-radiological means to ease the process of detecting retained sponges and
      reconciling sponge counts in the labor and delivery room (following vaginal birth). It would
      not replace any of the current standard-of-care safety mechanisms already in place at the
      study site to prevent retained sponges. All safeguards remain enforced: counting, visual
      inspection, and x-rays if indicated by standard protocol. The system being studied involves
      the surgeon scanning the subject's vaginal area using a spherical device placed 1cm above the
      symphysis pubis. This static scan will serve to detect any retained cotton textiles within
      the vaginal cavity after birth. This Verisphere, a reusable device, is encased in a sterile
      sheath during use. It does not come into direct contact with the subject's vagina, but hovers
      above the pelvic/vaginal region. If any radio-frequency tagged sponges remain inside the
      subject, a signal alerts the surgical team to remove them. The visible console displays a
      confirmation code once the scan is complete. This confirmation code is kept as part of the
      medical record once absence of retained textiles is confirmed. Once the provider is assured
      there is no retained item, the same device may be used to scan trash receptacles to locate a
      missing textile if the pre- and post-delivery sponge/gauze count remains incongruent. This
      alleviates the need for the assistant personnel to manually "dig" through soiled materials
      for sponge localization.
