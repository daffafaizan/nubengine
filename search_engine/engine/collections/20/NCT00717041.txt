      to identify and treat these conditions can lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality and a
      decreased quality of life. Traditional screening and intervention programs, usually based in
      primary care providers' offices, have been insufficient, particularly in medically
      underserved populations. Alternate sites for screening and intervention have begun to receive
      attention and may hold promise.

      The emergency department (ED) is the entry point for access to medical and social services
      for many patients and has the potential to serve as a site to identify older adults with
      unmet needs. However, we do not know the prevalence of depression and cognitive impairment
      and how they differ by mode of arrival of the patient to the ED. Second, a question remains
      as to the validity of screening patients during an acute illness. This study aims to:

        1. Compare the prevalence of depression and cognitive impairment among patients who arrive
           at the ED by EMS, as compared to those arriving via other means.

        2. Evaluate the reliability of screening patients for depression and cognitive impairment
           during an acute illness and after the illness.

        3. To evaluate correlates of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Upon completion,
           this study will describe the epidemiology of the population of older adults presenting
           to the ED.
