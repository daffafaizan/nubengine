      I. To assess the total response rate of the oxaliplatin, irinotecan and capecitabine drug
      combination in advanced gastric/esophageal junction carcinoma.

      II. To assess the duration of total responses of the oxaliplatin, irinotecan and capecitabine
      drug combination in advanced gastric/esophageal junction carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses
      repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
