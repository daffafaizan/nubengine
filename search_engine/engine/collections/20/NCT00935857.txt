      gastrointestinal tract diseases including, mostly commonly, the screening for colorectal
      polyps and cancer. Despite improvements in endoscope technology, a significant minority of
      procedures (up to 10%) can not be safely completed due to a variety of patient factors and
      technical difficulties. These factors primarily include prior abdominal surgeries resulting
      in adhesions, severe diverticular disease, inadequate bowel cleansing, and patient
      discomfort.

      Options for an incomplete colonoscopy include several endoscopic and non-endoscopic
      modalities. Non-endoscopic modalities include radiologic studies such as CT/MRI colonography
      as well as a retrograde barium study. Relative disadvantages of these modalities is the
      inability to remove colonic polyps, perform biopsies, and in the case of barium studies, a
      lower sensitivity for pathology. Alternative endoscopic modalities have been described that
      may assist in successfully completing colonoscopy Of these alternative methods,
      balloon-overtube assisted colonoscopy is the most promising, but this method has not been
      studied in a randomized, controlled fashion. In this study, we aim to compare
      balloon-overtube assisted colonoscopy versus standard colonoscopy for patients with prior
      incomplete colonoscopy.
