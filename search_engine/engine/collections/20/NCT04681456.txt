      outcomes to assess the safety and efficacy of VMAT radiotherapy. Data that will be collected
      includes baseline data of demographic, relevant medical history, photographs, treatment
      schedule, and treatment outcomes. Data may be collected retrospectively in regard to previous
      relevant medical history, prior treatments and outcomes as well as prospectively, including
      treatment schedule and treatment outcomes of radiotherapy treatment.

      The Registry aims to assess the safety and outcomes of treatment for up to 5 years. This
      Registry will be the first of its kind in the US and will provide a basis for a number of
      potential research publications. The Registry will also give insights into treatment delivery
      and potentially facilitate future improvements in patient care.
