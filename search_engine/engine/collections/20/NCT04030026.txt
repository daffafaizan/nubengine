    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover
      efficacy and safety study in IPF subjects with NAL ER tablets for the treatment of cough. The
      study consists of 2 treatment periods of 3 weeks, each followed by a washout period of 2
      weeks.

      Treatment Period 1: During Treatment Period 1, eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to
      one of the following treatment arms:

        -  Arm 1: Active NAL ER followed by crossover Placebo in Treatment Period 2

        -  Arm 2: Placebo followed by crossover NAL ER in Treatment Period 2

      Following 3 weeks of dosing in Treatment Period 1, subjects will complete a 2-week washout
      period before entering Treatment Period 2. Subjects assigned to Arm 1 will receive placebo
      and subjects assigned to Arm 2 will receive NAL ER during Treatment Period 2. A final 2-week
      washout period will occur at the completion of Treatment Period 2.

      NAL ER Dosing Subjects on NAL ER will have the dose titrated from 27 mg once daily (QD) to 54
      mg BID over a 5-day period and then maintained at 54 mg BID for approximately 4 days. Doses
      will be subsequently escalated and maintained at 108 mg BID over 1 week and then to 162 mg
      BID over 6 days.
