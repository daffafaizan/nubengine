      childhood vaccinations. Although serious events are rare, post-vaccination fever causes
      discomfort for the child, can lead to medical utilization, can rarely result in febrile
      seizure, and can cause a working parent to miss time from their job to care for a febrile
      infant who cannot attend day care. The benefits of acetaminophen prophylaxis for infants
      receiving current vaccinations, in terms of reduction of discomfort for the child,
      improvement of quality-of-life indicators for the parent, or reduction of medical
      utilization, have not been measured. This randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial will
      assess the efficacy of prophylaxis with acetaminophen in prevention of fever following
      routine childhood immunizations.
