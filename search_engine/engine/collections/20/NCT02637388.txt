      play a role in limiting energy intake. Satiation is referred to as the process that leads to
      the termination of eating, which may be accompanied by feelings of satisfaction. Satiety is
      the feeling of fullness that persists after eating, with the potential to suppress further
      energy intake until hunger returns. There is evidence to suggest that increasing
      gastro-intestinal viscosity improves appetite control and reduces subsequent food intake.
      Beta-glucan is a soluble fibre proposed to behave this way.

      In this double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial, subjective appetite sensations will be
      measured and blood will be collected at specific time points during the two arms in order to
      determine hormonal responses. Ad libitum food intake will be recorded. Food diaries will be
      used to measure dietary intakes.
