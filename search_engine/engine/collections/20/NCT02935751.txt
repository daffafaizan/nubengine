      discontinuation is sufficient to achieve minimal apixaban plasma levels (less than 30 ng/mL)
      prior to surgery. The investigators hypothesize that this portion will be 80-95%.

      All patients will have a blood draw at 48 hours prior to procedure and then a second blood
      draw on the morning of the procedure to test apixaban plasma and anti-Xa levels. Patients
      will also receive a follow-up phone call at 30 days to collect information on clinical
      events.
