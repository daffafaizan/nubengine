    
      128 subjects will be enrolled in the trial and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      IAI every three months for 24 months or sham injections. Enrollment will be stratified in
      order to ensure a balance between the two treatment groups for subjects who were diagnosed
      with exudative AMD within the past two years versus those diagnosed more than two years prior
      to Baseline.

      Study assessments will be conducted at required visits every three months and include
      manifest refraction and ETDRS visual acuity testing, slit lamp exam and dilated fundus exam,
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using Avanti device, and OCT
      angiography using Avanti AngioVueTM, and fluorescein angiography. Fundus photography will
      also be performed at Baseline, Month 12 and Month 24 visits.

      In the event of conversion to neovascular AMD in the study eye at any point during the study,
      the Investigator will treat the subject with IAI at a frequency per his/her discretion.
