      menstrual bleeding, pain, and pressure. Common surgical treatment modalities are hysterectomy
      (removal of the uterus) or myomectomy (removal of the fibroid). Minimally invasive surgical
      techniques (laparoscopy) are generally recommended due to improved recovery time, decrease
      infection risk, decreased bleeding risk and overall decreased morbidity and mortality risks.

      In order to remove a large uterus or large fibroids laparoscopically, a power morcellator is
      often used to cut the specimen into smaller pieces that can be removed through small
      incisions. Due to the concern regarding spread of small amounts of tissue during power
      morcellation, many surgeons are advocating contained power morcellation, i.e. morcellation
      inside a specimen bag.

      This study will be evaluating the efficacy of contained morcellation using a specific
      specimen bag. Morcellation will be performed in the designated bag. The bag will then be
      removed evaluated for any egg albumin leakage. If there is no leakage, it can be inferred
      that there is no tissue is spread during the contained morcellation process using this bag.
