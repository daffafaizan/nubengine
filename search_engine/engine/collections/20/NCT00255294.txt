      antimicrobial properties. Clinical safety studies have shown it to be safe for use up to six
      days in women and 7 days in men, and ongoing studies are assessing its safety for twice daily
      use for 14 days in women. This study will evaluate its contraceptive effectiveness in women
      who use it for 6 months.
