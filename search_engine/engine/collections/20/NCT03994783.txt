      Fifty percent of kidney transplant patients who develop acute antibody-mediated rejection
      (aAMR) will develop evidence of cAMR within 1 year of the acute rejection episode. There is
      currently no evidence on how to treat aAMR.

      The planned research is a randomised controlled trial, which compares an acceptable and
      commonly used therapy, which will be referred to as "standard of care", with an additional
      agent, rituximab, added to the "standard of care" treatment. The participants with be
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio.

      "Standard of care" will include optimisation of the participant's baseline anti-rejection
      medications and therapy to remove the antibodies which have developed against the kidney
      transplant, which are causing the damage. This is called plasma exchange. The participants
      will also receive therapy to reduce inflammation and reduce their immune response to their
      kidney transplant. This will be achieved using corticosteroids and intravenous
      immunoglobulins, respectively. These therapies have been used to treat aAMR for many decades.

      The intervention arm will consist of the "standard of care" treatment, with the addition of a
      drug called rituximab, which will be administered in 2 separate doses. Rituximab is itself an
      antibody, which binds to certain cells in the body involved in antibody production, called B
      cells. Following the administration of rituximab, the number of B cells is reduced, which
      affects antibody production. Rituximab is commonly used in transplantation for this
      indication, as well as for other conditions.

      Participants in both arms will be followed up to determine if there is a difference in the
      time to transplant failure and/or transplant function.
