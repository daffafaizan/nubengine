      spinal cord injury and post-stroke hemiplegia. The investigator is aware of only one pilot
      study of a powered exoskeleton (ReWalk®) in multiple sclerosis (MS) which demonstrated some
      improvements in sitting, standing and walking posture when used consistently. The
      investigator is not aware of any study of the Ekso GT™ exoskeleton in MS.

      This is a feasibility and safety study of using the Ekso GT™ exoskeleton for gait training in
      patients with relapsing or progressive MS and severe mobility limitations (EDSS 5-5 - 7.5).
      Preliminary efficacy outcomes on gait and walking will also be collected for the purpose of
      designing a larger clinical trial of the Ekso GT™ exoskeleton for gait training in patients
      with MS.
