    
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be recruited
      in a private care practice and randomized to receive either a whole body Photobiomodulation
      (PBM) therapy program or placebo. Primary outcomes will be pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale;
      Widespread Pain Index; Symptom Severity Score), functionality (Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire; The Leisure Time Physical Activity Instrument), quality of soft tissue
      (elastography) and central sensitisation (pain pressure threshold and the Autonomic Symptom
      Profile). Secondary outcomes will be psychological factors (Pain Catastrophising scale, Tampa
      Scale, Self-Efficacy questionnaire). Assessments will be at baseline, after treatment 6,
      immediately following the last treatment (4 weeks), and then 2 weeks and at 3 monthly follow
      up intervals to 6 months after completion of treatment.
