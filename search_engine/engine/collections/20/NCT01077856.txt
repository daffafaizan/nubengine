    
      Time perspective: The study will be conducted using data collected both
      retrospectively/concurrently from registries and prospectively by questionnaire survey.

      Baseline survey data were collected during a prior study from 2004-2005.

      Safety Monitoring: An expert panel on teratology consisting of one teratologist from each of
      the participating countries will review all available medical records related to any
      congenital anomalies to search for any emerging patterns that may be indicative of an
      association between GARDASILâ„¢ exposure in the mother and the subsequent congenital anomalies
      in the babies.
