        1. Manual and patients experience. n =6-8 patients. Goal is to collect patients' personal
           experiences about CBT- treatment. Analysis included inventories, laboratory measurements
           and transcribed interviews. Mixed methods (comparing statistical data and qualitative
           content analysis/ agency speech transformation).

        2. Therapeutic interventions and agency-speech transformation in CBT-therapy sessions. CBT-
           sessions are taped and transcribed. Research method: qualitative approach with discourse
           analysis (agency speech transformation during the intervention, therapeutical
           interventions in the group therapy)

        3. Randomized controlled research. n=70. Treatment/research group n=35. Control- group (35)
           participates on health counselling (6 sessions). Research question: is CBT-treatment
           clinically statistically significance. Comparison is between research- and control
           groups but also between patients who are diagnosed 93.3, having also objective
           impairment in cognitive functions or orthostatic intolerance, comparing to patients only
           diagnosed on G93.3.
