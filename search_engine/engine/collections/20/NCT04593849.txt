      burden, accounts up to 34% total lifetime medical costs in the United States. It may also
      lead to significant long-term morbidity and, potentially, mortality if treated Improperly.
      Initial management is particularly crucial in helping the bone fracture healing process and
      reducing comorbidity. Apart from fracture fixation through nonoperative/conservative or
      operative methods in aim to restore anatomic alignment, oral analgesics are same important in
      Orthopedics patients in symptomatic control and for early mobilization. Non-opioid medication
      such as Acetaminophen or NSAIDs are routinely used for injury or postoperative pain
      management, despite that inevitable side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and
      inconsistent show concerns of NSAIDs impairing bone healing in historical animal-based
      studies.

      In which case, topical agents used in traditional chinese medicine(TCM) usually become a
      well-placed supplement to relieve inflammatory conditions. In spite of the lack of scientific
      evidence of efficacy, topical applications such as Ru- Yih-Jin-Huang-Saan (RYJHS) and
      Wan-Yin-Gao(WYG) have been used on musculoskeletal injuries in oriented countries for
      centuries, as their transcutaneous transport of the herbal chemicals to deeper tissues show
      biological activities of anti-inflammation, reducing swelling soft tissue, angiogenesis,
      fracture healing and cellular proliferation.

      To date, there is no study evaluating the clinical effect of traditional chinese medicine in
      topical use on musculotendinous injury, nor is that investigating the effectiveness on bone
      fracture healing. We hypothesize that with aid of topical chinese herbal medicine in addition
      to oral analgesics can be more beneficial in treating post traumatic injury, launching early
      mobilization, and enhancing fracture healing process.
