    
      A placebo-controlled study that will recruit male and female menthol nicotine dependent
      smokers. Following screening and evaluation as described above, eligible participants will be
      enrolled in the study which will last about 4 weeks. Eligible, participants will be
      randomized to menthol or non-menthol smoking condition for 2 weeks (Phase 1) and then will be
      switched to the alternative condition for another 2 weeks (Phase 2). The smoking condition
      will be open label. Participants will be provided with free cigarettes in Phases 1 and 2. For
      the menthol condition, participants will be provided their usual brand of menthol cigarettes
      and for the non-menthol condition, they will be provided a matched-brand non-menthol
      cigarette (e.g., Newport Non-Menthol Gold 100s for those who smoke Newport Menthol Gold
      100s). In week 2 of each Phase, participants will have a test session. Each session will
      include 3 infusions in the same order: nicotine (1 mg per 70 kg body weight) delivered over 5
      minutes, saline and nicotine (1 mg/ 70 kg) delivered over 2.5 minutes. Once the participants
      complete the test session, participants will be crossed-over to the alternative treatment.
      The period between the 2 Phases will not be longer than one week.
