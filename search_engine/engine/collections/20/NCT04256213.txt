      pre- versus post-treatment biopsies in patients treated with a combination of Nivolumab and
      Ipilimumab in a pilot study, just before starting standard RT-CT.

      The study will also assess tolerability, Objective Response Rate, clinical activity and
      biological (dynamic) changes of the immune micro environment
