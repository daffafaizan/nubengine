      of thymidine to thymidine monophosphate followed by its utilization in DNA synthesis. It has
      been demonstrated that activity of TK1 in the serum of cancer patients corresponds to the
      amount of dividing tumor cells. Several clinical investigations clearly showed that abnormal
      TK1 levels indicate tumor growth. In breast cancer, serum TK1 was shown to predict increased
      risk of recurrence following surgery and may be a good marker for monitoring the response to
      therapy. The measurements of TK1 were useful as a prognostic and monitoring factor in
      patients with NSCLC. Unfortunately, all previously used assays measuring TK1 activity showed
      relatively low analytical sensitivity. Recently, the novel high sensitive non-radioactive TK1
      assay (DiviTum) has been developed. With this assay tumour growth may be detected at an
      earlier stage of disease and smaller amounts of residual disease may be detected during and
      after therapy.
