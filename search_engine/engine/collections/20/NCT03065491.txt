      effects of some nutraceuticals, and in particular of red yeast rice, phytosterols and
      L-tyrosol.

      In a previous study the investigators have already demonstrated the synergistic effect of red
      yeast rice and phytosterols in term of lipid-lowering activity.

      Preliminary data suggest that these nutraceuticals could also exert a positive effect on
      vascular health beyond the direct effects on serum lipids.

      No data are available on the combined effects of these dietary supplement in humans.
