      blood-derived or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells may improve cardiac regeneration after
      acute myocardial infarction. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces
      mobilization of bone marrow stem cells and, thereby, increases the number of circulating stem
      cells that are available cells for myocardial regeneration.
