      HIV-negative YMSM will be randomized in the Advances in Technology to Enhance Adherence
      Monitoring (A-TEAM) pilot study to 12 weeks of daily FTC/TDF with the PSS versus daily
      FTC/TDF standard-of-care (SOC), then each arm will crossover to 12 weeks of daily FTC/TDF
      without the sensor system versus with the sensor system, respectively. PrEP will be provided
      by the study (see Gilead letter) and other aspects of PrEP clinical care will be consistent
      with the PrEP Clinic's standard practices based on CDC clinical guidelines. The detection
      accuracy of the PSS will be correlated with DBS-determined TFV-DP and FTC-TP levels obtained
      monthly from participants. A relationship between TVF-DP in DBS and adherence to FTC/TDF PrEP
      in the preceding 1-3 months has previously been characterized. These adherence categories
      were implemented in iPrEx OLE and consisted of: below lower limit of quantitation (BLQ), >BLQ
      to 349 fmol per punch (fewer than two tablets per week), 350-699 fmol per punch (two or three
      tablets per week), 700-1249 fmol per punch (four to six tablets per week), and 1250 fmol per
      punch or more (daily dosing). Real-time visual feedback of medication ingestion will be
      provided to the participant via the PSS and transmitted to the study team. A weekly text
      message with estimated HIV risk reduction based upon the DBS algorithm will be transmitted to
      participants after the initial first week of FTC/TDF dosing. Finally, in-depth qualitative
      exploration of barriers and facilitators to use of the PSS components will be completed
      through individual interviews as well as focus group discussions with participants.
      Participants will also provide feedback on text messages regarding PrEP protection as well as
      suggestions for other potential methods to receive performance data.
