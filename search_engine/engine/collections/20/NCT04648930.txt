      Xolair treatment. It should be noted that, because the duration of Xolair treatment depends
      on the pollen dispersal situation and other factors, patients who complete or discontinue
      Xolair treatment before the visit at 24 weeks after the start of treatment will be followed
      up until the date of last dose of Xolair + 30 days, and the results will be recorded in the
      CRF.
