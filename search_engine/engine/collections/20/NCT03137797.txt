      diagnosed HIV patients.

      This study aims to precise the impact of HIV infection treatment on morbidity and mortality,
      the factors related to treatment response, clinical and biological complications, their
      consequences, especially lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities, associated factors
      especially genetic, aspects linked to aging.

      In addition, the study describes the evolution of patients living conditions and behaviors
      remotely from their screening, particularly related to sexuality, reproduction, and health
      inequalities and to study the long-term treatment adherence.

      One third of the patients were included in the metabolic disorders module. This module
      includes additional biological and imaging explorations.
