      prospective trials comparing the clinical results of between the axillary bilateral-breast
      approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic thyroidectomy have
      been described. The investigators therefore designed a prospective trial comparing outcomes,
      including surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction, between patients undergoing robotic and
      conventional open thyroidectomy.
