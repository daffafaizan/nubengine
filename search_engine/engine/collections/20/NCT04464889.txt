    
      This phase I is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of a HLA-A*02:01 restricted,
      HA-1H T cell receptor (TCR) transduced patient-derived T cell (MDG1021) immunotherapy, with
      secondary endpoints including preliminary efficacy, in patients with relapsed or persistent
      hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the
      dose-escalation part of the study, at least 9 patients will be treated with MDG1021 at 3
      different doses to assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose using a standard 3+3
      cohort design. Thereafter, the selected optimal MDG1021 dose will be assessed for safety and
      preliminary efficacy in 20 additional patients during the dose-expansion part of the study.
      Manufacturing feasibility will be determined. MDG1021 will be administered by single
      intravenous infusion.

      HA-1H is exclusively expressed on cells of the hematopoietic system. If the patient's
      blood-cells, and thus lymphoma or leukemic cells, carry the immunogenic version of the HA-1H
      antigen on their surface and the donor stem cells do not, MDG1021 immunotherapy could
      eradicate the patient's cancer cells and allow the donor stem cells to repopulate the
      patient's blood forming system.
