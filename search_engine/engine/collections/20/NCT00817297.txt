      self-reported Comfort score) of the V60 device and a conventional noninvasive ventilator
      (patient's current ventilator). For the User Needs Assessment, the primary objective of the
      study was to validate the V60 to user needs. All patients were volunteers from the
      Respiratory Section of the Health Sciences Centre at the University of Manitoba. The study
      utilized a randomized 2-period cross-over study design to compare the V60 System to the
      patients' existing conventional noninvasive ventilator in different ventilation modes.
