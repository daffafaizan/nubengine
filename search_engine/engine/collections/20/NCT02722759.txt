      in the study, if parents have given their written informed consent. Non-invasive SpHb
      measurements are recorded prior to routine venous sampling. Routine venous sampling includes
      labHb and BGAHb. Additionally HcHb is taken from the routine venous sampling (HcHbart/ven)
      and from an additionally capillary puncture of earlobe or heel (HcHbcap). Every neonate can
      participate in two measurements.
