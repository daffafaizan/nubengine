      Subjects were randomized to begin with either multifocal or single vision distance contact
      lenses. The lenses used in this study were the 1-Day Acuvue (AV) Moist spherical
      single-vision soft contact lenses (SSCL) in the 8.5 base curve and the 1-Day AV Moist
      Multifocal (MFSCL) in the low ADD (etafilcon A, 58% water content). The preferred viewing
      distance on digital devices for a similar age group to our study was 63 cm which would
      require a near ADD of +1.59D. A low addition (ADD) yielding up to +1.25D was selected to
      provide an intermediate near addition without compromising distance vision as much as would
      be expected with higher add powers. The multifocal lens utilizes an aspheric center-near
      design. Subjects wore the lenses on a daily wear, daily disposable schedule. Following one
      week (Â± 2 days) of lens wear, subjects were evaluated and the alternate lenses dispensed.
      Adverse events were collected and assessed at each study visit.
