    
      Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: Depressed patients with the s/s or s/L alleles of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism
      will have greater amygdalar activation and decreased cortico-amygdala connectivity compared
      to patients with L/L genotype

      Hypothesis 2: After 2 and 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram (10 mg) depressed patients
      with the L/L allele will have a greater decrease in amygdalar activation and a greater
      increase in cortico-amygdala connectivity than patients with s/s or s/L genotypes.

      Methods:

      We will stratify the subjects in the two genotype groups so that they are comparable in terms
      of age and gender distributions. Only depressed patients will be treated with escitalopram.
      Healthy subjects and unmedicated currently euthymic depressed patients will have baseline
      scan and subsequent repeat fMRI scans at the same intervals as the depressed patients but
      will not receive any treatment. After completing the first fMRI scan, depressed patients will
      undergto one week of single blind placebo lead in. After the first week patient's depression
      symptoms will be assessed again. If depression symptoms are much better after the first week
      ( > 20% reduction in HAM-D scores) then the patient will not be asked to do the rest of the
      study and will be referred to a clinician of their choice for further treatment as necessary.
      If their depression symptoms do not show much improvement after the first week then they will
      be asked to take escitalopram for the next 8 weeks. At the end of 3 weeks of treatment from
      baseline, the patient will undergo a second fMRI scan. Following the second fMRI scan the
      patient will be continued on escitalopram for another 6 weeks.
