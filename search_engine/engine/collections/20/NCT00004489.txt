      according to sex (male vs female) and osteoporosis disease severity (mild vs severe).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Patients undergo bioavailability assessment to confirm the ability to absorb alendronate.

      Arm I: Patients receive calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo daily for one month.

      Arm II: Patients receive calcium and vitamin D supplements with oral alendronate daily for
      one month.

      Treatment continues if differences are seen in bone mineral density between the treatment
      arms.

      Patients are followed for biochemical response at week 6, 12, and 52. Bone mineral density is
      measured at 1 year and 2 years.
