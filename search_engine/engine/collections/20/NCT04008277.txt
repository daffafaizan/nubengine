      variability throughout one complete menstrual cycle. A minimum of 10 volunteers aged 18 years
      of age or over will be recruited via a variety of methods according to the criteria detailed
      in section 9. They will be required to wear a heart rate monitor continuously and collect
      daily early morning urine samples throughout one menstrual cycle.

      Urine samples will be returned to SPD on a regular basis for measurement of urinary hormones
      related to pregnancy and fertility. Data collected via the monitor including heart rate and
      heart rate variability will be downloaded for comparison.
