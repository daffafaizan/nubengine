    
      A pilot study of letrozole in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy at high
      risk of developing breast cancer. Subjects will have hyperplasia with atypia (or borderline
      Epithelial Hyperplasia/Atypical Hyperplasia) and evidence of Estrogen Receptor expression by
      random periareolar fine needle aspiration and baseline serum estradiol levels less than or
      equal to 150 pg/ml. The feasibility of performing RT-qPCR on breast specimens for aromatase
      expression will also be done at baseline.
