    
      The aim of this protocol is to provide care for patients with a variety of rare genetic
      disorders, supplement and offer an additional opportunity for training in clinical genetics,
      dysmorphology and metabolic genetics in the National Institute of Child Health and Human
      Development (NICHD) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and
      spearhead the development of new research protocols on particular aspects of diagnosis and
      care for specific genetic diseases. Evaluations of patients with a broad spectrum of
      metabolic and genetic conditions will be performed. In addition, genetic counseling services
      will be offered to patients and their families to assess risk, and give information on
      preventive measures, and testing options. Disorders that will be studied include chromosomal
      and Mendelian disorders of childhood and/or adult onset, congenital anomalies and/or birth
      defects, dysmorphic syndromes, familial cancer syndromes, multifactorial disorders, and
      metabolic abnormalities. If not eligible for another NICHD research protocol (specific for a
      disease or a treatment), patients with genetic/metabolic-related conditions may be evaluated
      under the auspices of this protocol to advance the clinical skills of physicians
      participating in NICHD clinical research and training programs, and to provide stimuli for
      new clinical research initiatives. Standard, medically indicated laboratory or radiological
      studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient.
      In some cases, the patient will receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder,
      according to current clinical practice. Patients and/or family members with genetic disorders
      may offer their DNA for storage and/or testing. The overall purpose of this protocol is to
      support our Institute s training and research missions by expanding the spectrum of diseases
      that can be seen in our clinics and wards.
