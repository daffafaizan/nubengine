      remain on study for 26 weeks or until time of kidney transplantation, whichever came first.

      The study and enrollment was placed on partial clinical hold in February 2013 which resulted
      in changes to the protocol. The study was restarted in April 2014 following these changes.

      Participants who completed the 26-week study or were on study when the study was closed in
      June 2016 were eligible to participate in an open-label extension study (Study 20140159;
      NCT02341417).
