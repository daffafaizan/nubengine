    
      Our current nasogastric tube placement protocol requires confirmation of nasogastric tube
      placement with plain radiography. Obtaining a plane radiograph in the emergency department
      can be time consuming and exposes the patient to radiation. Ultrasound is readily available
      to our physicians and does not expose patients to radiation.

      Confirmation of nasogastric tube placement by ultrasonography may provide a faster means of
      confirmation and expose patients to less radiation.
