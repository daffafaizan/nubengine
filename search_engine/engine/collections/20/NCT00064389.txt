      study in subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma. Subjects of appropriate age who
      completed the Phase III levalbuterol HFA MDI trials (Studies 051-353 or 051-355) were
      eligible to participate. Studies 051-353 and 051-355, both entitled "An Efficacy and Safety
      Study of Levalbuterol, Racemic Albuterol and Placebo in Subjects Twelve Years of Age and
      Older with Asthma" were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
      active-controlled, parallel-group studies of up to nine weeks in duration (a one-week
      single-blind placebo run in period followed by an eight-week double-blind treatment period).
      Subjects who completed Studies 051 353 and 051 355 but who were not immediately eligible to
      rollover into the current study could also participate but only after a 30-day washout. New
      subjects and subjects who participated in the Phase III trials who were not immediately
      eligible (ie, had a >30-day washout) were considered to be de novo subjects.Study
      participation included 10 study visits over a 12 month period.
