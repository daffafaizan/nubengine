      approximately 20%. Sleep apnea is a common co-morbid condition, occurring in approximately
      half of patients with chronic HF, and often has predominantly central or mixed obstructive
      and central characteristics. Although it is associated with increased mortality in patients
      with HF, sleep apnea is usually asymptomatic and patients are therefore often unwilling to
      accept standard therapy with positive airway pressure. At the outset of this study, there
      were three treatment modalities currently recommended by the American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine for the treatment of predominantly central sleep apnea in HF patients: nocturnal
      supplemental oxygen (NSO), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive
      servo-ventilation (ASV). Recently, ASV was found to increase mortality in patients with heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction and central sleep apnea. There are only limited data
      on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these three modalities. The present study is
      designed to compare these modalities with respect to effects on ventricular function,
      exercise capacity, and other measures of cardiovascular risk.
