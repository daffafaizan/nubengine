      to evaluate the impact of permanent fixation (PF) versus non-permanent fixation (N-PF) of
      mesh in TEP repair for a primary inguinal hernia regarding chronic pain.

      Men between 30 and 75 years, consecutively registered in Swedish Hernia Register (SHR) for a
      TEP repair between 2005 and 2009 were included. A questionnaire was sent in 2010 including a
      general questionnaire, SF-36 and Inguinal Pain Questionnaire (IPQ). Primary endpoint was
      question two in IPQ, "worst pain you felt in the operated groin during this past week". Pain
      was defined as "pain present that could not be ignored". In adition a specific questionnair
      developed by the research group on pain and problems during sexual activiety were sent to
      patients between 30-60 years of age.

      The register was checked for long term recurrent operations.
