      comparison. Thirty subjects will use each lens type for two weeks in random sequence.
      Follow-up visits for each lens will be performed after two weeks of wear. Lenses will be worn
      on a daily wear basis.

      The final optical design of comfilcon A contact lens was optimized to improve the quality and
      two further studies (CV-18-10 and CV-18-11) were conducted after completion of this study to
      evaluate the modified optical design.
