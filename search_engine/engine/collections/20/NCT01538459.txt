      pain relief in the post-operative period. Dexamethasone as an adjuvant to local anesthetic
      has been shown to provide increased duration of block without adverse effects. Use of
      steroids as adjuvants are restricted to non-diabetics due to concern for increased plasma
      glucose from systemic absorption. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no
      difference(increase) from patient baseline(preoperative plasma glucose) in plasma glucose
      levels up to 4 hours post nerve block in patients who receive 8 mg of dexamethasone used as
      an adjuvant with local anesthetic to interscalene regional anesthesia. Research has
      demonstrated the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone as an adjuvant to local anesthetic in
      peripheral nerve block. Currently there are no studies which document any plasma glucose
      effects(or lack of effects) from dexamethasone used as an adjuvant to regional anesthesia.
      Currently dexamethasone is used clinically off label by anesthesiologists as an adjuvant in
      association with local anesthetic for nerve block anesthesia. Once studies are completed, the
      investigators hope to allow diabetics to also receive the prolongation of pain relief
      associated with the use of steroid as an adjuvant. In addition, the increased educational and
      pharmacological data gleamed from the data can potentially be utilized for future studies
      with dexamethasone utilized perineurally.
