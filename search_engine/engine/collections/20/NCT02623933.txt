      reported quality of life outcomes of an MR-integrated focal boost using HDR prostate
      brachytherapy. Eligible patients for this study will be determined by pre-brachytherapy MRI
      (DCE, T2 weighted and diffusion weighted) imaging, to identify a dominant intraprostatic
      lesion. The HDR dose prescription is 19 Gy to the whole gland ad 22.5 Gy to MRI visible
      lesion delivered in one fraction, assuming that dose constraints to critical organs can be
      met.
