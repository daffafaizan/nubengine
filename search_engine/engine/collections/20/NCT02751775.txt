      group meetings administered by the Mayor's Healthy City Initiative (MHCI). Meetings will
      include monthly meetings of the MHCI advisory boards composed of community stakeholders and
      focus groups of childcare center directors and parents. Stakeholders will create
      dissemination and implementation plans to leverage the findings of the project. We plan to
      conduct 2-3 focus groups of 8-10 parents and childcare directors, for a total of 16-30
      participants. Participation in the focus group part of the study will last approximately 1
      day.
