      (PERISCOPE) is a multi-centre, international observational study of a random-sample cohort of
      patients undergoing a nonobstetric in-hospital surgical procedure under general or regional
      anaesthesia during a continued 7-day period of recruitment.

      Participating centres throughout Europe will contribute routine clinical data describing all
      eligible patients who undergo surgery during a continuous week (7-days) at convenience of
      every department within a period of two months from May 1st to July 1st 2011. A questionnaire
      of around 50 items will be filled during the pre, intra and postoperative periods. The
      follow-up will end at discharge. The aim of the PERISCOPE study is to validate a simple score
      to predict postoperative pulmonary complications(PPCs). This score has recently been
      published in Anesthesiology and you can access linking to:

      TIMEFRAME Participants will be followed for the duration of in-hospital stay, an expected
      average of maximum 5 weeks.
