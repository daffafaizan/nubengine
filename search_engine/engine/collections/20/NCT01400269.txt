      of these treatments have not been investigated using scientifically rigorous methodology. A
      variety of developmentally based parent delivered interventions are gaining popularity as a
      type of treatment parents utilize to improve symptoms related to their child's diagnosis of
      autism. Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE)is a agency that provides a developmentally
      based parent delivered intervention in the community. Currently, this parent training program
      has not been evaluated using scientific methodology. Investigation into this community
      delivered treatment and its effectiveness to improve social and communication deficits will
      aid clinicians in providing better care for children with autism.
