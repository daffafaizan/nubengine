      technology in the form of a wristband. This wristband (Loop Band) uses optical sensors and
      spectrometry to measure and estimate vitals as well as a full blood gas panel; comparable to
      the standard method of an invasive arterial line and pressure transducer. The investigators
      aim to show equivalence of clinical physiologic outcome measurements with the Loop Band
      relative to current methods (i.e. arterial lines, etc.). In addition, this study aims to
      validate this wearable technology as a potential alternative to invasive measurements, to
      reduce complications, and improve accuracy in regards to patient monitoring.
