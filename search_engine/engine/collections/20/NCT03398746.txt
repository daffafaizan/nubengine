      children presenting to two Level 1 trauma centers over 12-months with subcutaneous skin
      abscesses necessitating drainage. Patients were excluded if the abscess was on the hand,
      foot, or face or if it required admission or operative intervention. Patients were followed
      over 10 days to determine the primary outcome of treatment failure defined by need for
      admission, IV antibiotics, or repeat drainage within 10-day follow-up. The secondary outcomes
      included ease of procedure, ease of care, pain after insertion and patient satisfaction using
      a 10-point numeric rating.
