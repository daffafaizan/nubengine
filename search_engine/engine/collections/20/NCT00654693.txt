      their vital signs filtered through software that generates alerts and records data. The alert
      engine will produce pager and application based pop-up alerts which will be sent to the
      research nurse. Low and high limit alarms will be set according to the published guidelines
      (Hillman, K. et. Al., Resuscitation 48(2): 105-10, 2001) and adjusted at will by the response
      team.

      During this portion of the study, the following research related procedures will be
      performed:

        -  begin continuous vital signs monitoring (BP - 1x per hour, 3 lead ECG -continuous, HR -
           continuous, SpO2 - continuous)

        -  PI or Co-PI will review each alert that's generated. The clinical significance will be
           determined and recorded in the study database

        -  Record patient's signs and symptoms daily

        -  Assess concomitant

        -  Assess AE's, SAEs
