      resection also have risk to lead postoperatively motor function deficits if destroy patients'
      motor cortex when tumor removed. Hence, it is important for neurosurgeon to realize the
      situation of patients' motor cortex locations in order to determine personal operative
      protocol.

      The blood oxygen level dependent fMRI (BOLD-fMRI) is a prevalent preoperative method to
      localization motor cortex. It shows motor relevant cortex by the change of blood oxygen level
      when patients cooperate to finish motor tasks. The advantage of BOLD-fMRI includes higher
      time and spatial resolution, higher sensitivity, non-invasive. However, its accuracy of
      localization has not been satisfactory because neurovascular uncoupling. The ZOOMit-fMRI is a
      novel technic which is evolved from conventional BOLD-fMRI to localize motor functional
      cortex.The advantage of ZOOMit-fMRI is smaller field of view (FOV) and higher spatial
      resolution comparing with BOLD-fMRI. That helps to reduce other region of brain interference
      and elevate accuracy of localizations.

      In this study, the investigators plan to enroll 60 patients, whose gliomas are involved in
      motor cortex, to acquire their BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI data in order to analyze their
      difference in the accuracy of motor cortex localization.
