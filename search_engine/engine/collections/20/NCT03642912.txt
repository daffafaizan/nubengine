      complications. They contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality of ECMO patients.
      This observational study aims to evaluate coagulation profiles of ECMO patients treated on
      the intensive care units of the Department of Anaesthesiology of LMU Munich. Adult ECMO
      patients are included in the study after informed consent.

      Bleeding and thromboembolic complications as well as treatment details are recorded.
      Additional coagulation laboratory markers (such as von-Willebrand-factor, ADAMTS13-protease,
      platelet function tests and thromboelastometric tests) are correlated with clinical signs of
      bleeding. Regular ultrasound examination of the large vessels are performed to Screen for
      thrombosis.
