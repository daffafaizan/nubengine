           use for the treatment of alopecia areata on adrenal function.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of intralesional corticosteroids (Kenalog-10)on hair regrowth
           in moderate to severe alopecia areata.

      18 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata were enrolled and 15 subjects completed
      all study visits.

      Subjects underwent intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (10mg/cc) (Kenalog-10) injections
      every 6 weeks for a period of 6 months in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). This
      period was followed by a 6 week, injection-free, safety follow-up visit. Adrenal function was
      assessed by utilization of the Low Dose Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Stimulation Test (ACTH)
      which measures adrenal gland production of cortisol after exogenously administered ACTH.
      Serum blood draws of 3 mL were done at baseline and 6-week intervals at the start of each
      scheduled appointment for intralesional treatment at approximately 0800 hours. Two blood
      draws were taken at time 0 and again 30 minutes after a 1 mcg bolus dose of synthetic ACTH
      (Cortrosyn).

      Patients underwent their scheduled course of intralesional corticosteroid (Kenalog-10)
      injections and other study data was collected, such as SALT scores and physician assessments
      of AA, during the time between blood draws.
