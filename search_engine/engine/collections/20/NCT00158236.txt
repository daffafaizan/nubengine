      often fail. Individuals with severe opioid withdrawal may experience shaking, muscle and bone
      pain, nausea, depression, anxiety, and drug craving. Buprenorphine, a medication that is used
      to treat opioid addiction, works by lessening the withdrawal symptoms. However, past research
      has shown that individuals who use buprenorphine are at risk for abusing the drug. Naloxone,
      another medication, is currently used to treat substance addiction. It is also used in
      combination with buprenorphine to reduce the risk of buprenorphine abuse in individuals who
      are physically dependent upon opioids. The purpose of this study is to compare the abuse
      potential of buprenorphine versus a buprenorphine and naloxone combination in non-dependent
      opioid users.

      This 7-week study will enroll non-dependent opioid users. Participants will take part in two
      medication challenge sessions per week. At each challenge session, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive varying doses of either buprenorphine; a buprenorphine and
      naloxone combination; hydromorphone, which is a medication used to treat moderate to severe
      pain; or placebo. Buprenorphine and naloxone will be administered as tablets that are
      dissolved under the tongue. Hydromorphone will be injected. During the challenge sessions,
      participants will complete performance tasks to measure psychomotor and cognitive
      functioning. Questionnaires and self-reports will be completed to assess medication effects.
      Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored throughout all sessions, and a specialized
      camera will be used to assess pupillary response of the eyes.
