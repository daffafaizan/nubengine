      adjuvant or palliative chemo-/ or radiotherapy are enrolled. Physical status is assessed by
      using the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) for endurance and by using the Handheld Dynamometer
      (HHDM) for strength (flexion and extension of elbow, hip and knee). Psychological performance
      is measured by standardized questionnaires (MFI, FACT-L, PHQ - 9). Data are collected at
      baseline (T0) and after the 8 weeks sports intervention (T1). Pts are instructed to train at
      least 5 times/ week in the inpatient setting. After discharge pts are instructed to train in
      a home-based setting at least 3 times/week for a period of 8 weeks. Feasibility is defined as
      an adherence of two trainings per week during at least 6 weeks (out of 8 weeks of the
      intervention).
