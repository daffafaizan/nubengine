    
      Eligible participants with screening central laboratory low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) values â‰¥ 75 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) were instructed to follow National Cholesterol
      Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP) Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC)
      diet and were assigned to 1 of the following 4 background lipid-lowering therapies for a
      4-week stabilization period based upon their screening LDL-C and its distance from the
      individual's required goal as stipulated by their NCEP ATP III risk category:

        1. no drug therapy required - diet alone

        2. low dose drug therapy required - diet plus atorvastatin 10 mg orally (PO) once daily
           (QD)

        3. high dose drug therapy required - diet plus atorvastatin 80 mg PO QD

        4. maximal drug therapy required - diet plus atorvastatin 80 mg PO QD plus ezetimibe 10 mg
           PO QD.

      If the participant met entry criteria at the end of the lipid stabilization period they were
      randomized 2:1 to receive evolocumab 420 mg or placebo subcutaneously once a month for 52
      weeks in addition to their background therapy.
