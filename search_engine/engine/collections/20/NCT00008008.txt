        -  Determine the response rate, disease-free interval, and overall survival of patients
           with malignant glioma treated with high-dose thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug enters the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Following a course of induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide IV over 4 hours,
      patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) daily until the completion of peripheral blood stem cell
      (PBSC) harvesting. PBSCs are collected over 3-5 days. Patients who do not mobilize sufficient
      cells undergo bone marrow harvest.

      Patients receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 5 hours on day -2. PBSCs or bone marrow are
      reinfused on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on
      day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2-3 weeks for a
      total of 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at every course, then monthly for 6 months, and then
      every 2 months thereafter.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
