      single center, outpatient, stepwise, rising dose study in male subjects with mild
      intermittent asthma to assess topical safety and tolerability of Albuterol Sulfate Acu-30™
      DPI, compared with Placebo Acu-30™ DPI. Increasing doses of each drug will be administered in
      a sequential fashion in 4 steps to 3 different subjects at each step (a total of 12 subjects)
      with mild intermittent asthma in each step.
