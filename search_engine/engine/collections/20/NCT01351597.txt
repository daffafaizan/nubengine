      platinum, liposomal anthracyclines, etc) have resulted in constant improvements in treatment
      efficacy and consequently in recurrent or metastatic outcome. This single arm, multicenter
      phase II study was designed to evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free
      survival of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with recurrence or metastatic breast
      cancer.
