      several feedback devices have been developed to improve the effectiveness of the training,
      they were neither realistic nor immersive. In addition, in conventional training programs,
      trainees are constrained in terms of time and location, as they are usually kept to a
      schedule.

      Virtual reality (VR) technology, which was designed to maximize immersion, could be used to
      overcome those limitations, which in turn may improve the effectiveness of CPR training.
      However, even with VR technology, procedures such as chest compressions, ventilation, and
      defibrillation cannot be implemented as in the real world. Extended reality (XR), which
      combines the virtual and real worlds, could overcome these limitations by facilitating the
      use of real-world manikins in the virtual environment.
