      therapy for acute myeloid leukemia with complex and/or monosomal karyotype.

      Subjects will receive decitabine for every 28 days, until disease progression or a bone
      marrow transplantation is carried out, in the schedule as below:

      Cycle 1:

      Receive decitabine for 10 days

      Cycle 2 and Cycle 3:

      Based on the result of bone marrow examination, subjects may receive decitabine for 5 days or
      10 days

      Cycle 4 until disease progression:

      Rdecitabine for 5 days. Subjects may also resume a 10 day treatment after cycle 6 if their
      physician judged as appropriate.

      The drug will then be administrated intravenously.

      Blood will be drawn every 7 days and bone marrow extraction would be done on Day 28 (+/-
      3days) from the day 1 of each cycle of treatment for examination.
