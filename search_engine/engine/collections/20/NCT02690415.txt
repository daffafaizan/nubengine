      with healthcare-associated infections. However, new epidemic strains have emerged outside of
      the healthcare environment designated community-associated (CA) MRSA. From 1999 to 2005,
      hospitalizations for Staphylococcus aureus-related skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in
      the United States increased 4-fold to nearly 90,000 annually. At Memorial Medical Center
      (MMC) Emergency Department (ED) and Express Cares (EC) there have been over 6500 visits in
      the last 6 years secondary to SSTI.

      Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest incision and
      drainage alone (without antibiotics) may be adequate management for uncomplicated MRSA skin
      abscesses. However, patients not receiving antibiotics are more likely to develop recurrent
      infections, which may be a result of persistent MRSA colonization. The investigators will
      conduct a prospective case-control study at MMC ED, EC and MMC primary care clinics of
      pediatric patients with skin abscesses comparing outcomes for those who received antibiotics
      (cases) versus those who did not (controls). This will not be an intervention study - both
      surgical and medical management of patients with skin abscesses will be at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      The central hypothesis is that the inclusion of systemic antibiotics in the management of S.
      aureus skin abscesses will decrease S. aureus colonization, and subsequently the incidence of
      recurrent SSTI in the year following baseline infection. To gain a better understanding of
      this problem, the investigators propose the following specific aims:
