    
      Tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) are a family of tyrosine kinases that bind neurotrophins,
      a family of growth factors important to the formation and function of the nervous system. In
      cancer, the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK)1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, which
      encode for the TRKA, TRKB and TRKC proteins, respectively, are subject to gene-arrangements
      that lead to kinase domain expression and constitutive downstream pathway activation. In
      preclinical models, NTRK gene fusions have transformative oncogenic potential, and they
      appear to be widely distributed across histologically diverse adult and pediatric cancers.
      Hence, these genetic abnormalities, observed in both children and adults, have recently
      emerged as targets for cancer therapy.

      Larotrectinib, a selective TRK inhibitor has showed marked and durable antitumor activity in
      patients with NTRK gene-fusion-positive tumors regardless of the tumor type, gene partner and
      patient's age.

      Because of this and the lack of alternative therapy in this rare but severe disease, the
      French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) granted in April 2019,
      a "cohort" Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU) in the indication:

      "Larotrectinib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients
      from one month, with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours with a Neurotrophic
      Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) fusion, refractory to standard treatments or in the absence
      of appropriate therapeutic alternative." Despite the potential benefit of identifying these
      fusions, the clinicopathologic features of NTRK fusion-positive tumors which are treated with
      Larotrectinib, are not well characterized.

      This study will provide information about the diagnosis and management of patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic NTRK fusion cancer treated with Larotrectinib under real-world
      treatment conditions in France, and describes the dosing patterns, safety and effectiveness
      of this agent.
