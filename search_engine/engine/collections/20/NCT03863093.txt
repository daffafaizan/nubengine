      in hand of undergraduate dental students as a single way to remove biofilm and the adjunctive
      application of ultrasonic piezo afterward for calculus removal and root planing only in the
      treatment of initial periodontal pockets.

      The sample size will be 15 patients. Initially, oral hygiene instructions with scaling and
      root planing will consist of the treatment phase. Each subject will be informed
      comprehensively about oral hygiene instructions using disclosing solution (such as
      erythrosine) and hand mirror. The participant will be shown modified bass technique and the
      proper usage of dental floss and appropriate interdental brushes.

      The control side will be treated with supra- and subgingival ultrasonic piezo scalers then
      supragingival polishing with rubber cup and a special fluoride containing paste as a
      traditional way of removal of plaque and calculus, while the test side, will be confined to
      erythritol powder by means of air polishing as the only way to remove ultrasonic piezo
      scalers.

      At the end of treatment, hand instruments may be used to ensure the smoothness 0f the teeth
      surfaces.

      Clinical measurements will be performed at baseline and at 2 weeks, 4 and 6 weeks for the
      plaque index and gingival indices, whereas probing will be performed only after 6 weeks.
