      replacement strategy remains unanswered. Although recent studies suggest that intraoperative
      fluid restriction may reduce postoperative morbidity and promote faster recovery,
      extrapolation to individual patients remains difficult. Indeed, whether fluid overload may
      expose tissue to oedema, impairing oxygenation and wound healing, fluid restriction may,
      conversely, expose to hypovolemia, which occurs frequently during abdominal surgery, leading
      to tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction. To date, the restrictive and liberal fluid
      substitution strategies have not been compared using a goal-directed approach. In addition,
      recent data suggest that targeting early indicators of hypoperfusion, such as central venous
      oxygen saturation (ScvO2), which reflects the oxygen delivery/consumption relationship, may
      be important in the management of patients undergoing major surgery. No data are available on
      the effects of intraoperative fluid volume replacement strategy on ScvO2 modifications.

      The purpose of this study is first to evaluate the influence of restrictive and liberal fluid
      replacement strategies on both hypovolemia and postoperative organ dysfunction using an
      oesophageal doppler goal-directed approach (with goal = peak aortic velocity variation and
      stroke volume optimization) during major abdominal surgery. The second objective is to
      investigate the effects of fluid loading on ScvO2 modifications.
