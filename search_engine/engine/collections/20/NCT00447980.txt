      vision and health. These visits may include visual exams, blood draw for laboratory testing,
      brief medical history and exam, and occasionally a questionnaire (survey), in addition to the
      visit for the surgical procedures. The primary effectiveness outcome for this study will be a
      visual field score one year after the implant surgery. There will be about 12 centers
      participating in this study, and up to 60 people enrolled, across the US. Each participant
      joining the study who has completed initial screening will then be scheduled to have a brief
      surgical procedure performed on each eye, one of which will include a very small cell-filled
      implant. Follow-up visits for repeat assessments will be required regularly to determine if
      the implant being tested is safe and effective for use to treat retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
