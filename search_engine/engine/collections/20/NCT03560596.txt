      to 23% among whites over the past decade. This increase is four times the nation's 9.7%
      growth rate, and accounts for more than half of the total U.S. population increase of 27.3
      million during this period. This growth is accompanied by a significant increase in
      cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related morbidity and mortality. Despite increasing trends in
      the awareness and treatment of hypertension (HTN) among all groups, Latinos have the lowest
      blood pressure (BP) control rates in the U.S. Although barriers to optimal HTN control such
      as poor access, and low awareness have been used to explain the disparities in BP control
      between Latinos and whites, BP control rates remain lower among Latinos who receive treatment
      compared to whites. This enigma may be explained by the disproportionately poorer adherence
      to prescribed antihypertensive medications among Latinos compared to whites. Poor medication
      adherence is a major contributor to inadequate BP control, and is associated with 125,000
      deaths annually. Despite over 30 years of research dedicated to understanding adherence
      behaviors in hypertensive patients, data in Latino patients is scant. More importantly,
      translation of adherence interventions to community-based primary care practices where
      majority of Latino patients receive care is non-existent.
