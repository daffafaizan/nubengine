      for Knee Osteoarthritis" is to determine the repeatability and reproducibility of various
      measurement techniques. The study will enroll healthy volunteers. All participants will
      receive x-rays and MRI examinations of the knees. Walking characteristics will be evaluated
      in a Motion Analysis Lab; this will involve taping reflective markers to participants' skin
      and having them walk on a level surface and up and down stairs. All participants will be
      evaluated two times, with a 1-week period between evaluations.
