      an organ donation scenario involving their mother. The possible vignettes consist of a
      Control condition, a Framing condition, a Normative condition and a condition that includes
      all the nudges. Participants are then given surveys to gauge their views and attitudes
      towards organ donation as a whole, their trust towards medical institutions and the doctors,
      their perceived manipulation from the doctor and their views on the altruistic nature of
      organ donation.
