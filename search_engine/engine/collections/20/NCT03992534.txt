    
      Pregnant women at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital and St Mary's Hospital London who
      are defined as being at a higher than background risk for preterm labour will be recruited
      into this study. Women at risk of pre-term labour will include those with either previous
      LLETZ, previous preterm birth, previous second trimester pregnancy loss or a combination of
      these indications.

      As part of this interventional study, subjects will be offered supplementation with L.
      crispatus CTV-05. The preparation of LACTIN-V is administered vaginally using a specially
      designed applicator.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether vaginal supplementation with L.
      crispatus CTV-05 is associated with colonisation.
