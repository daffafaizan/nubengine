      I. To collect samples from at least 25 women with advanced, high-grade serous ovarian
      carcinoma (OC), including Papanicolaou (pap) smears, uterine lavage, and a tumor sample.

      II. To test the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from pap smears and uterine lavage samples for
      tumor-derived TP53 mutations, using the new technology of Crispr-Duplex sequencing.

      III. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Pap smear or uterine lavage in detection of
      tumor-derived TP53 mutations.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo pap smear, uterine lavage, and collection of tumor sample during a
      planned surgery. DNA is then extracted from the samples and sequenced for TP53 mutations
      using Crispr-Duplex sequencing.
