      surgical intensive care unit. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and preventable cause of
      death in critically ill patients, with a mortality rate of up to 10%. Up to 95% of cases of
      PE originate from deep venous thrombosis (DVT). There are multiple pharmacologic and
      non-pharmacologic methods of DVT prophylaxis.The current standard of care in
      thromboprophylaxis in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at the University of Colorado
      Hospital is low-dose subcutaneous heparin (SCH). However, there is little evidence that this
      is the optimal prophylactic treatment. In fact, a database search of ICD-9 diagnoses made in
      2005 suggests that the incidence of DVT in SICU patients, the majority who receive
      subcutaneous heparin, is approximately 7%. Surgical ICU patients are at high risk of
      developing DVT during their hospital stay and likely need more aggressive anticoagulation.
      Intravenous heparin, given at a low dose and titrated to a measurable endpoint PTT (partial
      thromboplastin time), may offer several benefits over the current standard of care,
      subcutaneous heparin. This method of treatment would offer more aggressive anticoagulation
      and allow dosage to be adjusted frequently based on each patient's changing coagulation
      status.
