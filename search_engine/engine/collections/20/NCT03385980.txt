      understanding of clonal evolution in solid tumor patients is hampered by intra tumor
      heterogeneity (ITH), while remaining essential to the effective treatment of patients. Recent
      evidence suggests that branched evolutionary tumor growth may contribute to ITH both within a
      primary tumor and between primary and metastatic tumors. To study the full extent and
      consequences of ITH, and grasp clonal evolution, the investigators need to have access not
      only to circulating biomarkers (circulating tumor DNA) but also, simultaneously and
      separately, to the primary tumor and all its derived metastases. However multiple biopsies in
      live patients are neither medically feasible, nor ethical acceptable. A lesser known tissue
      collection method is through rapid tissue donation (RTD), which is the procurement of 'fresh'
      tissue within 2 hrs following the death of a patient. RTD-based research provides an
      effective way to investigate advance tumors biology in a manner not possible by any other
      means. With an RTD approach, the full extent and consequences of tumor heterogeneity can be
      evaluated by deep sequencing and global analysis of genetic alterations at the protein level
      of simultaneous core biopsies from several areas of the primary tumor and metastases and
      correlation with clinical outcome. To investigators' knowledge, no such studies have been
      done in Italy and are currently being pursued only in selected USA and UK cancer centers.
