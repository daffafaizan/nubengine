      what degree SSB warning labels increase consumers' knowledge about the potential health harms
      of SSBs and reduce SSB intake. The study is designed to answer two additional questions: 1)
      Do some warning labels work better than others? 3) If warning labels influence behavior, is
      it because they increase knowledge or simply provide a salient reminder that some drinks are
      less healthy? This aim is designed to test the effect of warning labels on total kilocalories
      (kcals) purchased and consumed by parents and children. We will examine how SSB warning
      labels influence snack and beverage purchases and intake among 405 racially and ethnically
      diverse parent-child pairs.
