      prediabetes who declined participation in a formal DPP despite invitation to participate at
      no out-of-pocket cost by their health plan. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 study
      arms: (1) a group that receives information on prediabetes, evidence-based strategies to
      decrease progression to diabetes, and a list of resources for mHealth tools for monitoring
      diet, physical activity, and weight (control group); (2) a group that receives the JOOL
      Health mobile phone application; and (3) a group that receives the JOOL Health mobile phone
      application and other mHealth tools (e.g. Fitbit activity tracker and wireless-enabled scale)
      whose results can be uploaded into JOOL.

      The investigators will use a mixed methods approach with a sequential explanatory design,
      which is to say that quantitative data and qualitative data will be collected in 2
      consecutive phases within the study. Specifically, in the first phase, investigators will
      collect and analyze qualitative data (e.g. focus groups) from a purposive sample of
      participants with differing levels of engagement and success. The rationale for this approach
      is that the quantitative data will provide a general overview of the intervention's efficacy
      and limitations, and the qualitative data will help to explain these findings by exploring
      participants' experiences and perspectives in more depth.
