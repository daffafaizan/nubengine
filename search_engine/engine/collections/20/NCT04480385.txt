      for real-time monitoring of cardio-respiratory parameters. The MultiSense速 strip measures in
      real-time, remotely and continuously 11 clinical key-indicators by being attached to the
      patient thorax: Electrocardiogram (ECG) trace, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory
      rate and relative respiration depth, pulse transit time, plethysmographic trace, perfusion
      index, skin temperature, physical activity and body position. Designed to be worn
      continuously for at least seven days, the patient can keep the patch during his sleep or in
      the shower.

      The aim of this study is to determine the quality of measurements of clinical signs provided
      by MultiSense速 strip in comparison to measurements made with conventional medical devices in
      the hospital setting, in terms of accuracy, connectivity, generation of artefactual data and
      stability of data transmission. The study population includes 60 patients undergoing visceral
      or digestive surgery. Once in the post-operative monitoring room, the MultiSense速 strip will
      be attached on patient's thorax. The monitoring will last 7 days through post-operative
      monitoring room (continuous comparison with reference monitor), general ward (comparison with
      spot-check monitoring) and patient's home.
