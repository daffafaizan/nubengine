      administered as a basal rate with additional insulin administration from the pump related to
      mealtimes.

      Insulin is physiologically secreted in a pulsate manner from the pancreatic Î²-cells with a
      period of 5-10 minutes, and this is responsible for plasma insulin oscillations with similar
      frequency. The oscillatory pattern is believed to optimize control mechanisms of insulin to
      enhance its action on metabolism.
