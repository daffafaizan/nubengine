    
      In the context of multimodal rehabilitation in colorectal laparoscopic surgery (Fast Track or
      ERAS (Enhance Recovery After Surgery)) multiple strategies have been introduced that have
      managed to improve patient recovery, decrease postoperative complications, decrease hospital
      days and decrease the overall costs per process.

      The possibility of performing individualized colorectal laparoscopic surgery with the minimum
      insufflation pressure guaranteeing optimal surgical conditions has not been evaluated and
      this would allow us to reduce the impact of surgery on the patient, decrease perioperative
      morbidity and improve patient recovery.

      In our study, abdominal compliance, Pv0 and maximal Pv were determined during the initial
      performance of the pneumoperitoneum, and then a stepwise protocol for the reduction of
      intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) insufflation was stablished with evaluation by the surgeons,
      until reaching the minimal insufflation IAP in which optimal surgical conditions are
      maintained.
