    
      This will be a prospective case control study. Children between the ages of 8 and 18 with
      suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) based on
      symptom criteria and who have been scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) by their
      primary gastroenterologist will be recruited.

      Children who do not have any history of esophageal disease or esophageal symptoms and are
      scheduled for EGD for other clinical indications (e.g. rule out celiac disease) by their
      primary gastroenterologist will be recruited and act as controls. Control subjects will also
      be given the opportunity to undergo esophageal MII-pH monitoring as part of their medical
      evaluation, but will not be excluded from analysis should they opt out of this part of the
      study.

      For all subjects, in addition to endoscopic evaluation, biopsies of the distal esophagus will
      be obtained for routine light microscopy (standard histology sample) as well as Transmission
      Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis to determine the presence and magnitude of dilated
      intercellular spaces (DIS), and immunoblotting for e-cadherin cleavage
