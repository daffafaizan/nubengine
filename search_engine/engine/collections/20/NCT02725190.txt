      (SD) could impact respiratory muscle endurance. A lack of inspiratory endurance could
      lengthen weaning from invasive ventilation. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether
      SD alters inspiratory endurance and to identify brain mechanisms involved in SD-induced
      decreased endurance. A group of 20 male healthy subjects will perform an inspiratory load
      trial after a normal sleep night and after a sleepless night. Electrophysiological parameters
      (EEG, motor evoked potentials) of the inspiratory motor command and sensory perceptions will
      be assessed before, during and after each trial.
