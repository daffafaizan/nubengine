      There are four DENV serotypes. Infection with one serotype results in lifelong immunity
      against that serotype, but only limited short-term cross-protection from infection with the
      other serotypes. Immunity to one serotype has a downside as subsequent infections by other
      serotypes increase the risk of developing more severe forms of dengue, which includes the
      most lethal form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever. Traditional epidemiologic and
      serologic-based estimates suggest a range of 50 to 100 million DENV infections per year
      distributed over 100 countries. Recent cartographic-based modeling studies suggest that up to
      390 million of dengue infections per year, of which 96 million are associated with clinical
      symptoms.
