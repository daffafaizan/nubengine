      mobile app (AtEase) that is designed to provide tailored behavior change guidance to promote
      pain self-management, healthy sleep habits, and effective stress management in a randomized
      clinical trial including 262 Veterans with chronic pain.

      Veterans will be recruited from VA Connecticut Healthcare, as well as from numerous diverse
      community recruitment channels (including employers, community groups that provide services
      for Veterans, Student Veterans of America, and social media).

      Eligible Veterans will be randomized to receive access to AtEase or the comparison
      intervention (a mobile-optimized adaptation of Chronic Pain Education for Veterans) for a
      total of 6 months. AtEase is a tailored pain self-management mobile app that tailors
      participant's feedback based on readiness to engage in pain self-management and preference
      for self-management strategies. Chronic Pain Education for Veterans is a free VA-endorsed
      publicly available pain management online educational curriculum that provides
      cognitive-behavioral therapy-based pain self-management materials.

      Between the baseline assessment and the 6-month follow up assessment, participants will have
      unlimited access AtEase or the Chronic Pain Education for Veterans program. All participants
      will complete follow-up assessments at 6 months and 12-months post-baseline.

      The primary outcome will be a comparison of PEG scores at 12 months follow-up. Secondary
      outcomes will include pain,Global Impression of Change; readiness to self-manage pain, manage
      stress, and engage in healthy sleep habits; well-being; and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
      Checklist scores.
