    
      VX15/2503-N-131 is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study of VX15/2503 in subjects with late prodromal and early manifest Huntington's disease.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of monthly IV administration
      of a single dosage of VX15/2503 (or placebo). Efficacy endpoints include determining the
      effect of VX15/2503 on brain volumes (MRI), FDG-PET imaging, 11C-PBR28 (TSPO) PET imaging
      (subset of Cohort B only) and clinical features of HD including cognition, motor function,
      behavior, functional abilities, global function and global measurement of change. Additional
      endpoints include PK / PD, immunogenicity, and exploratory biomarkers. Subjects in Cohort B
      that have received 12 months of VX15/2503 who volunteer will undergo a lumbar puncture at V13
      to collect cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to evaluate VX15/2503 mAb concentrations, total
      sSEMA4D levels, and other biomarkers in their CSF. Enrollment will involve approximately 276
      individuals who are 21 years of age or older with late prodromal (CAG-age product score (CAP
      score) of greater than 200 and Diagnostic Confidence Level (DCL) of 2 or 3) or early manifest
      HD (Total Functional Capacity (TFC) greater than or equal to 11). The study will be divided
      into Cohort A and Cohort B. Cohort A is now complete and an unblinded analysis has been
      performed. Cohort A subjects were treated for 6 months with either drug or placebo (1:1) and
      then all subjects were treated with drug for 6 months, followed by 3 months of follow up.
      Treatment duration for each subject in Cohort A was 12 months. Participation in Cohort A
      included a Screening visit, a Baseline visit within 30 days of screening; 12 monthly
      treatment visits beginning at baseline and continuing through Month 12; follow-up safety
      phone call at one month and a follow-up safety visit three months after the final infusion.
      Cohort A subjects participated in the study for approximately 16 months. Based on the
      analysis of Cohort A, it was decided to extend the duration of treatment for a subset of
      subjects in Cohort B to evaluate the clinical response to VX15/2503 after 36 months.
      Additional enrolled subjects in Cohort B will be treated with drug or placebo (1:1).
      Participation in Cohort B will include a Screening visit, a Baseline visit within 30 days of
      screening; 18 or 36 monthly visits beginning at baseline and continuing through Month 18 or
      Month 36; follow-up safety phone call or visit, and for a subset of subjects, a follow-up
      safety visit three and six months after the final infusion. Cohort B subjects will
      participate in the study for approximately 19 and up to 37 months.
