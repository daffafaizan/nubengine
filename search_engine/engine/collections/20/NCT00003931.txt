        -  Determine the frequency of partial tandem duplication of ALL1 (MLL) in patients with
           acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  Determine the predictive value of partial tandem duplication of ALL1 to identify a
           subset of AML patients who have a short duration of complete remission.

      OUTLINE: All samples are obtained from specimens collected on CALGB-9665. No additional blood
      or bone marrow samples are collected.

      Samples are examined by Southern blot analysis for gene rearrangement at 11q23. Samples
      showing evidence of ALL1 gene rearrangement are further analyzed by reverse transcription PCR
      amplification and/or cytogenetic analysis to detect partial tandem duplication of ALL1.
