      another. Primary VZV infection manifests as varicella (chicken pox). The virus then
      establishes a latent infection of the sensory ganglia from which it may reactivate years
      later to produce the clinical syndrome of Herpes Zoster (shingles). The initial cutaneous VZV
      lesions are pruritic, erythematous macules; and the lesions progress through maculopapular
      stage to vesicular, ulceration and crusting phases. The crusting phase signals the beginning
      of the healing process, and begins with clouding of the vesicular fluid, within about 24 to
      48 h after the appearance of each lesion. This is a Phase 2 study to assess: 1) the overall
      benefit of ARYS-01 (sorivudine) cream 3% vs. Placebo cream (with immediate or delayed use of
      Valaciclovir therapy) on Herpes Zoster rash healing rates and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN),
      2) the efficacy of ARYS-01 cream 3% vs. Placebo cream, prior to initiation of Valaciclovir,
      to build evidence for monotherapy treatment benefit of ARYS-01 cream on the initial onset of
      Herpes Zoster symptoms, 3) the efficacy of ARYS-01 cream 3% vs. Placebo cream, with immediate
      or delayed initiation of Valaciclovir, for synergetic effects on the initial onset of Herpes
      Zoster symptoms.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the effect of ARYS-01 cream (with or without Valaciclovir)
      on the reduction of the crusting stage of VZV rash present at Day 8. Secondary endpoints
      include time to cessation of new lesion formation, and time to cessation of Zoster-associated
      pains, pain intensity, rash healing and size reduction, and lesion dissemination.
