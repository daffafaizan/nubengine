      trauma. The direct health care costs related to osteoporosis are estimated to be $14 billion
      per year, comparable to costs in heart failure and asthma. Frailty, or poor physiologic
      reserve to deal with stressors, is estimated to be 7% in the general population over age 65.
      The frailty syndrome is characterized by sarcopenia or muscle loss, inflammation, low
      estrogen, growth hormone and testosterone levels, poor nutrition and disability, and is
      associated with an increased risk of falls and fracture. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish
      oil (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) have been shown to decrease
      markers of inflammation (cytokines) and decrease death due to heart disease. A number of
      studies in animals suggest that fish oil (EPA and DHA) supplementation inhibits bone break
      down, increases calcium absorbed from the diet and enhances calcium in bone. Few studies have
      assessed the role of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in the diet in bone disease in humans. As far as
      we know, no study has evaluated the role of n-3 fatty acids in the frailty syndrome.
