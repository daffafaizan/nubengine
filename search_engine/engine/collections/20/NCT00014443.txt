        -  Determine tumor response rate, duration of response, time to disease progression, and
           overall survival of patients with recurrent or refractory malignant glioma treated with
           topotecan and thalidomide.

        -  Determine safety and tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV continuously on days 1-21 and oral thalidomide daily
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
