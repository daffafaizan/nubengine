      are chronic relapsing disorders that often require long-term therapy and follow up .

      They are recognized for their complex pathophysiology that involves innate immune system
      deregulation and altered microbiome in genetically predisposed individuals. Non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from hepatic
      steatosis (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD patients are at high risk for
      liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Also NAFLD is typically
      associated with altered metabolism and metabolic syndrome (MetS).
