      thyroid lesions

        1. Main purpose

             1. to assess the performance of SWE for identification of benign and malignant thyroid
                nodules in multicenter study;

             2. calculate the optimal cutoff value for each parameter in multicenter study

        2. Secondary purpose to evaluate the application value of SWE for uncertain nodules by FNA.
