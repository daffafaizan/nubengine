    
      Patients in the age of 18 to 65 years with a high- risk relapse of a histology proven
      aggressive Non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma are eligible for the trial. Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma within this study is defined as:

      B-NHL:

      follicular lymphoma grade IIIÂ° lymphoblastic (precursor) lymphoma diffuse large cell cell
      lymphoma any subtype and variant including primary mediastinal lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma,
      blastic variant

      T-NHL:

      precursor T cell lymphoma peripheral T cell lymphoma, any subtype and variant
      angioimmunoblastic lymphoma anaplastic large cell lymphoma, any subtype NK / T cell lymphoma
      High risk relapsed or progressive disease is defined as (a) primary progressive disease, (b)
      early relapse after less than 12 month of remission duration and at least one risk factor
      according to the international prognostic index (IPI), (c) relapse or progression after high
      dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation, (d) relapse or progression and lack of an
      autologous stem cell product.

      Patients with this type of progression / relapse should receive rituximab plus
      ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (R-ICE) or rituximab plus dexamethasone/high dose
      ARA-C/cisplatinum as salvage therapy (recommendation, not part of study medication). In
      patients biwth T cell lymphoma rituximab may be replaced by alemtuzumab. If at least stable
      disease is achieved, patients can be definitely included.

      With inclusion, patients were randomized to receive either 375 mg/ m2 of rituximab at weeks
      3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26, 27, 28 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation or no additional
      medication.

      Conditioning for transplantation consisted of Fludarabine 125 mg/m2, Busulfan 12 mg/kg and
      cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg.

      Short-term (day 1 to day 28) mycophenolat mofetil and tacrolimus are used as basis GVHD
      prophylaxis in all patients. Anti-thymocyte globulin can be used due to the centres decision
      in patients with unrelated donors
