      reference placebo group are gargled and swallowed. 70 ml IgY/ placebo solution is gargled
      every night for two minutes (for maximal 24 months) The design will include the recruitment
      of 144 patients randomized in two groups (72 per treatment group) In order to compensate for
      dropouts (i.e. patients dropping out prior to 24 months without having an event) the total
      sample size was planned to be approximately 180 (i.e. ~20 % dropout rate). After the actual
      drop-out rate has been low throughout the study, only 144 plus approx. 10% potential
      drop-outs were included into the study.

      During the two years of treatment, subjects will be examined at the clinic every 3 months
      regarding safety and efficacy of the medication.
