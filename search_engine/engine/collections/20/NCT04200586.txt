      absence of coronary artery disease and hypertension. It is considered as a cardiac muscle
      disorder due to the metabolic consequences of DM characterized by left ventricular
      hypertrophy, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (in the early stage), and/or systolic
      dysfunction. To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective for the condition due
      to the incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis.

      Recent studies however prove the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors on reducing the primary
      composite end point of cardiovascular outcomes including hospitalization for heart failure,
      cardiovascular death, and all-cause death amongst patients with type II DM. Such clinical
      benefit is apparently mainly stemmed from the reduction in heart failure related mortality
      and sudden cardiac death rather than the macro-vascular events such as myocardial infarct and
      stroke, suggesting addition benefits going beyond the correction of hyperglycemia perse.
      These studies thus raise the possibility that the drug may have direct effects on the
      myocardium that conferring the clinical benefit not related the modification of traditional
      risk factors such as glycemic control, lipid, blood pressure, and obesity.

      A single-arm, observational cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study is proposed in type II
      diabetic patients before and 2 months after initiation of dapagliflozin. The aim is to
      identify mechanistic insights leading to the unexpected clinical benefit of SGLT inhibition.
