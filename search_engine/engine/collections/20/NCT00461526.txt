      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a new
      investigational drug in women for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. The investigational drug is a natural product taken from a plant that grows in
      South America. The study medication will be administered orally twice a day. Subjects will be
      not able to remain on certain standard IBS medications (anti-diarrheals) while participating
      in the study. The total duration of the study is 18 weeks.

      The study requires five study visits that include physical exams, ECG, blood draws,
      laboratory studies, and a colon procedure (such as a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy if
      an appropriate procedure has not been performed in the last 5 years.) Participants will be
      asked to make entries into a touch-tone telephone diary on a daily basis.

      Participants must meet all of the following criteria:

        -  Females at least 18 years of age

        -  Diagnosis of diarrhea predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome

        -  Willingness to make daily calls on a touch-tone telephone

        -  Willingness to have an endoscopic and/or radiologic bowel evaluation, if you have not
           received one in the past 5 years.

        -  Willingness to take an approved method of birth control (if required)

      Participants CANNOT meet any of the following criteria:

        -  Serious medical or surgical conditions

        -  Colon Cancer, Crohns Disease or Ulcerative Colitis
