      Endpoints (dependent on goal of therapy):

        -  Decrease in wound volume

        -  Decrease in size of the tunneling area

        -  Decrease in size of undermining

        -  Decrease in amount of slough

        -  Increase in granulation tissue

        -  The wound bed is progressing acceptably towards a transition to another treatment
