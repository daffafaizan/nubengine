    
      Primary Endpoint To identify the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of the combination of
      patupilone and RAD001

      Secondary Endpoints To assess the toxicity of patupilone and RAD001 To determine if
      concentrations of RAD001 are elevated in the presence of patupilone To evaluate tumor
      response using standard imaging modalities (CT scan, x-ray, bone scan) To develop
      pharmacodynamic markers that may predict or indicate response to mTOR inhibition or
      patupilone treatment.
