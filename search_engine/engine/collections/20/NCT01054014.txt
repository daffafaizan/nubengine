      treating of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. This study will compare the
      effects (both good and bad) of JNJ-40346527 to those of placebo (which looks like the drug
      being studied but has no active ingredients) in healthy volunteers. This study will be the
      first study in which JNJ-40346527 is given to humans. This study is being conducted in three
      parts. Parts 1 and 2 are randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind
      (neither the physician nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned drug) studies
      comparing the safety and tolerability of JNJ-40346527 to placebo in 96 healthy volunteers.
      Part 3 is an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the assigned drug),
      2-period crossover (meaning that volunteers will receive both treatments at different times)
      study of the effects of food on JNJ-40346527 in 8 healthy male volunteers. For Part 1, the
      participation period is a maximum of 64 days, including a screening visit, a 5-day in-clinic
      period and three follow-up visits. For Part 2, the participation period is a maximum of 83
      days, including a screening visit, an 18-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For
      Part 3, the participation period is a maximum of 59 days, including a screening visit, two
      4-day in-clinic periods separated by a 7 day break, and a follow-up visit. For all three
      parts of the study, safety evaluations, which will include ECG (a cardiac function test),
      vital signs and monitoring of side-effects will be performed. Additionally, blood and urine
      samples will be collected for evaluation. Volunteers will participate in 1 of 3 parts; Part
      1: volunteers will receive a single oral (by mouth) dose of JNJ-40346527 (10, 50, 150, 300,
      600, or 1000mg) or placebo; Part 2: volunteers will receive oral doses of JNJ-40346527 (50,
      150, 300, 500 or 750mg) or placebo once a day for 14 days; Part 3: volunteers will receive
      two oral doses of 150mg of JNJ-40346527 with and without food, with a 7-day break between
      doses.
