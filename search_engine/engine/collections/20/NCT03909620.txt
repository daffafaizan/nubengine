      early stage when it is treatable more effectively. There are several methods available for
      screening of lung cancer. These include sputum cytology, chest radiography, computed
      tomography (CT) of the chest, and positron emission tomography (PET). However, sputum
      cytology and chest radiography have been found to be ineffective as screening tests for lung
      cancer as there is no reduction in lung cancer mortality. The use of CT or PET for lung
      cancer screening may be associated with unacceptable levels of radiation exposure and
      enormous cost.

      Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest is a special type of CT, which uses
      relatively low radiation exposure to create a low-resolution image of the entire thorax. The
      radiation exposure associated with LDCT is 5-6 times less than that of a conventional CT scan
      of the thorax. LDCT screening has been to shown to result in a 20% reduction in lung
      cancer-specific mortality. Several national and international guidelines recommend this
      strategy for lung cancer screening.

      Despite these guidelines and recommendations by several organizations, lung cancer screening
      has not been established in several developing countries, where a controversy arises due to
      high rates of granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis. Emerging evidence indicates that
      false positive results with LDCT in developing countries may not be unacceptably high as
      previously believed.

      In this study, the investigators intend to assess the utility of lung cancer screening using
      low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in India, a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis.
