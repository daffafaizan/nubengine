      organ of the body.Cells in the brain; they need higher amounts of oxygen and energy than
      other organs in the body. Therefore, in order to maintain brain functions,rich and continuous
      blood flow and optimal oxygen saturation are required. Cerebral blood flow(SKA) is the most
      important factor in nutrition that provides oxygen saturation. Cerebral blood flow;Cerebral
      perfusion pressure(SPB) is affected by mean arterial pressure(MAP) and intracranial
      pressure(KIB).Under normal conditions, while SPB is constant, the conditions affecting blood
      pressure and cerebral venous return and elevation of KIB affect SPB.While normal cerebral
      blood flow is 50-70 ml/100 g/tissue/min;In cases where blood flow is interrupted,serious flow
      disruptions occur in cerebral circulation when the flow rate drops below 20 ml and vital
      conditions such as cerebral ischemia occur.

      In cerebral blood flow intensive care patients;it may be disrupted during some maintenance
      procedures that cause painful stimuli such as position change,head height,endotracheal
      suctioning,oral care, and invasive procedures.In the literature;It is reported that if the
      cerebral blood flow drops below 20 ml/100 g/min for 30 minutes,it will reversibly stop the
      function of neurons,and if it falls below 10 ml/100 g/min for 30 minutes, irreversible neuron
      damage will occur.Therefore, in order to prevent unwanted cerebral ischemia in intensive care
      patients;Before each procedure applied to the patient, the amount of oxygen in the
      bloodstream circulating in the brain tissue should be constantly monitored. In the last guide
      published by the Brain Trauma Association;It is recommended that partial carbon dioxide
      pressure(PaCO2) is 35-40 mmHg, partial oxygen pressure(PaO2) is above 60 mmHg, and arterial
      oxygen saturation is 90% and above.In order to preserve these values, the patients are
      followed up in the mechanical ventilator for a while in the first period they exit the
      operation.

      While the fact that the patients are connected to the mechanical ventilator may provide
      advantage in terms of providing continuous oxygenation,it may bring additional risks for the
      patients. Because the endotracheal suctioning suctioning need arises in the patient in the
      mechanical ventilator.There are important risks of endotracheal suctioning of mechanically
      ventilated patients with artificial in patients receiving mechanical ventilator support to
      prevent hypercarbia and hypoxia caused by secretion accumulated in the respiratory
      tract.These risks include hypoxia, arrhythmia, increase in
      MPD,hypertension,hypotension,agitation,pain,etc. countable.Especially during endotracheal
      suctioning, the increase of intracranial pressure in the patient, then the cough reflex
      induced and the high course of intracranial pressure after suctioning will disrupt cerebral
      perfusion,thus oxygenation of the brain is endangered.While blood flow and perfusion may be
      normal before and during the procedure,it changes to critical value afterwards and if it
      lasts more than 30 minutes,it poses a threat to patients.The position of the patient and the
      length of stay in the same position affect the cerebral circulation,reducing SPB.In this
      case,if the nursing follow-ups are insufficient or the attempts to protect the SME are
      ineffective;it becomes difficult for the brain to perform its functions, and even becomes
      unable to perform.

      In the intensive care units,raising the head and positioning is a routine nursing initiative
      in order to protect patients from KIB and cerebral complications that may occur due to
      KIB.Different head heights and body positions applied after the neurosurgical intervention
      have been observed to affect secondary complications by affecting SME, PB and SKA.According
      to researches; lateral position given by raising the head of the bed, long-term flexion and
      extension of the head, the head being constantly 45° high are positions that may be harmful
      for neurosurgical patients.In addition, it has been reported that rotating or repositioning
      causes more secondary brain damage(7%) by increasing the ICU compared to other nursing
      interventions applied to patients. Secondary brain damage may result from 5 minutes after
      nursing interventions or more than 10 minutes from the beginning of nursing intervention,20
      mmHg above KIB,60 mmHg below SPB,and 100 mmHg below systolic blood pressure. Responsibility
      of neurosurgical nurses;It is the safest way to provide the care that the patient needs
      without experiencing any undesirable side effects and secondary complications (respiratory
      events,cerebral ischemia,increased ICP,arrhythmia, etc.).This is directly related to the
      quality of the treatments. The results of the research showed that nurses should follow the
      cerebral oxygenation with non-invasive technique by constantly moving away from the invasive
      methods that cause many complications such as infection,arrhythmia,vascular injury to
      patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit.

      Since the oxygenation status of intensive care patients is measured and monitored with a
      pulse oximeter,the hypoxia state occurring in oxygenation in the brain tissue cannot be
      detected early. Standard methods used in the measurement of cerebral oxygenation have
      significant limitations in these patients.Jugular venous bulb oximetry measurement is an
      expensive method that requires invasive procedure;there is a risk of many complications such
      as infection on the patient, risk of tissue integrity deterioration,vascular injuries during
      bleeding of the catheter,bleeding; assessment of the measurement is essential by
      neurosurgeons;In addition, this method may miss regional ischemia.Non-invasive techniques
      such as transcranial doppler ultrasonography or electroencephalography(EEG) are other methods
      used indirectly to assess the adequacy of cerebral blood flow or the presence of
      ischemia.However,transcranial doppler and EEG are difficult to interpret by non-specialists.
      Cerebral oximetry device that measures oxygenation of the brain;It is important because it is
      a non-invasive method that monitors changes in cerebral oxygen metabolism,can provide
      continuous at the bedside, provides accurate and precise results as well as invasive
      methods,can provide nurses the convenience of interpretation independently in order not to
      cause secondary complications in nursing applications.Therefore,it can be easily evaluated in
      terms of nurses who are able to provide reliable and real-time data from several areas of the
      brain simultaneously, which is effective for the prevention and early detection of secondary
      injuries such as re-bleeding, vasospasm,cerebral ischemia,cerebral edema and seizure,and for
      24 hours of patients.Cerebral oximetry device that works with near infrared
      spectroscopy(NIRS) technology,which can be used as a bedside monitor, is considered to be the
      most suitable device for patients and healthcare workers.

      Studies have argued that low values in cerebral oximetry follow-ups may be predictors of
      hypoxic ischemic damage.In feasibility studies for the use of NIRS technology of
      neurocognitive and neurological complications during and after cardiac surgery;According to
      the transcranial doppler device of the cerebral oximeter device in adult patients;The use of
      this device has been suggested due to its advantages such as easy and uncomplicated
      use,clear,undoubtedly identifiable brain oxygenation, and nurses can evaluate
      independently.In studies, low regional regional oxygen level(rSO2) was directly and
      significantly interpreted with poor results after brain injury. In one study, the measurement
      of cerebral oxygen and hemoglobin values after vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage was
      done with transcranial doppler and NIRS and its correlation with cortical ischemia was
      examined. Transcranial doppler failed to detect vasospasm in four of the six cases, while
      NIRS detected changes in the brain cortex and basal vessels.In the study,it was reported that
      a decrease of 3.9-6.4% compared to the basal value occurring in regional oxygenation was
      cut-off values predicting high sensitivity(100%) and specificity(85.7%) vasospasm.

      When the literature is examined; Evidence that cerebral oxygenation monitoring is important
      in preventing complications such as delayed cerebral ischemia is clear. However, there is no
      evidence of the head height to be given during endotracheal suctioning and how long the head
      should remain in this position by affecting cerebral blood flow and KIB,which plays an
      important role in oxygenation of the brain.In a study,it is desired that the head height of
      neurosurgery patients should be 30 ° in terms of cerebral perfusion and should not exceed the
      45 degree angle. Ledwith et al. (2010) also reported that the head height of 30 degrees in
      the supine position decreases CRB. Coşkun et al. (2011), in patients with cerebral vascular
      disease who did not undergo surgical intervention, they observed tracheal suctioning with a
      head height of only 15 and 30 degrees, and an increase in cerebral blood flow with a head
      height of 15 degrees in the measurement performed with transcranial doppler 5 minutes after
      the applicationWhen the intracranial pressure is continuously high for more than 30 minutes,
      SPB will deteriorate and the cerebral flow will be interrupted.In randomized controlled
      studies,it has been reported that adequate cerebral perfusion is provided at head heights up
      to 15 degrees and 60 degrees, but the ideal head height specified as 15° and 60° is very it
      remained uncertain in a wide range. In the results of the meta-analysis study, it was
      reported that the most suitable head height in terms of serabral perfusion was 30 and 45
      degrees from 0,15,30 and 45 degrees in patients who underwent neurosurgery. However,it has
      been emphasized that the results related to the ideal head height are still contradictory in
      situations related to position change and other applications. In one study, when the head
      height was reduced from 30 degrees to 0 degrees in patients with head injuries, when the
      cerebral perfusion change was measured with NIRS technology; Cerebral perfusion pressure
      showed a significant change during the reduction of head height (p <0.001) and it was
      observed that the level of cerebral perfusion and oxy-hemoglobin increased by decreasing the
      head height. Although medical and nursing studies on this subject are still continuing today,
      there is no study investigating the effect of the ideal head height that should be within 30
      minutes required for stabilization of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during and after
      endotracheal suctioning.

      There are no studies on the use of NIRS technology in nursing applications for neurosurgical
      patients. Brogan et al. (2017) 's systematic review and metaanalysis study; It was emphasized
      that studies examining the benefits of this technology in patients with traumatic brain
      injury are insufficient, and that both doctors and nurses should prove the benefits of this
      technology before and inside the hospital by conducting experimental research. In a study in
      which cost analysis was performed in patients who were followed up using NIRS technology;It
      was determined that there was an average decrease of 1937 dollars per patient (p=0.036) and
      it was pointed out that NIRS is a sensitive and reliable monitoring tool that eliminates the
      need for special nursing care. In line with these results,it is predicted that the nurses who
      are with the patient for 24 hours and who participate in the care and treatment of the
      patient can provide significant benefits for the patient by using this technology.With the
      simple use of this technology by nurses in intensive care settings, it is aimed to prevent
      many problems that may occur in patients and it is also thought that it will be
      cost-effective in patients with long hospital stay.
