    
      A single arm study defining the recommended dose of PR104 for each subpopulation in this
      patient population.

      Following informed consent, subjects will undergo baseline evaluation with a history,
      physical exams, blood work, and disease assessment. Subjects will be assigned a dose of PR104
      based on a Bayesian model maintained at the Statistical department at MD Anderson Cancer
      Center. The model will be updated with both toxicity and efficacy data as it is generated for
      each subject. New subjects will receive the currently predicted best dose for their
      respective subset based on prior treatment, age and duration of prior response.

      PR104 will be administered initially as induction therapy for up to 3 cycles. Response will
      be assessed around day 42 (+/- 2 days) of the study. Subjects who obtain a CR or CRp will
      receive consolidation therapy for up to 4 additional cycles.

      Subjects will be evaluated each week during the induction phase of the study. During the
      consolidation phase of the study, subjects will be evaluated on Day 1 of each cycle and as
      clinically indicated. Subjects with clinically significant progression will be removed from
      study.
