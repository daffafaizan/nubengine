    
      Upon careful review of all available efficacy and safety data from the study phase Ib part,
      Novartis decided to not start the study phase II part.

      This decision was in no means triggered by an unfavorable safety profile of the combination.
      The observed safety profile of the combination represents contributions of the individual
      safety profile of trametinib and ribociclib.

      No new safety signals were observed.

      The study was closed early in line with protocol Section 4.4.
