      social behavior, cognition, stress physiology, and physical health. OT is released in adult
      humans and dogs during affiliative forms of human-animal interaction (HAI), and HAI
      attenuates AVP release in dogs. Thus, HAI may provide a safe and effective approach for
      stimulating endogenous OT release, and inhibiting endogenous AVP activity. The investigators
      will recruit a sample of typically developing 8-10 year old children who will engage in
      structured HAI sessions with a familiar companion dog or unfamiliar dog, compared to a
      nonsocial control condition.
