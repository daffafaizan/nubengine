      EGM recorded with the AnalyST ICD, patients enrolled will have to be already diagnosed as
      presenting the Brugada Syndrome. They will undergo an ajmaline test, to unmask the type
      1-ECG, characteristic from the Brugada syndrome.During the test, both surface ECG and
      intracardiac signal will be continuously recorded; then the signals will be compared in terms
      of amplitude of the ST shift, duration of the shift, and recovery period.
