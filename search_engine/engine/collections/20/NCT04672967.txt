      study of 100 children aged 18-60 months that have been referred for an ASD evaluation by a
      physician to assess the feasibility of a blood test that measures a set of blood plasma
      metabolites and the classification algorithm developed thereof to predict the risk of ASD.

      The secondary objective is to collect additional information for subclassification of
      participant cohorts including Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and Mullen Scale of
      Early Learning (MSEL) as well as any comorbidities that may correlate with our blood test
      scores.
