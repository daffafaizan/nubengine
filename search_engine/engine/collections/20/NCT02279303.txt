      to a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving a 2 (group) by 3 (time) repeated
      measures design. The intervention will stimulate dietary behavior changes using
      individualized anti-inflammatory dietary prescriptions with six monthly workshops (culinary
      demonstrations, recipes and meal planning) and behavior change cures reinforced through
      evidence- and theory-based patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and tailored
      newsletters personalized to individual readiness for change. Control participants will
      receive minimal nutritional information at baseline, monthly American Cancer Society
      survivorship brochures, and two telephone calls prior to assessment appointments. Groups will
      be compared at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Dependent measures will include
      dietary behavior and levels of cancer-associated biomarkers.
