      compromised due to early postoperative pulmonary complications. The risk of pulmonary
      complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atelectases, and early
      ventilator-associated pneumonia remains inappropriate. Therefore, the maneuvers improving
      pulmonary aeration and the early restoration of spontaneous breathing activity can be of
      clinical value. Protocol-driven liberation from mechanical ventilation (CMV) can decrease the
      duration of CMV as well as the number of pulmonary complications. INTELLiVENT-Assisted
      spontaneous ventilation (INTELLiVENT-ASV) is a new approach, that may be as effective as
      conventional protocol-driven liberation from CMV.

      In parallel, the thorough postoperative monitoring of pulmonary function during both
      postoperative mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing is also of a great value. One
      of the novel approaches to respiratory monitoring is Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI). The
      Integrated Pulmonary Index merges four vital parameters including end-tidal carbon dioxide
      (EtCO2), respiratory rate, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured by capnography
      and pulse oximetry into a single index value utilizing fuzzy logic model .
