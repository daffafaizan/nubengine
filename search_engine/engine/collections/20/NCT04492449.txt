    
      The present study will be included pregnant women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy
      (from the 27th gestational week), aged 18-40 years, with regular follow-up with the
      obstetrician and who present adequate systemic health during pregnancy, without the need for
      absolute rest. In subprojects 1 and 2, pregnant women who tested positive for IgM and IgG
      serology will be evaluated. Pregnant women who test positive (n = 60) and pregnant women who
      test negative (n = 60) for coronavirus sars-cov-2 will be selected, making a total of 120
      pregnant women. In project 1 the sample will be divided into 4 groups of pregnant women: GOC-
      with excessive weight gain and with COVID19 (n = 30), GOSC- without excessive weight gain and
      COVID19, GNC- without excessive weight gain and with COVID19 (n = 30) and GNSC- without
      excessive weight gain and without COVID19 (n = 30). For subproject 2 that will have proteomic
      analysis, the number of 10 patients for each group (GOC, GOSC, GNC and GNSC) will be adopted
      according to previous protocols for saliva proteomic analysis. Subprojects 3 and 4 will
      consist of babies, to identify possible congenital changes during the fetal period. In
      subproject 3, the 120 babies of the pregnant women participating in the study will be divided
      into BC (n = 60) and BSC (n = 60), which will be evaluated for the occurrence of the
      congenital syndrome associated with the presumed maternal infection by coronavirus sars-
      cov-2. In project 4, the sample will consist of 20 babies with congenital malformations for
      the case group (BM) and 20 control babies without congenital malformations (BSM), exposed to
      COVID19.
