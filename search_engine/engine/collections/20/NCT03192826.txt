    
      In this prospective, randomized, double masked clinical trial, patients scheduled to undergo
      Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy for posterior capsule opacification are randomized in 3
      groups. The Brimonidine group receives 1 drop of Brimonidine 0.2%. The
      Brinzolamide/Brimonidine group receives 1 drop of Brinzolamide 1%/Brimonidine 0.2% fixed
      combination. The Control group receives artificial tears. All groups are administered a
      single drop instillation, approximately one hour before Nd:YAG application. Intraocular
      pressure measurements are performed before treatment (baseline) and at the 1, 3, 24 hours and
      1 week post treatment.

      Dexamethasone ophthalmic drops are prescribed q.i.d. for one week after the procedure.
