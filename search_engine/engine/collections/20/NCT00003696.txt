        -  Compare the effect of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide with carboplatin and
           paclitaxel on progression free survival in patients with extensive stage small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Compare the overall survival, response rate, duration of response, and toxic effects of
           these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to institute and
      performance status (0-1 vs 2-3).

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin IV on day 1, and etoposide
           IV on days 1-3 every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1
           every 3 weeks.

      Patients with stable or responding disease are treated for up to 5 courses.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued within 24
      months for this study.
