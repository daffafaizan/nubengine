      presence of multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic often associated with psychiatric
      co-morbidity. The expression of tics range from brief, recurrent and non-rhythmic motor or
      vocal actions (simple tics) to complex motor or vocal sequences (complex tics). The
      pathophysiology of tics is not yet fully understood. Recent imaging data suggest that the
      pattern of functional connectivity in cortico-basal ganglia networks is disrupted in GTS
      patients and could reflect a defect in brain maturation. However, regions involved in the
      immediate genesis of tics remains unknown since it is difficult to capture on line the
      cortical changes associated with tic generation using imaging techniques due to moving
      artefacts. Moreover, tics are much more frequent in everyday life conditions than in the
      artificial conditions of a laboratory. The aim is to study cortical activity changes
      occurring before tic occurrence by using long duration recording of encephalographic activity
      (EEG) in ecological conditions through Holter EEG techniques (24h recordings). Recordings
      will be performed in 15 patients with a severe form of Tourette's syndromes. EEG changes will
      be correlated to event markers, voluntary monitored by patients or automatically recorded
      (accelerometers for motor tics). EEG epoch centered on tics will be compared to similar
      epochs without tics. The occurrence of tics will also be correlated with neurovegetative
      markers of emotions such as RR interval ECG variability and skin resistivity changes. The
      ultimate goal of this project is to define a potential therapeutic target of tics for chronic
      cortical stimulation.
