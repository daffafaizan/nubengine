    
      The group of experts at High Authority of Health (HAS) has defined the places of first and
      second-line workers in specific disorders of development and learning, as defined in the
      international diagnostic classifications CIM 11 and DSM 5. The referral to a second-level
      structure, a multidisciplinary structure in charge of carrying out the different cognitive
      assessments, requires a preliminary evaluation.

      This orientation is based on a medical consultation, carried out by a doctor specialized in
      the field, with an exploration tool adapted to the different fields concerned.

      The BMTi, a battery of third-generation tests (after the BREV and then the EDA) will enable
      the doctor, from 2018, to carry out this orientation in a relevant way in response to
      children with a complaint about neurodevelopment and learning. .

      The research project aims to validate this hypothesis, by comparing the diagnoses posed in a
      conventional way with the various multidisciplinary assessments, with the results of the
      transfer of all or part of the subtests of the BMTi by a doctor of second resort.

      This research project finds its place in a more global approach for a complete application of
      the recommendations of the group of experts of the High Authority of Health with:

        -  the systematic evaluation of educational prevention strategies by intensive training in
           small groups of children with similar needs, in schools,

        -  the evaluation of the role of the primary care physician in the prescription of the
           initial investigation report in the face of a simple reading, writing or numeracy
           disorder (research project with letter of intent filed in the framework of the call for
           tenders 38/5000 general direction of the offer of care (DGOS) PREPS 2018),

        -  the current project to validate referral tools to second-level appraisals,

        -  an evaluation project of the financing modalities filed under the regional health agency
           "Occitanie" in the framework of the call for tenders of article 51,

        -  the introduction of training courses for the first and second-line tools for ambulatory
           doctors.
