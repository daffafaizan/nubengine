      Enable® aortic bioprosthesis in a post-market real-world setting.

      This is a Non-randomized, prospective, non-interventional multi-center post-market release
      (PMR) study. Up to 800 subjects will be enrolled at up to 40 centers in Europe. After aortic
      valve replacement with the Enable® aortic bioprosthesis, each patient will have routine
      follow-up visits at the following intervals: at 30 days post-implant (at 30 days post-implant
      or prior to hospital discharge, whatever comes first), within 6 months following
      implantation, 1 year and annually thereafter up to 5 years post-implant.
