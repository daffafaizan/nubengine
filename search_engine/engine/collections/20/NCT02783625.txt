      romidepsin and duvelisib with bortezomib. All patients must have a relapsed or refractory
      T-cell lymphoma. The design is a standard 3+3 dose escalation of two parallel phase I
      studies. Patients will be enrolled in Arms A (Romidepsin + duvelisib) and B (Bortezomib +
      duvelisib) of the study starting at dose level 1.

      Three to six patients will be initially treated in each dose level until the MTD is
      determined. If dose level 3 is achieved without exceeding one dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
      after 1 cycle that dose level will be deemed the "optimal dose" and the study will proceed to
      the cohort expansion phase. Should patients be found to develop significant toxicity or not
      tolerate therapy at the MTD with repeated cycles of therapy, the "optimal dose" may be
      determined to be at dose levels less than the MTD. Patients with measurable disease treated
      in the phase I at the optimal dose will be counted towards the accrual of the expansion
      cohorts by disease subtype and all efficacy and toxicity endpoints.

      Cohort Expansion Phase: The expansion cohorts will further assess toxicity and safety and
      allow a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the combination to provide background for a
      potential future subtype specific phase II study. The assessment of efficacy will be
      descriptive.
