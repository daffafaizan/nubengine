      typically in response to chemical, thermal, tactile or osmotic stimuli. Dentine
      hypersensitivity may be treated by either making the nerve in the tooth less sensitive or by
      occluding the tubules to limit exposure of the nerve to external stimuli. Bioactive and
      biocompatible glasses react with oral fluid to deposit a mineral that is chemically analogous
      to that found in both enamel and dentine thus preventing exposure of the nerve to external
      stimuli.

      A number of controlled clinical trials have been reported indicating that a calcium sodium
      phosphosilicate bioactive glass, when incorporated into a toothpaste formulation,
      significantly reduce pain from dentine hypersensitivity. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of two currently marketed toothpastes, containing 5% calcium sodium
      phosphosilicate and the other containing 7.5% calcium sodium phosphosilicate in the treatment
      of dentine hypersensitivity compared to a matched placebo control.
