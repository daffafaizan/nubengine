      the calf veins (distal DVT). The proportion of distal DVT that propagate to the proximal
      veins, increasing the risk of pulmonary embolism, is not known. The best treatment of
      isolated distal DVT is therefore controversial and options include no treatment, follow-up
      scanning and treatment of only those patients with thrombus propagating to proximal veins,
      and full anticoagulation for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months.

      There is good evidence that the 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients with a negative CUS
      that is limited to the proximal veins is low, in the order of 1%. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that patients treated with a short period of anticoagulation (4-6 weeks) have a
      low risk of developing recurrent DVT or PE. In addition, the specificity of CUS for distal
      DVT is lower than that for proximal DVT, increasing the proportion of false positive
      findings, making it likely that a proportion of patients diagnosed with distal DVT are
      treated unnecessarily, with the attendant risks of major and fatal haemorrhage.

      The need for anticoagulation of patients with distal DVT to prevent recurrent DVT is
      therefore uncertain, however a survey of current practice suggested that most patients with
      this condition currently receive antithrombotic therapy. The impact of anticoagulation on
      initial patient symptoms, and the subsequent risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome are also
      unclear, and may be a possible alternative justification for antithrombotic therapy.

      In this proposed multicentre, prospective, cohort study, we plan to determine if a shorter
      duration of anticoagulation (minimum 2 weeks) is a safe and effective treatment for isolated
      distal vein thrombosis.
