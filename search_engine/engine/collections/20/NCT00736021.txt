    
      The study evaluates the hypothesis that large doses of Escitalopram will reduce symptoms of
      chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

      Forty adult survivors of carefully documented traumatic events who had been followed for more
      than two years and have not improved will receive up to 40 mg of Escitalopram (daily) for
      twelve weeks

      Symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, quality of life and global clinical
      impression, as well as emergent side effects will be recorded every two weeks (one week for
      the first four weeks.

      The primary outcome measure will be symptoms of PTSD as recorded at the end of the study (or
      the last meeting with the patient - Last Observation Carried Forward).

      The secondary outcome criteria will be treatment continuation, as expressed in the proportion
      of patients leaving the study for either lack of effect or side effects.
