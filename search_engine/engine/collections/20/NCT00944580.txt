      neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteogenic sarcoma, three relatively common solid tumors
      that in some cases can be associated with a high risk for relapse. In this study each subject
      will be screened for the presence of these antigens, and an individualized vaccine will be
      developed and administered using the subject's own dendritic cells (DC).

      This study consists of two phases: a screening phase and a treatment/vaccine phase. First,
      eligible individuals will be consented into the screening phase. Tumor specimens will be
      tested by immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR for the presence of MAGE- A1, MAGE- A3, and
      NY-ESO-1. Those testing positive for one or more antigen can be consented for the treatment
      phase of the study. Blood will be drawn for DC culture, and approximately one month later a
      series of three vaccines will be administered at two week intervals. Subjects will receive a
      topical medication called imiquimod to the vaccine site prior to and following each
      injection, to help immune cells travel into the area. Study participation occurs over 18
      months and also involves periodic physical examinations and blood draws.
