      indicates a poor outcome. Some clinical scales may play an important role in its diagnoses
      and treatments. Across the reviewed studies, the risk factors of END, which included
      biochemical parameters, neuroimaging, ect. were explored incompletely and the effective
      predictors of END is unknown. We aimed to explore the risk factors of END and investigate the
      predictive value of certain scales.
