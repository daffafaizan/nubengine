      with inadequate nutrient input; at the same time, the ingestion of unavailable carbohydrates
      have presented an inverse relationship with the risk for these diseases. Among these
      carbohydrates is inulin, a fructan considered as a prebiotic and the unripe banana flour,
      rich in resistant starch, which may contribute to the intestinal health.

      This study evaluated the effect of regular intake of frozen soups added functional
      ingredients (fructans and unripe banana flour) by heath volunteers, about gastrointestinal
      hormones, satiety and bowel movements.
