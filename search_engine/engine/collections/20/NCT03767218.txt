    
      Objective: To determine whether late follicular stimulation using recombinant-human FSH has
      comparable outcomes to treatment using recombinant-human FSH in early follicular phase in a
      flexible GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonist protocol, in oocyte donor patients.

      Design: Open label, phase 3 pilot randomized trial using a two-arm design with 1:1 allocation
      ratio

      Patients: Oocyte donors (aged 18-36 years)

      Intervention(s): Reference group: Start of ovarian stimulation with recombinant-human FSH
      (Bemfola 225 IU daily) from day 2 of follicular phase onwards. Initiation of GnRH antagonist
      (ganirelix, 0.25mg/day) on stimulation day 6 till day of trigger.

      Investigational group: Start of ovarian stimulation with recombinant-human FSH (Bemfola 225
      IU daily) from day 12 of the menstrual cycle onwards. Start of GnRH antagonist (ganirelix
      0.25mg/day) when serum LH (Luteinizing Hormone) > 10 IU/L, till day of trigger.

      Oocyte maturation trigger with GnRH agonist (0.2mg Gonapeptyl) in both groups.
