      Chung Hospital (KCH). The patient with informed consent will be randomly assigned to exercise
      coaching or psychoeducation group to prevent decline in cognitive and functional outcomes
      known to be common in this group. This comprises locally-tested evidence-based intervention
      strategies such as exercise and Yoga intervention, combined with exercise coaching to
      consolidate the exercise habit. Each of the intervention includes 28 sessions spanning
      for16-week.
