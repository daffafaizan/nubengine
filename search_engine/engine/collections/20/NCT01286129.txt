      to control challenge, allergy skin prick tests and methacholine inhalation test will be done.
      Prior to first allergen challenge, skin titration will be done using tenfold dilutions of the
      allergen chosen for nasal challenges. Subsequent to baseline visit, a control challenge will
      be done, followed, a week later, by repeated NACs. NACs will be done over 4 consecutive days,
      in the morning. Nasal peak inspiratory flows (NPIF), oral peak expiratory flows (PEF), and
      symptoms will be recorded at baseline and at regular intervals over 7 hours post-challenge on
      each challenge day. Induced sputum and nasal lavage specimen will be obtained 7 hours
      following the control challenge and the first and last NAC.
