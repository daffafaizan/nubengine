      ventilation the lung operated by the surgeon. It is recommended to perform a bronchoscopy
      which is the reference examination to confirm the good position of these probes. The interest
      of systematically controlling the good position of the left selective intubation probe by
      fibroscopy is controversial.

      The interest of ultrasound for the diagnosis of pleuro-pulmonary pathologies is certain in
      resuscitation and emergency context for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, haemothorax and
      atelectasis.

      The use of pleuropulmonary ultrasound in anesthesiology is the subject of studies. Several
      teams used it to ensure proper endotracheal tube positioning and to diagnose selective
      intubation. In fact, it has been shown that to control the position of the probe more
      precisely, ultrasound is more efficient than auscultation.

      The aim of this work is to show by a large-scale prospective study that pleuropulmonary
      ultrasound associated with the clinical examination confirms the exclusion of the operated
      lung. the absence of systematic control of the positioning of the probe by fibroscopy allow
      financial gain and a reduction in the risk of morbidity related to the realization of this
      invasive gesture.
