      B generalized periodontitis (GP-B; n=20), and Stage III Grade C generalized periodontitis
      (GP-C; n=20). Clinical periodontal parameters (plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on
      probing (BOP)) were measured. The amino acid analysis in saliva was accomplished by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) as mean concentration.
