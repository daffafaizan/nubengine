    
      Subjects who qualify will be approached and those consenting will be enrolled to undergo a
      baseline evaluation. Subjects without a clinical diagnosis of dementia and with a Mini Mental
      State Examination score (MMSE) score â‰¥ 25 will undergo neurocognitive assessment (MoCA),
      psychosocial and QoL assessment before randomization.

      Subjects will undergo regular visits (in-clinic, and/or by phone, or video conferencing)
      every 6 months during the treatment period. Subjects will take either rivaroxaban 15 mg or
      standard of care.

      An independent clinical event committee will classify all endpoint events. An independent
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) was established to monitor the progress of the study
      and assure the safety of subjects enrolled in the trial.
