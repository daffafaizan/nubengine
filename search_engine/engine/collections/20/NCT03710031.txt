      protocols improve. However, HSCT survivors face many mental, emotional, and physical
      challenges that threaten quality of life (QOL), which, according to the American Society of
      Clinical Oncology, is the most important treatment outcome next to survival. Psychoneurologic
      symptoms (PNS) significantly diminish QOL after HSCT. PNS often co-occur and may be
      associated with inflammation related to perturbations of the gut microbiota. This project
      will track the interplay among these factors in 50 adult survivors of HSCT to lay the
      groundwork for a targeted dietary self-management intervention to mitigate PN symptoms.This
      is to be achieved by elucidating the complex bio-behavioral mechanisms of distressing
      symptoms in HCT patients such as neurocognitive dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, depression and
      pain, inflammation (cytokines and C-reactive protein), gut microbiota [(GM) richness and
      diversity] and diet (macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats and proteins).
