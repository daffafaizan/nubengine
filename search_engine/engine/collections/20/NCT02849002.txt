      into understanding the signal features within a BrainPulse recording that are only present
      when the subject has a confirmed concussion. The initial pilot blinded study with Stanford
      University showed that there is increased energy in the 8-15 Hz range for BrainPulse
      recordings from adolescent male football players with a confirmed concussion. The current
      un-blinded study is designed to record the BrainPulse signal from a more diverse subject
      population to represent patients who have been diagnosed with a concussion in clinic setting.
      Subjects will include males and females ages 13 and older.
