    
      ING114916 is an open-label, multi-center EAP to allow access to patients with HIV-1 infection
      who have documented raltegravir or elvitegravir resistance, have limited treatment options
      and require dolutegravir to construct a viable anti-retroviral regimen for therapy. Patients
      must not be eligible for another ongoing dolutegravir clinical trial in order to participate
      in this EAP.

      The duration of patient accrual into the study will extend until dolutegravir receives local
      (by country) regulatory approval.
