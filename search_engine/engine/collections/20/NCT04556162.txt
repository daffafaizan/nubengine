      Current advices are to follow and supplement if needed, however the way to follow salt
      depletion is unclear.

      The best way is to calculate fractional salt excretion. This needs a simultaneous blood and
      urine sample for electrolytes and creatinin. Urinary surrogate markers have been validated on
      only 10 patients.

      At the annual check-up patients with cystic fibrosis receive these measurements. The
      investigators will collect the measurements and calculate fractional excretion and the
      possible surrogate markers on urine. Further this will be correlated to nutritional and
      pulmonary status and patient subgroups at risk will be identified.
