      study. Initially 77 apparently healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in the study.
      62 volunteers were enrolled in the study and assigned to either the MM group (n = 32) or the
      placebo group (n = 30) using a stratified randomization to guarantee comparability of age,
      sex and BMI distribution between the two groups. The randomization code was prepared by a
      staff member who was not involved in running the trial, by using computer-generated random
      numbers. At the initiation of the study, the subjects received 5 bottles (0.5L each) of the
      MM or placebo, which were made indistinguishable by their identical packaging. At 4 weeks the
      subjects received again 5 bottles. The subjects were asked to consume 80mL per day,
      preferably after meals. The dose was chosen based on the commercially recommended level. At
      each visit, the remaining volume of the supplement was counted by research coordinators. The
      subjects were excluded from the analysis if they consumed <80% of the recommended dose.
