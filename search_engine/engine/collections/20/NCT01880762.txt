      at NYU-FPO MRI, Tisch Hospital, NYU Medical Center, Department of Radiology, HCC basement.
      This protocol utilizes routine, Dixon sequences and multi-echo MR "spectroscopic" sequences,
      allowing quantization of the fat water and trabecular moieties of marrow. The opposed phase
      portion of a Dixon sequence can aid differentiation between dense red marrow and a metastatic
      deposits by assaying for intravoxel fat. Diffusion sequences may also potentially improve
      specificity by assessing mobility of water in hypercellular and hypocellular portions of
      marrow, and will be added to the protocol if scan time permits.

      The new sequences conform to FDA safety regulations regarding static magnetic field, time
      varying magnetic fields, specific absorption rate, and acoustic noise levels. However, since
      they have not been fully validated for diagnostic accuracy, the resulting images will be
      analyzed for research purposes only and will not be used in the patient's diagnostic
      assessment.
