      reduces stiffness and spasms in patients with SPS spectrum disorders compared to patients who
      do not receive any treatment. In this study, investigators want to compare the effects, good
      and/or bad, of IVIG with placebo on participants with SPS to find out which is better. This
      is a "randomized, double-blind" study. Which treatment participants will receive is randomly
      determined. Participants have an equal chance of receiving IVIG or the placebo.

      SPS spectrum cohort will include any from the SPS spectrum patient (stiff-limbs, stiff-trunk,
      stiff-limbs and trunk, and PERM). Study visits will be considered part of clinical care and
      will occur at: enrollment (will coincide with screening visit), and 11 weeks. IVIg/placebo
      (saline) treatments will be administered on 2 consecutive days in week 1, week 5, week 9 in
      all patients.
