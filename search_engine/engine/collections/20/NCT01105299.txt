    
      This study was conducted to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles
      and the bioequivalence of a newly developed new generation aromatase inhibitor (CJ
      anastrozole) with existing anastrozole formulation (ArimidexÂ®) in healthy Korean volunteers.
      This study is designed as single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 2-way crossover trial.
      Participants were randomized to receive 1 mg of either the CJ anastrozole or Arimidex,
      followed by a 3-week washout period. And then the alternate formulation was administered.
      After 10-hour overnight fast drug was administered. For analysis of pharmacokinetic
      properties, including Cmax and AUClast, blood samples were obtained at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, and 216 hours after drug administration.
