      of Life Survey (SN-5)and correlation with the incidence of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea
      and asthma.

      The study will enroll pediatric patients of rhino-sinusitis and parents to finish
      Questionnaire 1, including Chinese version of SN-5, visual analogue scale (VAS), Pediatric
      allergy disease Pediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PADQLQ), OSA-18
      quality of Life Survey, and asthma-diagnostic questionnaire . Some patients re-tested SN-5 in
      1 week later. After four weeks, they finish these questionnaire 2, including SN-5, VAS, and
      PADQLQ. In addition, the author will invite health children without rhino-sinusitis disease
      and their parents to fill in Questionnaire 1. The Chinese version of SN-5 will be validated
      to establish its reliability and validity.

      From December 2016 to December 2017, healthy volunteers and children with persistent
      sinonasal symptoms were enrolled. Guardians of the participants completed the SN-5, a visual
      analog scale (VAS) of nasal symptoms, and the Obstructive Sleep Apnea-18 (OSA-18) ; the
      responses were used to assess internal consistency, discriminant validity, and treatment
      responsiveness. A nontreatment group was administered the SN-5 1 week later to assess
      test-retest reliability.
