      and with undetectable viral load will be enrolled. On Day 1, all 24 subjects will attend the

      subjects will be randomised (1:1) to either Group A (RAL 400 mg OD) or Group B (RAL 800 mg
      OD) for 14 days. On day 15, a second 24 hour intensive PK will be carried out and the blood
      samples will be drawn. After 2nd intensive PK, the subjects will switch to the other dosing
      regimen. Subjects in group A will receive RAL 800 mg OD and group B will receive RAL 400 mg
      OD for another 14 days. On day 29, the third 24 hour intensive PK will be carried out. After
