      nocturia and urge incontinence. Overactive Bladder (OAB)Syndrome is a condition in which
      urgency is the predominant symptom with or without urge incontinence and is usually
      accompanied by frequency and nocturia. The mainstay of treatment of women with OAB syndrome
      is treatment with anticholinergic medication as well as behavioral therapy. This method of
      treatment has demonstrated a 60% response rate as reported in the Cochrane Database of
      Systemic Reviews.

      In addition to anticholinergic therapy, vaginal atrophy is often corrected as part of a
      pharmacologic treatment plan. Vaginal atrophy is a condition this is vastly prevalent in
      post-menopausal women. It is thought to affect up to 48% of post-menopausal women. Many women
      with this condition experience vaginal dryness, irritation, painful intercourse, as well as
      urinary symptoms including dysuria, urgency, frequency, nocturia, incontinence and recurrent
      urinary tract infections.
