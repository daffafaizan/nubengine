      measured clinically and by non invasive surface EMG, in four children with hypertonic CP,
      exposed to music combined with low frequency tones, via stereophonic headphones. Two children
      demonstrated a prompt motor improvement also.

      The goal of this study is to perform a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT)
      to assess these preliminary results.

      participants: 30 children with moderate to severe hypertonic CP (GMFCS 3-5), aged 3-9 years,
      from the "Meshy" or "Ilanot" Early Childhood Development Centers - Jerusalem, Israel, will be
      recruited with parents informed consent. Children who refuse to put on the headphones will
      not be included.

      A randomized controlled three-arm study, with one group receiving the proposed
      treatment-music with low tones and the other two groups receiving a placebo (music without
      tones or stories) will be performed.

      The children will listen to the music / stories via stereophonic headphones for 10 minutes -
      3 times a week for 4 weeks.

      Before starting the treatment the children will undergo:

        1. Neurological evaluation with their medical charts.

        2. Physiotherapic evaluation using the GMFM assessment and a surface EMG

        3. Fine motor assessment using the QUEST and visual assessments.

        4. Parents will complete the PODCI and the Care and Comfort questionnaires.

      We will repeat the EMG measurements immediately after the treatment.

      3 months after completing the treatment we will repeat the measurements we had done before
      treatment.
