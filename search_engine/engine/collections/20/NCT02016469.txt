      (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Although the etiology of IBD is unknown, but more and more
      evidence show that the inappropriate immune response to intestinal commensal bacteria leading
      to dysbiosis, and pathogens further act to the mucosal lymphoid tissue, causing IBD. Has yet
      not to determine the specific one or more pathogens as the cause of IBD,but literatures
      confirm the changes of diversity of the intestine flora.Based on the current awareness of
      changes in the intestinal flora in IBD, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) proposed in
      recent years to rebuild the intestine flora balance to achieve therapeutic purposes. But
      fecal bacteria of patients can not consistent with donor's for a long term after
      transplantation and therefore it is not an ideal way for disease control. Maintaining the
      diversity of flora in a long time so that well controlled the disease become the breakthrough
      of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

      Pectin is a soluble dietary fiber (DF), produced by the gut flora after a series of
      fermentation with many metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which supply the
      energy for epithelial cells, regulate intestinal PH and intestinal motility and join effort
      in immune regulation with intestinal lymphoid tissue. Previous studies showed that:
      water-soluble dietary fiber with the action of intestinal flora can cut the inflammatory
      cytokines, prevent inflammation and induce regulatory T cells, but the type and dose of
      dietary fiber used were different in different studies, and no studies have confirmed whether
      dietary fiber could adjusted the flora colonization ability in patients with IBD. We conceive
      that pectin by some mechanism to promote the migration of probiotics in intestine
      engraftment, reduce pathogenic agents' adhesion of intestinal mucosa, cut inflammation, and
      to maintain intestinal flora diversity and steady state in a long time, and than achieve the
      goal of continue to ease IBD.
