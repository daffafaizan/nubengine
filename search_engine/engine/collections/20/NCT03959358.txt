      things that would otherwise trigger an allergic reaction. This is called desensitization.
      Desensitization is usually done with repeat exposure to the thing that causes the allergic
      reaction. For example, people who have allergies may receive small, controlled doses of the
      allergen over a period of time until the allergic reactions are tolerable or are stopped
      completely.

      The researchers want to see if giving low doses of lenalidomide or pomalidomide to people who
      experienced an allergic reaction to these medications can become desensitized so that they
      are able to continue treatment for their disease with these drugs.
