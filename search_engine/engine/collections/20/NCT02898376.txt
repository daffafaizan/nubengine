      fibrosis. Synergism between PTX and Vit E is likely, as treatment with each drug alone is
      ineffective. This combination was also positively evaluated in the treatment of
      osteoradionecrosis, radiation-induced pelvic neuropathies, pneumoniae as well as bowel
      pathologies.

      Spa cares are part of the standard treatment of burn scars. Two spa treatments per year
      enable the mitigation or disappearance (after several treatments) of pruritus, dysesthesia,
      local inflammation, hypertrophy and sclerosis. They promote the healing of chronic
      superficial erosions. The spa treatment combines baths, sprays and especially filiform
      showers with thermal water jets under high pressure for a few minutes.
