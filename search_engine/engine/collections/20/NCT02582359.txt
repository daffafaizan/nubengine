      treatment (initial treatment), and a consolidation treatment (which is given later). The
      patient is being asked to participate in one or both phase I portions of this study.

      A phase I study tests the safety of an investigational drug or combination of drugs. Phase I
      studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is being studied. It also
      means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the drug combination
      for the participant's type of cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the safety and tolerability of MLN9708
      in combination with standard treatment for adults 60 years of age or older with AML.

      In the first phase I portion of treatment ("induction") participants will receive MLN9708 in
      combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Once the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      MLN9708 is established in this induction portion, up to 36 additional participants will be
      enrolled in the portion focusing on consolidation.

      The drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine have been approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration). MLN9708 is not approved by the FDA.
