    
      This open-label multicenter study will be conducted in 2 stages.

        -  Lead-in Phase: The first 6 patients treated will be evaluated to confirm the safety and
           feasibility of this regimen. After all 6 patients complete at least 4 weeks of
           treatment, and if no prohibitive toxicities are identified, continuous study treatment
           will begin.

        -  Continuous Study Treatment: Patients will continue to be enrolled into both cohorts
           based on their tumor specificities with a total of 31 patients in Cohort 1
           (ER-/PR-/HER2-/AR+) and 55 patients in Cohort 2 (ER+ and/or PR+/AR+).

      Patients will be evaluated every eight weeks for response to treatment. All patients who
      respond to treatment (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or have stable disease
      (SD) will continue to receive orteronel until they develop progressive disease (PD) or
      unacceptable toxicity.
