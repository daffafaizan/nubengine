        -  Determine the efficacy, mechanism of action, and toxicity of fenretinide in patients at
           risk of recurrent superficial bladder cancer after complete resection of initial tumor.

        -  Determine the treatment effects in modulating the expression of retinoid receptors,
           chromosomal abnormalities (numerical chromosomal abnormalities and DNA ploidy),
           apoptosis, and autocrine motility factor receptor (intermediate endpoint markers of
           recurrent disease) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to lesion
      type (multifocal vs solitary). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Patients receive either oral fenretinide or placebo on days 1-25. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      development of a second primary cancer requiring therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 15 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 178 patients (89 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
