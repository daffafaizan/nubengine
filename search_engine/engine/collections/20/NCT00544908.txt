      Primary

        -  To evaluate the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients with stage IV
           pancreatic cancer treated with dasatinib.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the response rate (complete and partial response) in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  To evaluate the median PFS and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To study the toxicities and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the impact of this drug on quality of life measures.

        -  To evaluate the impact of this drug on Src and FAK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           prior to and during treatment.

        -  To study the pre-treatment expression of various signaling molecules in the Src and
           STAT3 pathways and attempt to identify a relationship between these findings and the
           aggressiveness of the tumor or its response to treatment with dasatinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection periodically for correlative and
      biological studies. Blood samples are analyzed for phosphorylation levels of proteins,
      including phospho-Src, phospho-Fak, and other relevant biomarkers, by western blotting. Tumor
      tissue samples are analyzed for biomarkers by immunohistochemistry.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after every other course during treatment, and then
      at 1 year after treatment using the FACT-HEP questionnaire.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.
