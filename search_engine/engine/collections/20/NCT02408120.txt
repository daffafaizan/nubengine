      of insulin injections to control blood sugar levels. The doses of the two types of insulins,
      glargine insulin and aspart insulin are adjusted daily through the hospital stay based on
      blood sugar levels. Many times, in addition to glargine and aspart insulin at meals,
      additional small doses of aspart insulin are given to correct high blood sugar levels. It has
      not been determined if using these extra doses of aspart insulin to correct blood sugars
      before meals improves care of the patients. Studies done in the past indicate that blood
      sugar levels are well controlled on the standard treatment of the two insulins and that most
      patients do not need the small extra dose of insulin at bedtime. This study will test if
      insulin supplementation improves glycemic control and prevents hypoglycemia in insulin
      treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
