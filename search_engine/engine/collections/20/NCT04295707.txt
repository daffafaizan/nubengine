    
      This is a two-year randomized trial. Existing orthokeratology lens wearers (aged 8-13 years),
      who have completed a 2-year myopia control using orthokeratology, will be recruited and
      monitored for another two years. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to monthly or
      yearly replacement modality. Axial elongation and ocular conditions will be compared between
      the monthly and yearly replacement groups.

      Subjects on monthly replacement lenses will be randomly assigned to normal cleaning and
      intensive cleaning groups. Subjects in normal cleaning group will be provided with
      complimentary contact lenses solutions for daily cleaning and disinfection. In addition to
      the daily procedures for lens case, subjects in the intensive cleaning group will be required
      to perform weekly protein removal. All subjects on yearly replacement lenses will be required
      to performed intensive cleaning such that they will follow normal daily cleaning and
      disinfection as well as weekly protein removal.
