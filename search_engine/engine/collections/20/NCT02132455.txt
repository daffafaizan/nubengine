      undergoing a screening colonoscopy in four different groups: 1) at least 3 minutes from the
      total withdrawal time dedicated to the right side of the colon, 2) at least 4 minutes from
      the total withdrawal time dedicated to the right side of the colon, 3) 6 minutes total
      withdrawal time regardless of time spent in any segment, 4) 8 minutes total withdrawal time
      regardless of the time spent in any segment. Randomization will be done in blocks after
      stratification. Four gastroenterologists and two fellows matched base on similar ADR and
      stratified on each arm of the study (segmental versus non-segmental withdrawal) will be
      performing the procedures. The estimated sample size of the four arms of the study is 400
      patients.
