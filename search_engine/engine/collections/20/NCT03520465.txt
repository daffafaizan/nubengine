    
      Randomized prospective experimental study, in which we evaluate patients with CRC who
      underwent elective intervention for supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy in order to:

      Main objective:

      - To assess the effect of the prophylactic mesh in the eventration rate diagnosed by CT at
      one year after surgery in patients with CRC who underwent elective intervention for
      supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the appearance of complications in the control group and in the experimental
           group.

        -  Compare costs derived from short and long-term mesh placement in both groups.

      We consider as treatment the supra-aponeurotic mesh positioning (experimental group), and
      compare it to the standard closing with slow absorption monofilament.
