    
      Phase 2, open-label study of AVB-620 in women with primary, nonrecurrent, nonmetastatic
      breast cancer undergoing either a lumpectomy with simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy
      (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), or a mastectomy and simultaneous ALND.
      AVB-620 is a synthetic protease-activated peptide dye conjugate administered intravenously
      for the fluorescence detection and localization of potentially malignant tissue in primary
      tumor, tumor margins, or lymph nodes. A fluorescence image will be displayed on a monitor and
      will assist the surgeon to assess potentially cancerous tissue within the primary tumor site,
      tumor margins, or in lymph nodes which drain the primary tumor site.

      Eligible patients will receive a single dose of AVB-620 by IV infusion up to 24 hours prior
      to breast surgery.

      The study will evaluate the effect of timing of AVB-620 administration relative to surgery on
      the fluorescence and the accuracy of the AVB-620 imaging data to distinguish between
      malignant and nonmalignant tissues.
