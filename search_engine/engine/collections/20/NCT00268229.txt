      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of imatinib
           mesylate in combination with daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine in patients with
           relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the non-dose-limiting toxicities associated with this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any preliminary evidence of clinical activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive daunorubicin IV on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7.
      Patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with persistent leukemia on day
      14 bone marrow biopsy but â‰¥ 50% reduction in bone marrow blasts receive 5 more days of
      cytarabine and 2 more days of daunorubicin while continuing imatinib mesylate.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
