      20 usable datasets for analysis and also to account for any subjects that may drop out of the
      study. At present, all TKA available for surgeons to use are asymmetric where there is a
      distinct femoral and tibial component for the left knee and a distinct femoral and tibial
      component for the right knee. The Klassic knee system is a symmetrical knee implant, where
      the same femoral and same tibial component can be used for either the right or left knee. The
      kinematics for the 20 knees will be analyzed, including condylar roll-back, axial rotation,
      range of motion, and condylar lift-off
