      Primary

        -  To determine the active dose and/or maximum tolerated dose of ursodiol when given in
           combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen), and
           bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of ursodiol when given with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the systemic metabolic effects of ursodiol activation of nuclear receptor
           farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in glucose and lipid metabolism.

        -  To develop assays to detect ursodiol activation of FXR.

        -  To identify and evaluate potential serum biomarkers of FXR activation.

        -  To determine genes regulated by activation of FXR at target tissues.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ursodiol.

      Patients receive oral ursodiol twice daily on days 1-28 (days -6 to 28 of course 1),
      leucovorin calcium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15, fluorouracil IV over 46
      hours on days 1-2 and 15-16, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood sample is collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are also analyzed
      for the role of nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in glucose uptake and metabolism
      using PET scan imaging, an oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c levels; the effects of FXR
      activation on lipid metabolism; and a marker for response to FXR activation via western blot.
      Available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue blocks are analyzed for FXR
      expressing via IHC; expression of known FXR target genes via RNA analysis and real-time PCR;
      and expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism.
