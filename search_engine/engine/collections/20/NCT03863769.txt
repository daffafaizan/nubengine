      postural sway and improving performance-based mobility and disability in patients with the
      clinical diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. This study will identify if distraction spinal
      manipulation will reduce postural sway center of pressure (COP) movements as determined by a
      force plate, if distraction spinal manipulation will improve simple measures of
      performance-based mobility and if distraction spinal manipulation will improve perception of
      balance confidence and will reduce self-rated stenosis associated disability.
