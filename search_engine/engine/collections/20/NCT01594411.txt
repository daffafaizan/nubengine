      the subject's pretest probability for coronary artery disease (CAD) based on the subject's
      risk factors and quality of chest pain (typical or atypical), or anginal equivalent (e.g.,
      jaw, arm pain, or unexplained shortness of breath) and consider the results of prior testing,
      if applicable. The initial questionnaire will capture the PCP's initial clinical impression
      and decision ('preliminary decision') on how to further evaluate and manage the patient. A
      Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) assay will be performed at the PCP's
      office. After the PCP has received the Corus CAD (ASGES) result (approximately 2-3 days
      later), the PCP will decide on the appropriate evaluation and management of the patient
      ('final decision') using the Corus CAD (ASGES) result in conjunction with his/her clinical
      impression and/or other clinical data available. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate
      whether the Corus CAD (ASGES) test results is associated with a change in the PCPs'
      diagnostic evaluation and management of patients as compared to their initial testing and
      treatment decisions.

      Since it takes approximately two days for the physician to receive the result of the Corus
      CAD (ASGES), symptomatic subjects with unstable angina, or suspicion for myocardial
      infarction will be excluded from the study.

      A follow-up phone call and a detailed questionnaire will be performed at 30 + 15 days, from
      the time of blood draw, to assess the triage decision, such as referral to any subspecialists
      (cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and pulmonologist), cardiac diagnostic tests performed,
      cardiac procedures performed, and results of these cardiac tests and procedures.
