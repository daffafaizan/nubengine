      review indicates that surfactant does not demonstrate statistically significant beneficial
      effects on reducing the mortality and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) in term and
      late preterm infants with meconium aspiration syndrome. Therefore, a reasonable speculation
      is that preterm infants with ARDS do not benefit from one dose of surfactant. And the
      speculation can explain why not all preterm infants with respiratory distress can be
      beneficial from surfactant. In the era of pre-ARDS, the preterm infants fulfilling the
      definition of ARDS may have been considered as respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the
      first three days after birth.

      According to the diagnostic criteria of neonatal ARDS, a key procedure for diagnosis of
      neonatal ARDS is to exclude the newborn infants with RDS. But no detailed procedures are
      available to differentiate RDS from ARDS according the guideline of european RDS and
      definition of neonatal ARDS.

      Therefore, there are two aim in the present study. 1. to proposel a new definition of RDS; 2.
      to assess the beneficial effects of surfactant on neonatal ARDS.
