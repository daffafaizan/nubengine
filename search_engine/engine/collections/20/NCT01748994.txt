      predictors of health risk. A better understanding of the factors that determine regional fat
      mass growth may lead to developing new strategies for prevention or treatment of metabolic
      complications of obesity. The objective of this proposal is to study the responsiveness of
      different fat depots to adipogenic stimulation in upper-body and lower-body obese women.
