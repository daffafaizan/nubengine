      tumor-metastatic mice tumor models, the effective rate of Endostar was 47%～91% in daily
      dosage of 10～100mg/kg, and covered human commonly seen malignant tumors, such as lung cancer,
      gastric cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, malignant melanoma and
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, etc.. The development and progression of gastric cancer was in
      association with angiogenesis. An animal research observed the influence of Endostar on tumor
      strains in nude mice with gastric cancer, and the results showed that tumor size shrunk
      rapidly and the expressions of VEGF, bFGF, VEGF-C, VEGFR-3, bcl-2 and PDGF decreased
      significantly after treatment in experimental group, demonstrating that Endostar could reduce
      angiogenesis, increase tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in gastric cancer. An
      investigation of small-sample Endostar concomitant with chemotherapy on patients with
      advanced gastric cancer primarily indicated the efficacy and feasibility of Endostar
      concomitant with chemotherapy in treating gastric cancer.

      With the expanded application of Endostar in clinic, it also obtains certain effect in
      treating patients with lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The safety, efficacy, evaluation of
      relationship between benefit and risk in common or special population as well as the modified
      dosage of administration of Endostar in wide application should be further explored to
      provide sufficient scientifical basis for the safety, efficacy, applicable rule in special
      population and investigation of optimal administrative protocols for Endostar in wide
      application.

      This control, single-center clinical study of EndostarTM Injection with/without SOX protocols
      to treat advanced gastric cancer was conducted to explore the feasibility, efficacy and
      safety of Endostar concomitant with SOX protocols, and to provide more evidence-based medical
      basis for the clinical application of Endostar.
