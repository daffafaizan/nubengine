      study. The investigators will detailed explain the research process to participants, and make
      sure all participants provide written informed consent. The study will be conducted in
      clinical cardiopulmonary function lab in school and graduate institute of physical therapy,
      college of medicine, National Taiwan University. Baseline evaluation will be conducted after
      all the midterm exam complete, and make sure there is no sleep deprivation events two weeks
      before and after baseline evaluation. Outcome measurement will be on the day after all final
      exams complete.

      Participants will need to wear ActiGraph GT3X monitor (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA),
      which is a non-invasive sleep monitoring device in order to record precise sleep hours and
      sleep condition, five days before baseline and outcome evaluation. On the days of both
      baseline and outcome evaluation, the investigators will provide computer device for
      participants to perform cognitive performance test, which will take around 15 minutes to
      complete. Next, participants can take a rest for 10 minutes on the bed in supine position
      before heart rate variability measurement starts. The investigators will place electrode on
      participant's right forearm, then the non-invasive device will record heart rate variability
      data for about 5 to 10 minutes. At last, the investigators will evaluate participant's
      dominant hand grasp strength (kg) by Jamar hand dynamometer (Jackson, MI, USA) devices in
      standing position.
