      social communication behaviors, stereotyped behaviors for children with autism spectrum
      disorder(ASD) via a 20-min video of interactions between a caregiver and a child. The
      original CCIOS coding scheme consists 23 items. The score range for each item is 0-4, with
      higher scores being indicative of more atypical behavior. The investigators conduct this
      study to determine items for inclusion in the final CCIOS coding scheme through exploration
      of item correlations, establish the cutoff score of CCIOS for ASD and evaluate the
      reliability and validity of CCIOS.

      It is of importance to accurately distinguish children with ASD from those with Global
      Developmental Delay (GDD) and Language Disorder (LD) without ASD, sometimes, it's very
      difficult in children with mental ages below 2 years. This differentiation has strong
      implications for treatment recommendations and may also inform long-term prognosis. In this
      study, The investigators planned to recruit 60 children with ASD and 60 children with GDD/LD
      aged from 18 months to 48 months. The reliability evaluation include test-retest reliability
      and inter-rater reliability. DSM-5 criterion is used as the gold standard. Validity is
      assessed by determining the correlation and consistency between CCIOS and DSM-5 criterion.
