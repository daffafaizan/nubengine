      over years. After the classification and reporting of OA were established by American College
      of Rheumatology in 1986, the diagnosis has depended on the patients' symptoms and supported
      by plain radiographic findings.

      Since X-ray image has a discrepancy with clinical findings, the therapeutic modalities tend
      to depend on the clinical symptoms, rather than the objective imaging findings.

      MRI is a non-invasive and a very sensitive tool in detecting the early bony change such as
      bone marrow oedema, but it has some limitation in that it may have false positive or false
      negative results in the detection of the patella-femoral (PF) lesions. Bone scintigraphy is
      relatively sensitive because it reflects the early physiological changes of joints. But its
      image is planar that it cannot give enough information for the anatomic localization, and the
      image is overlapped.

      To compensate for the defects of these imaging methods, bone single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) has emerged as useful imaging tools in the diagnosis of OA.

      Based upon the fact that subchondral bony changes precede joint space narrowing in OA, bone
      SPECT seems to be a very useful tool in early OA, reflecting the early bony changes.

      The use of SPECT/CT offers the benefit of combined anatomical, mechanical (CT) and functional
      imaging (SPECT), which represents a relevant improvement in preoperative diagnosis and
      follow-up after procedures.
