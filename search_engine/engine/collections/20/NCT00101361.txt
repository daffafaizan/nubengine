      pressure ulcer of the pelvic region who are randomized to receive 24 weeks of optimized
      clinical care and an oral anabolic steroid agent (oxandrolone) will have a greater percent of
      healed pressure ulcers than those who receive placebo and the same optimized clinical care.
      The major secondary objective is to determine whether the healed pressure ulcer will remain
      healed for at least 8 weeks.

      Subjects are registered into a 4 week screening phase to be followed with weekly photos of
      the ulcer and if healed less than 30% (from the day 1 photo to the day 28 photo) with
      standard clinical care, they are introduced to the treatment phase (randomized) and followed
      for another 24 weeks on either oxandrolone or placebo. Wounds that heal (remain closed for at
      least 96 hours) are then subject to 2 four week follow up visits.

      Criteria for entering the screening phase are simple: either gender, age 18 years or older,
      inpatient with SCI or equivalent spinal cord damage and at least 1 Stage III or IV
      (indicating a severe wound, <260cm2) pressure ulcer of the pelvic region.
