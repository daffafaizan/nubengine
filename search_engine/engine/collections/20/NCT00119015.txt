      residual symptoms after taking an intranasal steroid. Surprisingly, the only studies
      investigating this combination of drugs have failed to show added efficacy of the H1 receptor
      over the intranasal steroids alone. Adding montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, to
      an intranasal steroid has not been studied in a placebo controlled fashion. Wilson and
      colleagues, in an open study of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, showed a benefit of
      adding montelukast.

      The investigators would like to recruit perennially allergic subjects and place them on
      fluticasone for 2 weeks. Those subjects with residual symptoms would then be randomized to
      receive either placebo or montelukast in addition to continuing the fluticasone for an
      additional 2 weeks.

      A positive study would support clinical practice and would serve as a preemptive strike
      against managed care plans that would not allow prescriptions for both drugs.

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of montelukast to treatment of a perennially allergic subject with an intranasal
      steroid is more effective at relieving symptoms than a placebo.
