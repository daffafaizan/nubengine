      Sentinel dosing (three subjects in each group) will be utilized in this FIH study. Sentinel
      cohorts will be used for the following groups:

      Part A (18-49 years) low dose Part B (50-85 years) low dose Part A (18-49 years) high dose
      Part B (50-85 years) high dose

      Overall, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive study vaccine or placebo by
      IM injection on Days 1 and 22.

      All study visits will be conducted at the clinical sites on an outpatient basis. Subjects
      will participate in the study for approximately 1 year from the first dose.
