      (NMR) during the phase of pneumoperitoneum. This is achieved by repeated administration of
      the non-depolarizing neuromuscular relaxant rocuronium, which is used in clinical routine.
      The level of relaxation is usually measured with the TOF-Watch relaxometer. This device has
      limitations in its usability and accuracy in this setting because it is unreliable when the
      monitored arm of the patient is not accessible for the anaesthetist for visual or tactile
      assessment of finger movements. The novel TOF-Cuff relaxometry equipment is by design
      intended to provide constant and reliable quantitative and in vivo calibrated relaxometric
      values independently of the arm position. The combination of frequently adjusted
      neuromuscular relaxation in a standardised mode in combination with a reliable relaxometry by
      TOFcuff promises an improved surveillance of neuromuscular relaxation and a higher safety
      standard. This investigation aims to test and to define the combined use of the best
      available drug with the best available relaxometer for general anesthesia in robot-assisted
      urological surgery.
