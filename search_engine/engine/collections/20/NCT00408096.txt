    
      In this randomized study, we wish to investigate with the use of clinical and radiological
      parameters whether there is a difference between the result of treatment of shoulder
      osteoarthritis with the Copeland resurfacing prosthesis and the Global CAP resurfacing
      prosthesis.

      Clinical parameters with the help of the Constant Shoulder Score (CSS) and Western Ontario
      Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Index (WOOS):

        1. Pain

        2. Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

        3. Range of Motion (ROM)

        4. Muscle strength

      Radiologic parameters:

        1. Migration of resurfacing prostheses with use of MB-RSA

        2. Bone density around the prosthesis measured with Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)

        3. Correlation between bone density and prosthesis migration
