      meningitis can be reduced by slow continuous infusion of cefotaxime combined with high-dose
      paracetamol orally for the first 4 days (instead of the traditional qid administration of
      cefotaxime without concomitant paracetamol). Children qualifying for entry (see criteria
      below), whose guardian has given informed consent,will be randomized into 2 treatment arms
      (see details below)and receive the treatments in a double blind fashion (see details below).
      Primary and secondary outcomes (detailed below) will be evaluated according to predefined
      criteria and time points (see below).

      Results will be analyzed for all patients in ITT datasets and in prespecified subgroups
      (etiology, nutritional status, etc.) in both crude and adjusted analysis. The efficacy
      results will be expressed as OR with 95% confidence intervals.
