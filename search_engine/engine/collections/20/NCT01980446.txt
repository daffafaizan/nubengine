      auditory-evoked potential would predict a favorable outcome in comatose survivors after
      cardiac arrest.The main objective is to determine the capacity of the presence of the
      mismatch negativity during the cortical auditory-evoked potential to predict a 1-year
      favorable outcome in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the capacity of the presence of the mismatch negativity during the cortical
           auditory-evoked potential to predict awakening during the hospitalisation stay.

        -  To determine the optimal time of realization of the cortical auditory-evoked potential

        -  To determine the capacity of the presence of the mismatch negativity during the cortical
           auditory-evoked potential to predict ICU discharge and/or hospital discharge favorable
           outcome in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest

        -  To determine the impact of the sedations drugs during the hypothermia phase, and during
           the ICU stay The main judgement criterion is the 1-year CPC score (CPC 1 to 2 as a
           favorable outcome)

      Study design : Prospective, multicentre, interventional study. Decision making to withdrawal
      of life support will be strictly codified according current knowledge and standardized among
      the participating centres. In the absence of predictors of non-awakening, care will be
      continued without limitation. The design of the study will focus on the determination of the
      capacity of the presence of the mismatch negativity during the cortical auditory-evoked
      potential to predict awakening. Cortical auditory-evoked potential will be performed bedside
      in the ICU by qualified neurophysiologists. Results of cortical auditory-evoked potential
      will remain blinded of bedside clinicians providing care for the patients. Awakening will be
      assessed bedside daily. CPC score will be evaluated at discharge of the ICU, of the hospital,
      at 3 months and 1 year by an independent evaluator, blinded of the results of the cortical
      auditory-evoked potentials.
