      assigned to receive induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine+cisplatin) plus concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (investigational arm) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (control arm).
      Patients in both arms receive radical Intensity modulated radiation therapy (Trilogy,
      Varian), and cisplatin (40mg/m2) every weeks for six cycles during radiotherapy. Radiation is
      delivered to GTV at 70 Gy in 30 fractions, CTV1 at at 60 Gy in 30 fractions and CTV2 at 54 Gy
      in 30 fractions. Patients in the investigational arm receive gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 on day
      1,8) and cisplatin (20mg/m2 on day 1-4) every three weeks for two cycles before the
      radiotherapy. The primary end point is response rates after radiotherapy, failure-free
      survival (FFS) and toxic effects and treatment compliance. Secondary end points include
      overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free
      survival (LR-FFS). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population;
      the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
