    
      Context: Patients undergoing treatment for cancer face disease, treatment, and environmental
      obstacles to sufficient, sound sleep. Hospitalizations can further worsen sleep quality and
      quantity due to overnight vitals checks, medication administration, blood draws, and
      environmental noise and light. For patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT), the risk for poor sleep is especially high due to protracted hospitalization,
      frequent vitals checks resulting in multiple night awakenings, and high symptom burden
      peaking approximately 10 days post-transplant.

      Objectives:

      Primary: Test the acceptability and feasibility of protecting one 6-hour window for nighttime
      sleep (intervention) relative to regular vitals checks (observation only periods) during HSCT
      recovery.

      Secondary: Assess the effect of one 6-hour window for nighttime sleep on subject sleep and
      engagement in supportive care on the oncology unit.

      Study Design:

      Aggregated N=1 randomized controlled design. All participants will undergo a 5 day
      observation and then be randomized to receive the 5 day intervention (extended vitals checks)
      during either nights of days +5-+9 or days +10-+14.

      Setting/Participants:

      Inpatients on the HSCT Unit at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      Intervention-increasing time between vitals checks from every 4 hours to one 6-hour period at
      night.

      Subjects will wear an actigraph for the duration of the study, complete a daily sleep diary,
      and complete self- and parent-proxy psychosocial measures (symptom burden, health related
      quality of life, sleep) and acceptability. Medical record review will also be conducted to
      assess vitals check frequency.
