      post excision scar with a fractionated ablative CO2 laser improves both the texture and
      cosmetic appearance of the scar. An attempt will be made to determine the ideal timing for
      treating the excision scar as previous studies have ranged from treating the day of the
      excision up till 10 weeks post-excision. In order to evaluate the treated portion versus
      untreated portion of the scar, investigators and the subjects will use a quartile rating
      scale. In addition, punch biopsy samples will be taken to quantify the difference in collagen
      architecture 9 weeks after treatment with the laser.

      There will be a total of 7 study visits to include the day of the excision and laser
      treatment if randomized to this group, post-op day number 14 for suture removal as well as
      laser therapy if the subject has been randomized to that treatment group, 4 weeks post-op, 9
      weeks post-op and laser treatment for subjects randomized to this time frame for treatment,
      12 weeks post-op, 17 weeks post-op and 24 weeks post-op. Each visit will last approximately
      30-45 minutes each in which clinical photos of the surgical scar will be taken and any wound
      care or side effects of the laser therapy or surgery will be addressed. Healing and scar
      appearance will be reviewed and rated at each of the six postsurgical visits.
