    
      We conducted a phase 2b/3 multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial of the
      intramuscular transfer of a plasmid DNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      165 with cytomegalovirus promotor (CMV) in patients with atherosclerotic lower limb ischemia.
      A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study, that is, 75 patients were randomized into
      the test group and received 2 intramuscular injections of 1.2 mg of pCMV- vegf165, 14 days
      apart together with standard pharmacological treatment. In all, 25 patients were randomized
      into the control group and received standard treatment only. The following end points were
      evaluated within the first 6 months of the study and during a 1.5-year additional follow-up
      period: pain-free walking distance (PWD), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and blood flow velocity
      (BFV).
