      I. Evaluate the safety of adoptively transferred CD8 T cells targeting NY-ESO-1 positive (+)
      tumors given alone and in combination with antigen-specific vaccination.

      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of NY-ESO-1-specific CD8 T-cells
      given alone and in combination with antigen-specific vaccination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy achieved following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-specific
      CD8 T cells in combination with LV305 alone and with G305 vaccine in patients with advanced
      synovial and mixed round cell liposarcoma.

      II. Evaluate the influence of antigen-specific vaccination on the induction of both CD8 and
      CD4 T cells to NY-ESO-1 and non-targeted tumor-associated antigens (antigen-spreading) and
      the correlation of these responses with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      COHORT 0: Participants receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day
      -2 and autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T lymphocytes IV over 60 minutes on day 0.
      Then, 6 hours later and twice a day for 14 days, receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT 1: Participants receive cyclophosphamide, autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T
      lymphocytes, and aldesleukin as in Cohort 0. Participants also receive dendritic
      cell-targeting lentiviral vector ID-LV305 intradermally (ID) on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT 2: Participants receive cyclophosphamide, autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T
      lymphocytes and aldesleukin as in Cohort 0. Participants also receive dendritic
      cell-targeting lentiviral vector ID-LV305 injection on days 1, 14, 43, and 70, and
      immunotherapeutic combination product CMB305 intramuscularly (IM) on days 29, 57, and 85 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After conclusion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 4 weeks for 168 days,
      then every 3 months for 24 months.
