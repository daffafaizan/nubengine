      hypnotic pain reliever during anesthesia. Their advantages are numerous: short half-life
      allowing anesthesia and rapid awakening, little accumulation, allowing to adapt the level of
      anesthesia or sedation to each patient, few side effects.

      Entropy° is an index derived from the electroencephalographic signal of patients, validated
      for the evaluation of the level of narcosis during general anesthesia.

      ANI ° (nociception index analgesia) is an index using the ventilatory physiological
      variability of the sinus rhythm validated to monitor patient's analgesia during general
      anesthesia.

      These non-invasive means of analgesia and sedation monitoring allows the clinician to ensure
      satisfactory levels of anesthesia by administering products at minimum effective doses.

      The authors propose to determine whether, for a comparable target effect (analgesia and
      monitored sedation), plasmatic concentrations and administration rates of propofol and
      remifentanil necessary during general anesthesia for a comparable surgical stimulus are the
      same in populations of obese and non obese patients.
