      for the non-response to most common chemotherapies. It is believed that the identification of
      so-called senescent tumors could improve treatment strategies for solid tumors and, in
      particular, avoid inefficient treatment of patients with highly toxic drugs.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety, radiation exposure (dosimetry) and
      diagnostic accuracy of the novel diagnostic substance [18F]FPyGal if it is used before tumor
      imaging imaging (here: positron emission tomography combined with magnetic resonance imaging
      (PET / MRT) or in combination with computed tomography (PET / CT)).

      Diagnostic substances used in imaging such as [18F]FPyGal are known as radiotracers, since
      their distribution in the tumor tissue can provide information about the special tumor
      biological processes taking place there.

      In the context of this study, it is of particular interest to find out whether it is possible
      to use the novel radiotracer [18F]FPyGal to detect areas after standard tumor therapy that
      contain particularly resistant (therapy-resistant) tumor cells. This resistance phenomenon in
      tumor tissues, which may be visualized with the radiotracer [18F]FPyGal, is called tumor
      senescence.

      The latest research results show that senescent tumor cells can not only evade different
      forms of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Senescent tumor cells can also cause the cancer
      to come back later. That is why current therapeutic research is concentrating on developing
      new approaches to combat such senescent tumor cells. For this it is relevant to be able to
      first diagnose senescent tumor cells as well as possible using imaging.
