    
      Background:

      Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) has been advanced as a therapy to significantly improve
      quality of life in patients with COPD, but to date no controlled studies have evaluated the
      impact of LVRS.

      Objectives:

      Evaluate cost-effectiveness of LVRS compared to current therapy for COPD.

      Methods:

      This is a case control study in which veterans undergoing LVRS at VA Puget Sound Health Care
      System (VAPSHCS) are compared to patients with a similar severity of disease at Boise VAMC
      who are not undergoing LVRS. Changes in health related quality of life are being evaluated
      using three instruments: the SF-36, the St. Georgeï¿½s Respiratory Questionnaire, and the
      Quality of Well-Being Scale, the latter to calculate utility associated with different health
      states. Costs will be determined using utilization data on outpatient visits, medications,
      oxygen use, inpatient days, radiology tests, laboratory tests, and emergency room visits are
      being collected for the twelve months before and after surgery. Costs will be calculated
      according to VA and community standards.

      Status:

      Complete.
