      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in combination with azacitidine in
      patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose of ibrutinib combined with azacitidine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To do an early assessment of the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib and azacitidine
      in higher risk MDS. Specific secondary endpoints include: disease response per modified
      International Working Group (IWG) 2006 response criteria for MDS, hematologic normalization
      rate (HNR = complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR] + hematologic improvement [HI]),
      overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), disease free survival (DFS), and time
      to response (TTR).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic and biological effects and impact of quality of life (QoL)
      of the combination of ibrutinib and azacitidine in patients with higher risk MDS is the
      exploratory objective of this study. Exploratory endpoints include: laboratory biomarker
      analysis and effect on QoL assessments.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ibrutinib.

      Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes or subcutaneously (SC)
      once daily (QD) on days 1-7 or 1-5 and 8-9, and ibrutinib orally (PO) QD on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.
