      The traditional chemotherapy for CRC remains on intravenous (IV) fluorouracil (5-FU) based
      regimens with the response rates of 10-20% and a median survival of approximately one year.
      Recent years, oral chemotherapy has a more practical and economic advantages over IV regimen.
      It is understandable that patients prefer oral regimens as long as the clinical efficacy is
      maintained. Oral treatment strategy preserves quality of life for CRC patients. In a previous
      cost-minimization study conducted in Hong Kong, it was demonstrated that capecitabine was
      more cost-effective than 5-FU plus oxaliplatin assuming they had equal clinical efficacy. Not
      only is capecitabine more cost-effective, it may also have additional cost saving in the
      nursing and pharmacy time . It is because a significant amount of time can be saved in both
      nursing and pharmacy for the preparation and administration of IV chemotherapy. In the UK, it
      was demonstrated that capecitabine required less pharmacy and administration time per cycle
      than 5-FU based IV chemotherapy. However, there is a lack of local data to demonstrate the
      impact of pharmacy and nursing care utilizing capecitabine comparing to traditional IV
      chemotherapy in CRC patients of Hong Kong.
