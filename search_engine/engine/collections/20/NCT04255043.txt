    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that aims to enroll 260
      patients with high bleeding risk.

      All patients with coronary denovo lesions suitable for DCB treatment will undergo 1:1
      randomization to either IVUS guidance or Angiography guidance using the Central Randomization
      System.

      All subjects will be screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
      per protocol. Data and images will be collected during the index procedure, and at the
      predefined 7-month coronary angiography follow-up visit.
