      treat acute symptoms of asthma and albuterol, a partial b2-agonist, is the most frequently
      prescribed asthma medication in the US. Although universally used in for acute asthma
      symptoms, SABA have been associated with a significant degree of interpatient variability.
      Many studies have characterized the SABA dose to bronchodilator response relationship under
      controlled conditions. However, few studies have explored the magnitude and sources of
      bronchodilator response variability, and no studies have characterized the dose versus
      bronchodilator response relationship using population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      (PPK/PD) modeling. In the present study, we characterized the relationship between inhaled
      doses of albuterol and bronchodilation in 81 children and adults with moderate to severe
      persistent asthma using a population pharmacodynamic approach. The purpose of this study was
      to obtain estimates of the pharmacodynamic parameters that characterize the dose-response
      curve, including maximal dose for bronchodilation, and to quantify and identify sources of
      interpatient pharmacodynamic variability.
