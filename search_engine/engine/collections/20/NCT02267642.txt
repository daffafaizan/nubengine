    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-dose phase II proof of principle trial to study
      the efficacy and safety of AbGn-168H in patients with moderate to severe active psoriatic
      arthritis. A minimum of 15 patients and a maximum of 20 will be recruited in 1 dosing group.
      For safety evaluation, the parameters to be assessed include physical examination, vital
      signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature), 12-lead ECG,
      safety laboratory tests, adverse events and tolerability. For efficacy evaluation, patients
      will be evaluated for proportion of subject reaching American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR
      20) in week 12 and proportion of subjects reaching ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 at different
      time points; Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) at different time points, as well as Target
      Lesion Psoriasis Severity Score (TLPSS) and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) for
      subjects with active skin lesions at different time point.
