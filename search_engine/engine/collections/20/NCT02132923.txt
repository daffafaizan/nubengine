    
      This is an exploratory prospective study (a study in which the patients are identified and
      then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study). The study will consist of two
      phases: a screening phase (Day 1) and an assessment phase (Day 2 to Day 7). During screening
      phase, pediatric patients consecutively hospitalized with RSV-related infection will be
      enrolled in the study within 24 hours of admission if symptomatic for maximum 5 days before
      the hospital admission and if the informed consent form (ICF) was obtained. The diagnosis of
      RSV infection will follow using a standard of care (SOC) rapid point point of care (POC)
      detection method available in the hospital unit on nasal specimens .During the assessment
      phase the collection of nasal specimens will be done daily for a maximum of 6 days (Day 2 to
      Day 7 of hospitalization) or until patients will be discharged from hospital. Approximately
      50 patients will be enrolled in this study. The total duration of the study for each patient
      will be approximately 7 days. The study duration will extend until the targeted number of 50
      RSV hospitalized children have completed the study.
