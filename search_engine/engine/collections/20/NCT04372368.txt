      all regulatory requirements for conventional plasma and FDA's additional considerations for
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma
      (https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemptio
      n-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds).

      The primary objective of this expanded access program is to provide COVID-19 convalescent
      plasma to patients with moderate to severe or life-threatening manifestations of COVID-19, or
      documented to be at high risk of developing such manifestations.

      The secondary objective will be the evaluation of safety, as assessed by incidents of adverse
      events judged by the treating physician to be potentially related to the administration of
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

      Exploratory objectives will include assessments for antibody responses for patients that
      receive convalescent plasma. An exploratory analysis may be conducted correlating the level
      of neutralizing antibody titers with clinical outcomes observed. Due to the need to
      monitoring COVID19 antibody responses following infusion, blood testing at day 1
      post-treatment and at discharge will be obtained as part of enrollment.
