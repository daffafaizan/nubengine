      set of 170 schools). The schools were provided by the Zambian Ministry of Education. The
      schools are split between primary (grade 1 to 7) and secondary schools (grade 8 to 12). In
      order to not interfere with exam periods, the Ministry of General Education and GIZ decided
      to implement the JIC among children in grade 6 in primary schools, and grade 11 in secondary
      schools.

      On average, the schools have 80 students and 74 percent of the sample are in Choma. 88
      percent of schools are considered rural, i.e., they do not lie in a major town. 4 percent of
      the sample have received a JIC before.

      The 170 schools were randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions.

        -  Control 1 (No intervention) (34 schools)

        -  Control 2 (No intervention) (34 schools)

        -  Treatment 1 (Random selection) (34 of schools)

        -  Treatment 2 (Indegree centrality) (34 of schools)

        -  Treatment 3 (Betweenness centrality) (34 of schools)

      The Columbia University (CU) team advised GIZ on the design of the study, and the
      intervention will be solely run by GIZ. The CU team is not involved in the implementation of
      the study. Data will be collected by the American Institutes of Research (AIR). The CU team
      will only analyze fully de-identified data produced by the study.
