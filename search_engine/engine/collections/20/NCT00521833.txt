      implantation of a 6.0 mm foldable hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens through a 3.2 mm
      horizontal clear cornea incision at 180 degrees (temporal incision in right eyes, nasal
      incision in left eyes). Keratometric astigmatism was measured preoperatively and one and four
      weeks and 6 months after surgery. Surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) was calculated by the
      vector analysis method using the Holladay-Cravy-Koch formula. Patients with history of
      diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disorders, steroid use, previous ocular surgery, with
      the rule astigmatism >1D, pseudoexfoliation and any corneal pathology were excluded.
