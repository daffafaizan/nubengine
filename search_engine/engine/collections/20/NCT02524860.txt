      at finding clinically relevant prostate cancer.

      A multiparametric MRI examination will be carried out prior to study enrollment. Probable
      cancerous regions (regions of interest, ROI) will be identified, and these ROIs will be used
      as targets during the biopsy.

      Three prostate sampling methods will be conducted in the same session on all patients. These
      include:

      i) Focal-Fusion Bx targeted biopsy ii) Cognitive fusion targeted biopsy and iii) Systematic
      (untargeted) biopsy. Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging will be conducted with BK Flex
      Focus Ultrasound system (Analogic Corporation, Peabody, MA).

      Primary hypothesis: The technique used to acquire the biopsy samples will impact the
      proportion of clinically relevant cancers by improving the specificity of detecting
      clinically significant cancers. It is hypothesized that Focal-Fusion Bx biopsies will
      diagnose more high risk cancers and fewer low-risk cancers than non-targeted systematic
      biopsies.
