      followed by breast surgery. The primary endpoint of the study is the false negative rate of
      VAB procedure. This rate will be calculated by comparing the detection of invasive or in situ
      carcinoma on surgical specimen versus VAB samples. The secondary endpoints of the study are
      feasibility, VAB procedure technical complications and safety.
