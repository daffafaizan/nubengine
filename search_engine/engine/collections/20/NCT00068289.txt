        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate (confirmed and
           unconfirmed, complete and partial), in patients with recurrent or refractory extensive
           stage small cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-based therapy.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate selected molecular markers with outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to platinum-sensitivity status (platinum sensitive
      [temporarily closed to accrual as of 8/1/04] vs platinum refractory [temporarily closed to
      accrual as of 6/1/04]).

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients (20-40 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 0.5-1 year.
