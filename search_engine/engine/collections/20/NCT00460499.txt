      perioperative period during CABG surgery in diabetic patients improves outcomes. The purpose
      of this trial is: (1) to determine whether outcomes can be improved by altering the content
      of glucose or insulin in these solutions (2)to determine the effect of these solutions and
      glycemic control on the inflammatory response of arterial and venous conduits used during
      surgery, (3) to determine whether the beneficial effects of improved glycemic control can be
      correlated with changes in the inflammatory response.
