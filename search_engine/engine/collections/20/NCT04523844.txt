      commonly used in the treatment of diabetic macular edema, neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration and other pathologies characterized by retinal or choroidal neovascularization.
      Intravitreal injections Î¿f anti-VEGF agents result in an immediate and transient increase in
      IOP, which returns to normal within a short period of time, typically within thirty minutes.
      Repeated intravitreal injections and prolonged treatments seem to be associated with
      sustained elevation of IOP, leading to the initiation of ocular hypotensive medication and
      glaucoma filtration surgery. A fixed-dose combination of brinzolamide 1%, a carbonic
      anhydrase inhibitor, and brimonidine 0,2%, an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, represents
      a safe and effective drug in glaucoma treatment and its ocular hypotensive effect has been
      demonstrated similar to or better than the unfixed combinations of its component drugs.
