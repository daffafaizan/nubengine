    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with
      incomplete recovery of platelets (CRp) as best response within 4 cycles of therapy of
      trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 (Akt inhibitor GSK2141795) in acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) patients with rat sarcoma (RAS) mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the disease-free survival of patients achieving CR/CRp. II. To determine the
      duration of response of patients achieving CR/CRp. III. To determine the toxicity profile of
      trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 in this patient population.

      IV. To determine the biologic effects of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 on
      leukemia cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.
