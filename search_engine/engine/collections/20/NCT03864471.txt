      the effectiveness of six-month HCOACDM on the functional ability, QOL, depressive symptoms,
      healthcare and social service utilizations, and care delivery satisfaction of the high-need
      community older adults. The high-need community older adults, screened based on the
      "High-need Community Older Adults Screening Scale" (HCOASS), will be cluster randomized based
      on the community care centers, to the intervention group (4 centers) or comparison group (4
      centers). Intervention group will receive six-month HCOACDM care and comparison group will
      receive original routine care provided by the care managers at community care centers. One
      pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, of outcome measurements will be conducted on
      all participants. Moreover, individual semi-structured interviews will be carried out to
      explore opinions and suggestions toward the HCOACDM of the care managers in intervention
      group. It is expected that the developed HCOACDM will be useful to provide the long-term care
      for community older adults and enhance the quality of diverse and complex care delivery
      system.
