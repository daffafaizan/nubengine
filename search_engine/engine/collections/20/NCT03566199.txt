      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of repeated administration of MTX110 co-infused
      with gadoteridol given by intratumoral convection enhanced delivery in children with newly
      diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of repeated administration of MTX110 given by
      intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in children with newly diagnosed DIPG in the
      confines of a phase I and early efficacy study.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Participants receive panobinostat nanoparticle formulation MTX110 intratumorally (IT) by CED
      infusion on day 1 or days 1 and 2 as determined by dose level. Courses repeat every 4-8 weeks
      for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 2
      months.
