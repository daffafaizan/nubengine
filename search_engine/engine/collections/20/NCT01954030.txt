    
      In Phase 1 of the study, we will conduct a dose-escalation study of the combination of CTO
      with the standard dosing of bevacizumab among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO
      Grade III or IV) that have previously failed bevacizumab. All patients will have also
      received standard treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide prior to enrollment on
      study.

      The Phase 2 portion of this study will investigate two novel treatment regimens sequentially.
      Each regimen will include 25 patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma who have
      been treated in the past with standard radiation therapy, temozolomide, and bevacizumab. All
      patients must have failed therapy while on bevacizumab. Subjects in the first treatment
      regimen will receive CTO alone and subjects in the second treatment regimen will receive the
      combination of CTO and bevacizumab together.

      Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the
      study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and bevacizumab had been
      determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.
