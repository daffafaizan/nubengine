    
      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label phase 2 study of the SINE™ compound selinexor
      given orally to patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL.

      Approximately 60 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL who meet the eligibility
      criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive selinexor until
      either disease progression or intolerance has occurred.

      Enrolled patients will be given selinexor as an oral fixed 60 mg dose (equivalent to ~35
      mg/m²) on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-4 of each 4-week cycle (total 8 doses per cycle).

      There is no maximum treatment duration. Patients will receive supportive therapy to mitigate
      selinexor side effects, as well as best supportive care (BSC).

      Patients enrolled under Protocol Versions <3.0 were to receive selinexor orally, at a fixed
      dose of 60 mg (equivalent to ~35 mg/m²) on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle
      (total of 6 doses per cycle). Selinexor was not taken during Week 4.

      For all patients enrolled in this study (regardless of the protocol version) who continued
      onto Cycle 3 and forward, the dose was to be increased by 20 mg to 80 mg (administered on
      Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-4), only after consultation with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.
