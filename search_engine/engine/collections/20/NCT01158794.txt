    
      This study will focus on the following primary objective:

        -  To investigate the association of GSTM1 gene deletion and liver iron concentration in
           patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional iron-overload.

      The Secondary Objectives of the study are:

        -  To explore the role of other iron metabolism-associated candidate genes on liver iron
           concentration of sickle cell patients with transfusional iron-overload.

        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 genotypes and other iron metabolism-associated candidate
           genes on maintenance and decline of liver iron concentration of patients with sickle
           cell disease and transfusional iron-overload.

        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 genotypes and other iron metabolism-associated candidate
           genes on increase, maintenance, and decline of iron concentration in the heart,
           pancreas, kidneys, and spleen of patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional
           iron overload.

        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 gene deletion and other iron metabolism-associated
           candidate genes on increase, maintenance, and decline of iron concentration in the
           liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen of non-sickle cell patients with
           transfusional iron-overload.

        -  To explore the relationship between Non-Transferrin Bound Iron (NTBI), hepcidin, organ
           function, and iron increase, maintenance, and decline in the liver, heart, pancreas,
           kidneys, and spleen of patients with transfusional iron overload.
