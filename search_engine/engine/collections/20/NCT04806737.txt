      proof-of-concept study on effects of the drug on activation and efflux of gluten specific T
      cells using HLA-DQ:gluten tetramers. The study will be conducted with two treatment groups in
      the form of a 2:1 parallel group comparison and will serve to compare oral treatment with 14
      mg/d teriflunomide vs. placebo in subjects with well-controlled coeliac disease undergoing
      gluten challenge. The screening period will be up to 8 weeks, followed by a 7-day run-in
      treatment period with a loading dose of teriflunomide followed by a 6 day therapeutic
      maintenance dose, an initial 4-week treatment-free follow-up period and a 6 month closing
      follow-up.
