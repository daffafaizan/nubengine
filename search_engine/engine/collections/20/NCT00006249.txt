        -  Compare the effect of adjuvant therapy with pegylated interferon alfa vs observation, in
           terms of distant metastases-free survival, in patients with previously resected stage
           III melanoma.

        -  Compare the overall survival in these patients after treatment with pegylated interferon
           alfa vs observation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of pegylated interferon alfa in these patients.

        -  Determine the compliance of these patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa.

        -  Compare the quality of life in these patients after treatment with pegylated interferon
           alfa vs observation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type
      of nodal involvement (N1 vs N2), number of positive nodes (1 vs 2-4 vs 5 or more vs not
      assessed), Breslow primary (T1-2 vs T3 vs T4 vs unknown), ulceration of primary tumor (absent
      vs present vs unknown), sex, and center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive pegylated interferon alfa subcutaneously weekly for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only. Treatment continues in the absence of distant
           metastases or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, and then at months 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,200 patients (600 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1.5-2 years.
