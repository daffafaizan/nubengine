    
      Between January 2010 and January 2014, women scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopy for CPP
      at our Department will be enrolled in the current prospective observational study. For these
      patients, laparoscopy represents the last diagnostic step after medical history negative for
      gastrointestinal, urological, musculoskeletal and psychoneurological disorders related to
      pelvic pain, physical examination, ultrasonographic assessment and laboratory testing. From
      all patients, at enrollment, blood samples for serum CA125 determination will be taken during
      the early follicular phase (2nd-3rd day of the menstrual cycle) and VAS score for menstrual
      pain will be assessed. Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Immunoassay Elecsys Systems,
      Roche Diagnostics, Italy) for serum CA125 assay will be used (kit coefficient of variation
      between-run 0.0% and within-run 2.0%).

      During the time passed on surgery waiting list, patients will received leuprolide acetate
      depot (LAD) at a dose of 3.75 mg IM at the 21st day of the menstrual cycle. One month later
      LAD administration, serum CA125 levels and VAS score will be assessed again, and then the
      surgical procedure will be performed in all these patients.

      After laparoscopy and definitive histological examination, the population initially enrolled
      will be sub-grouped according to endometriosis diagnosis in two groups, i.e. group 1
      (subjects with endometriosis) and group 2 (subjects without endometriosis).
