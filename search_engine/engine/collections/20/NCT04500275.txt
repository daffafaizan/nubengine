    
      1. Patient Recruitment and Group Assignment

        1. Institution. All the surgical procedures will be undertaken in the National Cheng Kung
           University Hospital (NCKUH) under service of the Cardiovascular Surgery Department. The
           patient monitoring will be carried out perioperatively in the general ward and intensive
           surgical unit (ICU, surgical or cardiac) of National Cheng Kung University Hospital.

        2. Eligibility Criteria. Described in other section.

        3. Randomization. Eligible patients will be 1:1 randomized using a computer-generated list
           to receive either normal saline (Control group) or Vancomycin Paste (Vancomycin group).
           A randomization list with corresponding patient recruitment number will be archived in
           NCKUH pharmacy. On the operating day, our research coordinator will order a study
           prescription, which looks identical to either control or Vancomycin group. The pharmacy
           will deliver the prescription content according to the patient recruitment number on the
           randomization list. The surgeons will know the patient grouping only after they get the
           prescription content in the operating room.

        4. Blinding. The intraoperative staff including the surgeon will know the application
           material for the patients. The patient and the nursing staff in charge of sternal wound
           evaluation will not know the allocation of patients.

        5. Sample Size Determination. The average incidence of DSWI after isolated CABG in NCKUH is
           3-4% in recent 5 years. An expected reduction of DSWI from 4% to 1% leads to an effect
           size of 0.15, which will require a total sample size of 330 to achieve a statistical
           power of 0.8 given an alpha error probability of 0.05 and 1 degree of freedom.
           (Estimation with G*Power software). Considering the potential patient withdrawals, our
           planned sample collection will be 360 cases (180 in each group) in two years.

      2. Intervention

      (1) Vancomycin group protocol. i. Timing of application: the Vancomycin® (China Chemical &
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (CCPC / Taiwab) paste will be spread on sternal edge immediately
      after sternotomy and before sternal closure.

      ii. Regimen: The vancomycin paste will be prepared using 2.5g of vancomycin mixed with 2ml
      normal saline for each time. A total of 5gm of vancomycin® powder will be applied.

      (2) Control group protocol. 2ml normal saline will be spread on sternal edge immediately
      after sternotomy and before sternal closure.

      (3) Common perioperative protocols in both groups regarding sternal wound infection
      prevention: i. Intravenous antibiotics: Cefazolin 1g q8h for 24hrs. Patients with known
      cephalosporin or beta-lactam allergy will receive single dose Vancomycin plus Gentamicin.

      ii. Skin preparation: Skin shave will be performed on the operation day after injection of
      prophylactic antibiotics. Skin sterilization will be prepared with alcohol beta-iodine scrub
      followed by Hibitane (Chlorhexidine Gluconate).

      iii. Bone wax: bone wax usage for hemostasis will be minimized and be removed as much as
      possible before sternal closure.

      iv. Internal mammary artery harvest: Bilateral internal mammary arteries will be used at the
      discretion of the individual surgeon.

      v. Sternum closure: our standard is 8 single wires closure. Replacement of any 2 single wires
      with a figure of eight wire or addition of Robicsek technique will depend on the decision of
      the individual surgeon.

      vi. Subcutaneous and skin closure: interrupted Vircyl for subcutaneous closure and staples
      for skin.

      vii. Blood glucose control: intravenous insulin infusions to maintain serum blood glucose
      level between 120 and 180 mg/dL.

      viii. Chest hugger: postoperative chest hugger will be used according to the preference of
      the individual patient.

      ix. Delayed sternal closure: The decision is based on the discretion of the individual
      surgeon. If a delayed closure is attempted, the vancomycin paste will still be applied over
      the unclosed sternal edge.

      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      3. Outcome Measurement. Details described in other section.

      (1) Sternal wound. Measurement on postoperative day (POD) 7, 30, and 90, based on the
      definition from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

      (2) Serum Vancomycin levels. Sampling time: postoperative day 0, 3 and 7. Measurement: High
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

        2. Data Collection:

           i. Clinical parameters collection. All patient demographic data and parameters of STS
           (society of thoracic surgery) database will be recorded, such as age, sex, cause of
           cardiac diseases, co-morbidities, concurrent medication, body mass index, nutrition
           status, operation details, days of hospital and ICU stay, hospital cost, any surgical
           complications, and any documented infection and their microbiology susceptibility test
           results.

           ii. Biochemistry and blood cell count. Data such as creatinine levels, fasting sugar
           levels, HbA1C, liver enzymes, nutrition status, and white cell count will be measured on
           postoperative day 0, 3, and 7 in the central laboratory of National Cheng Kung
           University Hospital.

        3. Data management. i. Two registrars are responsible for data registry. Data are stored in
           spread sheet format.

           ii. Missing Data. All data source are available in NCKUH's electrical medical record.
           Any variable with missing data more than 3% will be dropped.

        4. Report for adverse events. The investigators are responsible for adverse events
           reporting to our institution review board (NCKUH IRB). The reporting procedure is
           generally based on the form from the Council for International Organizations of Medical
           Sciences (CIOMS). The definition and requirement for Serious Adverse Event (SAE),
           Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), and Unanticipated Problems (UP),
           are available at our IRB website:
           http://nckuhirb.med.ncku.edu.tw/upload/download/file20191217230754.pdf.

        5. Quality assurance. This is a single institution study. Quality assurance will be done by
           monthly investigator meeting in our hospital, which including the following:

           i. Data checks. Monthly data visualization report, either histogram for continuous
           variable or bar chart for categorial variable, will be used for detection of any data
           running out of range or having inconsistency with predefined rules.

           ii. Source data verification. Accuracy and completeness of the registry data will be
           double checked by the primary care nursing practitioners by comparison with the
           electrical medical record system.

      5. Data Analysis, Statistical and Pharmacokinetic Analysis

        1. For clinical data, continuous variables are expressed are as means ± standard deviation
           and analyzed with t-test. Categorical variables are presented as numbers (percentages)
           and Pearson's χ 2 or Fisher's exact test was used where appropriate. Univariate and
           multivariate logistic regression model and Cox model will be used to analyze risk
           factors for sternal wound infection. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical
           analysis was performed using R, version 3.2.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
           Vienna, Austria.).

        2. For serum Vancomycin levels, non-compartmental analysis will be conducted with WinNonlin
           software (www.certara.com). The population pharmacokinetics will be analyzed with
           nonlinear mixed-effects modeling using in NONMEN 7.3 (Icon Development Solutions,
           Hanover, MD). Xpose (xpose.sourceforge.net), PsN (psn.sourceforge.net), and R, version
           3.2.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.) were used for
           postprocessing of NONMEM output.
