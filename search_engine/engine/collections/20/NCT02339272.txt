      synapsis between homologous chromosomes and formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), which
      regulates sister chromatid cohesion and provides the template for localization of
      recombination machinery proteins. Secondly, recombination between homologous chromosomes,
      which is essential for the correct segregation. Errors during these two processes may induce
      incorrect segregation of chromosomes and are a major cause of gamete aneuploidy. The aim of
      this study was to assess meiotic recombination in primary spermatocytes, synaptonemal complex
      length and the correlation with chromosomal abnormalities in testicular spermatozoa from
      infertile men with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Prospective cohort study to
      assess meiotic progression, total length of SC, frequency of recombination and sperm
      aneuploidy in samples obtained from testicular biopsies from NOA patients. The study group
      was compared with a control group from post-vasectomized (OA) patients. Immunocytogenetics
      with SCYP3, CREST and MLH1 antibodies for meiotic progression, SC length, and recombination.
      Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) for chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 13, 16, 18, 21, 22 in
      primary spermatocytes and chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, Y on sperm. MicroMeasure 3.3 program was
      used for SC length.
