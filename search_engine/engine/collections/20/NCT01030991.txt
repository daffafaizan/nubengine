      which may play a large role in the difficulty in managing these patients and enrolling them
      in clinical trials. A major advance in the care of patients with HFpEF would be a
      classification system based on etiology, pathophysiology, and/or genetic factors as well as
      machine learning analyses. The ultimate goal of this study is to demonstrate that it is
      possible to better classify patients with HFpEF based on etiologic, pathophysiologic, and
      genetic differences between patients. If successful, this study could lead to: (1) novel risk
      estimation in patients with HFpEF and (2) more fruitful clinical trials based on targeting
      specific subsets of HFpEF.
