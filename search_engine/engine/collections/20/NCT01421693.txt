      failure in patients with enteric fever, a comparative study will be conducted at Patan
      Hospital. 300 patients who are diagnosed with enteric fever will be enrolled into the study.
      The patients will be randomized to one of two groups. One group will receive treatment with
      Gatifloxacin for 7 days, and the other with Ceftriaxone. The patients will be followed during
      the treatment courses and at several points of 6 months after initial presentation. The
      endpoints then will be compared between two groups.
