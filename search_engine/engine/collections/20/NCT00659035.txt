      medications. Although such advice is routinely given considering patients' safety,
      unnecessary restrictions to driving can cause inconvenience to the patients and delay their
      treatment. Such restrictions also pose social and legal questions to patients and physicians.

      The investigators would like to test such patients' ability to drive under oral opioids using
      a driving simulator at the Pain Centre. This simulator is like a video game with computer and
      a steering wheel to simulate real life driving. The driving simulator provides measure on
      several outcome measures, such as attention, reaction time, etc. allowing us to specifically
      address question pertaining to any cognitive or behavioral differences.

      A pilot phase, for feasibility, included 80 subjects. This phase will include a comparison
      with a random selection of 450 patients receiving one of the following 5 treatments:

      Group 1 (IT): Subjects receiving 1-10 mg/day of morphine or its equivalent doses of opioid
      medications through intrathecal route. Intrathecal medications are administered through a
      catheter in spinal cord

      Group 2 (Oral): Subjects receiving oral opioids (morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone,
      methadone), but not also receiving anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate),
      muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or diphenylhydramine for at least a week before testing;
      low dose antidepressants and/or NSAIDs are OK

      Group 3 (Oral + Anticonvulsant): Subjects receiving oral opioids (morphine, oxycodone,
      hydrocodone, methadone) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate), but not
      also receiving muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or diphenylhydramine for at least a week
      before testing; low dose antidepressants and/or NSAIDs are OK

      Group 4 (Control -Pain) Subject not receiving opioid medications, anticonvulsants
      (gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate), muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or diphenylhydramine
      for at least a week before testing; low dose antidepressants and/or NSAIDs are OK.

      Group 5 (Control -No Pain) Age-matched volunteers (NO PAIN) not receiving opioid medications,
      anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate), muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or
      diphenylhydramine for at least a week before testing; low dose antidepressants and/or NSAIDs
      are OK.

      First group has 50 patients and the rest will have 100 patients each.
