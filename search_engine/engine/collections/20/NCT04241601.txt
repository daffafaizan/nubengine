      from narrowings or blockages in walls of blood vessels supplying the heart, due to fatty
      deposits and inflammatory cells that build up over time. This build-up leads to heart muscle
      damage called a heart attack. The immune system plays an important role in both the
      development of the narrowings and the damage to the heart muscle during a heart attack.
      Studies have shown that there is a lower level of protective immune cells called regulatory
      T-cells (Tregs) in heart attack patients. Increasing the number of circulating Tregs may have
      a direct effect in reducing the inflammation in arteries, preventing further narrowings in
      blood vessels and improving heart muscle function.

      Aldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), is a medicine that stimulates the production
      of Treg cells when given at low doses and is the drug being tested in this trial. IL-2 is
      licensed for the treatment of kidney cancer where it is given at much higher doses than
      planned in this trial. It appears to be safe and well tolerated at low doses while increasing
      Treg cells.

      IVORY will be conducted in patients presenting with a heart attack (Acute Coronary Syndrome
      (ACS)). Approximately, 60 patients will be randomized to receive either low dose IL-2 or
      placebo. It is a Phase 2, randomised, double- blinded, placebo-controlled experimental trial.
      Total study duration for each participant will be approximately 13 weeks.

      Participants will undergo two PET/CT (Positron emission tomography-computed tomography) scans
      to observe change of inflammation in the blood vessels from baseline between the two trial
      groups (Primary Endpoint).
