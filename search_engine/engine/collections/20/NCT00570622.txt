      pressure as well as hyperdynamic circulation and low peripheral vascular resistance.
      Endothelial nitric (NO) release is impaired in liver microvasculature, upregulation of eNOS
      activity in the cirrhotic liver may constitute a new strategy to correct the increased
      hepatic vascular tone in these patients. In contrary to this impaired endothelium-dependent
      relaxation (endothelial dysfunction) and NO deficiency in the cirrhotic liver, systemic and
      splanchnic circulation of cirrhotic patients is characterized by increased vascular tone and
      hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity,
      thiazolidinediones, like pioglitazone decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve
      endothelial function. In a randomized controlled, parallel group double-blind study 20
      Patients with advanced (ChildÂ´s Grade B or C) liver cirrhosis will receive pioglitazone or
      placebo for nine days. Portal hemodynamics and forearm blood flow response will be measured
      at baseline and after pioglitazone/placebo to investigate the effect of pioglitazone in these
      group of patients.
