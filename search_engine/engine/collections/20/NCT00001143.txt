      that quantitative analysis of "at risk" infants eye movement systems can detect abnormalities
      that precede and predict the onset of strabismus. We will collect data on the eye movements
      of a group of infants born between 36 and 44 weeks of post-conceptual age. These infants are
      enrolled between 4 and 24 weeks after birth and followed at 4 week (+/-5 days) intervals
      until 28 weeks of age and then yearly until 3 years after birth. After study enrollment
      infants will undergo a complete ophthalmic evaluation and ocular motor analysis at all study
      visits. The ocular motor analysis will include evaluation of ocular following, saccadic,
      pursuit and vergence eye movements using stimulus paradigms that have been specially
      developed for use in children. Children will be followed on an annual basis after 28 weeks of
      age until age 3 years to monitor the development of ocular alignment and to detect other
      visual system abnormalities. Study endpoints for each subject are at 28 weeks of age (ocular
      motor recordings completed) and 3 years of age (ophthalmic examinations completed). This will
      provide basic knowledge regarding the etiology of both normal and abnormal binocular
      alignment in infants in the first 28 weeks of life.
