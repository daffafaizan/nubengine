    
      In the Phase 1 component of the study, we will conduct a dose-escalation study of the
      combination of CTO with lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO grade
      III or IV). All patients will be bevacizumab-naïve. The dose escalation will be a standard
      "3+3" design to determine the MTD of CTO in combination with lomustine. The Phase 2 portion
      of this study will be a randomized screening study comparing CTO alone (Arm A) versus CTO
      with lomustine (Arm B) versus lomustine alone (Arm C) in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV
      malignant glioma who are bevacizumab-naïve. Subjects will be randomized with a treatment arm
      allocation ratio of 2:2:1.

      Based on the results of patients who have already taken part in Phase 1 of the study, the
      Principal Investigator has decided to reduce the dose of lomustine used in combination with
      CTO in this study by 25% of the FDA-approved dose, due to hematologic side effects (side
      effects related to lower than expected blood counts). Therefore, the dose of lomustine
      received in combination with CTO is approximately 75% of the standard recommended dose.

      Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the
      study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been
      determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.
