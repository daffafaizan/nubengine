      perceptions of transition from pediatric to adult care, transition readiness, disease
      knowledge, and self-management skills, and assess components of the St. Jude Children's
      Research Hospital (SJCRH) Sickle Cell Disease Transition Program. Participants will
      participate in focus groups to discuss transition and transition-related concepts and
      evaluate components of the transition program. Additionally, participants will complete
      questionnaires about specific aspects of the transition program and about current disease
      knowledge and management skills.
