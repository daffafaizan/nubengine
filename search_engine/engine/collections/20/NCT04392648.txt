    
      The drug that is being tested in this study is called TAK-573. The study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TAK-573 when used in
      combination with dexamethasone and either bortezomib, pomalidomide or cyclophosphamide in
      participants with RRMM.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase. The
      study will enroll approximately 135 participants (approximately 60 participants in Dose
      Escalation Phase and approximately 75 participants in Dose Expansion Phase). The dose
      escalation phase will determine the recommended dose of TAK-573 along with the combination
      agents for the dose expansion phase.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Germany, France, Spain, and
      Canada. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 3 years. Participants
      will be followed up for 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
