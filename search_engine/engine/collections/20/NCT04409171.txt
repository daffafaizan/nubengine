      blood glucose, insulin, glucagon and HbA1c were performed on patients receiving
      pancreatectomy (pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy). Tests were done
      preoperatively, postoperatively at 3 months, and at 1 year. The primary endpoints were the
      incidence and risk factors of new-onset and worsened DM after each type of pancreatectomy.
