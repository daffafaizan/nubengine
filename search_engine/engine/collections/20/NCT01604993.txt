      regarding the accompanying increase in cardiovascular disease risk and other health risks.
      Targets for optimal blood pressure are often unmet by conventional pharmaceutical therapies;
      consequently, complementary and alternative medicines are increasing in popularity among
      patients wishing to better manage their BP. In the case of hypertension, endothelial
      dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, a decline in the ability of blood vessels to dilate
      in response to shear stress is a major contributor to vascular pathology. At the core of
      these conditions is a decreased ability to synthesize nitric oxide, a potent vasodilatory
      agent. The proposed study will examine whether or not increasing the intake of dietary
      nitrate, which can be converted to nitric oxide endogenously, can improve three indices of
      vascular function that are validated risk factors for CVD: arterial stiffness, as measured by
      aortic augmentation index (AIx), aortic BP and brachial BP.
