      Classical analyses is performed by using the Greulich and Pyle X-Ray measurement. Such
      analyses have some restrictions such as intra- and inter observer variability, and variable
      synchronicity of bone maturation.

      Bone age determined by ultrasound (BAUS) has been indicated as a fast and reproducible
      method, allowing decimal BA determination and avoiding the need for X-Ray.

      Our aim is to validate the BAUS method in Brazilian normal controls. School students of both
      genders, with age varying from 6 to 16 years will be included.
