    
      A prospective cohort study will be undertaken during the influenza season of 2015 in Rambam
      Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.

      The study group will include inpatients older than 18 years, who have clinical presentation
      suggestive of influenza virus infection defined by the World Health Organization and the
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention, including sudden onset of high fever, cough,
      headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat and runny nose, who were found
      positive to influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction test, and in whom anti viral
      treatment was indicated.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Immune compromised patients: patients after solid organ transplant, post bone marrow
           transplantation, with inherited or acquired immune deficiency, or patients treated
           chronically with immunosuppressive drugs.

        2. Pregnant women.

        3. Patients who were treated with oseltamivir in the previous 6 months.

      Patients who approve their participation will to fill a questionnaire, and a polymerase chain
      reaction assay for influenza will be performed as follows:

      The first sample will be taken right before the first dose of oseltamavir, and then on days
      2, 3 and 5.

      Samples will be stored at a temperature of +4 Celsius degrees for a maximum of 48 hours.

      Outcomes: we will consider a positive polymerase chain reaction test 3 days after the
      initiation of treatment as prolonged shedding.
