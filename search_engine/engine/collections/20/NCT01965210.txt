      subjective appetite and metabolism will be evaluated using a randomized cross-over study
      design. Each participant will consume six different breakfasts on six different occasions
      separated by a 1 week wash-out period: three rye porridges supplemented with three different
      combinations of added fermentable dietary fibre and plant protein, two non-supplemented rye
      porridges differing in amount of rye and one wheat bread. Participants will rate subjective
      appetite (satiety, hunger and desire to eat) by using a visual analog scale (VAS) every 30
      min during an 8-hour period, starting 30 min before breakfast. The concentration of hydrogen
      and methane in the breath, as indicators of bacterial fermentation of dietary fibre, will be
      measured every hour. Blood samples will be collected before breakfast and at regular
      intervals throughout the day for analysis of glucose and hormone levels. The metabolic
      profile in the blood will be assessed as well as products from bacterial fermentation of
      dietary fibre, such as short chain fatty acids. Gastric emptying rate will also be evaluated
      using paracetamol as an indicator. Hormonal responses, changes in the metabolome and
      fermentation products will be related to subjective appetite and to differences in
      composition of the breakfasts.
