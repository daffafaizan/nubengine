      study was developed by a collegium at a nursing bachelor education program in a
      multidisciplinary collaboration with representatives from the university hospital and other
      experts. Data on nutritional risk and nutritional care practices of elderly patients were
      collected by 173 second year nursing students at the university college in question who were
      undergoing their acute and clinical care practice studies on 20 wards at the university
      hospital. Nine nutritional screening days were conducted in the academic years 2011/2012 and
      2012/2013. On the screening days the students filled in the questionnaire for each patient,
      including questions about age, gender, length of hospital stay, normal weight in recent
      months, weight, height, BMI, nutritional risk and nutritional care practices. The students
      measured weight and height whenever possible, and screened the patients for nutritional risk.
      Data were collected by using a stratified sampling technique along with adequate power
      calculations to improve the representativeness of the sample. The researchers received
      anonymously completed questionnaires and screening forms from the students and never met the
      patients.
