      stents in the treatment of unselected patients with coronary artery disease.

      2.1 Primary objective In a randomized study to compare the Xience V and the Cypher Select+
      coronary stents by assessing SAFETY (cardiac death, myocardial infarction and/or stent
      thrombosis) and EFFICACY (target vessel revascularization) after 9 months.

      2.2 Secondary objective To compare device success rate, procedure success rate and
      complication rate during hospitalization, after 1 month and after 9 months and the incidence
      of late stent thrombosis after 12, 24 and 36 months.
