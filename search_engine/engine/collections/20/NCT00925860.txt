      randomized to be treated by conventional ventilatory support or non-positive mechanical
      ventilation support. Those patients who did not benefit from the experimental non-positive
      ventilatory support, were intubated and conventionally mechanically ventilated and discarded
      for analysis. The primary outcome was mortality rate in both groups, and secondary outcomes
      were length of stay, improvement of oxygenation, and reduced complications rates.
