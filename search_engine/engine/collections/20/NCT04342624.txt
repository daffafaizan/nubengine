      and dinner (2 weeks of cinnamon, 2 weeks of placebo). The placebo capsule is a study product
      that looks like the cinnamon capsules, but contains no active ingredients. The amount of
      cinnamon will be 4 grams per day. 2 grams will be taken at breakfast and dinner. Timed blood
      collections over a three-hour period will be used to measure how cinnamon spice affects
      glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity in human subjects. Everyone who participates in the
      study will receive each treatment in random order. In this way, everyone will receive
      cinnamon spice capsules and placebo.

      In a crossover study design subjects will consume either cinnamon or placebo with foods and
      before bed for 28 days. The placebo capsule is a study product that looks like the cinnamon
      capsules, but contains no active ingredients. The participants will also be asked to undergo
      an oral glucose tolerance test 4 times (on separate days) before and after the first and
      second cinnamon/placebo consumption. Subjects will take 3 capsules of cinnamon or placebo
      (total 2 g) with the glucose drink (75 g). Timed blood collections over a three-hour period
      will be used to measure how cinnamon spice affects glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity in
      human subject. Continuous glucose monitoring will performed through the entire study for each
      subject. The microbiome will also be examined at the beginning and end of each 28 day phase
      (0-4 weeks and 6-10weeks). Subjects will consume a brown-beige diet during the study to
      exclude the effects of other polyphenol-rich foods. We will enroll twenty subjects >= 20
      years of age, overweight/obese (BMI 25 to 35 kg/ m2) with fasting blood sugar between 100 and
      126 mg/dl or HbA1c >=5.7% and <= 6.5%.
