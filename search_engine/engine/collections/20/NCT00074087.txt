      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of doxorubicin HCl liposome, in terms of response rate
           (complete response and partial response), in patients with stage IIB, IVA, or IVB
           recurrent or refractory mycosis fungoides.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity or until a maximum cumulative anthracycline(s) dose of 400 mg/m^2 has been reached
      (including anthracyclines from prior treatment).

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
