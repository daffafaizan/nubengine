      in detecting the environment and automatically adjusting to the sound environment. A second
      version of the Neuro 1 processor has been developed, the Neuro 2. The signal processing and
      stimulation characteristics are similar, so speech comprehension levels are expected to be
      equivalent. This study is designed to compare Neuro 1 and Neuro 2 in terms of audiometric
      performance.
