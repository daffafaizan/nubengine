      found in colorectal cancer and metastasis from existing literature.

      In patients diagnosed with lung metastases from colorectal cancer, 20mL of whole blood is
      collected before and after local treatment (surgery or radiation) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
      is extracted from the collected blood. Thereafter, 20 mL of whole blood is additionally
      collected once after 3 months (±2 months) and once after 6 months (±2 months) during
      follow-up and cfDNA is extracted. The investigators perform sequencing from the extracted
      cfDNA.

      The investigators compare the mutations detected in cfDNA before and after local treatment
      and identify the trend of reducing mutations in cfDNA after local treatment. So The
      investigators discover biomarkers for the outcome of local treatment. The investigators also
      search for mutations for target drugs from mutation profiling of cfDNA.
