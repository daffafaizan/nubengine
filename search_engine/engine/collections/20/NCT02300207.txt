      microgravity on the cardiovascular system and the underlying mechanisms and countermeasures
      remain largely unknown. Our previous studies have demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA)
      is effective at improving orthostatic tolerance (OT). The purpose of this study was to
      determine if EA treatment can attenuate cardiovascular deconditioning induced by a 4-day -6°
      head-down bed rest (HDBR). Fourteen healthy male subjects were randomly allocated into a
      control group (Con, n=6, 4 days HDBR without countermeasure) and an EA treatment group (EA,
      n=8, 4 days HDBR with EA at Neiguan [PC-6] for 30 min daily for 4 consecutive days during
      HDBR). OT was estimated with a combination of +75°/20 min head-up tilt and lower body
      negative pressure test before and after HDBR. Plasma hormones and heart rate variability were
      assessed before and after HDBR. Cardiac systolic functions and cerebral blood flow were
      measured before, during, and after HDBR. The data showed that EA treatment applied daily for
      30 min during a 4-day HDBR prevented OT and cardiac systolic function from decrease,
      prevented autonomic dysfunction (a decrease in the activity of the parasympathetic nervous
      system), and increased the concentrations of plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone
      (Ald). These results indicate that 30 min of daily EA treatment at PC-6 is highly effective
      in partially maintaining OT and cardiac systolic function. Activation of the peripheral
      sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma hormones is largely responsible for
      maintaining OT after a 4-day HDBR. Therefore, EA treatment appears to be an effective
      countermeasure against cardiovascular deconditioning induced by HDBR.
