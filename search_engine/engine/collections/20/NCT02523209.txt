      parameters including macro- and micro-architecture (especially cortical porosity and
      thickness). The Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA ) measurement of Bone Mineral Density
      (BMD) is a robust predictor of fracture risk in the non-uremic population. Micro and
      macro-architecture can be measured with High Resolution peripheral micro Computerized
      Tomography (HRpQCT) at the ankle and the wrist . Some recent studies suggested that HRpQCT
      could be a better fracture predictor than DEXA in uremic populations. In this context, the
      aim of our project is to describe in a cross sectional study the bone status of CKD patients,
      candidates for kidney transplanted . It will be 1) calculated the prevalence of cortical
      osteoporosis as assessed by cortical thickness at the ankle and the wrist (primary end
      point), 2) analyzed other HRpQCT microarchitecture quantitative parameters and 3) defined the
      biological and clinical factors associated with bone degradation (secondary endpoints). This
      population will be compared to age and sex matched normal subjects (collaboration with Pr
      Rizzoli, Geneva, Switzerland). The DEXA and HRpQCT will be compared for detection of patients
      at risk for fracture.
