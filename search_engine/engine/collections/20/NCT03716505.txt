    
      The study is a prospective randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled
      study, designed for comparison of two parallel groups, gammaCoreÂ®-Sapphire (active treatment)
      and a sham (inactive) treatment.

      The study period will begin with a four-week run-in period, during which there is no
      investigational treatment. The purpose of the run-in period will be to establish a baseline
      of the subject's headache/migraine history for longitudinal comparison.

      The run-in period will be followed by a 12-week randomized period when the subjects will be
      randomized (1:1) to either active treatment or sham (inactive) treatment.

      Subjects will dose themselves 3 times per day for 12 weeks.
