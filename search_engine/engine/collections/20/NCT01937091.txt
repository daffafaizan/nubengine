    
      Study Population: 48 HIV positive adult (at least 18 years of age) patients receiving care at
      the UNC ID Clinic will be enrolled in the study. Purposive sampling by race, gender and
      previous participation in HIV clinical trials will be used to ensure adequate representation
      in each category. Participation in a clinical trial will be defined as having participated in
      a trial of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for duration of > 48 weeks. Non-trial
      participation will be defined as having been offered the opportunity to participate in a
      clinical trial but have never participated in any clinical trial or participated in a trial
      that included a one-time sample collection with no follow up visits.

      STUDY METHODS

      Questionnaire: The questionnaire consists of open-ended questions to be administered to
      participants. The questionnaire items were composed by reviewing related studies. Two
      versions of the questionnaire will be administered, one for participants with a history of
      participation in clinical trials and one for participants who were approached but have never
      been in a clinical trial (See Appendix 1.) The questionnaire will be revised after
      pre-testing to incorporate changes before it will be administered to all 48 participants.

      Interview: The interview will be conducted at the UNC ID clinic by one research assistant.
      The interview will take approximately 45 minutes and will be audiotaped.
