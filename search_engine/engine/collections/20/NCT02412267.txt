    
      This is a Phase II, single-arm, non randomized, safety and efficacy study of ofatumumab in
      combination with salvage ICE chemotherapy (O-ICE) in 61 subjects with relapsed or refractory
      aggressive B cell lymphoma.

      O-ICE would be administered as an inpatient. The cycles are administered at 3 weeks intervals
      for ICE.

      Study subjects who are candidates for high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell
      rescue (ASCR) would receive one or two more cycle of ICE salvage chemotherapy with ofatumumab
      before stem cell mobilization. G-CSF at 10 ug/kg per day after the third or forth cycle of
      treatment (at the discretion of the treating physician) would be administered until the end
      of leukapheresis for stem cell mobilization. After the third or forth cycle of salvage
      chemotherapy, leukapheresis was initiated until a collection of more than 5 x 106 CD34
      cells/kg white blood or 5 procedures were performed, whichever occurred first. Collection of
      <2x106 CD34+ cells/kg from peripheral blood will be considered mobilization failure for the
      purposes of the study. Leukapheresis and cryopreservation will be performed according to
      hospital practice. High dose chemotherapy will be administered as per our institution's
      protocol.

      Study subjects who are not candidates for HDC and ASCR would receive at most 6 cycles of
      salvage chemotherapy with ofatumumab.

      Subjects who progressed on treatment would be taken off study protocol.
