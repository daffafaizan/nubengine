      placement over the neurovascular bundles after bilateral nerve sparing robot assisted radical
      prostatectomy on potency. The study will have a control arm that will follow standard of care
      surgery, without placement of any membranes. 70 men will be allocated to each arm.

      The research study will involve follow up every 3 months for the first 12 months. After this
      the investigators will follow patients annually with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      measurements and an assessment of any secondary therapies for 5 years post-surgery.

      Randomization of study patients will be done in equal proportion to Arm I (membrane
      placement) and Arm II (no membrane placement, standard of care surgery) using a permuted
      block design stratified by baseline SHIM score (<17 vs. >=17), and use of ANY erectile aids
      (Yes vs. No) in the last 3 months.
