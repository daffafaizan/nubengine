      whether Ty21 may replace the standard BCG immunotherapy in NMIBC patients.

      The minimal starting dose will be instilled intravesically once a week for 4 weeks in 3
      patients. If well tolerated, a 5-fold higher dose will be instilled 4-times in 3 other
      patients, and so on for a maximum of 4 doses to be tested.

      The maximal tolerated dose will then be administered to 3 new patients 6-times once a week.
      If 6 instillations are well tolerated, 7 additional patients will be included to receive 6
      instillations with this maximal tolerated dose.
