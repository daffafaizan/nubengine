      care for patients with chemosensitive relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma and aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and is an established effective therapy for patients with relapsed
      follicular lymphoma. Disease relapse remains a major problem, occurring in 50% of these
      patients, particularly in patients with primary refractory disease or other high-risk
      features. The addition of gemcitabine to single-agent melphalan as a high-dose conditioning
      regimen presents a promising combination that may lead to improvements in EFS (Event free
      survival). If this trial gives encouraging results, it may lead to a phase III trial
      evaluating this treatment strategy.

      Drug exposure would be AUC (area under curve) and clinical factors would be things like
      obesity, renal function, disease characteristics.

      We would be looking at the safety outcomes - i.e. adverse events as a measure of safety and
      tolerability. The adverse events would be non-hematological toxicities (any) and whether or
      not it is related to AUC. AUC in relationship to PFS (progression free survival) is also
      important (we want to know if we need to adjust dose to improve PFS).
