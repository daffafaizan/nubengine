      with a high-school diploma or less. A pilot study, which ran during the 2019-20 flu season,
      recruited approximately 850 subjects, and a planned scale-up will recruit an additional 2500
      subjects during the 2020-21 flu season. The investigators will oversample African American
      individuals, emphasizing low-income and minority men because these characteristics are
      correlated with lower relative take-up of flu vaccination. After informed consent is
      obtained, subjects will be asked about sociodemographic information (age, education, income
      and marital status), healthcare experience and past medical history, knowledge and beliefs
      about flu vaccination, and location of the nearest pharmacy. The investigators will then
      randomly assign the adult male subjects to videos which contain one of Black or white actors
      playing the role of either a doctor or a layperson as well as different scripts. The content
      of the infomercial will be the safety and effectiveness of adult seasonal flu vaccination.
      After the video, the investigators will obtain information on beliefs regarding vaccination,
      feedback on the video, attention to the video and willingness-to-pay for a flu shot coupon.
      The final baseline module will consist of a randomly assigned invitation to receive the
      results of an upcoming review of a COVID-19 vaccine, with subjects assigned to receive
      information from a trusted or standard source. The investigators will track flu coupon
      redemption, which is redeemable at most pharmacies nationwide.
