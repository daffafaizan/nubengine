    
      The study will focus in evaluation of fetal cardiac function by using myocardial performance
      index in fetuses with abnormal cardiotocography in 3rd trimester.

      Study Hypothesis:

      In women with non reassuring fetal cardiotocography, myocardial performance index may predict
      fetal distress accurately.

      Study Question:

      In pregnant women in the third trimester with abnormal cardiotocography, Does myocardial
      performance index predict fetal distress accurately?

      Study Objectives:

      This study aims to assess the accuracy of myocardial performance index in predicting fetal
      distress in pregnant women with non reassuring cardiotocography in third trimester.
