      I. To determine the safety and/or recommended dose of intrathecal (IT) nivolumab in
      combination with systemic nivolumab treatment in patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival with combined intrathecal and systemic administration of
      nivolumab in this patient population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the immunological effects of this treatment on immune cells in the cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) to those observed in the peripheral blood and in non-LMD tumors.

      II. Evaluation of predictors (clinical, molecular, and/or immune) of the efficacy and safety
      of this regimen.

      III. To assess the effect of nivolumab on subsequent treatment. IV. To compare levels of
      nivolumab in the CSF and peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase Ib study.

      Patients receive nivolumab IT over 5 minutes on day 1 of every cycle. Beginning in cycle 2,
      patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 (4 hours after
      the IT dose). Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 4 weeks and then every
      12 weeks thereafter.
