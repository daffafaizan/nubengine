      disease severity. There are differences in the severity, frequency and intensity of attacks
      and the general effect of the disease in individuals. Information about any particular attack
      is not sufficient to characterize the overall severity of the disease. Accordingly, the
      Headache Impact Questionnaire (HIQ) was developed to evaluate the headache experience over a
      period of time instead of any headache. Developed to measure the impact and quality of life
      of individuals suffering from headache, hÄ±q evaluates the frequency and duration of headache,
      the degree of pain severity, daily life activities, disruptions in work or school life, the
      influence of the individual's leisure activities and other symptoms that may occur. HIQ
      consists of 16 items and the higher the score shows the seriousness of the impact. The study
      is planned with 80 individuals with complaint of headache. After questioning the
      sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals, the patients will be asked to fill in
      HIQ, Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire, Headache Impact Test-6 and Short
      Form-36.Test-retest will be re-applied to those of the same individuals who can be reached
      after 1 week. The results will be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer package
      program.
