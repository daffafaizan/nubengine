      treatment for them is liver transplantation. However, the number of giving donors is
      extremely limited. Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into
      mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as hepatocytes. They reside
      in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The latter
      tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells. In
      this study, the cirrhotic patients will receive autologous adipose tissue derived stromal
      cells which contains substantial number of mesenchymal stem cells.
