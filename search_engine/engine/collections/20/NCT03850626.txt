    
      Approximately 20% of the general public suffer from seasonal or perennial allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis. The only available curative therapy is AIT. The effectiveness of AIT was
      demonstrated in numerous randomized clinical trials but comparability is difficult because of
      different primary and secondary endpoints.

      To validate the CSMS, adolescent (â‰¥ 12 years) and adult patients will be observed who are
      allergic to house dust mites (HDM), tree or grass pollen and who were treated with Depigoid.
      Depigoid is a registered (for tree and grass pollen) respective authorized (for HDM)
      suspension for injection for the treatment of immediate type allergic diseases. Depigoid
      contains depigmented and chemically modified allergen extracts, so called allergoids, derived
      from grass pollen, tree pollen or HDM.

      Allergy symptoms will be documented over a time period of two years: Either for two
      consecutive allergy seasons (for tree and grass pollen allergic patients) or for two
      consecutive exposure periods (September-December) for HDM allergic patients. The symptoms (4
      nasal and 2 ocular symptoms) and allergy medication intake will be documented on a daily
      basis either using the CSMS questionnaire or the especially developed electronic CSMS+ diary
      application.

      Already validated and established questionnaires will be used to validate the CSMS with
      regard to Quality of Life (QoL) and symptom control: the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (RQLQ), Adolescent RQLQ (AdolRQLQ, for patients aged 12-17 years), Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and AQLQ for patients aged 12 years and older (AQLQ+12),
      the Asthma Control Test (ACT), Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) and the Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS).
