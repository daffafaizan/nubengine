      enrolment.

      After providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be
      evaluated for study eligibility. It is to note that patients can be enrolled based on the
      presence of del(17p), as per center evaluation. However, the presence of del(17p) should be
      confirmed by the central laboratory (University of Torino laboratory), which will perform the
      test in 5 working days.

      After registration, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be treated according to
      the protocol, only after the presence of del(17p) has been confirmed by the central
      laboratory.

      Treatment period includes administration of 28-day cycles of treatment with DPd until any
      sign of progression or intolerance.

      The response will be assessed after each cycle. The LTFU period will start after development
      of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or treatment interruption due to toxicity. All patients
      are to be followed for survival during the LTFU period every 3 months via telephone or office
      visit.
