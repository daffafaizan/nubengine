    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of subjects with relapsed diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who are relapsed or refractory to
      front-line treatment and ineligible for stem cell transplantation or have recurrent disease
      after stem cell transplantation to oral ruxolitinib (ruxolitinib phosphate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety of oral ruxolitinib in subjects with DLBCL and PTCL. II. Determine
      progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and overall response (OS) in subjects
      with DLBCL and PTCL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the relationship between responses to oral ruxolitinib and alterations in gene
      expression profiling (GEP) signatures as well as biomarker immunophenotypic changes related
      to JAK2/STAT3, NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR pathways.

      II. Evaluate potential effect of oral ruxolitinib exposure on JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibition
      in serial tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
