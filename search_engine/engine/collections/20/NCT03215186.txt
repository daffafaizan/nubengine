      cataracts (CC), has been listed as a significant component of the international programme
      "VISION 2020 - the Right to Sight" launched by WHO in 1999. However, there is still a lot of
      unsolved problems regarding to CC, especially in developing countries, such as the delayed
      presentation and treatment to the hospitals, the lack of specialized treatment departments,
      and the poor treatment prognosis. With the two children policy opened in China in 2016, many
      CC parents hesitate to have a second child due to the potential high risk of CC. Date on
      detailed clinical characteristics of the CC children, including the demography,
      pregnancy-labor history, and living condition, are crucial for developing the national
      screening strategies of CC in Pregnant women. However, to our knowledge, it still lacks of
      thus large population-based and comprehensive investigations of the characteristics of CC
      children in developing countries. Supporting by the National Ministry of Health and the
      Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC), a specialized eye facility with the largest CC database in
      China, we therefore comprehensively investigated the demography, pregnancy-labor history, and
      living condition of CC children with their first visits to the hospital. We also further
      established a mathematic model of non-genetic risk factors of congenital cataracts. The
      implications of this study will be of clinical importance to roughly predict the risk of CC
      in pregnant women.
