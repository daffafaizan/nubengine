      selected. For the study performance, volunteers will be instructed to stop their brushing for
      23 to 25 hours before the first clinical visit. In addition, they will be also instructed to
      stop eating (solid foods and liquids) and to stop the use of cigarettes, if smoker, for 4
      hours before evaluation. Prior to the study, a pilot study will be conducted at the
      University Hospital of Bras√≠lia for the researcher calibration using the Turesky Modified
      Quigley Hein Plaque Index, following the predetermined protocol.

      A double-blind crossover study will be designed in which each volunteer will test two
      different models of toothbrushes. Prior to the beginning of the study, the brushes handle
      will be hidden with tape in a way that it will be not possible to see the toothbrush
      trademark. During the two visits, both brushes will be placed on the workbench and in the
      absence of the researcher, the participant will select one of the brushes. In the following
      visit, the same procedure will be performed and the participant will use the second brush. A
      period of washout of at least one week between the the first visit and the second visit will
      be done to obtain non-interference between results. No brush restriction will be imposed for
      the participant during this period.
