    
      Implant placement and abutment design will be planned with a computer software for guided
      implant treatment (SIMPLANT). The surgical implant placement will be performed under
      manufacturer's protocol by placing the implant platform 1mm below the buccal aspect of the
      osteotomy (Koutouzis et al 2013). Virtually designed, permanent CAD-CAM fabricated abutments
      (ATLANTIS, DENTSPLY) with different configuration of the subcritical contour (emergence
      shape) will be connected to the implants and temporary crowns will be delivered.

      Implants of the Group 1 will have permanent abutments with a concave configuration of the
      subcritical contour (emergence shape).

      Implants of the Group 2 will have permanent abutments with a convex configuration of the
      subcritical contour (emergence shape).

      The patients will be restored with single crowns 3 months following implant installation.

      A randomization protocol will be produced from a computer-generated list for the distribution
      of subjects in the two treatment groups.
