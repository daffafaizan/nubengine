      the pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of galantamine oral solution and galantamine
      tablet. All patients are healthy male patients who are 18-45 years old with BWI (Body Weight
      Index) between 18-28 kg/m2. All patients must sign informed consent before being enrolled. 24
      patients were randomized in the study. The duration of study is 9 days. All patients must
      stay at site unit for 12 hours after single oral administration otherwise patients could stay
      home but must return to site at specific date and time. The day before dosing day (baseline),
      patients were randomized to one of the two groups to be administered either 4mg galantamine
      oral solution (1ml) or galantamine tablet (1 tablet). After 7-day washout period, patients
      were crossed over to receive the other formulation. Pharmacokinetic observation will last to
      32 hours after dosing. Plasma were collected at immediately before dosing and 0.25, 0.5,
      0.75, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 32 hours after dosing to determine plasma concentration
      of galantamine. Safety and tolerance evaluation will last until Day 9. Safety evaluation
      include adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram and laboratory
      tests. On study Day 1, patients will take either 4mg galantamine oral solution (1ml) or 4mg
      galantamine tablet (1 tablet). After 7-day washout period, on Day 8, patients will cross over
      to take the other formulation, the dosage and administration are the same.
