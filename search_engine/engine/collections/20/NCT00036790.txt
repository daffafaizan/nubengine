        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of motexafin gadolinium and doxorubicin in patients
           with advanced malignancies.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      groups.

      Group A:

        -  Course 1: Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 9, and
           10 and doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on day 8.

        -  Course 2: 28 days after the beginning of course 1, patients receive doxorubicin IV over
           15 minutes.

        -  Courses 3-6: Beginning 21 days after course 2, patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15
           minutes on day 1 and motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days.

      Group B:

        -  Course 1: Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and
           doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on day 8.

        -  Course 2: 28 days after the beginning of course 1, patients receive doxorubicin IV over
           15 minutes on day 1 and motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3.

        -  Courses 3-6: Beginning 21 days after course 2, patients receive doxorubicin and
           motexafin gadolinium as in group A.

      Treatment in both groups continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m^2.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin and motexafin gadolinium
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose
      at which no more than 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-48 patients will be accrued for this study.
