      18F-FDG at baseline, after 1st cycle , and after 2nd cycle of systemic chemotherapy. The
      standard reference for treatment response was classified according to Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) after 3
      months of systemic chemotherapy. The metabolic response on PET was assessed according to PET
      response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST) criteria and was correlated to the treatment
      response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
