    
      Indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma is treated mainly with radiation and chemotherapy
      using a combination of chemotherapies, such as purine-analogues and CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). After the approval of an antibody therapy agent
      RituximabÂ®, it alone or combination with CHOP has been introduced. Bendamustine hydrochloride
      has a unique structure compared with the marketed agents, and has an innovative mechanism of
      action. Thus, it is expected that Bendamustine hydrochloride will provide new alternatives
      for patients with refractory/recurrent indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
