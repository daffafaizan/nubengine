      randomized controlled design with N = 240. Both the study group and the control group will be
      enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line, will receive four weeks of nicotine patches, and
      receive phone based counseling through the Quit Line. The control group n = 120 will receive
      the Quit Line intervention alone where as the study group n = 120 will receive the Quit Line
      intervention plus the Mindfulness Training for Smokers (MTS) Intervention.

      Mindfulness Training for Smokers provides 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation instruction
      followed by entry into a MTS meditation group. The total time for the study including
      recruitment, intervention and participant follow-up for N = 240 will be four years. The study
      will recruit subjects from the Dane county region through the University of Wisconsin School
      of Medicine and Public Health Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CRTI).
      Recruitment will take place through the television and radio advertisements (appendix). In
      addition, the Wisconsin Quit Line web site will provide a link to the MTS study. With this
      link, quit line coaches will have a brief description of the study (see appendix) and will
      provide contact information for the study. Finally, the MTS web site (url: www.sittoquit.org)
      will provide basic introductory information available to the general public.

      The principal hypothesis for the study is that MTS plus Quit Line will lead to significantly
      higher rates of smoking cessation at 6 months than use of the Quit Line alone. Secondary
      hypotheses is that study group compared to controls will show significant differences in
      questionnaire results that test distress, depression, anxiety, attentional control,
      mindfulness and quality of life.
