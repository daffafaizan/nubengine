      regulatory T-cells. Patients in whom a decision to treat with one of the following therapies
      (Dovobet, neotigason, narrow-band UVB and anti TNF alpha therapy) and agreed to take part in
      the study will be selected. Allocation of different treatments to patients is not part of the
      study. We will enroll 40 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in the age range from 18
      to 70. patients must be treatment-free for at least 2 weeks for topical application and 4
      weeks for systemic treatment of psoriasis. females of child bearing potential must be on
      reliable contraception. Children below 18 years, patients above 70 years, pregnant and
      lactating patients and immunosuppressed patients are excluded from this study. Blood and
      tissue samples will be taken before and after treatment. We will also invite 10 patients who
      are receiving ellipse excisions of naevi, and who known not to have psoriasis, to provide
      control samples of distal skin beyond the margins required to demonstrate complete removal
      and control donation of blood.
