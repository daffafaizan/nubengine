      potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models.

      Phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20 mg ~ 480 mg single dosing with healthy subjects,
      demonstrated that the Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase
      I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that
      Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed
      in high dose.

      A open-labeled, single-dosing, parallel Clinical Study to Evaluate pharmacokinetic
      characteristics after oral administration of fimasartan in healthy elderly and young male
      volunteers.

      22 male healthy volunteers were enrolled during 2 months.

      In part A, 240 mg of fimasartan per day was taken once by younger male healthy volunteers in
      day 1. Then blood and urine samples were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
      and 48 hours after administration.

      In part B, 240 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day was taken once by elderly male healthy
      volunteers in day 1. Then blood and urine samples were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,
      4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after administration.
