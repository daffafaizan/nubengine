    
      Prospective, longitudinal, double bind, randomized study of the effect of vitamin D
      supplementation in OSAHS patients with hypovitaminosis D.

      After written informed consent, patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of oral
      vitamin D (400 000 UI) or placebo. Subjects will undergo medical screening before
      randomisation into placebo or active group. Follow-up measurements will be performed at the
      beginning (day 0) and after 32 days of vitamin D supplementation: clinical examination,
      biological check up and sleep parameter evaluation. Patients will be instructed to stop using
      continuous positive airway pressure device for two nights before nocturnal sleep studies.
