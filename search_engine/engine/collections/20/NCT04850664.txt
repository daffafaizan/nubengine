      Orbitofrontal Cortex Training (CBOT), as an alternative strategy for relapse prevention in
      patients with Opioid Use (OUD) and other substance use disorders (SUD). This treatment
      leverages the overlap in brain regions that process smell and mediate decision making. The
      CBOT is portable and can be used at home. This clinical trial is being conducted to
      demonstrate its utility for home application by nontreatment seeking and treatment-seeking
      OUD populations, to engage in long-term, successful opioid recovery.

      Key objectives of this project are to: (1) establish the effectiveness of CBOT for improved
      retention and relapse prevention in a large sample of OUD subjects; (2) establish its
      effectiveness for acute reduction of withdrawal severity and negative affect early in
      recovery; and (3) evaluate its safety, user-friendliness and acceptability. Accomplishment of
      these goals would lead to larger clinical trials for OUD and wider applications of CBOT in
      other addictive disorders.
