      acute and chronic healthcare facilities in Belgium. MRSA infection is causing increased
      public concern as it carries a significant risk of morbidity, mortality and has been linked
      to substantial excess healthcare costs.

      Efficient control of MRSA transmission within healthcare facilities critically depends on
      screening for and isolation of MRSA carriers among admitted patients. Active surveillance
      cultures for MRSA are now part of clinical practice recommendations both in Europe and the
      USA. Indeed, studies have indicated that up to 70 % of the patient reservoir for MRSA among
      hospitalized patients can only be detected by active sampling of muco-cutaneous colonization
      sites. There is an urgent public health need for early and reliable detection of carriers of
      MRSA among patients admitted to healthcare facilities, to inform patient isolation and
      decontamination procedures, and thereby more effectively control cross-infection

      The general objectives of this intervention study to be conducted in two large Belgian
      hospitals are to measure the impact of rapid (< 3 h) PCR detection of MRSA carriage upon
      patient admission on shortening the delay to implement contact isolation precautions for
      carriers and reducing nosocomial MRSA transmission to patients admitted in the same wards.
