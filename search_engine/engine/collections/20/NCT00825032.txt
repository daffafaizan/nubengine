      the regional centre of Villa Pineta Hospital.

      Patients were randomized into two groups: control and intervention. Patients randomized to
      the control group undertook an inpatient comprehensive PR that complied with the
      recommendations made by the ATS/ERS and included a minimum of 15 daily sessions of specific
      training for lower extremities.

      Patients randomized to the intervention group undertook an experimental program consisting of
      15 additional daily sessions of unsupported UEET over and above the same PR program used for
      control patients.

      Measurements of upper extremity performance and symptoms perceived were taken in both groups
      at baseline (T0) and at the completion of the interventions (Tend) by one physiotherapist
      unaware to the patient's group allocation. To verify if the experimental training leads to
      long-term results on the functional arm exercise capacity, some measurements were repeated at
      6-months as the latest follow-up (T6months).
