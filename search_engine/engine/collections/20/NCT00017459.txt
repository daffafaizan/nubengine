      non-small cell lung cancer treated with vinorelbine and cisplatin with or without
      tirapazamine. II. Compare the complete and partial response rates, time to disease
      progression, and time to treatment failure in these patients treated with these regimens.
      III. Compare the clinical benefit of these regimens, in terms of performance status and body
      weight, in these patients. IV. Compare the toxicity and safety of these regimens in these
      patients. V. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 1
      hour on day 1. Patients also receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22. Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin and vinorelbine as in arm I. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during each course of treatment, at 30
      days after the last course of treatment, and then every 8 weeks for 2-3 years. Patients are
      followed every 8 weeks for 2-3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800 patients will be accrued for this study.
