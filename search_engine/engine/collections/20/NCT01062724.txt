      infants. Prolonged parenteral nutrition is associated with complications affecting the
      hepatobiliary system, such as cholelithiasis, cholestasis, and steatosis. The most common of
      these is total parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (TPNAC), that occurs because of
      reduced bile flow from the liver into the duodenum. Cholestasis causes liver damage and in
      some cases, death. Infant and neonate are at particular risk for this complication. The
      incidence of TPNAC ranges from 7.4 to 84%.

      Animal studies have implicated amino acids in the production of cholestasis; whereas studies
      in human neonates suggest a direct effect of amino acid infusions on the hepatocyte
      canalicular membrane. An appropriate amino acid solution might compensate for the metabolic
      immaturity of infants and perhaps reduce total parenteral nutrition associated complications
      such as cholestasis. Therefore, is important to compare the frequency of cholestasis and
      blood amino acid concentration during Primene and Trophamine use.
