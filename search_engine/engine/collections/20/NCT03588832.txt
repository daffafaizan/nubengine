      patients is undeniable. Given the above, it is essential to evaluate this construct,
      considering the impact it has on the ADL. There are numerous scales that allow evaluating how
      spasticity affects post-stroke functionality, even helping to detect which beneficial aspects
      of spasticity should be considered when defining a therapeutic strategy. Among the most used
      scales are the Barthel Index, which assesses the level of patient independence with respect
      to the performance of some ADL. The scientific evidence suggests that patients with
      spasticity have low rates in Barthel.

      The scientific evidence suggests that a careful and continuous evaluation of spasticity,
      would allow to identify establishment times and affected structures; as well as, to recognize
      predictive factors that assist rehabilitation professionals, identifying which patients are
      predisposed to develop spasticity, in order to reduce the risk of its establishment and
      influence its evolution, helping to identify preventive measures and effective interventions,
      that allow to achieve better motor and functional results, promoting its application in
      search of an optimal recovery.

      Given the above, the purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of patterns and
      their impact on the quality of life of patients after sequelae of a stroke. The generation of
      new scientific evidence acquires vital importance and are key to the management of these
      patients.
