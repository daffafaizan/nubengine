      disorder(GSAD)will respond to treatment with available pharmacotherapeutic agents such as
      SSRI's. This still leaves 50% that respond partially or not at all. Those who do respond,
      often experience adverse events (e.g., sexual dysfunction), which leads them to discontinue
      treatment. Thus, there is a strong rational for identifying alternatives to SSRI's that are
      effective with fewer side effects (or with a different side-effect profile, that features
      less sexual dysfunction)for the treatment of GSAD. Available data demonstrate that
      sustained-release venlafaxine, a dual reuptake inhibitor, is also effective for GSAD.(Stein
      et al., 2005). It is unclear from these studies whether serotonin reuptake is integral to
      efficacy for social anxiety disorder, or whether norepinephrine reuptake will convey similar
      efficacy. Atomoxetine (Strattera)an inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter,
      is an ideal candidate to address both these issues.
