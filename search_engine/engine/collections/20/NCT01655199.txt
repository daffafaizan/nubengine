      Cardiology and Pneumology of Quebec and in the Chest Institute of Montreal). For each
      patient, three visits will be performed. During the first visit, baseline pulmonary function
      and maximal exercise capacity will be evaluated and the patients will be familiarized with
      step test proceedings. Between the different visits, a 3-7 days period will be respected.
      During the second and the third visits, 4 step tests will be performed at 4 different rates,
      following one of the two conditions (placebo or bronchodilatation). This project will propose
      two randomization levels. The first randomization will be relative to the choice of the
      condition used during the second visit (placebo ou bronchodilatation) and the second one for
      the rates order (14, 16, 20, 24 steps/min). During each performed exercise, cardiorespiratory
      and pulmonary parameters will be measured using a portable system.
