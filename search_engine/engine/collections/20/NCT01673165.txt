      The fluid contains chyle, a milky fluid consisting of fat droplets. The standard treatment is
      to feed an infant with a specialized low fat formula for up to 6 weeks until the chest has
      time to heal. This formula is generally not well tolerated and mother's of our patients have
      expressed a desire to continue using breast milk. A few case reports have been published, but
      there have not been any studies to date looking at this. Data will be collected to include
      information about nutrition, weight gain, teaching needs, surgical, hospital, and discharge
      information.
