      supplementation of n-3 PUFA (4.4g/day) to placebo in claudicants (Rutherford stage 1-3) for 3
      months. Eligible patients will be screened according to specified inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All patients will be treated per our current practice as reflected in the American
      Heart Association Practice guidelines on PAD. Blood draws, vascular function testing and
      6-minute walking tests will be performed at baseline and after 3 months. n-3 PUFA
      supplementation will be achieved with 4 capsules of Pro-Omega twice daily (Nordic Naturals,
      Watsonville, California, USA), corresponding to a total of 4.4g/day. Each ProOmega capsule
      contains 325mg of EPA and 225mg of DHA. The placebo group will take the same number of
      capsules containing inactive substance (soybean; Nordic Naturals), designed to be the same
      color and shape as the treatment capsules.
