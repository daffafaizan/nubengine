      2015 are included in this study. We collect the data about the SCr of the patients before and
      after percutaneous coronary intervention, and define CIN as an increase in SCr of 0.5 mg/dl
      or 25% from baseline between 48 and 72 h after contrast medium exposure. Besides we obtain
      the data including clinical characteristics, laboratory data (blood and urine tests) for all
      the patients. The statistical analysis will find some new risk factors.
