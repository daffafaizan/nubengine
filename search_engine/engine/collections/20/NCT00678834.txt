      g- and d-tocotrienol (TCT). Vitamin E research has developed highly asymmetrically. Out of
      the 25,000+ papers on vitamin E in the PubMed, 99% deal with tocopherols. Recent research has
      demonstrated the lack of cancer-preventive effects and potential adverse health consequences
      of tocopherol (6). As a result, more attention has been turned towards non-tocopherol forms
      of vitamin E (16). Palm oil represents a major source of natural TCT. TCT possess powerful
      neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-cancer and cholesterol lowering properties that often
      differ from the properties of TCP (15).

      During the last five years, our and other laboratories have reported several striking
      beneficial properties of tocotrienols in experimental settings. One major concern that limits
      enthusiasm for tocotrienol for humans is the report that the vitamin E transporting protein,
      tocopherol-transport protein (TTP), has a very low affinity to transport tocotrienol. Using
      TTP-knock out mice, we have recently demonstrated that oral TCT is effectively carried to
      vital organs and that such transport can take place independent of TTP. With that background,
      the purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis that orally supplemented tocotrienol
      reaches the vital organs of humans.
