      reduced life span. Despite the many modalities available to treat this disease,as surgery,
      medical treatment and radiotherapy, uncontrolled disease persists in a significant portion of
      patients

      Oral estrogens, alone or in combination with somatostatin receptor analogues, have been shown
      to control acromegaly in women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) resulted in
      similar effects in both genders. Clomiphene citrate, a SERM that increases luteinizing
      hormone and follicle stimulating hormone secretion, improves hypogonadism and fertility
      outcomes.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of clomiphene citrate on serum insulin like
      growth factor 1 and testosterone levels in male acromegalic patients not controlled by
      surgery, radiotherapy and/or medical treatment.

      In this prospective, open label, single center trial, sixteen male patients were studied.
      Clomiphene citrate (50 mg/day) was added to previous medical treatment for 3 months and
      hormonal assessment was performed prior to and during the intervention. Hormones included:
      growth hormone, insulin like growth factor, total testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone,
      luteinizing hormone and prostate-specific antigen.
