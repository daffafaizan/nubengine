    
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is expected to affect 131 million people worldwide by 2050, but as
      many as 40% of these cases may be prevented by targeting modifiable risk factors such as
      diet, physical activity, cognitive engagement, and smoking. Neurotrack Technologies, Inc.
      will test the efficacy of a digital multi-domain lifestyle intervention with health coaching
      for cognitive health designed to change behaviors associated with increased risk for AD. This
      digital intervention addresses the challenge of scaling effective multi-domain lifestyle
      interventions for cognitive health and has the potential to improve risk behaviors, thereby
      reducing and/or delaying cognitive decline in older adults at risk for AD.
