      determine if they are eligible to participate in the study. There are certain prestudy test
      that are required: physical exam, blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, bone marrow aspirate and
      biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of AML.

      Treatment regimen consists of Azacitidine IV/SQ on days 1-5 every 28 days. If the Azacitidine
      is given IV it will be given over 15-40 minutes. The treatment will be given for a minimum of
      4 treatment cycles. Blood samples will be taken every week to monitor for side effects of the
      Azacitidine. A bone marrow aspirate will be done every 3-4 months to determine the response
      to the study drug or until the disease progresses. There is also a quality of life
      questionnaire that will be completed at the beginning of the study and every 4 weeks while on
      the study.
