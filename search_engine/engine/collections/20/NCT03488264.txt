      stigma, demographic and clinical characteristics, sickle cell disease (SCD) self-management
      strategies, and quality of life (QoL) in adults with SCD in the United States (US) and
      Jamaica, countries with important differences relevant to this study. Proposed is a cross
      sectional study that will use a convergent parallel mixed methods design (individual
      interviews and self-report surveys). Participants will be interviewed about SCD
      self-management strategies and how sources of stigma influence these strategies. Quantitative
      measures will be used to assess perceived stigma [SCD Health-Related Stigma Scale (SCD-HRSS)]
      and QoL [Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measures (ASCQ-Me): emotional impact, pain
      episodes, pain impact, sleep impact, social functioning impact, and stiffness impact; disease
      severity]. The primary outcome of the study is stigma and the secondary outcome is
      QoL(emotional impact, pain episodes, pain impact, sleep impact, social functioning impact,
      and stiffness impact; disease severity).

      The specific aims of this study are to:

      Aim 1: Determine the influences of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical
      characteristics on SCD self-management and QoL in adults with SCD in the US and Jamaica.

      Question 1: What are the influences of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical
      characteristics on SCD self-management? Question 2: What are the influences of perceived
      stigma and demographic and clinical characteristics on QoL? Aim 2: Describe the relationship
      between SCD self-management strategies and QoL.
