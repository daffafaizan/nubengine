    
      Retrospective cohort analysis of breast cancer patient's records for patients treated with
      surgery as an initial intervention at our department from 2015 to 2018 will be identified.
      Multivariate analyses of factors, including pathological stage (PS), T stage (T), nodal stage
      (N), grade (G), estrogen receptor (ER) status (E) and human epidermal growth factor receptor
      (HER2) status will be recorded to identify associations with disease-free survival DFS. A
      score of 0-4 will be assigned for each factor by considering the hazard ratio magnitude.

      Analysis of the correlation between pathological stage, T stage (T), nodal stage (N), grade
      (G), estrogen receptor (ER) status (E) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)
      status combined score and the disease free survival (DFS ).
