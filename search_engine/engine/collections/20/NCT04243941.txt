      prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging can help
      optimize the placement of the high dose inhomogeneity characterizing stereotactic body
      radiation therapy. All radiation plans have "hot spots" of radiation, and in current practice
      these regions are randomly located. This study will focus those hot spots on regions
      determined by mpMRI + PSMA-PET to have visible tumor.
