      home PFMT results in increased frequency of home exercises sets per month performed by the
      patients and objective cure rate after 3 months of supervised training. Secondarily, to
      investigate other subjective and objective clinical parameters in the groups that received or
      not BF together with PFMT after 3 months of supervised training, and in a longer term of
      9-month follow-up.

      Method: 72 incontinent women were randomized to the: BF Group (outpatient BF + home PFMT) or
      PFMT Group (outpatient PFMT + home PFMT).

      Assessments: baseline after 3 months of supervised treatment and at 9-month follow-up (after
      6 additional months of home PFMT without supervision).

      Primary outcomes: adherence - monthly exercises sets performed (exercise diary) and objective
      cure of SUI (pad test) after 3 months.

      Secondary outcomes: urinary symptoms, muscle function, quality of life, adhesion and subject
      cure at the two time-points.
