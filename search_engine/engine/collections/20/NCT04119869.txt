      Cancer Institute. The iaya app is a smartphone application intervention that -through a
      variety of approaches, such as exercises aimed at identifying and changing thoughts and
      behaviors, imagery, and relaxation- seeks to enhance coping with the emotional impact of
      cancer.

      The investigators are conducting this study to see if the iaya app, specifically developed
      for young adults with cancer, is practical, to determine patient satisfaction with the iaya
      app, and to test study procedures.
