      between coffee consumption and the incidence of cardiovascular disease has been studied
      extensively, the effects of this drink on the cardiovascular apparatus and its role as a risk
      factor for coronary heart disease are still debated. Moreover, the effect of coffee on
      attention, sleep changes, anxiety and panic disorders was studied but a great variability was
      observed.

      Many of the known or suspected cardiovascular and neuropsychologic effects of coffee have
      been attributed to caffeine. The main mechanism of action of caffeine is to antagonize
      adenosine receptors; a secondary effect is the inhibition of phosphodiesterases, with the
      subsequent accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and a intensification of the
      effects of catecholamines.

      It is also well known that there is a considerable variability in the cardiovascular and
      neuropsychologic response to coffee drinking, explaining the inconsistency between different
      effects observed in the various studies. This variability may have a genetic basis.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate acute cardiovascular and neuropsychologic effects of
      coffee and explore whether such effects are influenced by the genetic asset of caffeine
      metabolism (by a polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 1A2), adenosine metabolism (by
      polymorphisms of adenosine receptor and adenosine monophosphate deaminase) or catecholamine
      receptors (by polymorphisms of adrenergic receptors).
