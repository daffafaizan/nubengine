      cause of mortality in the world . With half of the world's population living in Asia, stroke
      epidemiology and its risk factor determination is important globally. The changes in
      population demographics and continuing industrialization in Asia have also led to a change in
      the epidemiology of stroke sub-types . Among the ischemic stroke sub-types, Intracranial
      Atherosclerotic disease is now emerging as the most prevalent vascular cause of stroke with
      high prevalence in Asian, African and Hispanic individuals .

      Patients with ICAD are at a significant risk for recurrent stroke, with a risk as high as 25%
      in the first two years . Rate of recurrent stroke also varies by the location of the affected
      artery. Risk factor management is extremely important for the primary and secondary
      prevention of stroke in Asia as it is in Western countries. With the changing demographics
      and relatively fewer cost effective treatment modalities available, particularly for resource
      poor countries like Pakistan, it is imperative to delineate the clinical as well as lifestyle
      risk factors at an earlier asymptomatic stage to prevent future life-threatening
      consequences.

      Therefore the primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical, lifestyle,
      dietary and psycho-social determinants of asymptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic disease
      (ICAD) and its other associated Brain MRI findings namely brain volume reduction, silent
      brain infarcts, and peri-ventricular hyper intensities in clinically normal adults with ICAD
      on MRI Brain.
