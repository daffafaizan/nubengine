      dose of UCN-01 administered as a 3, 2, or 1 hour infusion every 4 weeks for patients with
      advanced solid tumor malignancies and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. II. Investigate
      the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of UCN-01 administered on this schedule in
      these patients. III. Obtain preliminary evidence of the antitumor activity of UCN-01 in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is dose escalation study. Patients receive UCN-01 by intravenous infusions over
      3, 2 or 1 hour(s) every 4 weeks. The first dose level is administered over 3 hours, the next
      dose level is administered over 2 hours, and the next and subsequent dose levels are
      administered over 1 hour. One patient is treated at each dose level until unacceptable
      toxicity is observed. An additional 2 patients are then entered at that dose level. If dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) is experienced in 1 of 3 patients, 3 additional patients are accrued
      at that dose level. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose has been
      surpassed and a total of 6 patients must be treated at the previous dose level. If no
      patients develop DLT, the dose is escalated in successive cohorts of 3 patients per dose
      level. Patients are followed for 4 weeks after each drug administration before subsequent
      patients can be entered at the next higher dose level. Patients are followed for 2 months
      after their last dose of UCN-01.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued into this study over 18 months.
