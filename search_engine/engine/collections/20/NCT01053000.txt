    
      Subjects will be randomized such that their RIGHT dorsal hand/forearm will receive one of the
      following two treatments with the subject's LEFT dorsal hand/forearm receiving the other
      treatment; Treatment 1 will include pre-treatment of the dorsal hand/forearm with Tazorac
      0.1% gel BID for one week, followed by ALA applied to the entire dorsal hand/forearm 60
      minutes prior to BLUE light treatment for 16 minutes 40 seconds Treatment 2 will have ALA
      applied to the entire dorsal hand/forearm and occluded for 60 minutes prior to BLUE light
      treatment for 16 minutes 40 secondsNote: ALA will be applied to individual dorsal
      hand/forearm actinic keratoses (AK) lesions followed by broad area application over the
      entire dorsal hand/forearm surface. The treatment area on the side NOT pre-treated with
      Tazorac will then be occluded using plastic wrap for 60 minutes. The treatment area of the
      dorsal hand/forearm is defined as the extensor surface of the hand/forearm between the elbow
      and the base of the fingers (the fingers are NOT included in the treatment area).
