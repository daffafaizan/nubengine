    
      This is a Phase 2, , randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled, 2-weeks, proof-of-concept study
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the mechanistic effect of Aerosol
      administration of Aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid plus Inhalation administration by
      nebulization captopril 25mg in subjects infected with COVID -19

      After randomization and standard treatment The infected patients will receive Aerosolized 13
      cis retinoic acid plus Inhalation administration by nebulization captopril 25mg once daily.
      for 14 days
