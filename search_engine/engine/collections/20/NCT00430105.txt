      and microscopic polyangiitis, are progressive, multisystem, autoimmune diseases which respond
      to immunosuppressive therapy. Their treatment with corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs has
      been standardised in a first wave of studies (ECSYSVASTRIAL project), but limitations of such
      regimens include only partial efficacy and appreciable treatment-related toxicity.

      The present trial, CYCLOPS, aims to reduce the cumulative exposure to immunosuppressive drugs
      by administering cyclophosphamide (CYC) as intermittent pulses. The potential benefit of
      using CYC in this way for AASV has been demonstrated in preliminary, smaller studies.
      Patients with previously untreated AASV and, "generalised", but not life threatening, disease
      with renal involvement, will be randomised to either continuous oral CYC or intermittent
      pulse CYC. CYC will be continued until three months after remission has been achieved, with a
      minimum CYC total duration of six months and maximum duration of twelve months; both limbs
      will then receive the same maintenance regimen of azathioprine and prednisolone.

      The study will last 18 months. The primary end-point is the disease-free period, taken as the
      period of time from remission until relapse or study end; secondary end-points are adverse
      effects, cumulative damage and immunosuppressive drug exposure. 160 patients will be
      required.
