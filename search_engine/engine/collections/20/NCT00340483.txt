      they often fail in their quit attempts. This group may benefit from aids which promote higher
      rates of success in their quit attempts. The lack of promising approaches for adolescent and
      young adult smoking cessation is a recognized problem.

      The goal of this study is to build on previous work in developing a smoking cessation kit for
      youth, which is based on the principles of social marketing and social cognitive theory. This
      study aims to test the acceptability and efficacy of the X-Pack intervention. It is our
      belief that with minimal assistance--in the form of the X-Pack product and supporting
      e-mails--the quit attempts that young people make can result in long-term abstinence.

      The design of this study is a two-arm randomized trial where participants are randomized to
      the X-Pack condition or to the control condition. Study participants consist of current
      smokers between the ages of 18-22 who are interested in quitting in the next 6 months. The
      first 292 participants who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and
      randomized to one of two conditions. Participants in the intervention condition will receive
      the X-Pack, an in-person counseling session, and supporting e-mails. Participants in the
      control condition will receive the control materials, Clearing the Air, and an in-person
      counseling session. Participants will be measured at baseline, 2 and 6 months.
