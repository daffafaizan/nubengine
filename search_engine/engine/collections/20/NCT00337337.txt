      pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). It has been found that high fiber
      concentration in meal is frequently associated with low GI. In many single-blind cross-over
      study, short term consumption of high fiber meal has been shown to enhance postprandial
      insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. We presume that increasing daily consumption of
      fiber would improve the insulin resistance and therefor glycemic parameters patients with DM.
      Patients with type 2 diabetes with stable dose of hypoglycemic medication control will be
      recruited, two types of meals will be given, type A is a general Asian rice-meal and type B
      consists of the same rice with multiple-grain-fiber added. Both type of meals will be
      consumed for 3 months by each patients.
