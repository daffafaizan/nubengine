      safety and efficacy of IdeS® (Hansa Medical, Lund, Sweden) given immediately prior to kidney
      transplantation. We hope that IdeS® will help eliminate DSAs in HS patients who are DSA+ and
      flow cytometry (FCMX) crossmatch + at time of transplant. We plan to enroll a total of 20
      patients. Patients will be followed for 6 months post administration of IdeS®.
