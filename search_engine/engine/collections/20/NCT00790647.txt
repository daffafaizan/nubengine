    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if hematologic responses to high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell
           transplantation increase with addition of bortezomib in the conditioning regimen in
           patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Autologous stem cell mobilization and collection: Patients receive filgrastim to
           mobilize stem cells, which are then collected.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive bortezomib intravenously on days -6, -3, 1, and 4
           and oral high-dose melphalan on days -2 and -1.

        -  Stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplantation on day
           0.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and
      annually thereafter.
