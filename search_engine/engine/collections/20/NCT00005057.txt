      hours for 7 days in combination with adenovirus RSV-TK administered by direct intralesional
      injection in patients with cutaneous or subcutaneous metastatic malignant melanoma. II.
      Determine the dose limiting toxicities of this regimen in this patient population. III.
      Evaluate the response (both local and at distant metastatic sites), duration of response,
      response by ganciclovir dose, and any impact local treatment with adenovirus RSV-TK and
      ganciclovir "suicide" gene therapy may have on overall survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ganciclovir. Patients are stratified according to
      response of the index lesion and other metastatic disease sites. Patients receive an
      intratumoral injection of adenovirus RSV-TK on day 1. Ganciclovir IV is administered every 12
      hours on days 3-10 for a total of 14 doses. Patients sustaining a partial response (PR) or
      complete response (CR) may be retreated 2 weeks after documented PR or CR. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of ganciclovir until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 60 days, then every 2
      months for 6 months, and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
