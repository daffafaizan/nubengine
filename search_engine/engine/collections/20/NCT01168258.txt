      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), endothelin-1 (EDN1) and receptor for
      advanced glycation end product (RAGE) genes are associated with the development of diabetic
      macular edema (DME).

      Study Population:

      Two hundred case participants with DME and 200 diabetic controls without DME will be
      enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a longitudinal, genetic association study evaluating whether single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF, EPO, EDN1 and RAGE genes affect the development and progression
      of DME. All participants will provide a blood sample, undergo an eye examination, optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) and discuss their medical, family
      and social history. Case participants with DME and diabetic control participants without DME
      will be allowed to receive standard-of-care treatment at the NEI under this protocol.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome variable is the genotype frequency of SNPs in the above specific genes of
      DME and control participants. Secondary outcomes are serum levels of VEGF, EPO, EDN1 and AGE,
      plasma biomarkers such as mRNA and ophthalmic measurements (visual acuity and imaging results
      such as FA and OCT results). The longitudinal outcome measure includes investigating
      associations between the studied genetic polymorphisms and the long-term response to
      standard-of-care therapy.
