      Inonu University Medical Faculty Hospital were recruited.They were equally randomized into
      three groups: PLMA, supreme and i-gel groups. All three devices were compared with regard to
      oropharyngeal leak pressure, number and duration of insertion attempts and complications of
      airway. Oropharyngeal leak pressure will evaluate including to start,trendelenburg and
      postoperative at period. Fiberoptic evaluation of the LMA's position were performed after
      successful insertion and determination of the airway pressures. After one hour patients were
      evaluated by a blinded independent observer for postoperative complications ( sore throat,
      dysphonia and dysphagia).
