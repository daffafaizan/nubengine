      determine asthma severity. Omalizumab is a man-made monoclonal antibody that directly blocks
      the cause of allergic reactions. There are three main objectives to this study. The first is
      to gain an understanding of how omalizumab affects cells involved in the immune response. The
      second objective is to determine whether response to omalizumab is influenced by exposure to
      environmental factors, including allergens and viral infections. The third objective is to
      determine what clinical markers can be used to determine which patients would most benefit
      from omalizumab therapy. This study will evaluate the immune and allergic responses of
      inner-city children with moderate to severe asthma who are receiving omalizumab or placebo as
      part of a parallel study (Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma, ICAC-08, NCT00377572).

      Nasal secretions will be collected from all participants at the beginning of this study,
      toward the middle of the study, and with each asthma exacerbation requiring a clinical visit.
      Some participants will participate in either the basophil or T-cell studies and associated
      procedures. These studies require blood collection at five study visits. Sputum collection
      will occur at four study visits. Those participants involved in the basophil studies will
      also undergo skin testing at three study visits.
