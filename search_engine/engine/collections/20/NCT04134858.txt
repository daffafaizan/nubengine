      frequent attenders in primary healthcare. The experimental group received the health coaching
      and the control group received the usual care. The data were collected with pre- and posttest
      12-month follow-up via a questionnaire of FINRISKI2012, RAND-36 and ACDI and clinical health
      outcomes measured by health-coaching nurses. The data were analyzed by statistical methods.
