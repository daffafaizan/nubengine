      superior vena cava to the end of the tip of the catheter using TEE, and measures the
      insertion depth of the catheter at insertion point. It is possible to find the ideal central
      venous catheter insertion depth in actual clinical practice in adult patient.

      The ideal central venous catheter insertion depth can be measured accurately when the end of
      the central venous catheter is monitored with transesophageal ultrasonography, and it can be
      derived a meaningful formula for predicting the ideal central venous insertion depth from the
      patient's height .
