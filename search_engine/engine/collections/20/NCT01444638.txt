      have/not have pre-spinal ultrasound examination of their back, prior to spinal insertion by
      anesthesia trainees.

      The hypothesis is that ultrasound visualization of the patient spinal spaces will allow
      junior residents to correctly place the spinal needle with fewer attempts.

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the primary outcome (number of
      attempts). i.e. the investigators hypothesize that the number of attempts is not affected by
      ultrasound assistance. The control group will undergo spinal anesthesia with manual
      palpation, the standard of care.
