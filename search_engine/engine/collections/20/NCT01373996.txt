      theater, recovery room and intensive care unit is well established and uses pressure sensor
      connected via cable to patient's bedside monitor. The wireless sensors result in reduction of
      wires attached to the patient and may enhance nursing, treatment and transportation of
      patients in aforementioned setting.

      The HMW 10 Wireless System was developed and incorporates wireless transmission of patient's
      signal. The purpose of the study was to measure the quality of data transmitted through the
      HMW 10 Wireless System, and to demonstrate that the quality of the data meets the
      requirements of European Directive 93/42/EEC (Medical Device Directive - MDD) and EN/IEC
      60601-1 and EN/IEC 60601-2-34.
