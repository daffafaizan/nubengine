    
      This is a prospective, observational study in which all the patients will have implants
      placed and a provisional prosthesis attached within 24 hours of implant surgery. Each
      restorative case will consist of a posterior short span fixed bridge of four implants or
      less. The final prosthesis will be placed within five months or implant placement surgery.
      Overall success will be determined on the basis of procedural success, prosthesis success,
      and implant success.
