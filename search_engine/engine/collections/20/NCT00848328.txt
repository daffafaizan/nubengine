      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular or
           small lymphocytic non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with lenalidomide and rituximab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to disease progression, duration of response, and overall survival
           of these patients.

        -  To determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess changes in serum cytokines before and after treatment and correlate these
           changes with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive rituximab
      IV on days 15 and 22 of course 1 and on days 1 and 8 of course 2. Patients who do not achieve
      complete response after 2 courses of rituximab may receive up to 4 additional doses of
      rituximab once weekly for 4 weeks.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and after treatment for cytokine analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
