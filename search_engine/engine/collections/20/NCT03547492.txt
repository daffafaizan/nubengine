      randomized into a language (intervention) or motor (control) group. All participants have a
      baseline LENA (device that captures 16 hour recording and associated computer analysis
      generates a report of numbers of adult words spoken, infant vocalization and conversational
      turns). Interventions after the baseline recording by group are as follows:

      Intervention:

        1. Review language curriculum and motor curriculum with study personnel

        2. Direct linguistic feedback of baseline LENA recording

        3. 2nd LENA recording completed and analyzed

        4. Direct or mailed linguistic feedback of 2nd LENA recording

        5. 16- Weekly text messages

        6. 4 month LENA recording with mailed linguistic feedback

        7. 12 month LENA recording with mailed linguistic feedback

      Control:

        1. Review motor curriculum with study personnel

        2. 2nd LENA recording completed and analyzed

        3. 4- monthly text messages

        4. 4 month LENA recording

        5. 12 month LENA recording with mailed linguistic feedback of all recordings

      Both groups undergo the following assessments:

        1. Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 4 and 12 months

        2. Maternal Peabody Picture Vocabulary test at 4 months

        3. Edinburgh Post-partum Depression Scale at 4 months

        4. MacArthur Bates Communicative Developmental Inventory: Words and Gestures at 12
