    
      The main objective is to assess the concordance of two non-invasive devices using the
      technology described above : the Clearsight (Edwards Lifesciences, pulse contour analysis),
      and the Niccomo (Medis, bioimpedance). Both will be used in each patient included in the
      study. They will be tested during modifications of cardiac preload induced by sequences of
      position changes (see below) including Trendelenburg and anti-Trendelenburg positioning,
      performed systematically before and after the procedure, as well as during fluid challenges,
      vasopressor boluses and alveolar recruitment maneuvers (performed during the procedure
      according to the needs of the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient). Both monitors will
      also be compared with an invasive monitor of stroke volume (Vigileo/Flotrac, Edwards
      Lifesciences), and the respiratory pulse pressure variation will also be measured during the
      sequences of position changes and will be used as a gold standard for fluid responsiveness.
