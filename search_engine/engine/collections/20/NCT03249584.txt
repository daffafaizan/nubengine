      Conformité Européene (CE) mark in Europe, and Health Canada Licence in Canada. The goal of
      this study is to collect real-world outcomes among a cohort of patients in the US, EUR and
      CAN with metastatic malignant lesions in a vertebral body, painful metastatic lesions
      involving bone (in the US, patients with metastatic lesions involving the bone must have
      failed or were not candidates for standard therapy), and benign bone tumors such as osteoid
      osteoma who receive treatment with the OsteoCool™ RF Ablation system. Additionally, the study
      will collect device, procedure and/or therapy related adverse events and device deficiencies.
      Lastly, subject outcomes (such as pain relief, quality of life, and function) will be
      evaluated using validated assessment measures.
