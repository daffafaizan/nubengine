      fluoroscopic time (i.e. radiation exposure) is poorly understood. Both snare and forcep
      techniques have independently evaluated in literature but have never been compared directly.
      The proposed study would prospectively assess whether one of these established technique
      offers an advantage with respect to either of these variables.
