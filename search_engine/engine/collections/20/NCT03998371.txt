      numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a
      substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and
      polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment
      resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors
      exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor
      stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity
      of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially non-invasive way to detect CIN in the urothelial
      cells from the urine sample for diagnosing and monitoring bladder cancer patients. UCAD is a
      new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from
      urine, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by
      bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of bladder cancer patients.

      The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing urine samples from
      bladder cancer patients and control groups that without any tumor in the urinary system or
      other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of UCAD test for diagnosing
      urothelial carcinoma to other modalities, such as urine cytology or fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH).
