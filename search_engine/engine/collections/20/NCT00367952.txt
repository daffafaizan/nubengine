      3TC in HIV patients who are failing therapy containing 3TC and have the presence of the M184V
      mutation in reverse transcriptase. This extension study (AVX-201E) is available to patients
      who complete the AVX-201 protocol.

      Patients will continue to receive apricitabine open label for a further 96 weeks (making a
      total of 144 weeks from starting AVX-201) in addition to an optimised background. Safety
      markers and efficacy markers will be followed.
