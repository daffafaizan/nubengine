    
      This study involves the use of an investigational combination of drugs. "Oxycodone with
      Risperidone" and "Oxycodone with Ziprasidone" are called "Investigational" because the U.S.
      Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these drug combinations for the purpose of
      this study. Individually, each of these drugs is approved by the FDA for other reasons (i.e.
      oxycodone as a painkiller, while risperidone and ziprasidone are approved as anti-psychotic
      medications), but the administration of these drugs together has not been studied before or
      been approved by the FDA for this purpose.

      This is the first study involving humans to examine the safety of this combination of drugs
      and how they work together. The goal of the study is to find out what effects, good and/or
      bad, it has on people who take them. Because the combination has not been studied in humans
      before, information about the safety and effectiveness is incomplete and all of the side
      effects are not yet known.
