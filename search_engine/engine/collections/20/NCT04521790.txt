    
      This study, previously designed as a single-center experience, is multicenter, observational
      and both retrospective and prospective.

      Retrospective phase includes all clinical data occurring before the index event
      (hospitalization or clinically suspected myocarditis) and myocarditis diagnosis. Prospective
      phase includes all data following index event and myocarditis diagnosis.

      This study has multiple aims.

        1. To compare EMB with noninvasive diagnostic techniques (CMR, DECT, PET scan, either alone
           or in association).

        2. To assess the role of blood biomarkers for identification of aetiology, predisposition,
           prognosis, response to treatment, inflammatory activity, clinical presentation.

        3. To describe myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias, with special focus on ventricular
           arrhythmias at different myocarditis stages and in different clinical contexts. To
           validate and generalize the leader hospital model for optimal diagnostic and
           therapeutical management of arrhythmias in myocarditis patients (given the role of the
           leader hospital as an international referral center for arrhythmias ablation and
           management).

        4. To evaluate the timing needed for myocarditis healing in different patients subgroups,
           as assessed by noninvasive imaging techniques (CMR, DECT, PET scan), either alone or in
           association.

        5. To compare patients subgroups of myocarditis, in terms of epidemiology, aetiology,
           prognosis, and diagnostic-therapeutical strategies. Among the others, the main study
           subgroups will be:

      A. Arrhythmic vs. non-arrhythmic myocarditis. B. Arrhythmic myocarditis subgroups. C.
      Non-arrhythmic myocarditis subgroups (i.e.: fulminant, acute coronary syndrome-like,
      pericarditis-like, heart failure, nonischaemic dilated /hypokinetic cardiomyopathies of
      unknown aetiologyâ€¦).

      D. Infectious vs. autoimmune vs. toxic myocarditis. E. Myocarditis treated by aetiology-based
      treatment vs. isolated cardiac medical treatment.

      F. Myocarditis at different disease stages: acute, hyperacute, fulminant, chronic active,
      post-inflammatory, or active vs. previous vs. non-myocarditis.

      G. Myocarditis presenting as organ-specific diseases vs. in the context of a genetic disorder
      or systemic disease.

      H. Myocarditis vs. peri-myocarditis/myo-pericarditis. I. Other analyses.

      Any adult patient with clinically suspected myocarditis, of any clinical presentation and any
      degree of severity, will be considered as suitable for study enrollment.

      Patients will undergo diagnostic and therapeutical strategies considered as clinically
      indicated in a patient-tailored manner, as suggested by international guidelines
      recommendations and best local clinical practice. Patients will be free of either accepting
      or refusing any diagnostic or therapeutical proposal. Whenever accepted, data will be simply
      collected and analyzed.

      Based on clinical presentation, patients will be divided into two groups, arrhythmic (group
      A) and non-arrhythmic (group NA, including any other clinical presentation).

      Independently of A/NA groups, all patients will undergo optimal diagnostic and therapeutic
      strategies, as summarized in panel A. In parallel, special diagnostic and therapeutical
      strategies will be performed in patients with arrhythmic presentation or evidence of
      arrhythmias, as shown in panel B. Proposed flowcharts (Panels A and B) represent only an
      approximate algorithm. Exceptions can be made in single cases, based on clinical indications.

      Panel A - Diagnostic and therapeutical workup in all patients. Independently of groups
      (A/NA), all patients will undergo optimal diagnostic and therapeutical workup, guided by
      updated scientific evidence merged with the clinical experience of the center.

      Baseline diagnostic workup will include: complete blood exams, 12-leads ECG, continuous
      telemetric monitoring, transthoracic doppler echocardiogram, coronary artery imaging
      (coronary angiography or CT scan). Any other clinically relevant diagnostic test will be
      collected.

      In life-threatening presentations (cardiogenic shock or malignant arrhythmias), support
      treatment by optimal medical therapy, inotropic or mechanical circulatory support, and
      acute-phase arrhythmia management (including cardioversion, defibrillation, or temporary
      pacing) will be performed, as indicated, before completing diagnostic workup.

      Final diagnosis of myocarditis will include, whenever applicable:

      A. For stable patients: 1) a second-level imaging technique (CMR as first choice; and/or
      DECT, PET, or multiple/fusion imaging techniques, based on clinical indications); followed
      by: 2) EMB, whenever clinically indicated. Blood exams for aetiology screening will be
      personalized upon clinical indications.

      B. For unstable patients: EMB only, as recommended. Blood exams for aetiology screening will
      be personalized upon clinical indications.

      Diagnostic criteria for myocarditis, as assessed by any diagnostic technique, will be defined
      based on international scientific evidence and will be constantly updated. Similar
      considerations apply to myocarditis staging and aetiology definition. Whenever not available
      at local institutions, diagnostic exams can be performed and analyzed at external centers.

      All patients with myocarditis (or any alternative final diagnosis), will undergo standard
      cardiological optimal medical treatment (COMT), as indicated. By converse,
      aetiology-dependent treatment will be performed only in patients with a final diagnosis of
      any active (acute, fulminant, chronic active) myocarditis of defined aetiology (EMB-proved).
      Multidisciplinary assessment, including infective disease specialists (in viral/infective
      myocarditis), immunologists (in non-infective/autoimmune myocarditis) or any other specialist
      as needed, will be used to identify indications to treatment, drug choice (either approved or
      with a justified unapproved indication), treatment duration and safety profile, aiming at the
      best patients' interest. Toxic myocarditis will be treated accordingly, by evaluating the
      opportunity of withdrawing pathogenic noxa.

      This protocol will not interfere with local best clinical practice. Patients with non-active
      myocarditis (previous or healed) or with non-myocarditis, will undergo "standard FU" (see
      below). Patients with active myocarditis will undergo "intensive FU" (see below).

      Independently of FU modalities, diagnostic reassessment will be considered in the presence of
      at least one of the following instability criteria: a) new unexplained cardiac symptoms
      (dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope, palpitation); b) new unexplained increase in troponin or
      natriuretic peptides; c) new imaging abnormal signs; d) new unexplained clinically relevant
      arrhythmias. Diagnostic reassessment will include second-level imaging and/or EMB, as shown
      above. Subsequent therapeutical workup will be in line with the above explanations. In stable
      patients or undergone myocarditis healing, exercise stress test will be obtained, whenever
      possible.

      Panel B - Diagnostic and therapeutical workup of patients with arrhythmias In parallel with
      (and independently of) Panel A content, patients with arrhythmias (group A) will undergo
      specific diagnostic and therapeutical management for arrhythmias, as a result of the
      integration between international guidelines recommendations and the experience of an
      international referral center for arrhythmia management and ablation.

      To oversimplify, 4 groups of patients will be considered.

        1. Group 1: major ventricular arrhythmias, including haemodynamically unstable VT (hu-VT)
           and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

           After electrical stabilization and support treatment (panel A), indication to secondary
           prevention ICD implant will be multiparametric and patient-tailored. In patients with
           active myocarditis, subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) or wearable CD (WCD) will be considered.
           Antiarrhythmic drugs will be considered in all Group 1 patients. In addition, all Group
           1 patients will undergo COMT and aetiology-dependent treatment whenever applicable
           (panel A). Ablation of ventricular arrhythmias will be considered in patients with
           severe arrhythmic presentation, or symptomatic, or refractory to optimal medical
           treatment. Electrophysiological study (EPS) may be used in selected cases. A cardiac
           resynchronization therapy with defibrillator function (CRT-D) will replace ICD whenever
           indicated.

        2. Group 2: other ventricular arrhythmias, including high-burden (hb) premature ventricular
           complexes (PVC); nonsustained VT (NSVT); haemodynamically stable VT (hs-VT).

           Whenever clinically indicated, Group 2 patients will undergo invasive EPS (or in
           alternative noninvasive programmed ventricular stimulation in ICD carriers) to stratify
           arrhythmic risk. Patients with positive EPS will undergo ICD (or S-ICD/WCD) as in Group
           1. Patients with negative EPS, as well as Group 2 cases not undergoing EPS, will undergo
           watchful waiting strategy (always with an intensive FU) with or without loop recorder
           implant: in these cases, ICD (or S-ICD/WCD) will be implanted only following
           documentation of relevant VA in FU. In addition, all Group 2 patients will undergo
           antiarrhythmic treatment, COMT and aetiology-dependent treatment whenever applicable
           (panel A). In symptomatic or drug-refractory cases, ablation of ventricular arrhythmias
           will be considered. A CRT-D will replace ICD whenever indicated.

        3. Group 3: bradyarrhythmias, including advanced (2nd type II or 3rd degree)
           atrioventricular block (AVB); critical sinus pauses from sinus node disease (SND).

           After electrical stabilization and support treatment (panel A), including the use of
           temporary pacemaker as a bridge-to-decision, patients will undergo watchful waiting
           strategy or definitive device implant. Instead of a pacemaker (PM), ICD will be
           considered in the presence of high-risk criteria for ventricular tachyarrhythmias,
           including: a) overlap with Group 1 presentation; b) overlap with Group 2 presentation,
           especially in the presence of positive EPS; c) other indications for primary prevention
           ICD implant (severe systolic dysfunction); d) signs of increased tachyarrhythmic risk
           (scar signs); e) patients with special aetiologies leading to an increased
           tachyarrhythmic risk (i.e: cardiac sarcoid, giant cell myocarditis, Chagas disease,
           overlapping genetic syndromes). In addition, all Group 3 patients will undergo COMT and
           aetiology-dependent treatment whenever applicable (panel A). A CRT-D or a CRT-P will
           replace ICD or PM, respectively, whenever indicated.

        4. Group 4: supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF); atrial
           flutter (AFlu); atrial tachycardia (AT).

           Following acute-phase rate control (RaC), stable rhythm control (RyC) strategy will be
           considered as the therapeutical target, together with appropriate anticoagulation, as
           needed. Normal sinus rhythm will be obtained through either electrical or
           pharmacological cardioversion. In patients with unsuccessful attempts of sinus rhythm
           conversion, optimal treatment of active myocarditis will be considered as a primary
           target. Following myocarditis healing, in the presence of persistent arrhythmias,
           patients will be considered for RyC via electrical or pharmacological cardioversion.
           Transcatheter ablation will be an option for patients with drug-symptomatic, recurrent
           or refractory arrhythmias. Permanent RaC strategy will be considered only in non
           responders. Widespread use of implantable loop recorders will apply, as clinically
           indicated. In addition, all Group 4 patients will undergo COMT and aetiology-dependent
           treatment whenever applicable (panel A).
