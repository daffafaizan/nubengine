    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose of MLN9708 (ixazomib) in combination with mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride, etoposide, intermediate-dose cytarabine (MEC) in patients with relapsed/
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the non-dose limiting toxicities associated with MLN9708 in combination with
      MEC in patients with relapsed/ refractory AML.

      II. To describe any preliminary evidence of clinical activity of this combination (compete
      response [CR] rate) in relapsed/ refractory AML.

      III. To determine the median cluster of differentiation (CD)74 antigen expression in patients
      achieving a response versus those patients not achieving a response.

      IV. To determine if gene expression profile pre- and post-treatment correlates with response
      to therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ixazomib.

      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV), etoposide IV over 1 hour, and intermediate-dose cytarabine IV over 6
      hours on days 1-6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-5 weeks.
