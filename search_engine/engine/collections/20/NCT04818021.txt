      related to repeated pairing of somatosensory and auditory inputs (as would occur during
      speech motor learning). Before and after the training, base-line and post-training auditory
      perceptual performance will be examined in the absence of somatosensory stimulation, in order
      to evaluate the effects of the pairing on speech perception. Perceptual classification and
      speech motor learning will both be assessed on a 0 to 100 scale.
