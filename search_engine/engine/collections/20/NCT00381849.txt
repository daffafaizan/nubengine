      Subjects must have a measurable stone by CT. The first phase is a double blind, randomized,
      placebo controlled cross-over of Cystone and placebo for 6 weeks each separated by a 1 week
      washout. Entry, 6 and 12 week 24 hour urine supersaturations or cystine, pH and sodium
      determinations will be collected. Then all patients enter an open label phase of 46 weeks,
      ensuring a 52-week total exposure to Cystone during the 59 week study. Baseline and 1 year
      stone quantification CT scans will be performed. End points will be changes in urine
      chemistry/supersaturation and stone burden. Stone burden was measured by CT, quantitatively
      for stone density and volume. All CT images were also reviewed in a blinded fashion by a
      radiologist to score each kidney as increased, no change or decreased stone burden.

      Statistics and Randomization: Randomization was accomplished using a table provided by the
      department of statistics to the study coordinator who was blinded as to whether the patients
      received placebo or CystoneÂ®. Biochemical and supersaturation results were analyzed via a
      matched pair analysis using the JMP software package (SAS Instituted, Inc.); P values < 0.05
      were deemed significant.
