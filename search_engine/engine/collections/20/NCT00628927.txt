      Stroop color-word interference task is predictive of treatment completion in participants
      with cocaine use disorders and to extend this finding to participants with Methamphetamine
      use disorders. Secondary objectives include evaluating whether:

        1. performance on various neurocognitive measures, including the Stroop, Rey
           Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Iowa Gambling Task (GT), Wisconsin Card Sorting
           Task (WCST), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version -11 (BIS-11), and the Frontal
           Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) is predictive of treatment attrition and stimulant use
           outcomes in METH/cocaine abusers;

        2. neurocognitive test performance is associated with oxidative damage, a severe
           consequence of oxidative stress, in METH/cocaine abusers;

        3. oxidative damage is predictive of treatment attrition and substance use outcomes in
           METH/cocaine abusers,

        4. oxidative damage in METH/cocaine abusers is significantly greater than that of a normal
           comparison group and

        5. exploratory analyses reveal a significant relationship among oxidative stress,
           neurocognitive function, and treatment outcomes in METH/cocaine abusers.
