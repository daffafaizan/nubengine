    
      This is a Phase IV, multi-center, double-blinded, placebo control randomized study to
      evaluate the therapeutic effect of telbivudine with or without prednisolone priming in
      patients with chronic hepatitis B.

      Patients are allocated to either group A or B randomly.

      Group A: Patients initially receive a 4-week course of oral prednisolone (30 mg daily for 3
      weeks and then 15 mg daily of 1 week). After a rest period of no treatment for 2 weeks, the
      patients receive telbivudine therapy at a daily dose of 600 mg for 2 years. Patients will be
      asked to come back to clinic for follow-up 6 months after telbivudine treatment.

      Group B: Patients receive a 4-week course of placebo. After a rest period of no treatment for
      2 weeks, the patients receive telbivudine therapy at a daily dose of 600 mg for 2 years.
      Patients will be asked to come back to clinic for follow-up 6 months after telbivudine
      treatment.

      Eligible patients will be randomized prior to the first dose of study medication. The visit
      at which the patient receives the first dose will be defined as the study Baseline. Patients
      will return to the clinic at 3, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 30, 44, 58, 72, 86, 98, 110, 116, 122, 128
      and 134 weeks post-Baseline. At each of these visits, routine clinical laboratory tests,
      adverse event inquiry, and other clinical assessments will be performed. Serum samples for
      HBV DNA analysis will be obtained at 4, 6, 30, 58, 86, 110 and 134 weeks. Serum samples for
      HBV sequencing will be obtained at Screening and Week 110 (or upon early termination from the
      study).

      Complete physical examinations will be performed at each study visits to evaluate any adverse
      signs or symptoms reported by the patient.

      Serum for HBeAg, antibody to HBeAg (HBeAb), HBsAg, and antibody to HBsAg (HBsAb) will be
      obtained at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 6, 30, 58, 86, 110 and 134(or upon early
      termination from the study), and at all protocol-required follow-up visits.

      Patients will be followed monthly for 6 months after discontinuation of study drug(s).
