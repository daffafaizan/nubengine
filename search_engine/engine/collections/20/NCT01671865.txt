      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will be used to evaluate skeletal muscle in study
      participants. This research is being done to assess how changes in muscle imaging correspond
      to muscle strength and function. Qualified participants will be asked to complete 5 study
      visits over 21 months. Each visit will include muscle strength and function testing in
      addition to the MRI/MRS scan. The investigators plan to use MRI and MRS in developing outcome
      measures that can be used in future clinical trials for FSHD.
