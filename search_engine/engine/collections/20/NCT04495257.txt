      combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The study will enroll patients with advanced solid
      tumors (melanoma, RCC) to determine the recommended phase II dosing (RP2D) of APX005M in
      combination with ipilimumab 1mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg (IPI1 NIVO3) every 3 weeks for four
      cycles followed by APX005M in combination with nivolumab 360mg every 3 weeks. APX005M will be
      administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg every 3 weeks in Dose Level 1 (DL1) and escalated to 0.3
      mg/kg every 3 weeks in Dose Level 2 (DL2) (Table 1). The IPI1 NIVO3 regimen is approved for
      patients with metastatic RCC.

      APX005M is a humanized IgG1 agonistic monoclonal antibody that binds CD40. Nivolumab is a
      humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1. Ipilimumab is a humanized IgG1κ
      monoclonal antibody directed against CTLA-4.

      Primary Objective

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of APX005M in combination with nivolumab and
           ipilimumab

        -  To determine the recommended RP2D of APX005M in combination with nivolumab and
           ipilimumab in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary Objective

      • Determine rate and pattern of AEs in patients treated with APX005M in combination with
      nivolumab and ipilimumab
