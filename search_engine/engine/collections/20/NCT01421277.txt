      must have been received by the participant within a time window of 3 months (Â± 2 weeks) prior
      to the participant being identified by the Investigator, and could be enrolled into the study
      within 6 months of taking the prescribed triptan medication for the first time and that use
      of a sample triptan would not disqualify a participant as long as the sample was of the same
      triptan that was eventually prescribed.
