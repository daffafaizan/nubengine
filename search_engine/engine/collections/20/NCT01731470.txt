      exploring a "control" compound when measuring the efficacy of liposomally encapsulated
      capsaicin for the intravesical treatment of interstitial cystitis. Liposomes are lipid
      vesicles composed of concentric phospholipid bilayers, which enclose an aqueous interior.
      Liposomes have the ability to form a molecular film on cell and tissue surfaces and are
      currently being tested as possible therapeutic agents to promote wound healing. Application
      of liposomes at the wound surface provides a moist protective film over the wound and
      augments wound healing without chronic inflammatory reactions in the neodermal layer.
