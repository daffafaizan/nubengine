      total of 20 resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients
      will be enrolled. Patients will be diagnosed according to morphologic, immunologic,
      cytogenetic and molecular(MICM) criteria, including bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype,
      cytogenetic and molecular examination. CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector
      to express anti-CD19 scFv TCRÎ¶:4-1BB,administered by i.v. injection as a using a "split dose"
      (total dose of 5x10^6/kg-5x10^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on
      day 2. This protocol will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs for which there are
      no effective therapies known at this time. Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be
      monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.
