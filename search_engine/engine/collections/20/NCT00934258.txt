      blinded end-point classification trial to test the hypothesis in Taiwan that the addition of
      fibrate on statin would provide a further reduction in the major coronary events in the
      patients with diabetes or atherosclerotic vascular diseases with metabolic syndrome. With the
      advantage of this large-scaled prospective trial, it is also a good opportunity to identify
      simultaneously the genetic determinants of wide range of interindividual variability in
      phenotypic and clinical response to two major lipid-lowering drug classes, rosuvastatin and
      fenofibrate. The aim of this proposal is to find which SNPs influence the therapeutic
      effectiveness of lipid lowering therapy in Taiwanese hyperlipidemic patients. A key feature
      is the use of multiple drug-treated population samples to get the findings derived from both
      candidate gene and genome-wide searches for SNP associations with markers of drug efficacy as
      well as side effects. Thus the promise of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics-- "individualized
      medicine" will come true in treating hyperlipidemia in Taiwanese.
