      COPD symptoms, leading them to require treatment with either antibiotics or oral steroids and
      severely affecting their quality of life. SNG001 is the study medication, and it contains
      interferon beta (interferon-Î²) which is a natural antiviral protein. In this study we will
      look to see whether inhaled SNG001 can boost anti-viral responses and minimise the worsening
      of COPD symptoms/lung function when patients have a confirmed respiratory virus.

      In Part 1 ten COPD patients without a respiratory virus will be randomised to receive three
      days of SNG001 or placebo. The aim of this part of the study is to assess safety of SNG001 in
      COPD patients.

      In Part 2 COPD patients will contact the research team when they experience cold or flu
      symptoms or a deterioration of their COPD symptoms. At this point, eligible patients will
      undergo a virus detection test and those that test positive for a virus will be randomised
      1:1 to receive SNG001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The first dose of study medication
      will be administered within 48 hours. Other assessments will be performed during the 14 days
      of treatment to look for changes in anti-viral biomarkers, lung function and COPD symptoms.
      Patients will also be followed up 14 days post end of treatment.
