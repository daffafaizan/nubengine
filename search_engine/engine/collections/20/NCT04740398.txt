      dose-escalation study that will focus on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, MTD and
      RP2D. Patients with advanced solid tumor who failed from previous standard treatment or
      without standard therapy exists will be enrolled in the phase Ia study. DLT observation
      period is 28 days.

      Patients in phase Ib part will be recruited into certain tumor cohorts and receive RP2D
      CBP-1008 iv infusion every two weeks. Primary efficacy of ORR, DCR, PFS, etc., will be
      evaluated. The correlation between tumor response and the receptors will be explored. Safety
