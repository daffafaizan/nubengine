      patients. However, organ rejection remains as an important threat to the long-term survival
      of the transplanted organ. If clinicians could better monitor the condition of the organ
      after transplantation, they may be able to improve the chance of graft survival. Noninvasive
      ways to monitor the condition of the transplanted organ need to be developed and tested. This
      observational study will investigate whether certain blood and urine tests are useful in
      monitoring the health of transplanted kidneys.

      This trial will involve 14 post-transplant study visits over the course of 2 years. A
      physical exam, medication history, adverse events assessment, and blood and urine collection
      will occur at all visits. Kidney biopsies will occur at study entry prior to transplantation
      and at Month 6, in adult participants only. Protocol biopsies are optional in the pediatric
      substudy group. Additional visits may be required if organ rejection is suspected.
