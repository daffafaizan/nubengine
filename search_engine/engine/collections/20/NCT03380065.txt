      studied. It can be done either via the radial artery approach or the femoral artery approach.
      Currently most centers use the radial artery approach due to the lower risk of access site
      bleeding as compared to the femoral artery approach. In addition, the radial approach allows
      earlier patient mobilisation after the procedure.

      Once the sheath, through which the procedure is done, is removed, a special air filled band
      is used to compress the artery to prevent bleeding. This involves filling the band with
      around 18 ml of air and then releasing the air at periodic intervals. There are however no
      set protocols for the removal of air and literature often suggests varying protocols. However
      what the protocols try to achieve is proper hemostasis, with low incidence of radial artery
      occlusion. In addition to these, patient comfort and safety along with staff ease of use is
      important. Some protocols involve frequent deflations which might be more tedious for the
      nurses, but more comfortable for patients whilst others might be easier for the staff (due to
      longer intervals), but more uncomfortable for the patients. However, there are no studies
      that actually compare these protocols
