    
      Dichlorobisphenol A (Cl2BPA)is formed by the reaction of chlorine with bisphenol A present in
      water during water disinfection process. As a consequence, Cl2BPA is present in various
      aqueous media including tap water. Cl2BPA has also been found in human, in blood, urine,
      breast milk and adipose tissue suggesting chronic exposure to this compound. Cl2BPA is an
      endocrine disruptor that binds to estrogenic and PPAR-γ receptors. Epidemiological studies
      have shown that exposure to DCBPA has been related to the occurrence of diabetes, obesity and
      myocardial infarction.

      Currently, no toxicokinetic data are available to estimate the disposition (ADME) of Cl2BPA
      after oral and dermal exposure in human while these data are needed for proper risk
      assessment of this compound.

      The objective of this study is to determine toxicokinetic parameters of deuterated d12-Cl2BPA
      after the administration of a single low dose (50 µg/kg) to healthy volunteers via oral or
      dermal routes.
