      double blind crossover placebo-controlled trial.

        1. If mild anaemia, patients are randomized to 300 mg of ferrous fumarate or placebo for 4
           weeks followed by 2 weeks of washout period after which patients will crossover the
           opposite treatments for another 4 weeks.

        2. If moderate anaemia, patients will receive 600 mg of ferrous fumarate for 10 weeks. They
           are randomized to either vitamin E (800 IU) or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks
           of washout period after which patients will crossover the opposite treatments for
           another 4 weeks
