      I. To determine the feasibility of pharmacologic beta-adrenergic blockade in women with
      stages II-IV epithelial ovarian cancer patients (n=25) either during initial tumor reductive
      surgery and through the first six cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy or during
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and further chemotherapy (chemo) up to a total
      of 6 cycles.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the biobehavioral states of these patients by using the Functional
      Assessment of Chronic Illness and Therapy- Ovary (FACT-O), Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Survey (HADS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and serum
      levels of angiogenic cytokines at points pre- and post-treatment with beta-blockers.

      II. To follow patients for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determining vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and other
      cytokines levels in patients with ovarian cancer who are receiving beta-blockers and
      comparing these levels pre-treatment and during treatment with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning 48-72
      hours before treatment. Patients undergoing surgery resume propranolol hydrochloride
      post-operatively once oral drugs are tolerated and continue until completion of 6 cycles of
      chemotherapy. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy continue propranolol hydrochloride
      PO BID during 3 chemotherapy cycles pre-surgery and 3 cycles post-surgery. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
