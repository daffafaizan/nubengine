    
      This is a Phase II study of perifosine in patients with refractory and relapsed leukemia.
      After a one time loading dose of 600 mg (150 mg x 4 at least 4 hours apart) during the first
      cycle, perifosine will be given orally at 100 mg once a day continuously. Cycles are 28 days
      in length. Intra-patient dose escalation for the maintenance dose to 150 mg daily will be
      done in the second cycle if no non-hematological toxicities beyond grade 0-1 occurred during
      the first cycle are observed.

      Patients will be assessed for efficacy at the end of each 28 day cycle of therapy, +/- 7
      days. Complete remissions, partial remissions and hematological improvements of any kind will
      be counted towards an objective response for all diseases.

      A maximum total of 74 patients will be enrolled on the study, all of them assigned to the
      same experimental treatment scheme (arm) described above.

      A maximum total of 37 evaluable patients will be entered in each of two diagnostic groups,
      which are being distinguished due to different anticipated rates of accrual. Group 1: AML,
      MDS, CML-BP non-lymphoid, CMML, Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM); Group 2: CLL, ALL, CML-BP
      lymphoid.
