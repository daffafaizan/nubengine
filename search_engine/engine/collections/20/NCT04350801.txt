      neuropsychological tests battery, brain MRI, and routine blood labs including thyroid
      function tests, vitamine B12 & folate levels, and syphilis screening to rule out other
      secondary causes of dementia. We undergo peripheral blood-based amyloid beta levels and
      regular home-based cognitive monitoring (every 3 months) to investigate whether
      amyloid-positive MCIs progress rapidly using home-based cognitive monitoring during 6 months.
