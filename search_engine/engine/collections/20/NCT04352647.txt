      answered, to carry out an analytical, transversal and observational study. All the
      participants are women, of age, federated in athletics and belonging to Castilla y Le√≥n.

      UI has a high prevalence (44.4%) in female athletes, being more common in those who practice
      long-distance races. As age and years of sport increase, the incidence of this pathology
      increases. Absorbent pads are used by more than half of the incontinent women, while the rest
      wet their underwear. Menopause, childbirth and surgery in the region are risk factors for
      UTIs, while the presence of urinary tract infections or candidiasis are not. The results
      affirm that urine leaks do not cause anxiety or depression, but they do affect your sporting
      life.
