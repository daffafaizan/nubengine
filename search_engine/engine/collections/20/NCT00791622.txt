    
      This multicenter, placebo- and positive-controlled, randomized study consists of 3 phases - a
      screening phase of up to 5 days, a 6-day placebo washout phase, and a treatment phase that
      includes 1-day of open-label moxifloxacin treatment (Day 1), 10 days of double-blind
      treatment (Days 2 to 11), and end of study evaluations (Day 12). On Day 1, all patients will
      receive open-label treatment with a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin administered in the
      morning. Moxifloxacin will be used to establish assay sensitivity on the QTc interval.
      Patients will then be randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with placebo,
      paliperidone ER, or quetiapine on Days 2 to 11. Two doses of paliperidone ER will be studied:
      12 mg/day that is the maximum recommended dose and 18 mg/day that is a supratherapeutic dose
      (50% above the maximum recommended). Patients randomly assigned to paliperidone ER will be
      administered 12 mg on Days 2 to 6, 15 mg on Day 7, and 18 mg on Days 8 to 11. Patients
      randomly assigned to quetiapine will receive 100 mg bid on Day 2, 200 mg twice daily (bid) on
      Day 3, 300 mg bid on Day 4, and 400 mg bid on Days 5 to 11. Patients will receive
      double-blind study drug 30 minutes after having a standardized breakfast on Days 2 to 11.
      Serial time matched 12 lead ECG triplicate readings will be recorded on Days -2, -1, 6, and
      11 (predose and 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 6, and 12 hours postdose) as well as Day 1 (predose,
      1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 hours postdose) and Days 7 and 12 (23.5 hours postdose). This study will
      explore the QTc and pharmacokinetic data from paliperidone ER (commercial formulation) and
      quetiapine (marketed atypical antipsychotic of the same therapeutic class) at the maximum
      recommended doses for both products and at a supratherapeutic dose (50% above the maximum
      proposed labeled dose) for paliperidone ER. Safety and tolerability will be monitored
      throughout the study.

      A single oral dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg tablet on Day 1; Oral paliperidone ER 12 mg on Days
      2 to 6; 15 mg on Day 7, and 18 mg on Days 8 to 11; Oral quetiapine 100 mg twice daily (bid)
      on Day 2; 200 mg bid on Day 3; 300 mg bid on Day 4; and 400 mg bid on Days 5 to 11.
