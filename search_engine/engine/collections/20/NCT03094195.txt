      double-blind treatment study consisting of 3 periods i.e. Screening, Treatment, and Treatment
      withdrawal. The study was planned in two cohorts. The initial cohort had three treatment arms
      i.e. Placebo b.i.d., EMA401 25 mg b.i.d., or EMA401 100 mg b.i.d. Following an unblinded
      safety review by an independent DMC, the second cohort was to have been initiated with an
      additional treatment arm i.e. EMA401 300 mg b.i.d.. Due to the premature study termination,
      the second cohort was not initiated. At the end of treatment period the 25mg BID and 100mg
      BID arms were re-randomized (1:1) to the same treatment or placebo. Placebo arm stayed on
      placebo. The planned duration of treatment period was 12 weeks and 1 week of treatment
      withdrawal at the end of treatment period. The study was terminated early due to pre-clinical
      toxicity data that became available after start of trial. Novartis implemented a Urgent
      Safety Measure (USM) which instructed sites to discontinue study treatment immediately and to
      have all patients return for additional laboratory assessments (full hematology including
      coagulation and clinical chemistry panel). Safety data from the USM was presented as a
      separate outcome measure table and not included in the Adverse Event section.
