    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Mindfulness Ambassador Council (MAC), a
      12-week facilitated group mindfulness based intervention specifically designed to promote
      mindfulness skills and the development of emotional and social competencies in youth, is an
      effective, feasible, and acceptable means of treating people in the early stages of psychotic
      illnesses.

      We intend to randomly assign 30 patients being treated for psychotic illnesses in an early
      intervention program to an immediate treatment intervention or a delayed treatment
      intervention. Participants assigned to the immediate treatment intervention will receive the
      MAC intervention at the onset of the study whereas those assigned to the delay treatment
      intervention will receive the MAC intervention after approximately 3 months in a treatment as
      usual control group.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at 3-month
      post-intervention on a number measures. MAC acceptability will be assessed through the Client
      Satisfaction Questionnaire and qualitative interviews, MAC feasibility will be assessed
      through recruitment, consent and completion rates, and MAC efficacy will be assessed with a
      number of clinical, social, cognitive, and mindfulness skill assessment tools as well as
      through changes in healthcare utilization before and after administration of the MAC
      intervention.

      Although the current study is hypothesis generating in nature, based on previous findings of
      Mindfulness Based Interventions for psychoses, we are expecting that participation in the MAC
      intervention will result in improvements on clinical, cognitive, functional, and health
      service utilization parameters. Additionally, we expect that the MAC intervention will be
      acceptable to participants and a feasible intervention for early psychotic disorders.
