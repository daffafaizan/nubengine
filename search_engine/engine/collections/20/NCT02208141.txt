      the development of obesity and related comorbidities and to characterize factors that play a
      role in the development of adipose dysfunction in children. The investigators will employ a
      translational approach which is based on the characterization of adipose tissue biology in
      samples of children to determine alterations leading to adipose tissue dysfunction. These
      include assessment of the composition (including BAT), remodeling, function, metabolism and
      inflammation of adipose tissue as well as the adipokine profile. For the assessment of
      clinical relevance, these experimental data will then be correlated with the clinical
      phenotype. Finally, we aim to identify factors responsible for early adipose tissue
      dysfunction and characterize them for their clinical and functional relevance.
