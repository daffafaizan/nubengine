    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of individualized
      training support for multiple myeloma patient populations divided into high and low risk
      according to their fall and fracture risk. The primary hypothesis is that multiple myeloma
      patients who meet the criteria for a high risk of falling and / or fracture can achieve
      equivalent adherence rates and training effects through individually compiled individual
      training, such as multiple myeloma patients with low risk of falling who conduct group
      training.

      The adherence rates are recorded via attendance lists for training and video conferences as
      well as a training diary for independent training. To record the training effects, physical
      performance and functionality are measured and the quality of life, sexuality, depression,
      fatigue, sleep quality, work ability and risk of falling are assessed using standardized,
      validated questionnaires.
