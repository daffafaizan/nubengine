      as oxidation or alternative regulation of signaling pathways by post-translational
      modification of proteins (e.g., phosphorylation). Delivery of oxygen in high concentrations
      to the lungs can result in damage, which is mediated in large part by reactive oxygen
      species. Inflammation can result in activation of intracellular signaling pathways. This
      study will evaluate modification of proteins and nucleic acids in bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid, bronchial epithelial cells, and peripheral blood of individuals exposed to oxygen or
      who are smokers. In doing so, it will determine the effects of hyperoxia or inflammation on
      the lung.
