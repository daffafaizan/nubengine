      number of studies have suggestted that there may be improper use or even abuse in recent
      years. Long-term use of BDZ may have the risk of impairing memory, respiratory depression,
      and increasing accidents risk. At present, there is no risk investigation on psychiatric BDZ
      abuse in China, and many psychiatric practitioners lack of knowledge on the standard use of
      BDZ. The aim of this study was to understand the use of benzodiazepines in psychiatric
      outpatient clinics in China and to develop a BDZ standardized use electronic intervention
      guidebook and to verify the effectiveness of this electronic intervention in reducing the use
      of BDZ in psychiatric outpatient clinics and improving clinical efficiency. Through
      retrospective surveys and focus interview groups, the study was conducted to understand the
      use of BDZ and related factors of abuse in psychiatric outpatient clinics in Shanghai, Hunan,
      Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces. Based on the consensus and guidelines of domestic experts, BDZ
      standardized electronic intervention was used. The real-world randomized controlled research
      method was combined with electronic content push and periodic electronic evaluation to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the use rate of psychiatric BDZ
      and improving clinical efficiency. The research can deeply understand the use of BDZ in
      domestic psychiatry and form an effective BDZ standardized electronic intervention manual,
      which will provide practical value for regulating domestic BDZ in the future.
