    
      Aim 1: To determine if RT impacts neuronal function associated with food intake behavior in a
      manner favoring reduced EI in overweight/obese adults.

      Hypothesis: Compared to pre, post-RT fMRI measures will demonstrate ↓ neuronal responses to
      food cues in the insula, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, brain regions implicated in
      reward, impulsivity, motivation, and regulation of ingestive behaviors. These changes will be
      associated with ad libitum EI.

      Aim 2: To determine if RT impacts appetite-related peptides, ratings, and food intake
      behaviors in a manner favoring reduced EI in overweight/obese adults.

      Hypothesis: Compared to pre, post-RT measures will show changes in appetite-related peptides,
      ratings (↓ hunger ↑ satiety), and behaviors (↓food-related cravings & impulsivity, ↑
      self-efficacy) consistent with EI reduction. Changes in appetite regulation indices will be
      associated with changes in relevant brain networks (Aim 1). These changes will also be
      associated with ↓ ad libitum EI.

      Exploratory Aim: To determine if RT impacts neuronal function and appetite-related peptides
      and behaviors in a manner favoring ↓ EI in Non-Compensators (top tertile of fat mass loss) as
      compared to Compensators (bottom tertile of fat mass loss).

      Hypothesis: Compared to Compensators, Non-Compensators will show ↓ neuronal responses to food
      cues and default network, and changes in appetite-related peptides, ratings, and behaviors
      consistent with ↓ EI.
