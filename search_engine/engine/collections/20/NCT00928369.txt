      In this age group, the causes of gynecologic surgery were usually divided into three parts,
      congenital anomalies, genital traumas, and pathologic lesions of genital tract including
      uterine bady and cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva. Among these, adnexal
      masses generally have been the most common cause of gynecologic surgery in the pediatric and
      adolescent patients. Adnexal lesions span a spectrum of pathology from functional
      (non-neoplastic), benign to highly aggressive malignant neoplasms. The actual incidence of
      adnexal lesions in the young women is unknown; however, of the ovarian neoplasms operated on
      during childhood or adolescence, 10-30% are malignant. Therefore, early detection and
      adequate management of adnexal lesions are prerequisite for the life saving and future
      preservation of fertility potential. But until now, there have been limited studies regarding
      the clinical characteristics of patients with adnexal mass during this period, and most
      studies have been conducted with small numbers of patients. Therefore, more informations
      regarding the clinical characteristics of patients with adnexal lesions are very important
      for the early diagnosis and adequate management of the adnexal lesions in children and
      adolescents.

      In this study, we reviewed the clinical characteristics of 494 young Korean patients who took
      the operation in university hospital with adnexal lesions over the past 14 years.
