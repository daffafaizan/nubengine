    
      This study was designed as a randomized, open-label, single-center, crossover study to
      evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of extended-release (ER) OROS
      paliperidone in healthy Japanese adults. Of the 20 Japanese volunteers who are to be
      enrolled, at least 6 are to be men and 6 are to be women. All volunteers will receive single
      doses of 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone with and without a standard Japanese breakfast. There will
      be a 1-week washout between treatments, for a total treatment duration of approximately 2
      weeks. Volunteers are to be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequence groups (fed and
      fasted; fasted and fed). The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone will be assessed for 96 hours
      after each dosing. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Prior to
      initiating clinical trials in Japan, a food effect study is required to evaluate the effect
      of food on the pharmacokinetics of ER OROS paliperidone in Japanese adults.
