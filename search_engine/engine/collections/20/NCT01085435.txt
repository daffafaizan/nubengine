    
      EFFORTLESS is an observational, post market, standard of care, Registry to be conducted at
      approximately 50 centers worldwide in patients requiring an ICD for the treatment of
      ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients included in the registry will have been implanted with
      the S-ICD system since its CE mark (commercial regulatory approval) and will be followed for
      up to 60 months. The patients' perception of their therapy will be evaluated using Quality of
      Life assessments and the Registry will include an exploratory analysis of resource
      utilization and costs based on measures of clinical outcome such as complication rates,
      unscheduled hospitalizations and length of stay. The objective will be to enable comparison
      of costs of the S-ICD system versus a standard transvenous system.

      A Sub-Study will extend the EFFORTLESS S-ICD Registry in order to achieve an average of
      approximately 8 years of follow-up from index procedure. A subgroup of approximately 200
      patients will be enrolled at a sub-set of EFFORTLESS sites. The data analysis will focus on
      long-term S-ICD system-related adverse events, S-ICD replacements and device longevity.
