      I. To determine the objective response rate of patients with imatinib and sunitinib-resistant
      malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity experienced by patients with imatinib and sunitinib -resistant
      malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To determine progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with imatinib and
      sunitinib -resistant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with BAY
      43-9006.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine if mutational status of KIT and PDGFA in patients with imatinib- and sunitinib
      resistant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor correlate with response to BAY 43-9006.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      treatment with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate (imatinib mesylate- and sunitinib
      malate-responsive disease vs primary imatinib mesylate- and sunitinib malate-refractory
      disease).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed periodically.
