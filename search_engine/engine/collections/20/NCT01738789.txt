    
      All patients with an indeterminate ultrasonographically adnexal mass referred for MR imaging
      will be consecutively included in each center.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Patient ≥ 18 years old

        -  With indeterminate ultrasonographic adnexal mass

        -  Informed consent

      Non inclusion Criteria

        -  Pregnant women

        -  Pacemaker, ferromagnetic materials, or foreign body at risk of mobilization

        -  Intolerance to iodinated or gadolinium contrast agents, or severe renal insufficiency
           (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73m²).

      Objectives • Primary objective: Evaluate if ADNEXMR SCORING system is relevant for reporting
      pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations performed for characterization of
      sonographically indeterminate adnexal masses in an external prospective multicenter study

      • Secondary objectives and endpoints: Evaluate

        1. The potential impact of applying the score to the therapeutic strategy, in particular to
           measure the possible reduction in oncologic surgery in benign cases

        2. If ADNEXMR SCORING system improves reproducibility of MR report for characterization of
           adnexal masses

        3. If ADNEXMR SCORING system is as accurate if the radiologist is blinded from any clinical
           and ultrasonographic data

      Main endpoint Joint analysis of true negative and false negative rates according to ADNEXMR
      SCORING system as compared to the histological results (or follow-up outcome, see "reference
      standard", below) with an evaluation of the sensitivity and the specificity of the score
