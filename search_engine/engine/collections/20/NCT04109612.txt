      and ischemic, (ICD-10 codes: I61, I63 and I64) admitted within 48 hours of symptoms onset to
      seven NHS and University hospitals will be conducted. About 1,000 patients (2% of all new
      cases/annually) will be recruited from six urban and semi-urban areas with 5.5 mil people
      (50% of Greek population), reporting 25,000 discharged stroke cases annually (53% of all
      stroke discharges), according to data derived from Hellenic Statistical Authority. All
      patients will be followed for three months. Moreover, a sub-group of the 300 firstly
      recruited patients will be followed for a year to obtain data on post hospital health and
      social needs, health services utilization (medication, rehabilitation, outpatient visits) and
      productivity loss . Patient enrolment and follow up is estimated to last 18 months.
