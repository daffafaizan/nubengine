      and tailored made actions provided by expert teams. The main objective of our study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-month personalized multidisciplinary care provided to the
      dyad FTLD patient and caregiver on patient's behavioural disorders. The secondary objectives
      are to assess the impact of this program on patient's cognitive deterioration, functional
      autonomy and behavioral problems, as well as caregiver's depressive symptomatology and sense
      of competence
