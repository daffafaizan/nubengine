      botox/surgical history, use and duration of walkers/child-runner (WCR). The scale was
      translated into Turkish with the following translation steps. Thirty four children with
      idiopatic toe walking were included in the study. Internal structure consistency and
      test-retest reliability were measured for reliability analyses. For each item on the scale,
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient and item-total score correlations were calculated. The scale was
      administered for test-retest reliability at baseline and one week later by one rater.
      Test-retest reliability was assessed by Pearson's correlation test with observational gait
      analysis and 'co-validity' was investigated, statistically.
