      cancer (NSCLC, including squamous cell lung cancer, and small cell lung cancer). Although
      surgery provides the best chance of cure, the majority of lung cancer require radiation for
      treatment. The current radiation recommendation, using modern techniques and a uniform
      radiation dose, generates an overall cure rate of less than 10-15%, and moderate toxicity in
      10-30% of treated patients. Who can be cured and who will develop side effects? Computed
      tomography (CT) provides a useful tool to monitor, but a limited power to predict both tumor
      control and lung toxicity. Using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
      (FDG-PET) and ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (V/Q SPECT),
      we have recently shown changes in tumor activity and regional lung function during the course
      of radiation, which may be associated with long-term outcome. The general strategy of this
      project is to perform functional image and blood test during the course of radiation and
      correlate them with long-term outcomes. By completing this study, we expect to generate
      predictive models better than CT-based ones for both tumor control and lung toxicity.
