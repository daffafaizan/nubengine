    
      This is a randomized control trial, two arms with block randomization. Primary care patients
      with diabetes and elevated blood pressure randomized to intervention or control. Intervention
      arm: home telemonitoring using the Ideal Life blood pressure cuff and telephone or internet
      transmission device to transmit blood pressure information to the Primary care manager team
      with otherwise normal care manager care. Control arm: Omron (off the shelf) home blood
      pressure monitor (no transmission of data) and usual care. We will be comparing blood
      pressure control between groups and provider contacts.
