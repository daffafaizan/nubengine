      a total of 5,203 outbreaks (≥ 1case), of which 651 (13%) occurred in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
      (ARA) area. In the ARA area, 3,885 residents of NH were confirmed cases (positiveness of the
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or of the serology testing), of which 1,772 (46%)
      subsequently died. To manage this crisis, the French government decided to first, ban the
      visits to residents and to reinforce hygiene measures targeting care workers, and secondly,
      of a national lock down. In the same time, shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE)
      had happened worldwide.

      In this context, one can hypothesize that the occurrence of outbreaks and its spread among
      the residents of NH would have been initiated by the staff members. Nonetheless, the
      implementation of local actions might have been efficient to mitigate the epidemic, while on
      the other hand, shortage of PPE might have worsen the epidemic.

      Therefore the investigators aimed to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of
      outbreak in residents and in staff members of nursing home, as well as the factors
      influencing this relationship, using data from a multicentric cross-sectional survey
      conducted in the French Alps, a part of ARA area.
