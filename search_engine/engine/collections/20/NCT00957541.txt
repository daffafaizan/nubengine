      feature, which has been implemented in a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. This
      trial will study the effectiveness of the diagnostic feature to detect heart failure events
      in medically stable, ICD-indicated, congestive heart failure patients. The ability of the
      diagnostic feature to 'detect' and 'predict' heart failure events will be studied.
