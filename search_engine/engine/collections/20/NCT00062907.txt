    
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the vaccine regimen
      administered as two doses of pVAX/L523S and two doses of Ad/L523S.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To provide initial evidence as to whether CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses specific for
           L523S protein can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of
           Ad/L523S

        -  To provide initial evidence as to whether antibody responses specific for L523S protein
           can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of Ad/L523S

        -  To investigate the extent to which dose escalation of Ad/L523S affects the elicited
           immune response
