    
      Aim: To study differences between gender in diagnostic tools, pharmacological interventions,
      and self-reported symptoms in ParkinsonÂ´s Disease (PD).

      METHODS:

      Data were extracted from the Swedish Neuro Registers, one of the Swedish National Quality
      Registers. A mix of urban and rural parts of the country were chosen and data were divided by
      gender. Self-reported first experienced PD related symptom was used to define the starting
      point when processing the data. Zero to three years from this point was defined as early
      symptoms and over three years as late symptoms.

      CONCLUSION:

      Differences between gender were seen in all chosen aspects, both diagnostically. Distinctions
      were also prominent in reported NonMotorSymptoms (NMS) profiles. These findings should be
      important to take into consideration for patients, professional staff, and caregivers in the
      daily work with gender mixed PD groups.
