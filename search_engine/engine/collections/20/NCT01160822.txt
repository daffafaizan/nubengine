    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled 18 weeks study,
      consisting of two parts:

        1. Part A: an ascending single dose part in which the safety and tolerability of up to 4
           different canakinumab doses are studied (starting dose 150 mg, maximum dose 600 mg).

        2. Part B: a double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel design part in which the pain
           reduction of the canakinumab dose selected from part A is studied in comparison to
           Placebo and Naproxen.
