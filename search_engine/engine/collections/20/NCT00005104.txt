    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Patients receive oral metformin or oral placebo three times daily for 7 weeks. Patients
      remaining anovulatory by day 49 receive metformin or placebo plus escalating doses of oral
      clomiphene citrate daily for 5 consecutive days, beginning on days 50, 80, and 110. Following
      ovulation, treatment with clomiphene citrate and metformin or placebo continues until 6
      ovulatory cycles occur, pregnancy occurs, or anovulation persists. Patients receiving the
      placebo arm who have not ovulated on the highest dose of clomiphene citrate may be crossed
      over to receive metformin after a 6 week washout.
