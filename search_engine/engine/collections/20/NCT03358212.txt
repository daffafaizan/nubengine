      denosumab as an post-operative strategy.

      This study only included patients who meet all the following criteria: (1) With
      treatment-naïve sacral giant-cell tumor (GCT) firstly treated in our center (for referral
      patients, only those with definite diagnosis were included); (2) Being diagnosed with classic
      giant-cell tumor of bone (GCTB) by puncture pathology prior to treatment (for referral
      patients, definite diagnosis shall be made by the Pathology Department in our center through
      pathology consultation on tissue sections); (3) previously denosumab-naïve.

      Data collection:The following data of patients included in this study were collected: (1)
      basic information: age, gender; (2) pathological data: puncture pathological diagnosis, and
      postoperative pathological findings; (3) the imaging findings (including X-ray, CT, Magnetic
      resonance(MR), Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography(PET-CT)) and functional
      assessment of patients in the neoadjuvant denosumab group before and after the use of
      denosumab; (4) intraoperative blood loss, and duration of operation; (5) imaging findings in
      postoperative follow-up re-examination and outcome.

      functional assessment: For sacral giant cell tumor:The Motor Urination defecation(MUD)
      scoring system published on Spine by our center in 2016 , which include three domains (motor
      function and sensation of lower limbs [M], urination and uriesthesia [U], and Defecation and
      rectal sensation [D]) with three items in each domain (each item can be scored by 0, 1, 2 or
      3, and the maximum score is 27), was applied in the functional assessment of sacral nerves.

      For GCT occurs in Limbs ,we use Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) 93 to record the
      function.

      All the patients enrolled will take denosumab according to the protocols:denosumab 120mg was
      administrated to patients by subcutaneous injection every four weeks, with loading doses on
      Day 8 and Day 15 of the first cycle,them take it monthly till 1 year after the surgery.We
      focus on the recurrence rate after the drug withdrawl and possibility of malignant
      transformation.
