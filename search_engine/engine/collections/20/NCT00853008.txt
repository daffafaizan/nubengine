      >25x109/L and 11q23 or MLL rearrangements. Induction therapy included vincristine, prednisone
      and daunorubicin for 4 weeks. In pts with slow cytologic response to therapy (â‰¥10% blasts in
      bone marrow assessed on d14) intensified induction with high dose ARA-C and mitoxantrone was
      administered. Early consolidation therapy included 3 cycles with rotating cytotoxic drugs
      including high-dose methotrexate, high-dose ARA-C and high-dose asparaginase. Pts. with slow
      cytologic response on d14 or MRD level >0.05% after consolidation were assigned to allogeneic
      SCT (related or unrelated) and those with standard cytologic response on d14 and MRD level
      <0.05% after consolidation received 3 additional cycles of delayed consolidation (identical
      to those of early consolidation) followed by maintenance therapy up to 2yr in CR.
