    
      Head-perineum distance measured by transperineal ultrasound is a simple and well-known tool
      to help diagnose the fetal head engagement and predictive value to instrumental extraction
      succeeds.

      It is performed in labor room and is a non-invasive test, realized on a healthy skin.

      The investigators performed a systematical measure of head perineum distance at the beginning
      of the expulsive labor phase. The investigators made the hypothesis, based on our clinical
      experience, that starting expulsive labor phase with head perineum distance greater than
      forty five millimeters, lead to an increased risk of instrumental extraction and therefore an
      increase in materno-fetal morbidity and mortality.

      The investigators sought to evaluate the optimal head perineum distance at the beginning of
      expulsive efforts.
