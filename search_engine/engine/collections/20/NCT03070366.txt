      pauci-metastatic disease. In these cases, systemic therapy is the standard attitude. However,
      patients often received chemotherapy in their history and response rates are relatively low.
      The median survival is between 7 and 11 months with secondary effects and degradation of
      quality of life. It is a palliative treatment. Data on systemic treatment in the context of a
      micro-metastatic disease are limited. In contrast, stereotactic irradiation in
      pauci-metastatic context leads to better local control rates and may sustainedly reduce the
      progression of metastatic disease.

      Stereotactic radiotherapy is increasing use in clinical practice for limited metastatic
      stages (oligo metastatic with 1-3 synchronized metastases). Radiotherapy in this indication
      has major advantages and a similar efficacy compared with other ablative treatments.
