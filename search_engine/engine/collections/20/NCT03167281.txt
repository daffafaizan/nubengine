    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the timing and efficacy of early administration and
      late administration of t-PA/DNase via thoracostomy (n=60). Patients will be identified from
      the Intensive Care Unit, Coronary Care Unit, and wards/stepdown units. Prior to chest tube
      placement, patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (early use of
      t-PA-DNase verus late use of t-PA-DNase). Route of administration will be via their
      thoracostomy tube over a period of three days twice daily.
