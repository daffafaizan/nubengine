      natural cleavage plane between the peritumoral capsule and the renal parenchyma without
      removing a visible rim of healthy renal tissue, which appears to reserve more renal
      parenchyma without compromising oncologic safety, may be an alternative to standard partial
      nephrectomy (PN). Although published studies showed excellent long-term oncologic results,
      many urologists still consider SE an unsafe technique with a high risk of incomplete tumor
      excision. The aim of this study is to compare the peri-operative, renal functional and
      oncologic outcomes of endoscopic robot-assisted simple enucleation(ERASE) and standard
      robot-assisted partial nephrectomy(RAPN) in the treatment of T1 renal cell carcinoma.
