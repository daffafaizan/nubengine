      takes advantage of very fast imaging technologies (up to 20 000 images/sec) to measure the
      diffusion of pressure waves in the tissues. This pressure wave can be either natural (blood
      pressure), or generated by an very short ultrasonic impulsion at a given place. By using both
      modes, it is possible to have a precise cartography of tissue mechanical properties. This
      technique is applied to solid tissues such as breast or liver, but not yet currently to
      hollow tissues such as arteries. The aim of the present study is to compare the values of
      stiffness obtained with Ultrafast ECHO with the reference non invasive technique, the
      Echotracking, which measures stiffness by assessing the deformation of arteries in response
      to changes in blood pressure. On the physiological part, we will revisit old concepts of
      increased stiffness of hypertensive's arteries. Indeed, hypertension is associated with
      increased stiffness due to recruitement of collagen fibers, but also to chronic remodelling.
      We have shown before that this remodelling conducts to accumulation of arterial tissue of
      lesser intrinsic stiffness. The latter finding was done through models based on echotracking
      measurements. It will be interesting to see whether it holds true when stiffness is directly
      measured.

      Sixty subjects (30 normotensive and30 hypertensives) will be included and studied once.
      Measurement will be performed in random order 3 time on the common carotid artery on both
      sides. Aortic stiffness will be measured by pulse wave velocity
