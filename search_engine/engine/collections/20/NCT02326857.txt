      in Latin American women with AJCC 7 clinical stage II or III breast cancer. The molecular
      profiles will be correlated with epidemiological, histological, and clinical characteristics,
      including pathologic response to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, this study
      intends to define a molecular signature that will predict response to neoadjuvant therapy in
      breast cancer. This is a prospective cohort study in which no investigational drugs will be
      administered to participants. The study will be conducted at participating institutions in
      Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay.
