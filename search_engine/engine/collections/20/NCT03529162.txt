      performed in conjunction with a rotator cuff repair. Currently, biceps tenodesis is performed
      in many different ways depending on surgeon preference. First, the location of the tenodesis
      can vary, as surgeons may prefer a suprapectoral or subpectoral tenodesis location. In
      addition, the tenodesis fixation technique can also vary, as surgeons have the option to use
      a screw or suture anchor to perform the tenodesis. There have been numerous studies comparing
      these various techniques, including suprapectoral versus subpectoral techniques and screw
      versus suture anchor techniques. None of these studies have been conclusive, and there
      continues to be controversy as to the best technique.

      The current study will compare two techniques of subpectoral biceps tenodesis. Specifically,
      we will compare tenodesis using a suture anchor versus a technique where the tendon is simply
      sutured to the pectoralis major tendon. The latter technique has been previously described
      and published.
