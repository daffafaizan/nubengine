      treadmill in postoperative rehabilitation after knee arthroplasty. This issue is especially
      relevant because the number of knee arthroplasty patients is increasing. The rehabilitation
      of knee arthroplasty patients has also appeared to be more challenging than in the case of
      hip arthroplasty.

      The investigators will compare anti-gravity treadmill rehabilitation and the traditional
      postoperative rehabilitation with instructions. The investigators will recruit the patients
      either in the anti-gravity group (n=27) or in the traditional rehabilitation (n=27)
      (randomized study design).

      The investigators will assume that anti-gravity treadmill exercise after hospitalization will
      lead to the faster rehabilitation, better walking quality and balance management compared to
      the traditional rehabilitation.
