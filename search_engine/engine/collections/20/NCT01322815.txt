    
      Subject visits will occur 1-4 weeks prior to initiation of GI-4000, then

        -  In newly diagnosed (Group A) patients, at every FOLFOX/FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab visit,
           bevacizumab and GI-4000 dosing visit, GI-4000 dosing visit and then quarterly after
           completion of therapy

        -  In patients with stable disease who have completed a first line therapy with an
           oxaliplatin or irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab containing regimen
           (Group B), at every bevacizumab and GI-4000 dosing visit, GI-4000 dosing visit and then
           quarterly after completion of therapy

      Group A patients (N=26) will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of first line
      therapy with bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX (N=13) or FOLFIRI (N=13)

        -  Subjects will receive 1 40 yeast units (YU) dose of GI-4000 prior to initiation of
           FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, then intercycle doses of GI-4000 will be given 7
           days after each cycle while first line therapy is given (up to 8 cycles)

        -  After completion of first line therapy, subjects will enter the maintenance phase in
           which bevacizumab and GI-4000 will be given concurrently every 2 weeks for as long as
           therapy can be tolerated or until progression

        -  If a subject discontinues bevacizumab therapy due to intolerance, the subject will
           continue GI-4000 every 2 weeks until progression, intolerance or withdrawal from the
           study

      Group B patients (N=26) with stable disease who have completed a first line therapy with an
      oxaliplatin or irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab containing regimen ) will
      enter the trial prior to receiving therapy with bevacizumab

        -  Subjects will receive 40 yeast unit (YU) GI-4000 concurrently with each bevacizumab dose
           for as long as therapy can be tolerated or until progression

        -  If a subject discontinues bevacizumab therapy due to intolerance, the subject will
           continue GI-4000 every 2 weeks until progression, intolerance or withdrawal from the
           study
