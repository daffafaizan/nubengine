    
      30 subjects with SI joint pain confirmed by SI joint injections will be randomized to receive
      either L4 and L5 primary dorsal rami and S1-3 lateral branch radiofrequency denervation or
      sham denervation. To facilitate patient blinding, in both groups 1 ml of lidocaine will be
      injected before true (or sham) denervation so patients cannot feel heating. The stimulation
      will be the same for both groups and blinding assessed after the procedure. Follow-up visits
      will be at 1,3 and 6-months postprocedure.
