      branches inside the same sequence. The objective of the project is to compare the regurgitant
      fraction in the pulmonary artery (PA) measured using 4D MR-flow and standard 2D MR-flow in
      repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) patients. The consistency of the 4D flow quantization
      will be assessed assuming mass conservation in the pulmonary artery tree (PA flow =LeftPA
      flow +RightPA flow ? ).
