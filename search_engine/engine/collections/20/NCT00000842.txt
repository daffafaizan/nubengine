      pain-modifying agents or membrane-stabilizing drugs. Because nerve growth factor is important
      in the development and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons and their outgrowths,
      it is proposed that recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide a specific restorative
      treatment for HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy.

      Patients are randomized to receive either rhNGF at one of two doses or placebo, administered
      subcutaneously twice weekly for 18 weeks. Patients are stratified into three groups within
      their regimens by use of didanosine, zalcitabine, or stavudine as follows: current use vs.
      discontinued between 8 and 26 weeks before randomization vs. never used or discontinued use
      at least 26 weeks before randomization. Patients will assess their pain daily using the
      Gracely Pain Scale. AS PER AMENDMENT 5/6/97: After completion of the double-blind phase (18
      weeks on treatment followed by 4 weeks off treatment), patients may receive open-label,
      active drug treatment according to their previously assigned regimen for an additional 48
      weeks.
