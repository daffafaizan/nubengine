           and staged by thoracicoabdominal computed tomography (CT), endoluminal ultrasonography
           and positron emission tomography (PET) before surgery. The other crucial test including
           barium meal, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, cardiac
           ultrasonography, electrocardiogram and treadmill test, as well as blood biochemistry
           examinations will also be accomplished preoperatively.

        2. Patients who meet clinical criteria will be asked to sign a consent form, and divided
           randomly into two groups - trans-substernal group and trans-esophageal bed group.
           Patients in both groups will undergo a minimally invasive esophagectomy which consist of
           4 steps: (1) thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization followed by mediastinal
           lymphadenectomy; (2) laparoscopic gastric mobilization followed by abdominal
           lymphadenectomy and gastric tube construction; (3) cervical esophageal mobilization and
           transection; (4) lifting of the gastric tube to the neck for gastro-esophageal
           anastomosis through trans-substernal or trans-esophageal bed path. The operative
           procedure of the two groups is similar except step 4.

        3. Patients in both groups will be followed-up regularly. Intra- and post-operative status,
           morbidity and complications, nutrition status, as well as quality of life after surgery
           will be evaluated, and differences between the trans-substernal and trans-esophageal bed
           groups will be compared.
