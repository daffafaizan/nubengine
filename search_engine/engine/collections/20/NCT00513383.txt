           this study received panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy. Participants enrolled in Part B
           will receive panitumumab in combination with induction chemotherapy followed by
           chemoradiotherapy.

        -  The main purpose of Part A was to examine the safety and the best dosing of panitumumab,
           chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer. The best dosing
           was determined by increasing doses of chemotherapy given in combination with panitumumab
           during radiation. The chemotherapy drugs being used in Part A were carboplatin and
           paclitaxel, which are standard therapies used in head and neck cancer. These drugs were
           be added to radiation and this combination is called chemoradiotherapy. The
           investigators have determined the best dose of panitumumab and chemotherapy to give with
           radiation, Part B has now begun.

        -  The main purpose of Part B is to examine the safety and best dosing of chemotherapy
           combined with panitumumab (called induction therapy) prior to receiving panitumumab and
           chemoradiotherapy. The drugs that are used for induction chemotherapy will be docetaxel,
           cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. These drugs are also standard therapies used in head and
           neck cancer.
