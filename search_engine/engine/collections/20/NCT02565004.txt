    
      Background:

        -  This study is to continue the analysis begun on 09C0079 which was focused on
           identification of the genetic mutation associated with a new gastric polyposis syndrome,
           Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS).

        -  GAPPS is an autosomal dominant gastric polyposis syndrome that confers a substantial
           risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and has been found to be associated with germline point
           variants in APC promoter 1B.

        -  At this time, any non-gastric phenotype associated with GAPPS is unknown and is being
           explored using a phenotyping survey interview.

      Objective

      - To specifically investigate families with clusters of cancer to determine if there is a
      potential familial genetic mutation specific to a particular cancer and if present, to
      compare these genetic abnormalities with individuals from the same family without cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Participants must meet one of the following:

             -  Have been previously enrolled on the familial genetic analysis arm of NIH study
                09-C-0079; OR

             -  Be family members of patients previously enrolled on the familial genetic analysis
                arm of 09-C-0079; OR

             -  Have a documented pathogenic germline APC promotor 1B variant from a CLIA approved
                laboratory.

        -  Participants must be 10 years of age or older

      Design:

        -  This protocol was originally opened to continue same use of research that was approved
           under protocol 09-C-0079, to analyze the data for publication, and to provide
           participants with any results of clinical and analytic validity and clinical utility.

        -  In a subsequent amendment carriers of a germline APC promoter 1B variant will
           participate in a phenotyping assessment survey interview to assess the phenotype of
           Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polypopsis of the Stomach (GAPPS).
