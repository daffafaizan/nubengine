      the efficacy of CES as an add-on treatment for tic disorders (SCATT). The study will be
      conducted at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. A total of 100 patients aged 6 to
      17 years with tic disorders and lack of clinical response to 4 weeks' pharmacotherapy will be
      enrolled. Patients will be randomly into 2 groups and given 4 weeks' treatment, including 40
      daily 30-minute sessions of active CES(500μA~2mA) or sham CES(lower than 100μA) on weekdays.
      Change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) is considered to be the primary outcome. The
      secondary outcome is the changes in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Hamilton Anxiety
      Scale (HAMA). Assessments will be performed at baseline, week 2, week 4 and week 8. Adverse
      events(AE) will be also evaluated.
