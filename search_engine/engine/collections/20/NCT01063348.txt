      normal skin leading to tissue damage, personal distress, and impaired functioning. Although
      skin picking has been described in the medical literature for over one-hundred years, it
      remains a poorly understood psychiatric issue and often goes undiagnosed and untreated.

      Picking behavior does not by itself suggest a psychiatric disorder. Pathology exists in the
      focus, duration and extent of the behavior, as well as the reasons for picking, associated
      emotions, and resulting problems. Patients with PSP report thoughts of picking or impulses to
      pick that are irresistible, intrusive and/or senseless. These thoughts, impulses, or
      behaviors also cause marked distress for patients and significantly interfere with other
      activities. Unlike normal picking behavior, the pathologic form of skin picking is recurrent
      and usually results in noticeable skin damage.

      Thirty subjects with pathologic skin picking will receive 12 weeks of double-blind treatment
      with N-acetyl cysteine or matching placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that N-acetyl
      cysteine will be more effective than placebo in patients with pathologic skin picking. The
      proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of an often disabling disorder that
      currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.
