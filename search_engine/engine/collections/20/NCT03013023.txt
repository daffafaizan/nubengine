        1. to develop behavioral-support interventions for preterm infants who receive painful,
           stressful procedures in the NICU,

        2. to develop a parent-infant transactional program (PITP) for parent-infant dyads with
           preterm infants in the NICU,

        3. to determine the short-term effects of the behavioral-support interventions and PITP on
           infant stress (salivary cortisol levels) and sleep patterns,

        4. to determine the short-term effects of the PITP on parental stress, depression, social
           support, and sleep quality during postpartum, and

        5. to determine the long-term effects of the behavioral-support interventions and PITP on
           parent-infant interactions and infants' long-term emotional regulation and
           neurobehavioral outcomes.
