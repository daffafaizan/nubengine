      satisfaction data on an Acne System (Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%, Salicylic Acid 0.5%), which
      includes Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advanced Acne Treatment (2.5%
      Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% Salicylic Acid), in the treatment of
      moderate to severe acne. Approximately 120 male or female subjects ages 12-35 years,
      inclusive, with moderate or severe acne as assessed by Investigator's Global Assessment
      (ISGA) and lesion counts are expected to be enrolled. Subjects will be instructed to use all
      3 study products as part of a complete acne treatment system; no reference therapy or control
      group will be included. Subjects will be instructed to apply Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl
      Peroxide) and Foam Advnced Acne Treatment (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) to the face each morning
      and Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% Salicylic
