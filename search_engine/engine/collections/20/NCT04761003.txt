      aspirated pleural fluid. Thoracentesis or blind pleural biopsy may not provide a definitive
      diagnosis. Cryobiopsy has more successful diagnostic results than forceps biopsies with
      complications (only hemorrhage) during procedures. Cryobiopsy can obtain more diagnostic
      biopsies due to the size of the biopsies and best property in expressions of an artifact-free
      sample area
