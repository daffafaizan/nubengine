      Chongqing Medical University. The protocol design is in accordance with Consolidated
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.This study is designed as a randomized
      controlled trial to compare intra-operative continuous femoral nerve block combined with
      lighter anesthetic depth (group L) with deeper anesthetic depth (group D) monitored by
      bispectral index (BIS). All potentially eligible participants will be asked to give written
      informed consent before they are enrolled in this study.The following outcomes will be
      assessed:post-operative major complications (post-operative pulmonary infection,need of
      mechanical respiratory support,myocardio-infarction,deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
      embolism, stroke, poor wound healing,all-cause post-operative death within 30 days).Secondary
      Outcomes included :acute post-operative pain assessed by visual analogue scale and dosages of
      rescue medications;Dosages of intra-operative vasopressors,anesthetics and analgesics;Life
      quality measured by EQ-5D questionnaire 3 months post-operatively;adverse events associated
      with the femoral catheter (displacement, infection, hematoma,drop-out of catheter).
