      cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer. They are both gaining popularity in
      public. Ketogenic diet has also been very popular, especially due to its effect on weight
      loss and blood glucose parameters. To our knowledge there, are no studies that compare
      long-term effects of all three diets and omnivorous diets with regards to health parameters
      and gut microbiota composition.

      The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the link between different diets and health
      parameters, such as parameters related to longevity, inflammation, stress and gut microbiota
      composition. The study is designed to compare different diets and their relationship with the
      body as a whole.
