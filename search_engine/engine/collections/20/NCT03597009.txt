    
      This is a phase 1b/II clinical trial that includes a safety run-in cohort to investigate the
      novel approach of administering intrapleural talimogene laherparepvec via a pleurX catheter
      in patients with known malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

      In Phase Ib of this study, the safety of infusing talimogene laherparepvec directly into the
      pleural cavity of subjects diagnosed with MPE, through pleurX catheter, will be tested.

      In Phase II of this study, after establishing the safety of the above mentioned approach, 24
      subjects will enrolled and treated with intrapleural talimogene laherparepvec and IV
      nivolumab.
