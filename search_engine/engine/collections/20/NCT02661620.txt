    
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the REDAPT™ Revision Femoral System
      modular stem cumulative revision rate at 5 years.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to provide 10 years of safety and performance data on
      the REDAPT™ Revision Femoral System modular stem in terms of Standard of Care Radiographic
      Assessment, Harris Hip Sore (if obtained prior to implant), adverse event assessment, whole
      blood metal ion level assessment for Cobalt and Chromium (only performed if subject if
      symptomatic with pain, swelling, and/or functional limitation related to the device and/
      implant procedure as assessed by the Principal Investigator (PI), and Metal artifact
      reduction sequence (MARS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) will
      be obtained if metal ion levels of Cobalt and/or Chromium > 7parts per billion (ppb) 140
      subjects have been enrolled in the study at 5 clinical study sites around the world. A
      Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be completed at years 5 and 10.
