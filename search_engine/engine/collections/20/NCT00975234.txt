      myocardial infarction (MI) is of special significance, as the heart muscle cannot regenerate
      so a region's necrosis leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. Depending on the area
      affected by the scar, infarction can lead to a progressive and irreversible decline in
      cardiac function, giving way to heart failure (HF) syndrome. The molecular basis of
      congestive heart failure is the absence of cardiac stem cells capable of regenerating cardiac
      muscle. In the skeletal muscle, there are cells located beneath the basal membrane with are
      capable of regenerating muscle fibres; they are known as myoblasts. There are several studies
      with autologous myoblasts, either by direct administration during surgery or percutaneously,
      which could distinguish between the effect of revascularisation surgery and that of the
      myoblast injection. The objective of this study is compare improvement in global and regional
      cardiac function in patients with old MI obtained by aortocoronary bypass surgery with
      intracardiac administration of autologous skeletal myoblasts versus standard aortocoronary
      bypass surgery treatment.
