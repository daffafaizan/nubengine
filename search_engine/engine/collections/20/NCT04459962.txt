    
      This is a Cohort Study which will collect non-invasive, expired breath sample, cheek swab and
      a Medical and Lifestyle questionnaire from participants.

      When the participant presents for COVID-19 testing they will be asked to provide a cheek swab
      and breath sample, and complete the study questionnaire. They will not need to give any
      identifiable information or have a second visit. The samples will be analysed immediately and
      disposed of as clinical waste. ANCON will then use the data to build a breath profile of
      COVID-19 infection.

      Sample and data collection method for inpatients:

        -  Sequential (daily or every other day as able) breath and swab test will be taken from
           some of the patients admitted in the hospital (inpatients).

        -  This will be taken from entry or start of the study to discharge or end of study or
           until patient or medical staff deem unsuitable to continue

        -  This will enable to track infection and the relevant profile changes as covid-19
           progresses and/or is treated. This will provide vital additional information around
           identifiers associated with the disease and its progress.

      Anonymous Questionnaire - Each participant will be asked questions in the form of a short
      standard questionnaire based on:

        -  Medical Information

        -  Lifestyle Information
