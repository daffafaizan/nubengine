      during sleep due to recurrent collapse of upper airway. Epidemiologic evidence showed they
      were at higher risk for autoimmune diseases. The regular T cell (Treg) has a crucial role in
      controlling autoimmunity. In this study, 40 OSA patients and 40 age-, gender- and BMI-matched
      controls will be recruited. Peripheral venous blood of the participants is drawn for
      numeration of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regular T cells by flow cytometry. As well, the CD4+CD25+
      regular T cells are enriched by MACS and tested for their suppressive functions on
      proliferation assays. Th12+ CD4+ cells are also measured.
