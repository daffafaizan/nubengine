      hemodialysis. Although RRF is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity in
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, few studies have addressed therapeutic approaches for
      preserving RRF after the initiation of dialysis therapy. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin
      system by ACEI or ARB is a well-established approach for renoprotection in pre-dialysis
      chronic kidney disease patients. Up to now, only two trials showed that an ACEI, ramipril,
      and ARB, valsartan , were effective in the preservation of RRF of CAPD patients. However it
      is important to point out that the evidence cited has limitations. First, the trial only
      involved patients from one university teaching hospital. Second, transport characteristics,
      were not assessed before the start of the study. Third, the trial was too small to detect
      potentially important differences in health care use and survival between groups. Therefore,
      whether both ACEI and ARB preserve RRF, improve clinical outcomes and decrease health care
      use and costs should be tested in much longer and larger studies involving multiple sites. In
      order to confirm these findings, here the investigators will perform prospective, randomized,
      open-label and multiple center study to address long-term effects of ACEI, ARB and
      combination of both therapy on RRF in Patients on CAPD.
