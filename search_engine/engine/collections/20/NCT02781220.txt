      amyloid positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) scan in clinical
      practice for participants at our site that are enrolled in the IDEAS (NCT02420756) trial. To
      accomplish this, when a clinician has ordered an amyloid PET scan, the investigators will
      assess the impact of [18F]Flutemetamol PET/CT scans on 1) physician diagnosis and management
      as it relates to care practices and drug management, and 2) patient reported outcomes in
      patients evaluated in the Cognitive Disorders Clinic at the University of Utah and meeting
      Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for clinical amyloid PET/CT scans. A secondary purpose is to
      compare the semi-quantitative assessment of amyloid plaque burden using vendor supplied
      software and standard visual assessment of amyloid positivity.

      The primary hypothesis is that, in diagnostically uncertain cases, knowledge of amyloid
      status as determined by amyloid PET/CT scans may alter patient diagnosis and management and
      lead to significant changes in patient and family reported outcomes. A secondary hypothesis
      is that vendor supplied semi-quantitative assessment of amyloid plaque positivity will be
      superior to standard visual criteria assessments.

      Objectives

      AIM 1: to assess the change in diagnosis and management, related to care practices and drug
      management of adult patients being evaluated for cognitive deficits and meeting Appropriate
      Use Criteria (AUC)

      AIM 2: to assess the change of amyloid PET/ CT scans on patient-reported outcomes involving
      care partner confidence and satisfaction

      AIM 3: to assess confidence increase through use of vendor supplied semi-quantitative
      software

      AIM 4: to assess adherence to identified patient management related to care practices and
      drug management
