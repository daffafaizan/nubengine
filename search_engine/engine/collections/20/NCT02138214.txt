      I. To determine the rate of transient and permanent hypocalcemia

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems.

      II. To determine the degree to which quality of life (QOL) is compromised.

      III. To determine the degree to which accurate quality of life measures can be extracted from
      patient interview narratives using natural language processing techniques.

      IV. To determine clinical recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, if ineligible into a SOC arm.

      Arm I: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy alone.

      Arm II: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic central neck
      dissection (CND).

      Arm III: Patients ineligible to be randomized into Arm I or II, Standard of Care (SOC)
      comparator receiving same follow up.
