    
      A double blind Phase II randomized study of metformin versus (vs) placebo in non-diabetic
      women on first to fourth line chemotherapy with anthracycline, taxane, platinum, capecitabine
      or vinorelbine based regimens for metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer
      (BC). Patients were randomized to receive metformin 850 mg tablets or placebo once daily for
      two days as ramp-up, followed by one tablet twice a day for the duration of the study.
      Randomization was stratified by line of chemotherapy (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th line) and hormone
      receptor status (ER and/or PgR positive versus both negative). All patients were required to
      have measureable or non-measureable, but evaluable metastases at study entry. Metformin or
      placebo was to be continued until disease progression, even if chemotherapy was changed or
      stopped prior to disease progression. Recruitment took place at five sites in Ontario,
      Canada: Mount Sinai Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, St. Michael's Hospital,
      Toronto and London Regional Cancer Centre, London.
