    
      At baseline (BSL), subjects whose eligibility was confirmed were randomized to one of the
      following four treatment groups.

        -  75 mg secukinumab

        -  150 mg secukinumab

        -  300 mg secukinumab

        -  Placebo At Week 16, all subjects were classified as responders (â‰¥ 20% improvement from
           BSL in both tender and swollen joint counts) or non-responders.

      Subjects who were randomized to a secukinumab treatment group at baseline were targeted to
      remain on the same dose for the entire trial.

      Subjects who were randomized to placebo at baseline were re-randomized at Week 16 as follows:

      Placebo non-responders received secukinumab 150 mg s.c. or 300 mg s.c. (1:1) every 4 weeks,
      starting after the efficacy assessments at Week 16.

      Placebo responders continued to receive placebo at Week 16 and Week 20 and received
      secukinumab 150 mg s.c. or 300 mg s.c. (1:1) every 4 weeks, starting after the efficacy
      assessments at Week 24.

      This was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized treatment trial until week 52 analysis was
      completed and open label afterwards.

      An amendment to the study protocol (after all patients were in the trial for 2-3 years)
      introduced changes whereby patients previously treated with secukinumab 75 mg s.c. could
      change to receive 150 mg s.c. or 300 mg s.c., and patients previously treated with
      secukinumab 150 mg s.c. could change to receive 300 mg s.c., as deemed appropriate by the
      investigators.
