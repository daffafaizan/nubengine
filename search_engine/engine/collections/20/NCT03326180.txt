    
      The trial design is a patient-blinded multi-centre, active comparator, randomised controlled
      two-arm parallel group superiority trial of liposomal bupivacaine plus bupivacaine
      hydrochloride versus bupivacaine alone for post-operative pain in patients undergoing knee
      replacement surgery.

      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The randomised controlled trial (RCT) design is
      robust and reduces any potential bias. Patients will be blinded as to which treatment they
      receive. Blinding of patients is possible as they will be under general anaesthetic for their
      knee replacement surgery at the time of the drug administration. Blinding of surgeons, who
      administer the medication and outcome assessors was not necessary as the primary outcome is a
      patient reported outcome measure.
