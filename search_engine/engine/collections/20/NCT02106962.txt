        -  A patient candidate identified by the PI who meets all of the inclusion criteria and
           none of the exclusion criteria will be consented for the study.

        -  The medical history will be collected from the subject.

        -  The subject will receive routine hemodialysis

        -  Directly after the completion of hemodialysis, the following study drug application
           steps will occur:

             1. Site 1 Initial Compression: Apply fixed amount of Tranexamic acid and bacitracin 5%
                or 25% to gauze and compress for 3 minutes to needle site 1.

             2. Site 2 Initial Compression: Apply fixed amount of Tranexamic acid and bacitracin 5%
                or 25% to gauze and compress for 3 minutes to needle site 2.

             3. Second Compression per site: If bleeding has not stopped, repeat application with
                new gauze and same amount of ointment to each respective site and compress for 5
                minutes more at each site.

             4. Third Compression per site: If after the second application and compression the
                bleeding persists repeat both application and compression for another 5 minutes
                (total time would be 13 minutes at this step).

             5. Test Failure: If after the third application to each needle site there is still
                bleeding, the testing would be considered a failure and routine procedures should
                be utilized to stop the bleeding.

        -  Any adverse events will be collected.

      Visit 2 - Follow-Up:

      â€¢ The 1 week follow up visit will be performed to review study drug application site and to
      collect any adverse events reported by subject

      The clotting time will be compared to the clotting time at a different dialysis session in
      which no treatment will be used
