      multi-session intervention that targets men who are newly released from jail and have a
      history of drug use. Men 45 days or less post release with self reported HIV negative and
      substance use histories were randomized into either a 5-session intervention or control
      group. Study participation included four time-sensitive interviews and STD testing at three
      time periods. The interview questions included demographics, STD history and knowledge,
      sexual risk behaviors, as well as an assessment of anger management, communication, and
      condom use skills.
