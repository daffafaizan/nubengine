      with higher incidence rates in novice runners but also in recreational runners training for a
      specific event. The mechanisms behind overuse injury development are thought to be
      multifactorial and certain parameters have shown to increase injury risk in recreational
      runners. The aim of this trial is to target these specific parameters and implement training
      programs to which recreational runners will adhere for a period of 18 weeks. 150 male and
      female recreational runners, aged 18-55 years will be randomly allocated to one either the
      intervention 1 (INT-All) or Control (CON).The INT-All group will perform an exercise program
      containing strength and foamrolling exercises in addition to their regular training, twice a
      week. The CON group will continue as per usual with their training. Training data will be
      collected on a weekly basis from all groups and injury information will be submitted by the
      participants upon occurrence. The primary outcome measure is the number of sustained injuries
      in both groups. Participants will be recruited in December 2018 and the intervention will
      start in January 2019 for a period of 18 weeks, ending in May 2019. Data analyses are
      anticipated to be completed in September 2019.
