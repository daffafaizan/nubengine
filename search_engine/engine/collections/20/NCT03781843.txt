      hospital for knee pain. These 90 patients were who matched the following criteria. All
      patients had knee pain for more than 3 months.

      The ultrasound-guided genicular nerve block was performed at the site of the superior
      lateral, the superior medial, and the inferior medial genicular nerves. Color Doppler was
      used to identify the arterial structures which serve as landmarks for the corresponding
      nerves. This method was used to inject a total of 6 mL of lidocaine or 6 mL dextrose or 6 mL
      saline at 3 separate target sites: the superior lateral, superior medial, and inferior medial
      genicular nerves.

      Pain was evaluated with Analog Analogue Scale (VAS), daily living activities with Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), maximum distance walked with
      Lequesne Score, and neuropathic pain was evaluated with painDETECT inquiry form. Outcome
      measures were assessed at baseline and at 1st, 4th weeks, and 3rd months after the procedure.
