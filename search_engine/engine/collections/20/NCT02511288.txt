      patients are diagnosed at a late stage, non-eligible to a curative treatment. Due to tumoral
      genomic identification, it has been possible to classify NSCLC in molecular subtypes
      according to molecular abnormalities detection called "drivers" which can be targeted using
      an appropriate treatment. This change modifies the standard treatments from the very first
      line of treatment particularly for patients having an EGFR mutation or an ALK or ROS1
      rearrangement, with a significant benefit of progression free survival. The French NCI (INCa)
      recommends to identify genomic alterations of a genes panel including EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2,
      ALK and ROS1 as well as mutations in MET exon 14. However, all the patients who benefit from
      a targeted therapy develop resistance after a mean duration of 10-12 months after starting
      the treatment. In case of progression, the tumour genetic analysis through new biopsies,
      enables to identify these mechanisms and then to determine if the patient can benefit or not
      from a third generation molecule active on these mechanisms, and to have a better
      understanding of the disease evolution.

      The detection of these alterations is routinely performed using tissular biopsies but in 10
      to 20% of the cases, it is not possible.

      The detection of these molecular abnormalities in the plasma, called " liquid biopsy " is a
      valuable non-invasive complementary approach for these patients. It is presently used in
      routine for detecting the EGFR mutations at diagnosis as well as for searching EGFR T790M
      mutation for resistant patients.

      The liquid biopsies enable to detect circulating tumoral DNA.
