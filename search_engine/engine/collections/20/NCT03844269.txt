    
      All participants enrolled in this study will not be taking medications for attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including stimulants, for the duration of the study.
      Participants who are taking ADHD medications prior to Day 0 must have been stable off of
      medications for at least 30 days per parent report, or washout of medications at a Screening
      visit 3 - 7 days prior to Day 0.

      At Baseline / Day 0, all eligible participants will complete both resting-state
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and a perceptual discrimination task (PDT)-locked EEG.

      All participants will then play AKL-T01 for approximately 25 minutes per day, 5 days per
      week, for 4 weeks at home.

      At Follow-up / Day 28, participants will repeat both resting-state and PDT-locked EEG.
