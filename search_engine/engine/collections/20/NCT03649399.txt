      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Several pharmacologic and procedure-related measurements
      have been established for post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) prophylaxis one being the placement of
      pancreatic duct stents in patients with high risk for PEP. The beneficial role of pancreatic
      stenting in the prophylaxis of PEP was demonstrated in large meta-analyses. The used stents
      have a high potential of self dislodgment, retained stents have to be removed endoscopically
      after 5-10 days. For evaluation of spontaneous stent passage abdominal x-ray ist used and
      accordingly retained stents removed. The current study aimed to analyze whether prophylactic
      pancreatic stents can be detected by transdermal ultrasound to save the x-ray examination.
