      treatment groups. There is an equal chance of being in either group.

      Patients in Group 1 will be treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). These
      patients will receive 42 treatments, 5 days per week, over 8.5 weeks. This method has become
      the standard treatment at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

      Patients in Group 2 will also be treated with IMRT. However, these patients will only receive
      30 treatments, 5 days per week, over 6 weeks. The dose per day for Group 2 patients is higher
      than for Group 1 and has the possibility of killing more tumor cells.

      Each external beam treatment requires about 10-20 minutes. However, patients can expect to
      spend 20 - 30 minutes on the treatment table because imaging measurements of prostate
      position will be done before each treatment. The total time in the radiation department each
      treatment day will be about an hour.

      After the radiotherapy is completed, patients will have a PSA blood test every 3 months for 2
      years, then every 6 months for Years 3 - 5, then annually. They will be examined every 6
      months during the first 2 years beginning 3 months after the completion of treatment, then
      annually. A needle biopsy of the prostate will be performed if these tests suggest
      recurrence.

      This is an investigational study. 225 patients will take part in this study. This study will
      take place at M. D. Anderson and possibly some affiliated hospitals.
