      extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) depending on severity, chronicity, anatomic level of
      involvement and efficacy of anticoagulation.The frequency increases with occlusive iliac
      venous thrombosis. PTS results in significant morbidity and a staggering toll on health
      careresources . PTS is reduced by early percutaneous endovenous intervention and
      administration of new oral anticoagulants. There are conflicting results on the efficacy of
      exercise . In general, exercise has been useful in activation of the muscle pump and
      improvement of symptoms. There are no data about exercise in a swimming pool. Both walking in
      water or swimming reduce the effect of joint contact and therefore pain which is particularly
      useful in patients with arthritis or heavyweight. Furthermore with less effect of gravity,
      absorption of dependent edema would be faster. Dry skin becomes hydrated and the chlorine of
      water can exert antiseptic properties. There are no data on the role of aquatic activity in
      the reduction of measures of venous insufficiency.The purpose of this study is to assess
      whether encouragement of patients to perform aquatic activity in addition to baseline
      treatment would positively impact chronic venous insufficiency.
