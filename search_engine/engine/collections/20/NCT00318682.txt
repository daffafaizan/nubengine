      clinicians. The results of this score are currently used for clinical decisions and
      description of the evolution of the disease. FIBROSCAN would be interesting in avoiding liver
      biopsies, if it was able to predict accurately the METAVIR score obtained if a liver biopsy
      was performed. The data available on diagnostic performances of FIBROSCAN are incomplete, the
      number of patients studied and the methods selection (blindness of the results of other
      techniques) are not precise in some of them. The main objective of this study is therefore to
      evaluate the performance of FIBROSCAN in the prediction of METAVIR score > 2 (vs F0 or F1).
      An ancillary study will try to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FIBROSCAN in the global
      prediction of METAVIR score. A statistical method will be tested using the reference method
      as an ordinal polytropic variable. Half of the sample (1250 patients) will be used to
      determine the best THERSHOLD of FIBROSCAN in each of the clinical subgroups of patients, in
      order to obtain a high sensibility. The second half will be used as the validation sample,
      and the threshold will be used to estimate the sensibility, specificity and other diagnostic
      parameters of the FIBROSCAN. The secondary objectives are:

        1. to evaluate the performance of FIBROSCAN in the prediction of METAVIR score in adjacent
           classes of fibrosis (F0-F1, F1-F2, F2-F3, F3-F4), and

        2. to study the association between elastometry and fibrosis surface obtained by
           morphometry (considered as the best evaluation of global liver fibrosis).

      This technique will be applied to a restricted number of biopsies (consecutive biopsies >
      2cm).
