    
      This is an open-label, outpatient Phase II, prospective, randomized, single-center, clinical
      trial. Up to 14 patients with a diagnosis of unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      All patients will undergo leukapheresis to collect PBMC.

      All patients will receive Cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m2 dl-3 and Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 dl-3.

      Following chemotherapy to induce lymphopenia, patients will be re-infused with PDMC as
      follows:

      Autologous PBMC re-infusion (Cohort A) Autologous, CD25-depleted PBMC re-infusion (Cohort B)

      Following PBMC re-infusion, all patients will receive subcutaneous GM-CSF Infusion (50
      micrograms/24 hrs) continuously for 6 days.

      All patients will then receive 4 booster vaccinations as follows:

      Intradermal injection of autologous tumor cells in the lower abdomen to deliver a total dose
      of at least 2x107 cells administered week 3, week 5, week 9 and week 13. Subcutaneous GM-CSF
      Infusion (50 micrograms/24 hrs) adjacent to the vaccine site begins at time of vaccination
      (week 3, 5, 9 and 13) and continues for 6 days.
