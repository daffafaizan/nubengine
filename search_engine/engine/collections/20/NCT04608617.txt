    
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized observational study of acute ischemic stroke patients
      whose CTA scans are analyzed by Viz LVO to support clinicians in making stroke triage
      decisions,. The study results will be compared to a cohort from enrolling centers prior to
      Viz LVO implementation that will serve as a historical control. Data will be collected
      retrospectively from the time of presentation through 90 days post discharge.

      The study will include patients undergoing imaging for a suspected LVO acute ischemic stroke.
      The post-Viz LVO intervention group will consist of patients who either presented to or
      underwent transfer to an interventional center, from a non-interventional center, following
      image analysis by Viz LVO. Data will be collected retrospectively on consecutive patients
      meeting eligibility criteria from the date of implementation up to 5 years post
      implementation.

      The control group will consist of patients who either presented to or underwent transfer to
      an interventional center, from a non-interventional center, for evaluation prior to the
      implementation of Viz LVO. Data will be collected on consecutive patients from one day prior
      to implementation, back as far as 2 years prior to implementation
