      of positioning of the femoral and tibia components. However, an acceptable target for
      alignment remains a matter for debate. A mechanical axis within 3Â° of neutral axis has been
      used as the primary outcome measure in many clinical trials comparing computer-assisted- and
      conventional TKA. However, the evidence supporting this arbitrary value is unreliable because
      previous reports are limited by their small sample size, inadequate radiographs, short
      follow-up and lack of clarity when defining a margin of accuracy.
