      after STEMI and always correlates with a poor prognosis. However, precise and simplified
      assessment of MVD is difficult, especially in the acute phase of STEMI patients. Resent
      studies suggested that FFR could be overestimated when MVD exists. But whether the
      overestimated value of FFR caused by CMR defined MVO could reflect microcirculation function
      is still unclear.

      This study is a retrospective study using STEMI patients who underwent pharmaco-invasive
      strategy as the population. Contrast-enhanced CMR was performed 5 days after PCI as the
      reference standard.
