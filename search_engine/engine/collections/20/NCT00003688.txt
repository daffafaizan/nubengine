        -  Determine the efficacy of dactinomycin in patients with persistent or recurrent low-risk
           gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive dactinomycin IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve normal beta-human chorionic
      gonadotropin (HCG) receive 2 additional courses after attaining normal beta-HCG.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months and then monthly for 10 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-42
      months.
