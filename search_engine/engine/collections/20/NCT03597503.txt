      the efficacy and safety of SPN-810 in the improvement of impulsive aggression (IA) behaviors
      in adolescents with ADHD.

      SPN-810 will be administered in patients diagnosed with ADHD and associated feature of IA,
      who are currently being treated with an FDA-approved standard ADHD treatment and with
      persistent IA behaviors. The frequency of impulsive aggressive behaviors will be assessed as
      a primary outcome.
