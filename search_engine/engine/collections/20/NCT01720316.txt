      important risk factors for schizophrenia (SZ) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g.,
      autism spectrum disorders, mental retardation, epilepsy) with odds ratios as high as 7-30
      (Sebat et al. 2009; Malhotra et al. 2011; Heinzen et al. 2010; Weiss et al. 2008; McCarthy et
      al. 2009). We have found a de novo structural rearrangement on chromosome 9p24.1 in two
      psychotic patients. One of the genes in this region is the gene encoding glycine
      decarboxylase (GLDC), which affects brain glycine metabolism. GLDC encodes the glycine
      decarboxylase or glycine cleavage system P-protein, which is involved in degradation of
      glycine in glia cells. Carriers of the GLDC triplication would be expected to have low levels
      of brain Gly, resulting in NMDA receptor-mediated hypofunction, which has been strongly
      implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Olney & Farber, 1995; Coyle, 2006;
      Javitt, 2007).

      There is an extensive literature on the effects of NMDA enhancing agents on positive,
      negative, and depressive symptoms and on neurocognitive function (see Tsai & Lin, 2010; Lin
      et al. 2011 for reviews). Although many studies have reported positive results in at least
      one symptom domain (Heresco-Levy et al. 1996, 1999, 2004; Tsai et al. 1998, 1999, 2004, 2006;
      Javitt et al. 2001; Goff et al. 1996; Lane et al. 2008), the results of other studies have
      been negative or ambiguous (Goff et al. 1999; Evins et al. 2000; Duncan et al. 2004; van
      Berckel et al. 1999). Factors likely to contribute to this variability include: mechanism of
      action of the agent, compliance, concurrent treatment with first- vs second generation
      antipsychotic drugs, baseline glycine blood levels, presence/absence of kynurenine pathway
      metabolic abnormalities (Wonodi et al. 2010; Erhardt et al. 2007) and individual differences
      in brain glycine uptake and metabolism (Kaufman et al. 2009; Buchanan et al. 2007). Genetic
      variants that impact the synthesis and breakdown of glycine, glutamate, or other modulators
      of NMDA receptor function are also likely to have significant effects. Although glycine
      augmentation has shown variable efficacy in patients unselected for having a mutation that
      would be expected to lower brain glycine levels, the GLDC triplication in the two carriers in
      this study would be expected to result in unusually low brain glycine levels, supporting its
      therapeutic potential as an augmentation strategy.

      Thus, it is important to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of glycine augmentation in
      individuals in whom there is a high prior probability of therapeutic benefit and to
      characterize the neurobiology of this mutation in terms of brain metabolites, brain function,
      and the pharmacokinetics of glycine metabolism using well-established methods (Kaufman et al.
      2009; Prescot et al. 2006; Martinez et al. 2008; Butler et al. 2001; Jensen et al. 2009;
      Ongur et al. 2008).
