      affects up to 2,5% of the population. Most cases are seen in a complex of such
      hypersensitivity with chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and asthma.
      Despite research in finding a reliable in-vitro-test for the condition, challenge tests are
      still considered gold standard. So far oral, nasal, inhalation and intravenous routes of
      administration has been described in literature.
