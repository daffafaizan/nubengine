      domains (visuospatial / executive functioning, object naming, memory, attention, language,
      abstraction, orientation). The original English MoCA consistently showed very high
      sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing patients with mild cognitive impairment from
      healthy controls. Therefore it is an excellent tool for early recognition of cognitive
      disorders. Based on a Canadian sample, the MoCA proposes a cut-off-value of 26/30 points.
      However, there is increasing evidence of intercultural differences in terms of the best
      cut-off-score. In addition the original version only slightly corrects for possible
      influences of education - an adjustment for age- or gender-related effects is missing.
      Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the possible impacts of demographics on
      the MoCA total score and to provide normative values for a German-speaking population.
