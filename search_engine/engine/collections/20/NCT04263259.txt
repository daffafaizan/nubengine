      attentional bias modification among heavy drinking adults, the proposed study has the
      potential to unify dual process models and neurobiological models of addiction. The cognitive
      retraining will be delivered via mobile electronic devices to ensure the cost-effectiveness
      of these procedures, to allow a large amount of retraining to be delivered in an ecologically
      valid manner, and to facilitate broad dissemination of such procedures if found to be
      efficacious. Using an intensive longitudinal experimental design, subjects will be randomly
      assigned into one of 2 groups (attentional bias modification vs. attentional bias control).
      Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data will be used to assess changes in cognitive and
      behavioral measures in situ, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans before
      and after cognitive retraining will be used to examine neural changes in specific regions of
      interest (ROI).
