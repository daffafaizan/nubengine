    
      The investigators will enroll 120 medically stable adult patients who present to two
      emergency departments with a physical injury (< 24 hours ago) and a chief complaint of pain.

      The investigators will randomly assign subjects using a blocked randomization schedule to
      either: 1) a single dose of oral lorazepam (1mg), or 2) oral placebo. Emergency department
      providers and patients will be blind to treatment allocation.

      All participants will complete measures of negative affect and pain scores at baseline, and
      and 1 and 2 hours post-study drug administration. The investigators will record any
      analgesics administered in the emergency department until discharge. Patients will also
      undergo quantitative sensory testing in the Emergency Department at baseline, and after study
      drug administration. At 14-days post-discharge, the investigators will measure summary
      reports of pain, mood, and analgesic medication used.
