      this study device for this purpose.

      Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a common diagnosis after breast biopsy. Although it is
      not cancer itself, ADH can become breast cancer in some cases. As a result, surgery is
      performed to remove ADH to make sure it doesn't progress to cancer. In many cases, no cancer
      is found during the surgery.

      Previous studies have shown that breast MRI may be able to predict which areas of ADH will be
      cancer at the time of surgery. This would help prevent unnecessary surgery in some patients.

      Contrast enhanced mammography is a new type of mammogram that is already being used in
      clinical practice to help find breast cancer. Similar to breast MRI, it uses contrast
      material combined with the mammogram to highlight areas that might be breast cancer and that
      could be missed on the mammogram alone. Contrast material is a dye or other substance that
      helps show abnormal areas within the body.

      Studies have shown the contrast enhanced mammography has a similar ability to find breast
      cancer as breast MRI.

      The investigators purpose is to see whether contrast enhanced mammography can predict which
      areas of ADH will become breast cancer at the time of surgery. The investigators believe this
      will help prevent unnecessary surgery in many with women with the diagnosis of ADH.
