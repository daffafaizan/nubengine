      and effectively restore blood flow in a thrombotic neurovascular occlusion in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke. Safety will be assessed by the device-related serious event rate as it
      compares to other similar therapies. The events include but are not limited to symptomatic
      hemorrhage, vessel dissection, embolization and overall morbidity and mortality. Target
      vessels include the basilar, internal carotid and middle cerebral (M1 and M2 segments)
      arteries.
