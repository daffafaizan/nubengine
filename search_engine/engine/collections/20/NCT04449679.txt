      I. Develop and refine a real-time chemo-associated side effects monitoring support system
      (RT-CAMSS) using interactive text messaging (TXT) and mobile platforms for patients with
      gastric, esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal cancer during chemotherapy.

      II. Assess the feasibility and engagement of the RT-CAMSS in a 2-month pilot study.

      III. To gather preliminary data on the impact of RT-CAMSS on patient's quality of life and
      symptom distress.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Patients participate in an audio-recorded focus group or one-on-one interview over
      40 minutes either in-person, over the phone, or electronically. Patients receive sample text
      messages and questionnaires generated from the RT-CAMSS to generate reaction, discussion, and

      40 minutes either in-person, over the phone, or electronically. Patients receive sample text
      messages and questionnaires generated from the RT-CAMSS to generate reaction, discussion, and
      scenarios.

      PHASE II: Patients receive RT-CAMSS over 2 months or until chemotherapy is discontinued,
      whichever is earlier. RT-CAMSS consists of text messages addressing knowledge about specific
      cancer type and chemotherapy, side-effect prevention, suggestions of lifestyle behavioral
      changes and emotional support, and preparation for surgery. Patients then record their
      symptoms through answering a series of questionnaires and receive tailored feedback according
      to their answers, including a consultation with a nurse.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.
