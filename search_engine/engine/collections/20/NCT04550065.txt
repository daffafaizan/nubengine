      role has increasing importance. A family-based health promotion strategy can be instrumental
      in helping disseminate and reinforce knowledge and behaviours on family well-being and better
      equip families to protect themselves and promote family well-being amidst the pandemic.

      This study aims to use a game-based approach to enhance knowledge and behaviours on family
      well-being. We will conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The findings would
      provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach in a
      family-based context. It would also guide the direction for future health education and
      awareness trials and related projects and campaigns for health promotion efforts and to help
      improve family well-being in the Hong Kong community and elsewhere.
