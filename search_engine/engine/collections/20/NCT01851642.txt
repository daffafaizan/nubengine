      1-3% of all people diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In AAT
      deficient people diagnosed with COPD, it was originally believed the cause of the disease was
      due to a lack of supply of alpha-1 antitrypsin. However, early information gathered in our
      laboratory suggests another cause of the development of COPD and the progressing of the
      disease may be due to a malfunction in macrophages.

      CF is also a genetic disorder which affects 1/300 births among the Caucasian population. One
      of the main symptoms of CF is inflammation of the lung tissue. Lung macrophages play a major
      role in lung inflammation as well as in helping to resolve the inflammation.

      Inflammation is an important defense of the body. It is the body's response to infection
      causing germs and things that may cause irritation, as well as, a way for the body to repair
      damaged tissue.

      We suggest that the effects of AAT deficiency and CF decreases the inflammation response in
      the lungs and also restricts the ability of macrophages to correct that inflammation once it
      occurs.
