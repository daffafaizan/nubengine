      more aggressive with a typical molecular portrait. [30] This subtype seems to have a poor
      prognosis and poor treatment options because these patients are not candidate to hormonal
      therapy. Novel treatment strategies focusing upon this subtype are necessary in the future.
      [31] There are reports of clinical benefit in estrogen receptor negative patients treated
      with dose-dense chemotherapy (see background CALGB 9741 and MIG-1 study). In the CALGB 9741
      study, patients randomized to receive dose-dense regimens experienced severe toxicities
      during paclitaxel treatment leading to dose reduction in 7% and 5%respectively.

      Ixabepilone has shown consistent activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with
      all stages breast cancer. This phase II study evaluate the feasibility of dose-dense
      Ixabepilone (4 cycles) given sequentially to the combination of Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and
      Cyclophosphamide (4 cycles) all given every 14 days with the support of Filgrastim as
      neo-adjuvant treatment for ER-negative breast cancer patients.
