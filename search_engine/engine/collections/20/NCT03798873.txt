      movement, a critical factor in managing weight, cardio-metabolic health, mood, sleep,
      self-esteem and ultimately overall quality of life. Many individuals who experience weight
      gain have an abdominal or central distribution of weight which affects body mechanics leading
      to back pain, poor posture, difficulty walking with altered gait, knee, foot, ankle and leg
      pain (IT band, meralgia paresthetica) and other non-specific chronic pain. Chronic pain
      impedes mobility often incorporating depression and low motivation in an endless cycle.
      Furthermore, as individuals are losing weight, they often suffer from excess skin which also
      aggravates by chafing (arms, inner thighs), hanging down and interfering with gait.

      The Investigators will examine the effect of wearing a custom-fitted, FDA-registered, Class I
      device, compression garment (Obesinov, S.A.R.L.) by participants with a BMI â‰¥ 35 on
      day-to-day quality of life over a period of one year. Various measures of quality of life
      will be taken, including assessing the participant's level of pain, mood, self-stigma and
      comfort with the use of a compression garment. Additional assessments include impact of the
      compression garment on activity, strength, posture and movement as well as potential impact
      of the use of this garment on weight loss and change in laboratory measures of metabolic
      health.
