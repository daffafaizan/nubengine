      food. Children with CP often have difficulty in transitioning to solid food. The main food of
      45% of them was liquids and semisolids. It was reported that food/fluid textures were
      modified for 39% of children in which with poorer gross motor function tended to receive a
      greater proportion of energy from fluids in their diets and fewer chewable foods. Lopes et
      al. investigated dietary patterns of 90 children with CP aged 2-13 years by using the 24-hour
      recall method and found that 26% and 9% of children had difficulty in chewing and swallowing
      of solid foods, respectively. However, the diet of children with normal feeding skills
      includes liquid, semisolid and/or solid foods together so unable to take any solid food may
      affect sufficient food intake and nutritional status of children with CP who have chewing
      disorders. The significance of this situation is that nutritional status has effects on
      general health and quality of life of children and their families. Therefore, it is important
      to show the nutritional status of CP children with chewing disorders to increase the
      awareness of both parents and healthcare providers on solid food intake and solve the problem
      early. The objective of this study was to investigate growth, dietary intakes and feeding
      behaviours of children with CP who have chewing disorders, and to compare them with their
      healthy peers.
