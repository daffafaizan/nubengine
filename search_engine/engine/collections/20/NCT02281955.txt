      positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) received
      de-intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by a limited surgical evaluation. The primary
      endpoint of NCT01530997 was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT. Power
      computations were performed for N=40 and were based on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR
      for de-intensified chemoradiotherapy is at least 87%, the historical rate. The type 1 error
      for this calculation was 14.2%. 43 patients enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary
      endpoint. The observed pCR rate was 89% (34/38). Since the observed pCR rate was excellent in
      NCT01530997 and was in concordance with the expected rate, in the proposed study we will not
      mandate a post-CRT surgical evaluation. Instead a PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks post-CRT will be used
      to determine whether a surgical evaluation is needed.
