      both children and adults. HUS is characterized by the abnormal occurrence of diffuse
      thrombosis in the microcirculation resulting in the occurrence of ischemic events affecting
      especially the kidneys and is associated with hemolytic anemia.Its prognosis is severe, with
      a mortality of 1% in children, 10% in adults and the occurrence of renal failure in 50% of
      cases.In its typical form, HUS occurs in the aftermath of a diarrheic intestinal infection by
      bacteria which produce a Shiga toxin. In its unusual shape, which affects both children and
      adults, there are genetic abnormalities alternate way of regulating complement proteins
      explaining frequent relapses.One of the major problems encountered in the management of HUS
      is the absence of reliable marker of treatment response or relapse; conventional
      hematological markers being too insensitive to judge therapeutic efficacy or identify early
      relapse. Data from the literature suggest that the endothelial cell is a major target of this
      syndrome. Our hypothesis is that an initial micro-endothelial activation plays a critical
      role in the initiation and / or relapse of the disease through the sudden release of high
      molecular weight ultralarge von Willebrand factor (UL-vWHf) and procoagulant endothelial
      microparticles.The main objective of this study is to define a "vascular competence" profile
      in a population of patients with typical or atypical HUS; both in the acute phase and in
      remission of the disease.
