      and about the proportion of women expelling the fetus prior to the D&E and other side effects
      mean that rigorous data on possible advantages of osmotic dilators are needed. To address
      this gap in the literature, we propose to perform an RCT comparing two methods of cervical
      preparation prior to D&E:

        1. Misoprostol 400 mcg administered buccally approximately 3-6 hours prior to D&E, repeated
           once 3 hours after the first dose (a modified version of the current protocol)

        2. Laminaria tents inserted into the cervix 18 to 24 hours prior to D&E
