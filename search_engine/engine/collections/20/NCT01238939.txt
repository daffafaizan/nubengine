    
      On Day 1 of each 28 day cycle, NK012 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion,
      followed by continuous infusion of 5-FU over 46 hours. On Day 15 of each cycle, patients
      again receive 5-FU continuous infusion. Treatment is expected to continue for 6 cycles,
      unless disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity requires
      discontinuation of the drug. At the discretion of the investigator, patients who show signs
      of benefit may continue beyond 6 cycles.

      Once a MTD/RD has been determined for the combination regimen, a dose expansion cohort of
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will be treated at the determined MTD.

      (Prior to Amendment 2, patients were receiving NK012 and 5-FU and leucovorin (LV). The dosing
      regimen was changed as of Amendment 2 to NK012 and 5-FU.)
