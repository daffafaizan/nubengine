    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled
      (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has
      a real effect in a clinical study), single-ascending (increasing) dose and multiple-ascending
      dose study of JNJ-42721458 compound in healthy males. The study is divided in two parts. Part
      1 is a single-ascending dose (SAD) study which will include up to 10 panels (using ascending
      doses starting from 0.1 mg) in which a single dose of the study medication will be
      administered on Day 1. Part 2 is a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study which will include
      approximately 6 panels (using ascending doses starting from 5.0 mg) in which multiple doses
      of study medication will be administered once daily for 10 days.

      Part 2 will be initiated after completion of dosing and all relevant evaluations from Part 1.
      In each panel of Part 1 and 2, 6 participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      JNJ-42721458 and 2 participants randomly assigned to placebo. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, physical examinations, laboratory tests, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, cardiac telemetry and evaluation of injection sites which will be
      monitored throughout the study. The total study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 6-7 weeks in Part 1 and 7-8 weeks for each participant in Part 2.
