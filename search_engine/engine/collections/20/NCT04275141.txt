      using a quantitative measurement of the substrate flux. This dynamic in vivo kinetics can be
      explored using stable, nonradioactive tracers with the help of gas or liquid chromatography.

      Investigation of genetic factors associated with MS phenotype. Molecular analysis will be
      performed by next generation sequencing (exome or whole genome sequencing). In addition, a
      targeted analysis for pathogenic variants in genes implicated in homeostasis regulation will
      be done.
