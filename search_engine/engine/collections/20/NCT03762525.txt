      and six weeks after implantation of the Gore IBE device in conjunction with its dedicated
      self expandable Internal Iliac component (Sub-study A);and to quantitatively characterize the
      displacement of stents with regard to the main body and native IIA during the cardiac cycle
      on an implanted iliac branched endograft in conjunction with a non-dedicated IIA component
      (Cook IBD with Advanta V12 or Fluency) with those in conjunction with a dedicated self
      expandable Internal Iliac component (Gore IBE device). (Sub-study B) Study design: Sub-study
      A & B: Multicenter observational case studies Study population: Sub-study A: 15 prospectively
      included patients and sub-study B: 15 patients in each group that have been treated in the
      period October 2006 - July 2016.
