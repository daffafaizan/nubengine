      voltage-gated sodium channels at neuronal level. They are axonal conduction blockers impeding
      nerve impulse propagation. In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Gonyautoxin 2/3
      epimers in the treatment of patients diagnosed with chronic tensional-type headache, the
      patients were locally injected with placebo versus Gonyautoxin following a painful spots
      injection standarized protocol
