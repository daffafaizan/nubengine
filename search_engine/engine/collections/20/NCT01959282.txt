    
      This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),
      double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant
      receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to
      test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time), dose-response study (a study to
      evaluate response to different dosages of study medication) of oral tablets of JNJ-54781532
      in adult participants with moderately to severely active UC. Approximately 220 participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 5 treatment groups at Week 0 (placebo;
      JNJ-54781532 25 mg once daily; JNJ-54781532 75 mg once daily; JNJ-54781532 150 mg once daily;
      and JNJ-54781532 75 mg twice daily) to receive their randomized dosage of study medication
      through Week 8 and will be assessed for clinical response at Week 8. Participants who achieve
      clinical response at Week 8 will continue to receive their original randomized dosage of
      study medication through Week 32. Participants who do not achieve clinical response at Week 8
      will be treated as follows: participants originally randomized to placebo will receive
      JNJ-54781532 150 mg once daily through Week 16; participants originally randomized to
      JNJ-54781532 will continue to receive their original randomized dosage of JNJ-54781532
      through Week 16. Participants who were not in clinical response at Week 8 and do not achieve
      a partial Mayo score response (a decrease from baseline in the partial Mayo score by â‰¥3
      points) at Week 16 will be discontinued from study medication; and those who achieve a
      partial Mayo score response at Week 16 can continue receiving JNJ 54781532 through Week 32.
      Participants will be evaluated for safety (adverse events) up to Week 36 (ie, 4 weeks after
      the last dose of study medication). The maximum study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 44 weeks (including maximum screening period).
