    
      This study will be conducted at 1 study center in Hong Kong. Approximately 36 healthy Chinese
      male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 inclusive, will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive a single SC administration of benralizumab: Treatment 1, Treatment 2 and Treatment 3
      (12 subjects per group). Each subject will participate in only 1 treatment group.
      Approximately 8-12 evaluable subjects in each group that met specific non-compartmental
      analysis (NCA) criteria are required to ensure eligible AUC0-âˆž calculation. The total length
      of the study for each subject is up to 117 days (28 days of screening and 85+/- 4 days of
      further study visits).
