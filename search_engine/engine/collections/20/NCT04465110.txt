      obese and overweight males (N=10) are reduced following chronic GSE supplementation during
      exercise. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (Q), total vascular
      conductance (TVC), and AoS to two submaximal cycling exercises (40% and 60% VO2peak) were
      compared 7 days after ingestion of GSE or placebo (PL) within an one week washout period.
      Compared with PL, GSE supplementation significantly decreased MAP at rest, 40%, and 60%
      workloads. AoS was significantly reduced at rest. Q tended to be decreased, but there was no
      significant difference. GSE had no effect on HR, TVC, and SV. Our study indicates that
      chronic supplementation with GSE reduces arterial pressure at rest and during exercise
      primarily via the combined reduction of AoS and Q. Thus, GSE can be a dietary supplement to
      treat augmented blood pressure responses in obese and overweight males at rest and during
      exercise.
