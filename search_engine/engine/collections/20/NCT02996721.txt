      widespread insufficiency both in the United States and worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have
      associated low 25[OH] Vit D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular
      outcomes. However, randomized trials are needed to establish the relevance of 25[OH] Vit D
      status to cardiovascular health. While a few randomized trials have evaluated vitamin D
      supplementation, none have "treated to target" (i.e., individual dosing so that adequate
      25[OH] Vit D levels are obtained), but have rather given "blanket" doses regardless of 25[OH]
      Vit D level.
