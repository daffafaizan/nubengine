      reaching The making decision to treat ESRD with renal replacement therapy is a complex
      process and needs to be shared between patients, family, physician and nephrologist.

      Systematic Information delivery about several treatments of ESRD is recommended for patients
      and his family (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, Kidney Transplantation and Conservative
      treatment). Some studies on the preference of patients for renal replacement therapy reported
      a choice for PD about 50% while the registers report a low diffusion of PD (around 10%).
      Since 2009 we propose a systematic information about the different therapeutic options for
      ESRD and identified some clinical characteristics associated to patient's preference. However
      we want to know if psychological or physical phenotype is associated to patient's preference.

      The objective of the study is to highlight the relationship between psychological and
      physical profiles and patient's preference to better understand the patient's treatment
      preference and improve the information provided.
