      control), and at specific interim time points during the course of the intervention.
      Assessments include measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and body
      composition (including total body bone mineral content) determined by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA). There is also collection of blood and muscle and adipose tissue
      biospecimens, monitoring of free-living PA level using wearable devices, and completion of
      participant reported outcomes and health status by interview and/or questionnaire. An
      additional group of highly active (HA) individuals currently active in either EE (HAEE) or RE
      (HARE) are recruited for a single acute exercise testing session of either endurance or
      resistance exercise and other study assessments. MoTrPAC participants are recruited, trained,
      and assessed via six adult Clinical Centers (CC), involving 10 clinical sites. As part of the
      MoTrPAC functions, participant data and biological samples are transferred from the clinical
      sites to the Consortium Coordinating Center (CCC) Data Management, Analysis and Quality
      Control Center (DMAQC)and to the Biological Sample Repository, and later analyzed by the
      Consortium Chemical Analysis Sites (CAS) and the Bioinformatics Center (BIC).

      Biological samples collected in this project undergo molecular phenotyping, including
      metabolomic, lipidomic, proteomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses. These
      assays are done at the MoTrPAC CAS.

      Overall coordination of the study and analyses occurs at 4 institutions which make up the CCC
      and the BIC.
