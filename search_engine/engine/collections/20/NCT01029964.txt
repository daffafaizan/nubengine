      the first three years of behavioral treatment in relation to age at start of treatment. The
      secondary aim was to evaluate specific factors of importance (gender, heredity, parental
      weight status, socioeconomic factors and age at obesity onset) for treatment effects. The
      third aim was to investigate factors correlated to drop out.

      This is a longitudinal study of all patients referred to National Childhood Obesity Center
      between January 1997 and December 2004. Only patients with behavioral treatment were
      included. Patients with other treatments (VLCD/LCD, drugs and surgery) and other diagnoses
      (syndromes, craniopharyngioma, Mb Down, myelomeningocele, various types of mental and
      psychological disorders) and children <6 and >17 year at inclusion were excluded. The
      remaining children were divided into three age groups of obese children depending of age at
      onset of obesity treatment (6-9, 10-13 and 14-16year). All patient data were registered in
      the BORIS nationwide childhood obesity database.
