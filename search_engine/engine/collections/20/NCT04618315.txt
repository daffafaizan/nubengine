      chronic health problem in ~40% of those over the age of 60 years. Only 20% of these
      individuals purchase and use hearing aids. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017 is
      designed to increase affordability and accessibility, and thereby adoption, of hearing aids.
      While this legislation directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to create and
      administer this new channel of hearing aid provision by 2020, best practices related to
      hearing aid provision without the involvement of a professional, licensed provider have not
      been explored and established. Patients do not have the evidence they need to decide between
      modes of acquiring hearing aids. The current proposal addresses the specific knowledge gap of
      efficacious direct-to-consumer hearing aid delivery models. Two methods of patient-driven
      methods of selecting and fitting hearing aids will be compared against audiology-based best
      practice fitting. Individuals who perceive mild or moderate hearing difficulty will be
      randomly assigned to one of three fitting arms. Satisfaction and benefit from hearing aids
      will be assessed at six weeks and six months after initial fit.
