      induction in CC-resistant women with PCOS .

      Because it is an insulin sensitizer, NAC was proposed as an adjuvant to clomiphene citrate
      for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are resistant to
      clomiphene citrate. Encouraging results in those patients stimulated us to investigate
      whether adding NAC to the standard treatment with CC results in a higher ovulation rate,
      higher pregnancy rate, and less CC resistance in women with newly diagnosed polycystic ovary
      syndrome using a randomized, double-blind, controlled study.
