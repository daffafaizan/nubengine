      related to the disease. The management of painful symptoms is difficult and currently, there
      is no commonly admitted guidelines.

      Several studies have shown the efficacy of Erickson hypnosis to reduce the perception of
      chronic pain in different conditions. This efficacy has never been tested in Parkinson's
      disease.

      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Erickson hypnosis protocol, compared
      to usual care, for the management of Parkinson's disease-related chronic pain.

      The study team assume that Erickson hypnosis will be more efficient than usual care to reduce
      perceived chronic pain. They also assume that regular practice of autohypnosis will
      contribute to long-term efficacy.
