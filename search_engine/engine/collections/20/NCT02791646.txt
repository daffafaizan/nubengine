      guidelines recommend the implementation of behavioral cancer pain interventions into patient
      care. Yet, implementation remains low. Evidence on patient dose-response (i.e., number of
      sessions, skills), intervention adaption based on initial response, and understanding
      personal characteristics related to differing dose-response can improve implementation by
      optimizing behavioral intervention delivery.

      This trial is a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), that will examine
      response to differing doses of a behavioral cancer pain intervention (Pain Coping Skills
      Training [PCST]) and subsequent response-based adjustments to doses. Cancer patients with
      pain (N=327) will initially be randomized to receive either PCST-Full or PCST-Brief.
      Participants who do not respond (<30% pain reduction) to their initially assigned
      intervention will be re-randomized to receive either maintenance (i.e., booster sessions
      focused on problem solving and skills reinforcement) or an increased level of intervention
      (i.e., additional sessions and skills). Participants who respond (> 30% pain reduction) to
      their initially assigned intervention will be re-randomized to either a maintenance dose or
      no further treatment. Intervention responses will be (% reduction in pain) will be compared
      across conditions using a standard two-sided, two-sample t-test. Techniques typically used
      for SMART studies will be used to compare intervention dosage sequences across PCTS that
      adjusts to initial dosage based on patient responses. The risk and safety issues in this
      trial are low and limited to those common to a psychosocial intervention (e.g., loss of
      confidentiality).
