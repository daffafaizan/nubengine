      patients over the age of 50. While both hereditary and environmental factors appear to play a
      role in the pathogenesis of the disease, no common genetic mutations have been identified.
      This pilot study is intended to test the feasibility of evaluating the patterns of expression
      of genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of AMD. The genes of interest are involved
      in the process of wound repair, cell injury and cell death. We hope to access the expression
      of these genes, but in tissues taken from non-ocular sites, in patients with AMD and in
      patients without AMD.

      Biopsied skin fibroblasts and circulating monocytes from 62 patients will be obtained; 14
      without AMD, 14 with at least one large (greater than 125 microns) druse, with geographic
      atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization from AMD, 10 with geographic atrophy only, and 20
      with choroidal neovascularization and/or disciform scar. The gene expression patterns from
      these tissues will be examined through various techniques including polymerase chain
      reaction, Northern blot analysis, differential display and microarray technology. The genetic
      expression patterns in patients with AMD will then be compared to age-matched control
      subjects. The primary outcome will be to determine the feasibility of obtaining skin and
      monocyte samples from patients with AMD, extracting RNA from these samples, and studying gene
      expression patterns. This study will provide investigators with information needed to develop
      subsequent studies of potential diagnostic tests.
