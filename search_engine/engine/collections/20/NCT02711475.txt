    
      Any diminutive polyps encountered during a colonoscopy will be examined with the use of
      electronic filters and magnification and assigned by the endoscopist to a adenoma/non adenoma
      category, resected and retrieved: a follow up surveillance period will be assigned on the
      basis of the endoscopic appearance of the polyps.

      Each polyp will then be sent separately to Pathology for the histologic evaluation, and a
      surveillance interval period will be determined accordingly.
