      including, obstetrical, gynecological, orthopedic, abdominal, and oral surgery. The short
      elimination half-life of IR tramadol necessitates every 4-6 hour dosing to maintain optimum
      levels of analgesia in chronic pain. The study medication in this study is a once-daily,
      extended release (ER) tramadol formulation. This is a 12-week multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized, dose-ranging, placebo and positive-controlled, parallel-group study. For the
      purpose of this study, celecoxib serves as a positive control to validate the sensitivity of
      the model. Patients with OA functional Class I-III of the knee or hip, with moderate to
      severe pain are eligible for participation, if appropriate criteria are met. During a 2-7 day
      washout period, the use of all analgesic medications will be discontinued. Eligible patients
      experiencing moderate to severe pain (>= 40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale) in the index
      joint to be evaluated and who meet all other study criteria will enter the double-blind
      titration period. During this period, patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment
      with tramadol HCl ER 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, celecoxib 200 mg or placebo, once daily. During
      the titration period (Days 1-9) all patients will be contacted by phone every few days to
      ensure they do not experience unmanageable pain or unacceptable side effects. Efficacy and
      safety evaluations will be collected at study visits occurring at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12
      or at the time of early termination. Study medication will be discontinued at Week 12 and
      patients will return after 1 week for a post-treatment visit (Week 13).
