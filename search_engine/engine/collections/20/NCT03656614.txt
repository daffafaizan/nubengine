    
      Sugammadex is a modified Î³-cyclodextrin compound that reverses the neuromuscular blockade
      produced by steroidal nondepolarizing muscle relaxants such as rocuronium,vecuronium and
      pipecuronium by encapsulating them, making them unavailable to interact with the nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.However, residual neuromuscular blocks
      between reappearance of T4 and train-of-four ratio (TOFR)=0.5 are more frequent in clinical
      practice compared with profound or deep blocks and have not been investigated for sugammadex
      previously.

      Unlike neostigmine, sugammadex is efficacious in reversing profound (no responses to either
      train-of-four (TOF) or posttetanic count stimulation) or deep (posttetanic count of 1 or 2)
      neuromuscular block (NMB) in doses of 16 and 4 mg/kg, respectively. However, shallow
      neuromuscular blocks are more frequent in clinical practice compared with profound or deep
      blocks and have not been investigated for sugammadex previously.
