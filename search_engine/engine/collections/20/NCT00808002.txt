      maintenance of viral persistence despite continuous highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART). This is likely to represent the major barrier to virus eradication in patients on
      successful combination antiretroviral therapy.

      The majority of the viruses in the latent reservoir use CCR5 receptor during entry.

      More recently, clear evidences for decay of this HIV-1 reservoir in patients who initiated
      antiretroviral therapy early in infection have been demonstrated. The treatment of acute
      infection may set the stage for subsequent attempts at eradication. To achieve this, more
      potent antiretroviral therapy and/or more potent antilatency therapies may be needed.

      In contrast to previous antiretroviral drugs, maraviroc does not need to cross the cell
      membrane, nor does not require intracellular processing in order to exert its activity. In
      addition, there is no cross-resistance between entry inhibitors and agents that act on
      intracellular targets.

      Maraviroc has demonstrated potent antiviral activity against all CCR5-tropic HIV-1 viruses
      tested. Maraviroc could thus fulfil the requirements for an optimal candidate for treatment
      intensification in HIV-1 infected patients with a recent HIV-1 infection.
