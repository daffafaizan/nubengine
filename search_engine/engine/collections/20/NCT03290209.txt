      gastric cancer. However, some studies show that age or comorbidities is the relevant
      predictor of postoperative complications, conditioning the safety of the surgical procedure
      itself, thus affect the survial. Even with the advances in surgical techniques and care, age
      still is a significant risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, elderly
      patients with gastric cancer could receive minimally invasive surgery with reduced nodal
      dissection, i.e., D1 lymphadenectomy, in order to prevent postoperative complications.
      Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive operation and is proved to be an acceptable
      alternative to open surgery. At present, there is no RCTs to confirm the safety and
      effectiveness of laparoscopic D1 lymphadenectomy for elderly patients with advanced gastric
      adenocarcinoma. This study is to compare the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic D1 versus D2
      lymphadenectomy for elderly patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma（cT2-4a, N-/+, M0）to
      evaluate the safety of laparoscopic D1 lymphadenectomy, and to verify its results in terms of
      survival in elderly patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.
