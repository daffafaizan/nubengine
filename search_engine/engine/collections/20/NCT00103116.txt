        -  Determine the immunologic effects of adjuvant vaccine therapy comprising autologous
           dendritic cells loaded with allogeneic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in
           patients with unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB, or resected stage I-IIIB NSCLC.

        -  Determine the potential clinical efficacy of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to type of prior
      primary therapy (surgical vs nonsurgical).

      Patients undergo leukapheresis over 3-4 hours to harvest mononuclear cells for the production
      of dendritic cells (DC). DC are then pulsed with allogeneic non-small cell lung cancer cells
      to produce an autologous dendritic cell vaccine. Patients receive vaccine intradermally once
      a month for 2 months in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 4 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then periodically
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
