      with Sunitinib (Cases) and compare them to the characteristics of mRCC patients non on CR
      (controls) in order to identify factors associated with the occurrence of complete remission.

      The results obtained on the sample must be representative of the population targeted by the
      study. The most appropriate method to obtain a representative sample is probability sampling.

      A sample size of N = 40 (cases) and N = 80 (Controls) will provide a power of 80% in the
      detection of a frequency difference between cases and controls corresponding to an OR of 0.24
      for a parameter frequency 10% in control arm and an OR of 0.30 for a parameter frequency of
      around 30% in control arm. The significance level was set at bilateral 5%.

      The data will be analyzed using SAS software (version 9.1 - SAS Institute, North Carolina,
      United States).
