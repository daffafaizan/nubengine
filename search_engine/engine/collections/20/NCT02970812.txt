      to investigate the efficacy of electrical muscle simulation (EMS) for treatment of waist
      circumference (WC) reduction in abdominal obese adults.

      Methods: 60 patients with abdominal obese, man with WC > 90 cm and woman with WC > 80 cm,
      received EMS as experimental group (EG) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
      as control group (CG) 5 times a week for 12 weeks.
