      different targeted digital outreach platforms to engage women at risk for urinary
      incontinence in the Pacific Northwest. Counties in Oregon, Washington, Idaho will be
      randomized to receive advertisements for the American Urogynecologic Society's patient
      education website (domain VoicesForPFD.org) via either Google or Facebook. The investigators
      will use advertising campaigns developed specifically for this purpose. Through website
      analytics measuring advertisement clicks and census population data, the investigators will
      estimate utilization rates of the website for each county among the target population of
      middle-aged women to determine if one platform is more effective than the other for this
      topic and population.
