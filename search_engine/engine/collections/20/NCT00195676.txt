      had participated in a prior psoriasis adalimumab study. Study M03-658 consisted of three
      sequential treatment periods. The first period was Period O, in which participants received
      open-label treatment with adalimumab (40 mg every other week or 40 mg every week) for a
      minimum of 104 weeks and a maximum of 252 weeks. Period O was the only period of the study
      until May 2008, when the subsequent periods were added via amendment to the protocol. At that
      time, participants who had achieved satisfactory therapeutic response (a Physician's Global
      Assessment [PGA] of 0, 1, or 2 [clear, minimal, or mild]) were given the opportunity to
      discontinue from the study or to continue and participate in the subsequent two periods. The
      second period was Period W, a maximum of 52 weeks, in which participants with a PGA of 2
      (mild) or less were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment (i.e., participants received no
      treatment) until relapse of their psoriasis occurred (defined as a PGA of 3 [moderate] or
      worse). The third period was Period R, a 16-week period in which participants were retreated
      with open-label adalimumab (80 mg initial dose followed by 40 mg every other week). Period O
      was designed to evaluate the first objective regarding long-term efficacy and safety of
      adalimumab treatment, and Period R was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab
      retreatment following relapse. Specific subsets of the study population that were identified
      as the populations of interest were the modified intent-to-treat populations for Period W and
      Period R, and these are described further in the outcome measures.
