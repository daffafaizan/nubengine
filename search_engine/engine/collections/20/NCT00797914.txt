      and withdraw the instrument through a series of fixed and stationary loops. To develop and
      maintain the skills necessary to perform colonoscopy safely and effectively requires
      extensive training and ongoing education. Quantification of tactile information provides the
      opportunity to understand the "feel" used by the endoscopist to perform colonoscopy. The
      identification of force application patterns has the potential to enhance training and
      improve performance. CFM™ is a handheld device that uses load cells to transform applied
      force to electric signals and to transmit wirelessly the signal to a computer for storage and
      visual display. The device is designed so that the endoscopist maintains a conventional hand
      position and uses an electronically controlled grip and release mechanism to fix the position
      on the instrument. Several expert endoscopists from multiple institutions will use the CFM™
      to perform colonoscopy. The data will be recorded and analyzed for differences by patient
      characteristics(e.g. gender, age, pain sensation, surgical history) and by endoscopist.
