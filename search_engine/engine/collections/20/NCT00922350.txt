      obstructive lung diseases with asthma, reduces the turbulence of airflow despite high rates,
      due to its low density.

      Although the first report of the use of heliox in the treatment of asthma dating to 1935, few
      controlled studies are available clarify the impact of the use of heliox in hospital
      admission of patients with acute asthma attacks refractory to standard treatment.

      The severe airflow obstruction, observed in cases of acute asthma, also leads to lung
      hyperinflation that favors the increase of respiratory work by increasing the load for the
      inspiratory muscles by placing them at a mechanical disadvantage.

      Various body positions were studied relating them to muscle activity with mechanical
      disadvantage. These studies suggest that the influence posture acts mainly in the position of
      the diaphragm, thus, increasing the stress related to other muscles such as the abdominals
      and the effect of gravity on these.

      This study aims to: assess the efficiency of the positioning body associated with
      nebulization with bronchodilators carried by heliox during acute severe asthma in adults,
      using as the primary outcomes FEV1, FVC and PEF and secondary outcomes as the Borg scale,
      inspiratory capacity, RR, HR and SpO2.
