    
      A total of seven cohorts of healthy volunteers are planned with doses of CDX-301 (rhuFlt3L)
      ranging between 1 and 75 Î¼g/kg and dosing durations between 5 and 10 days.

      Volunteers will be admitted to an inpatient unit during the Treatment Period. Blood samples
      will be collected periodically to assess the effect of CDX-301. Volunteers will be followed
      for safety for 28 days following the last dose. Any volunteer who develops anti-CDX-301
      antibodies will be followed monthly until the antibody response is below the limit of
      detection. In general, the total duration of the study will be between approximately 33-38
      days.
