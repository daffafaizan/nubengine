      skin surface and reports on larger tissue volumes in muscle and brain. The near-infrared
      diffuse optical spectroscopy instrument generate harmless amounts of low-level non-ionizing
      near-infrared ligh can measure the tissue absorption and scattering properties at depths of 1
      cm or more below the skin surface include larger tissue volumes in muscle and brain. The
      absorption properties of tissue provide and can determine absolute concentrations of
      deoxygenated hemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and water, as well as the total hemoglobin
      saturation.
