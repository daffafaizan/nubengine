      and whole vestibular nerve function, as well as the ascending and descending vestibular
      pathways in the brainstem at once.

      In about 30 healthy participants and 20 patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis,
      unilateral simultaneous cVEMP and oVEMP recordings in each side during monaural stimulation
      (air-conducted sound, 500Hz tone bursts, 100 nHL), and bilateral simultaneous recordings of
      each VEMP while binaural stimulation were compared to the conventional method of sequential
      recording each VEMPs on each side at a time.
