      population will include 60 patients admitted with a first time ST elevation anterior STEMI as
      diagnosed by the following criteria: a) Significant chest discomfort and /or shortness of
      breath; b) ST segment elevation (1.5 mV total) in two or more adjacent anterior precordial
      leads; c) Successful reperfusion therapy (>TIMI grade 2 flow) either with thrombolytics or
      PTCA within 24 hours of onset of symptoms as documented by coronary angiography; and d) No
      previous history of an anterior AMI or previous ECG suggesting an old anterior AMI.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two doses of CD-NP (5 ng/kg/min and 10 ng/kg/min) or
      placebo continuous infusion for up to 72 hours in a 1:1:1 manner. All patients will receive
      other standard medical therapies as determined appropriate by the physician and in accordance
      to the ACC/AHA guidelines
