      computed tomography (CT), and clinical morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
      joint structures. These techniques can only detect later-stage, macroscopic joint structural
      abnormalities that are irreversible and not amenable to early therapy. This study aims to
      develop highly accelerated imaging sequences for ex-vivo knee OA applications on a standard
      clinical 3T scanner using novel CS and parallel imaging (PI) strategies.
