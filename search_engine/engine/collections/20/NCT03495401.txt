    
      This is a parallel, quadruple-blind, randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of
      double fortification (iron and zinc) in synbiotic milk (containing 7 billion CFU L.plantarum
      Dad13 and 4 g fructooligosaccharides) on the gut microbiota composition, body height and
      weight, blood zinc and hemoglobin level, and cognitive level in under 5 years stunted
      children subjects. The duration of the study is 4 months, including a 2-week pre test and
      informed consent before randomization of subjects into treatment or control group, a 12-week
      intervention period, and a 2-week post test after the end of intervention. During the
      intervention period, subjects will be instructed to take 100 ml of fortified synbiotic milk
      or non-fortified synbiotic milk per day. They will also be asked to document consumed milk,
      any unusual symptoms or side effects of treatment. Diet will be monitored via 24-h dietary
      recalls and SQ-FFQ before and after treatment respectively. Changes in the gut microbiota
      composition will be determined by measuring bacterial population levels (Bifidobacteria,
      Lactobacillus, Enterobacteria, Prevotella, and Bacteroides) in stool sampled collected at
      baseline and 12 weeks by qPCR. Metabolic markers (calprotectin, hemoglobin, and zinc level)
      will be measured at baseline and 12-weeks in serum and plasma using biochemical and
      immuno-assay. Changes in the cognitive level, height for age Z-score collected at baseline
      and 12 weeks using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition .
