    
      This study is a randomized controlled study. Eligible patients going through a CT-examination
      of the heart's coronary arteries, Coronary CT Angiogram (CCTA) will after an informed consent
      be randomized into two groups, either the intervention group or standard care.

      The intervention consists of extended information regarding the benefits of doing a CCTA,
      thereby emphasising the specificity and accuracy of the CCTA's ability to exclude coronary
      disease. After this, there will be given an opportunity of a visual go-through and
      explanation of CT-images. Then they will be informed of the examination result that shows
      normal coronary arteries.

      Follow up is planned after one month, six months and twelve months, where the participants
      receive the same questionnaire as at baseline to fill out and return. The questionnaire
      consists of Seattle Angina Questionnaire and RAND-12, in addition to social demographic and
      clinical data, such as sex, height, weight and current medication.
