    
      Subjects on regular therapy with anti-epileptic medications who have evidence from clinical
      monitoring that current therapy is insufficient, following failure of at least two AEDs for
      at least during the last 2 months will be enrolled into this study. Upon subjects/parents
      have consented to participation in the study and after baseline examinations, subjects will
      continue with current antiepileptic treatment, as clinically needed, for another 28 days at
      the same dose as before entering the study; drug accountability will be performed for
      verification of treatment compliance, and diary will be used to record data on epileptic
      seizures. After that, participating patients will be randomly assigned to MGCND00EP1 or
      placebo and take it as add on to previous treatment for 6 weeks as titration period and 6
      weeks at maintenance dose, and then titrated down during next two weeks. Patients will
      continue previous anti- epileptic treatment throughout all the periods of the study.
