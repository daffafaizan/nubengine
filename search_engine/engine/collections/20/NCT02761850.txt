      patients with congenital cataract (CC), the developmental profile of refraction is
      complicated due to the potential influences of diverse clinical manifestations and various
      treatments, and has not yet been fully characterized.

      The investigator described the developmental profile of refraction change in a large cohort
      of Chinese CC patients. The decisive factors to the range of myopic shift in unilateral CC
      appeared to be different from that in bilateral CC, indicating dramatic differences in the
      etiopathogenesis and refractive prognosis between bilateral and unilateral CC. The refraction
      data from CC patients provided in the study are of clinical significance to the guidelines
      for CC treatment, especially for IOL calculation concerning the laterality of CC.
