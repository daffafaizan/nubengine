      population in Taiwan having erectile dysfunction (ED) trouble is as high as 5 to 10 percent.
      At the same time, statistics from the Taiwan Sexual Dysfunction Counseling Training Committee
      show that as many as 50 percent of men between 40 and 70 years old have erectile dysfunction.
      Erectile dysfunction is the most common sexual dysfunction in men and is believed to be
      related to nerve or blood vessel damage, and often significantly affects the patients'
      quality of life.

      PRP is the abbreviation of "platelet-rich plasma". It can release growth factors and
      cytokines in the body to further promote tissue repair. The results of pre-clinical and
      clinical trials show that PRP can promote the repair of cavernous tissue, protect erection
      function of nerve, and stimulate the regeneration of nerve.

      Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) is a non-invasive treatment. Under
      this treatment, it will help body producing angiogenesis-related proteins, stimulating the
      formation of small blood vessels, generating new blood vessels at the site to be treated, and
      increasing the perfusion flow of local tissues. Li-ESWT has been clinically shown to have a
      significant effect on erectile dysfunction.

      The purpose of this clinical study is mainly to use platelet-rich plasma combined with
      low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy to treat patients with erectile dysfunction
      and observe the improvement results.
