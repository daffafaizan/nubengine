      (ischemia) can cause damage to the vasculature via injury and tissue death resulting in
      endothelial dysfunction. This ischemia-reperfusion (blood flow occlusion and resupply)
      triggered injury can be reduced or prevented by preceding brief periods of ischemia called
      preconditioning. Properly-performed preconditioning can exert a powerful protection against a
      subsequent sustained period of ischemia in a variety of organs in the body including the
      heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Preconditioning protocol involves repeated brief
      inflation and deflation of a blood pressure cuff. In many of human cardiovascular research
      studies, it is common to measure endothelial function and ambulatory (24-hour) blood
      pressure. The ambulatory blood pressure device takes repeated blood pressure readings every
      15-30 minutes during the daytime and 30-60 minutes at night. It is possible that repeated
      bouts of inflation/deflation of the blood pressure cuff could induce preconditioning effects
      and influence endothelial function. Therefore, in the proposed study we aim to address this
      hypothesis.
