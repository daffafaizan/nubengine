    
      Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections. Antibiotic
      resistance, such as seen with new community-acquired methicillin-resistant strains, presents
      a major challenge in treating and preventing these infections. Therefore, a preventative
      vaccine is considered a potentially better approach.

      This study assesses the safety and immunogenicity of monovalent and bivalent S. aureus
      vaccine components. Healthy adult subjects will be randomized to receive 1 dose of monovalent
      or bivalent toxoid vaccine, or placebo in a dose escalation schedule.

      Antigen-specific antibody will be measured by ELISA in sera collected for three months after
      injection. Safety data will be collected as 7 day reactogenicity diaries after each
      injection, adverse events and Staphylococcus aureus and skin and soft tissue infections will
      be collected through Day 84, and serious adverse events and chronic illnesses will be
      collected for the full 6 month study period.

      To evaluate the possible utility of booster doses, the cohort receiving the highest dose of
      bivalent antigen will have a 2nd dose administered at Day 84, with a new 7-day reactogenicity
      diary and sera collected after the 2nd dose. All subjects will be followed up with a 6 month
      phone call after vaccination or booster.

      The total subject observation period will be for 24 weeks from Day 0, plus 12 additional
      weeks for the cohorts that receive a 2nd dose. With a recruitment period of 4 months, the
      study duration is expected to be approximately 13 months.
