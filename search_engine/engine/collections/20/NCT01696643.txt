      with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 1,400 participants
      (approximately 700 participants per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at
      approximately 225 study centers to receive either 0.25 milligrams (mg) CB-5945 twice daily
      (BID) or a matching placebo BID for the 52-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a
      4-week follow-up period. All randomized participants will be evaluated for safety,
      tolerability, and quality of life from the first dose of study drug through Week 56.
