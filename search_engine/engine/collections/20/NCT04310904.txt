      assessment of CO and cardiac Doppler technique. Patients hospitalized in ICU will be included
      if they need a trans esophageal echocardiographic evaluation and a research of intra cardiac
      shunt (using a saline contrast test). Patients with Swan Ganz catheter will be included as
      well. Cardiac output will be measured using cardiac Doppler. Simultaneously, 4.5 ml of saline
      with 0.5 ml of air will be agitated to have a contrast solution. This solution will be
      injected as usual and echocardiographic imaging will be recorded. These imaging will be
      analyzed off-line and CO will be calculated with an algorithm previously developed and
      compared with the reference method. In case of swan ganz catheter, the cardiac output will be
      also measured using the thermodilution technique.
