      combinations are frequently used to address these factors and to improve efficacy in the
      treatment of acne. The current study proposes to compare a fixed-dose (once-daily)
      combination gel product containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO)and clindamycin against a fixed-dose
      (once-daily) combination gel product containing BPO and adapalene for the treatment of facial
      acne vulgaris.
