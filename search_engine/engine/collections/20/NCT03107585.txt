      of 35:

        -  Group 1 (GP1): bilateral echo-guided intermediate cervical plexus bloc (ICB) by 10 ml of
           isobaric Bupivacaine (0.25%).

        -  Group 2 (GP2): control.

      Ten minutes after ICB, general anesthesia was realised. Total dose of Remifentanil is
      calculated upon awakening, the postoperative pain is determined by visual analog scale from 0
      to 10 (VAS) statements to H0, H2, H4, H6, H12 and H24. Whenever VAS is greater than or equal
      to 4, a morphine titration was administered.

      Total dose consumption, side effects and satisfaction are noted at the end of protocol.
