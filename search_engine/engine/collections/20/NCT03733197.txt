      City-Provo-Orem) of Utah. African American men's CRC screening rates in UT are substantially
      lower than in other states, and the Salt Lake City region has the largest population of
      African-Americans in the state.10,50 Approach. The investigator propose a multi-stage mixed
      methods study (Figure 1), beginning with an exploratory sequential design validating the
      items for subsequent use in a pilot mixed methods intervention to accomplish aims. For Aim 1
      (Years 1-2), the investigator will collect and analyze QUALitative data from 2 sources -
      focus groups and cognitive interviews - to validate and test a culture-specific scale of
      masculinity barriers to care among African-American men (hereafter called the Masculinity
      Barriers to Care Scale, MBCS). Next, the investigator will administer the MBCS as an online
      QUANTtitative survey with the target population to evaluate the association between scale
      scores and CRC screening uptake. For Aim 2 (Years 3-5), the investigator will consider
      existing evidence-based approaches (e.g., motivation interviewing), the integrated results
      (QUAL + QUANT) from Aim 1 regarding masculinity barriers to care, and community input to
      design a novel, culturespecific, behavioral intervention - one aimed at increasing CRC
      screening uptake (fecal immunochemical test; FIT) among African-American men and feasible for
      delivery in barber shops. The investigator will pilot test the peer intervention in a two-arm
      cluster randomized intervention (6 barbershops, randomized by site) to account for
      differences in barbershop culture and reduce contamination. The primary outcomes for the
      pilot are recruitment, sample size estimation, preliminary efficacy, and acceptability. The
      investigator will also conduct post-intervention interviews with participants from both arms
      to evaluate acceptability (i.e., why and how each arm was or was not successful).
