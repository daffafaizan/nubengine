    
      Complete denture wearers had their existing mandibular dentures relined with a soft
      silicone-based denture liner (Mucopren Soft; Group 1; n=22) or a hard acrylic resin based
      denture liner (Kooliner; Group 2; control n=22) with chairside procedures. The OHIP EDENT
      (Oral Health Impact profile) questionnaire was given to patients prior to reline procedures
      (baseline-T0) and 90 days (T90) post relining. Three possible answers and scores were
      proposed for each question: never (0), sometimes (1) and almost always (2). Results were
      analyzed by means of the generalized linear model (pâ‰¤0.05) considering two factors: time (T0
      and T90) and group (hard and soft denture liners).
