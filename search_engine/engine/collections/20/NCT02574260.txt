    
      This was an extension study to the multicenter, open-label, phase 2 Study 002/03
      (NCT00289016). Participants who had received the maximum 24 treatments under Study 002/03 and
      met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible to enroll.

      Participants continued to receive talimogene laherparepvec until discontinuation criteria
      were met. The discontinuation criteria were complete response, clinically significant
      progressive disease that rendered further dosing futile, receipt of 24 treatments or 12
      months on treatment (whichever was longer), occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity, death,
      investigator determination that other treatment was warranted, or another criterion for
      withdrawal from treatment (participant request, noncompliance with study procedures, or
      sponsor request).
