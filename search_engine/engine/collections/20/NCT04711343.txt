      to determine the serum concentration of Secukinumab, thus to evaluate the similarity of the
      pharmacokinetics of the three study drugs.

      The investigator will perform safety evaluation for vital signs, physical examinations,
      injection site reaction, ECG, clinical laboratory tests and adverse events throughout the
      study. Immunogenicity evaluation (ADA, ADA titration and NAb) will also be evaluated.
