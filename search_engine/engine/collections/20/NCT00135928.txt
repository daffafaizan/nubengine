      (STEMI) seems to improve cardiac function. An alternative strategy is increase of circulating
      stem cells by mobilisation from the bone marrow with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor
      (G-CSF).

      Objective: To determine the short-term (30 days) safety of G-CSF therapy after a STEMI
      treated with acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      Methods: Patients with STEMI treated with PCI <12 hours after symptom onset were randomised
      (1:1) to G-CSF (10 Î¼g/kg/d) or placebo for 6 days in a double-blind design. Other inclusion
      criteria: age 20-70 years, culprit lesion in a large coronary artery, and peak CKMB >100
      microgram/L. Follow-up was done after 1, 5 and 6 months, with an angiogram at 5 months.
