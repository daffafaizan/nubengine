      to the age of 75 with newly diagnosed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) not previously
      treated. Patients will receive RCD or PCD combination as induction treatment followed by
      rituximab or velcade maintenance therapy, as the investigators try to compare the, very good
      partial remission (VGPR) rate, complete remission (CR) rates, Overall remission rate (MR+CR +
      VGPR + partial remission (PR) rate), major reaction rate (MRR, PR+VGPR+CR) at the end of the
      research.
