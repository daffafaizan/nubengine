      with diabetes. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputation (LLA), and it
      is associated with cognitive decline, worsening quality of life and substantial economic
      impact on French healthcare system. DFU is also associated with excess risk of premature
      death with significant decrease in life expectancy despite major improvement in medical care
      during last decades. The hypothesis of the study is that this worse prognosis seen in DFU
      patients may not be fully explained by a high cardiovascular risk, but mainly linked to
      different causes, including inflammatory, infectious and malignant conditions.

      In addition, to conduct the first prospective, observational and multi-centre cohort of
      patients with DFU in France to evaluate the 5-years mortality rate, its causes and relevant
      prognostic determinants, the investigators will also assess all changes in health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL), and the economic impact related to DFU (cost of illness study) for
      the French healthcare system, using SNDS claims databases. A 3-year inclusion period will
      start during 2020, and each participant will be followed for 5 years or until death.
