    
      This is an open-label, randomized study in which the first 33 patients will be assigned to
      receive the either:

        -  DRibbles vaccine and HPV vaccine

        -  DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and imiquimod

        -  DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and GM-CSF After 11 patients have been assigned to each
           group, the study arm with the greatest number of vaccine-induced strong antibody
           responses will then continue with enrollment of 15 further patients. The primary
           objective is to determine the best strategy to induce strong (>15 fold) tumor-specific
           or tumor-associated antibody responses in patients with stage III A and B NSCLC. The
           goal is to select one regimen to advance to additional clinical trials.
