      Q10 (Q10) administration reduces symptoms and improve subjective health in Gulf War veterans
      (GWV).

      Rationale: In a number of settings, studies have reported benefits of Q10 to fatigue, muscle
      pain and cognition, "syndrome" defining symptoms in GWV. It has also been reported to improve
      a range of other symptoms and conditions that arise at increased rates in GWV. Additionally
      Q10 defends against mechanisms that may play a role in health problems in GWV. For these
      reasons, a study evaluating benefits by Q10 to symptoms and quality of life in symptomatic
      GWV is merited.

      Subjects: 46 GWV meeting Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Kansas criteria for "Gulf War
      illness." Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Intervention:
      Coenzyme Q10 at 100mg three times a day (tid) or 300mg tid or matching placebo for 3.5 Â± 0.5
      month periods.

      Primary Outcome: Subjective health; syndrome defining symptoms (fatigue, muscle pain, muscle
      strength; and cognition).

      Secondary Outcomes: A variety of secondary outcomes will be assessed including other symptoms
      reported to be elevated in GWV; markers of oxidative stress; and dose-response.

      Analyses: Nonparametric and secondarily parametric analyses will compare effects of Q10 vs
      placebo; and of higher dose vs lower dose Q10 on primary and secondary endpoints. Possible
      effect modification (differential benefit) based on factors such as oxidative state and Q10
      serum concentration will be explored through regression analysis.
