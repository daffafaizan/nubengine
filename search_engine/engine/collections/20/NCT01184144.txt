      endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common ailment affecting approximately five million
      reproductive-aged American women. We will test the efficacy of a novel immunomodulatory drug
      (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, PPAR-gamma, agonist), pioglitazone, to
      reduce peritoneal fluid cytokine concentrations in women with endometriosis compared with the
      non-treated controls (randomized controlled trial). Based on prior studies done by the
      investigator highlighting the major role of cytokines and the immune system in the genesis or
      propagation of endometriosis, these experiments could lead to improved translational
      treatment strategies and a better understanding of endometriosis. Acting through PPAR-gamma,
      TZDs inhibit proinflammatory cytokines as well as NF-kB, an important nuclear transcription
      factor for the production of many cytokines. Accordingly, since human endometrial epithelial
      and stromal cells contain PPAR-gamma, we felt i would be useful to evaluate the influence of
      a PPAR-gamma ligand, pioglitazone, on the concentration of specific peritoneal fluid
      cytokines.

      Comparison: After the pre-trial screening, eligible subjects with presumed endometriosis and
      age 18-45 will be consented and randomly assigned to receive either pioglitazone (30 mg,
      daily)or no drug for 2 weeks. Peritoneal fluid will be collected at the time of surgery and
      the volume measured. All patients enrolled in the study will have their surgery during the
      follicular phase of the cycle in order to minimize differences in volume and cytokine
      concentration due to the cyclical changes. The primary measure will be the peritoneal fluid
      concentration comparisons of the two groups assessing six different cytokines.
