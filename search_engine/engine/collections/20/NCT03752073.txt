    
      Term, low risk patients requesting elective induction of labor who desire pre-induction
      cervical ripening at home will be randomized to receive an outpatient trans-cervical ripening
      balloon (17 F non-latex Foley catheter) or hygroscopic cervical dilator (Dilapan-S). Patients
      present to the hospital for their scheduled induction of labor approximately 12 hours later.

      We hypothesize that the trans-cervical balloon and hygroscopic dilators will show equivalent
      efficacy in cervical ripening, but that pain scores and patient satisfaction will be better
      with the hygroscopic dilators.
