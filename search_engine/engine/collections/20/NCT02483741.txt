      and burns. Studies revealed that the healing effect of honey could be classified by its
      antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of its components.
      Manuka honey has been shown to inhibit a wide range of microorganisms, including
      multiresistant strains. This unique honey is derived from flowers of manuka tree
      (Leptospermum scoparium) in New Zealand. Dihydroxyacetone and methylglyoxal are unique and
      naturally occurring constituents of manuka honey that correlate with its antibacterial
      activity.

      Since surgical extraction of impacted molars is one of the most common operations in the oral
      cavity and the postoperative symptoms disturbing the patient may reduce the quality of health
      service, this study aims to assess the healing potential of Manuka honey in reducing these
      symptoms by comparing the outcome of extraction of impacted lower molars with and without
      topical application of Manuka honey into the extraction socket.
