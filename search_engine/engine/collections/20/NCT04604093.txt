      subjects, with a minimum of approximately 65 subjects per arm. At least 50% of randomized
      subjects will be age 65 and older. Subjects will be randomized to use either the FreeStyle
      Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System or traditional SMBG to manage their diabetes. The
      subsequent impact of FreeStyle Libre 2 versus SMBG on reducing the amount of time spent above
      180 mg/dL will be assessed.

      Safety of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and SMBG will be
      characterized by Adverse Device Effects and Serious Adverse Device Effects experienced by
      study participants.
