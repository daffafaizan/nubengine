    
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of uncommon heterogeneous malignancies originating
      from neuroendocrine cells localized throughout the body. Approximately 50% of patients with
      NETs would have metastatic cancer, where 65% of patients with metastatic cancer would result
      in mortality within 5 years of diagnosis.

      The current treatments of NETs do not follow single discipline and the effective agents are
      largely still under clinical investigations. Apparent formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM)
      has been reported in at least two types of NETs. Moreover, VM has been found as part of
      multiple microvascular alterations in mouse models of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

      Wih the high potential of inhibiting VM formation, CVM-1118 is considered to have therapeutic
      potentials in treating NET tumors.
