    
      Following confirmation of eligibility and completion of baseline surveys, participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of the study arms by the project coordinator, using a
      computer-generated allocation algorithm on the basis of a randomization blocks method using
      four, six or eight participants in each block.

      In-person and telephone counseling will be delivered by the same board-certified genetic
      counselors using a guideline-concordant semi-structured protocol that will allow for
      personalization of counseling.

      Participants randomly assigned to telephone counseling will be mailed packets that include a
      sealed envelope containing an educational brochure about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
      genetic counseling with visual aids. At the time of their session, participants will review
      the brochure and genetic counselors will use visual aids to explain breast-ovarian cancer
      genetics. Women receiving in-person counseling will be given the same materials during their
      session at the community clinic.

      For women who elect to have testing, those who have telephone counseling will be sent a
      genetic test kit; those who have in-person counseling will have the option of giving a sample
      immediately at the clinic, or will be given a test kit with the same instructions as those in
      the telephone-counseling group.

      When BRCA test results become available, participants will be offered individual post-test
      counseling with the same genetic counselor who conducted the pretest session.
