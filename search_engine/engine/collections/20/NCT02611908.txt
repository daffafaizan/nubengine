    
      This is phase 1 study for patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) experiencing
      disease progression on single ibrutinib. This study will evaluate the optimal ibrutinib dose
      (including doses higher than 420 mg) when combined with obinutuzumab.

      During the screening period, patients will continue on ibrutinib at their previous tolerated
      dose, unless required to stop (e.g.: by a preceding clinical trial).

      On cycle 1, day 1, the dose of ibrutinib will be assigned based on the dose cohort. Patients
      in cohort 1 will receive ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily. Patients in cohort 2 will receive
      ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily. Cohort 3 will be 700 mg PO daily. Cohort 4 will be 840 mg PO
      daily.

      On cycle 1, day 1, patients will also initiate treatment with obinutuzumab (100 mg on day 1,
      900mg on day 2, 1000mg day 8, 15, 28 then q 28 days for a total of 8 doses).

      The primary safety endpoint is determination of DLTs during the first 28 days. The primary
      efficacy endpoint of overall response rate will be assessed 2 months after the final dose of
      obinutuzumab.
