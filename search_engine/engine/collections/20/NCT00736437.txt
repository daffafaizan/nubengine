      time to healing (loss of hard crust) of delayed classical herpes labialis (HSV) lesions
      experimentally induced after ultra violet radiation (UVR) exposure. Secondary objectives were
      to compare the time to normal skin, incidence of lesion development (number and type of
      lesions), maximum lesion size, length of lesion stages, frequency/severity/duration of pain,
      frequency/severity/duration of tenderness, redness and/or oedema in the UVR exposed area,
      frequency of virus positive lesions, time to cessation of viral shedding and safety of ME-609
      cream vs placebo cream.
