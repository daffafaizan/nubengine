      advertise the study among patients at the clinics and wards of the First Affiliated Hospital
      of Dalian Medical University, China. Patients interested in participation in this study or
      their legal guardians contact the project manager via telephone. Patients will be screened
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria after providing signed informed consent.
      Eligible patients with chronic spinal cord injury will receive intravenous, lumbar, and local
      administration of hUC-MSCs/hUCB-MSCs (provided by Cell Bank of Stem Cell Clinical Research
      Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University). The primary outcome
      measure of this study is neurologic function scores, including ASIA (American Spinal Injury
      Association) motor score, ASIA sensory score, ASIA impairment scale (ASIA classification),
      and acupuncture score. These scores will be used to evaluate the recovery of nerve function
      after spinal cord injury and determine the therapeutic efficacy and persistence. The
      secondary outcome measures of this study include Walking Index of Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI),
      Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Kunming Locomotion Scale (KLS), Modified Ashworth
      Scale (MAS), and Visual Analogous Scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse reactions.
      At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, patients will be followed up to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation in the treatment of spinal cord
      injury.
