      glioma. All patients will receive everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/m2/dose daily. An adaptive
      Simon two-stage design for phase 2 studies of targeted therapies will be used to assess the
      efficacy primary objective. The proposed treatment with everolimus will be deemed not worthy
      of further investigation in this patient population if the true PFS at 6-months (PFS6) is
      less than 50%. If in the first stage, with a combined sample size of 25, there is preliminary
      evidence to suggest efficacy of everolimus is restricted to patients with PI3K/AKT/mTOR
      activation as measured by p-S6 positivity, a total of 45 patients will be enrolled and the
      design will have 81% statistical power to detect a true disease stabilization rate ≥70%. If
      in the first stage there is preliminary evidence to suggest efficacy of everolimus is
      independent of PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, a total of 65 patients will be enrolled and the
      design will have >95% statistical power to detect a true disease stabilization rate ≥70%.
