      the strongest breast cancer risk factors. Extremely dense breast tissue affects about 10% of
      women, with an additional third having heterogeneously dense breasts. Women in these
      categories have 3-6 times the risk of breast cancer as compared to women with least density.
      Although breast density is measured on routine screening mammograms, it is not typically
      communicated to patients. This is changing as a result of legal mandates and approaches need
      to be tested to effectively integrate this clinical information in care. Therefore,we have
      developed an intervention to support decision making about cancer risk management (MRI and
      chemoprevention) for women at clinically elevated risk using a web-based intervention that
      will evaluate the efficacy of a web based intervention with personalized risk information
      communication versus usual care.
