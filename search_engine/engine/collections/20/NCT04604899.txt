    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, Phase 2 study of human retinal progenitor
      cells (jCell) for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The study will include only
      subjects previously treated with jCell.

      To assess reinjection of a previously treated eye, subjects who have previously been treated
      with jCell and desire a second treatment in the same eye will be enrolled. Subjects must have
      completed at least 12 months of follow up since the prior injection of jCell. Subjects who
      have had both eyes previously treated with jCell will only have one eye retreated; the eye to
      be retreated will preferably be the better seeing eye, but exceptions may be made by the
      study investigator, taking into consideration BCVA, prior response to treatment, and any
      other medical conditions that may indicate which eye is the best candidate for retreatment.
      Subjects will be followed for 12 months for safety and efficacy.
