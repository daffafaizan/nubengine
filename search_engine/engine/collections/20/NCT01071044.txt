      early 2000's. This clinic was staffed by a board-certified rheumatologist and the psychiatric
      staff at RCBM. Through the major referral hospital in the area, patients with self-identified
      fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue were referred to our clinic. Over eighteen months, we
      evaluated 75 patients, and found that in patients who had comprehensive evaluations, nearly
      70 percent also had a history of ADHD, inattentive or combined types. Diagnosis was made
      using clinical history and standardized symptom checklists. Oftentimes, the ADHD had been
      previously undiagnosed. This finding supports the link between ADHD and FMS/CFS.

      Results from these evaluations reinforced our initial findings: patients who are treated for
      their ADHD symptoms also show a reduction in their chronic pain and fatigue symptoms. This is
      true regardless of previous (unsuccessful) therapies to treat their fibromyalgia.

      As a result of these findings, we are conducting a controlled study to further demonstrate
      the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in controlling fatigue symptoms in patients
      presenting with chronic fatigue syndrome. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      over a period of 8 weeks, where subjects are randomized to either LDX or placebo. We will
      evaluate subjects through standardized pain, fatigue and ADHD assessment scales.
