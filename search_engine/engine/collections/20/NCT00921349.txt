      choice for management of bleeding esophageal varices. The advantages of EVL include requiring
      fewer treatment sessions to achieve variceal obliteration, lower rebleeding rates and fewer
      complications (5-9). Controlled studies that compared EVL with beta-blocker in the prevention
      of first variceal bleeding suggested that EVL was at least equal to beta-blockers in the
      prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding. However, portal pressure may be elevated after
      repeated EVL. Hence the combination of nadolol and EVL is a reasonable approach to prevent
      the first episode of variceal bleeding.
