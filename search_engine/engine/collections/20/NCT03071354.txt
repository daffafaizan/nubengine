      elderly patients (â‰¥65 years of age) with acute respiratory failure, who are identified at
      high risk for malnutrition by ICU-specific nutritional risk scores. Patients will receive
      either 3g of HMB daily, or control, daily until day 28 following randomization (even if
      discharged).the investigators will measure functional outcomes using standard, validated
      measures prior and after discharge.

      The investigators hypothesize that this inexpensive nutrient, HMB, along with our supportive
      measures, reduces muscle loss, improves physical muscle function, and improves quality of
      life in the longer term following critical illness.
