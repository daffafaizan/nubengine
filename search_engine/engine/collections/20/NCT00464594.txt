      to compare the suppressive effect of the following two kinds of interventions on the
      worsening/progression to definite diabetes which has a harmful hyperglycemia i.e. an
      increased risk of microangiopathy: standard education for the improvement of lifestyle in
      accordance with the "Guidelines for the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus in Japan" of the Japan
      Diabetes Society (JDS) and standard lifestyle guidance combined with pharmacological
      intervention using the lowest possible dose of commercially available oral hypoglycemic
      agents (one of acarbose, metformin, or gliclazide) in Japan.
