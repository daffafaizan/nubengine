      Evaluate the effectiveness of Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy (TBCT) compared to Exposure and
      Response Prevention (ERP) in the treatment of OCD patients, by neuroimaging tests such as
      MRI.

        1. Describe the neuroanatomical profile of the sample participants before and after the
           psychotherapeutic intervention by MRI;

        2. Compare the profile neuroanatomical between the experimental group and the control group
           by MRI;

        3. Identify possible neuroanatomical differences in the participating sample of pre and
           post-treatment, both among individuals and among psychotherapeutic intervention groups;

        4. To investigate associations between the results of MRI scans and indexes the scales
           currently used to assess severity of OCD.
