        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when
           administered concurrently with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with inoperable
           stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I) (Closed to accrual as of
           01/13/04.)

        -  Determine the 12-month survival rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)
           (Closed to accrual as of 11/27/07.)

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the partial organ tolerance doses for the lung and esophagus in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of 3-dimensional conformal
      radiotherapy.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 01/13/04): Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy once daily five days a week for 7-8 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent
           chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

      Cohorts of 7-9 patients receive de-escalating doses of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined when given in combination with
      chemotherapy. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 patient
      experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Additional patients are accrued and treated as above at the MTD. At least 3
           weeks after completing radiotherapy, patients may receive additional chemotherapy
           comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours once and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once.
           Treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin may repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 73 patients (up to 27 for phase I [closed to accrual as of
      10/28/04] and 46 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5 years.
