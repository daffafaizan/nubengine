    
      The study will investigate the effectiveness of a SD of HPV vaccine through the conduct of a
      regional effectiveness study in Thailand.

      The study will be conducted in schools and district hospitals from the two selected provinces
      (Udon Thani and Buriram)

      The study design includes 4 distinct and independent components:

      1) vaccination, 2)baseline cross-sectional survey, 3,4)sequential cross-sectional surveys for
      impact assessments at Year 2 and Year 4 post vaccination.

        -  Vaccination: The target population is represented by all Grade 8 female students in the
           two provinces. All enrolled students will receive either SD (Udon Thani) or 2D
           (Buriram). A subset (N=200/province) of Grade 8 female students in each province will be
           selected for a blood collection before vaccination for assessment of vaccine
           immunogenicity.

        -  Surveys (baseline, Year 2 and Year 4 impact surveys): Target populations of are a subset
           of female students of Grades 10 High school (HS)/year 1 Vocational School (VS) and Grade
           12 HS/year 3 VS from all schools in the two provinces and the sampling unit is an
           individual. Urine collection will be performed to assess HPV infection by DNA PCR and
           for genotyping of positive samples. A subset of students (N=200 per province) will be
           randomly selected for each of the Year 2 and Year 4 surveys for blood collection for
           assessment of vaccine immunogenicity.

        -  Demographics and sexual behavior questionnaire will be collected from all students.
