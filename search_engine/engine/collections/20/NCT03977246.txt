      Twenty-eight trained female cyclists completed a 1-km cycling TT following a control session
      or an open-placebo intervention. The intervention consisted of an individual presentation,
      provided by a medic, in which the concept of open-placebo was explained to the participant,
      before she ingested two red and white capsules containing flour; 15 min later, they performed
      the TT. In the control session, the participant sat quietly for 20 min.
