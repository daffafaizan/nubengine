      Florida. Adults age 21-65, exercising less than 3 days/week. 56 subjects were randomized to a
      control or an intervention group. Subjects followed a diet with >30 grams of fiber and <16
      grams of saturated fat daily, and were taught to reach 70-85% of their maximum heart rate 5-6
      days/week, and to perform strength training 3 days/week, plus were asked to participate in
      10-20 minutes of stress management activities daily. The study was designed to determine body
      composition, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein
      (TC/HDL), and cognition.

      Specific aspects ofcognitive performance were noted to increase with increasing levels of
      aerobic activity, but not with strength training, dietary fiber change, or stress managment.

      Having established that the treatment group would exercise at different levels of intensity,
      additional subjects were recruited, and the cognitive performance of no exercise, moderate
      aerobic exercise, and frequent aerobic exercise could be compared with specific domains of
      cognitive performance: memory, psychomotor speed, reaction time, attention, and cognitive
      flexibility. The St Anthony's Institutional Review Board approved this research project.
