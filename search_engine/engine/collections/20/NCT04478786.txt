      online focus group discussion (a collective group discussion) about their experiences of
      using MCCD. The participants will be any operational ambulance crew member, employed by the
      local ambulance Trust and who had experience of using any type of MCCD. The focus groups will
      be audio recorded; participants will be aware of this when they choose to participate.

      The aim of this research is to collect and report ambulance crews' experiences of using
      mechanical chest compression devices for out of hospital resuscitation attempts Ultimately
      there may of course be benefits for patients by exploring whether MCCD play a part in out of
      hospital resuscitations. Funding has been offered by a manufacturer one of the types of MCCD;
      they have had no involvement in the design of the study.

      Once transcribed, the data will be analysed manually. The content of each focus group will be
      coded and then each participants' individual responses will be coded, first using open
      coding, then focused coding to identify emergent themes, before concluding with the
      categories that have been identified. The constant comparison method of data analysis will be
      used.
