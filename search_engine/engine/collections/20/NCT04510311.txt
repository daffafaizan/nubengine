    
      Subjects enrolled in this study will be recruited from the population of adult patients with
      neuroendocrine tumors, including pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, being treated at the
      University of Michigan Hospital.

      The primary objective of the study is to obtain basic information on the biodistribution and
      pharmacokinetics of [18F]3F-PHPG in cancer patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

      The secondary objective of the study is to compare the diagnostic performance of [18F]3F-PHPG
      in cancer patients with neuroendocrine tumors with the FDA approved radiopharmaceuticals
      [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine ([123I]MIBG) and [68Ga]DOTA-TATE in the same patients. A group
      of approximately 12 of the subjects scanned with [18F]3F-PHPG will be recruited to undergo a
      whole-body [123I]MIBG scan using planar scintigraphy with a gamma camera, following the
      standard clinical protocol used at the University of Michigan. In addition, a single SPECT/CT
      scan of the primary neuroendocrine tumor will be acquired after the whole-body scan to
      provide a tomographic image for comparison with the positron emission tomography (PET) image
      acquired using [18F]3F-PHPG. Several subjects enrolled on this study will undergo
      [68Ga]DOTA-TATE scans off-study, as part of routine clinical management. Existing
      [68Ga]DOTA-TATE scans will be obtained from consenting subjects' medical records.

      This is an exploratory study and thus all statistical data analyses will be exploratory in
      nature.
