      determine whether advantages exist in one or more of the dressing types that are approved and
      currently used for split-thickness skin graft donor site dressings.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and followed up
      post-operatively and treated as per current standard of care.

      Data to be collected and analyzed includes: patient age, co-morbid illnesses, medication,
      skin-graft donor location, skin-graft donor area, STSG thickness, infection rate,
      complications involving the donor site, post-operative pain score every morning until
      hospital discharge, healing rate, photographs of the donor site immediately post-operatively
      and then at routine follow-up appointments.
