      Primary

        -  Determine the 4-week rate of complete response in patients with severe acute
           graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) treated with alemtuzumab, tacrolimus, and
           methylprednisolone within 100 days after undergoing allogeneic stem cell
           transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the best response at 4 and 12 weeks in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine 6-month survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of infectious complications in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine rate of chronic GVHD in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single-blind, multicenter study.

      Patients receive methylprednisolone IV on days 1-3 and then orally or IV on days 4-14;
      tacrolimus IV continuously on days 1-7 and then orally once or twice daily on days 8-180,
      followed by a taper in the absence of chronic graft-vs-host disease; and alemtuzumab IV over
      2 hours on days 4-6, 18, and 32. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or the development of serious infection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 and 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-34 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-12
      months.
