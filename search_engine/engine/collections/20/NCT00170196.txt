      mortality, especially patients with severe CAP. In the past decennia, in spite of many
      investigations, little reduction is seen in morbidity an mortality. Corticosteroids have a
      immune-modulation effect, which is not completely elucidated. Most likely the immune
      modulation effect is due to down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The use of
      corticosteroids next to antibiotics in CAP could lead to shorter time to clinical stability,
      length of stay and costs.
