      various components of hemostasis. Routine laboratory assays such as activated clotting time,
      activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, or platelet count might, as
      demonstrated previously, insufficiently provide specificity and/or sensitivity to assess
      coagulation and platelet disorders. Therefore, additionally thrombin generation (TG) was
      analyzed by the calibrated automated thrombogram assay (CAT). Also, platelet function was
      quantitatively assessed by the PAC-t-UB assay and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was
      used to elucidate the contribution of platelets, intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways
      in peri-operative bleeding. The hypothesis of this study was that the procedure exposed an
      increased thrombotic risk, resulting in a faster and increased TG and hyper platelet
      function?
