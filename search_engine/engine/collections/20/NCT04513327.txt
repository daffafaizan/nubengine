      and due to increased population engaging in sports activities, the ACL injury is becoming
      more prevalent among young adults. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction is essential to
      restore knee function and many factors including age, degree of sports activities engagement,
      weight bearing should be considered when organizing rehabilitation programs. Knee joint
      stiffness and weakness of knee flexor/extensor muscles are common problems following the
      surgery which are related to improper rehabilitation after ACL reconstructions.

      Current method of post-operative rehabilitation is home-based self rehabilitation using
      brochure, combined with one or two times of education at the hospital before discharge.
      Patients often find difficulty in doing rehabilitation by themselves at home without
      supervision which resulted in decreased compliance.

      With development of technologies using multi-motion sensor and AR(augmented-reality) system,
      the investigators have developed a digital healthcare system(Uincare Homeplus) which can
      supplement patients' rehabilitation at home by giving them proper instructions as well as
      feedback. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators aim to compare
      the efficacy of the newlydeveloped digital healthcare system with conventional rehabilitation
      program.
