      the bronchial blocker in the targeted mainstem bronchus. However, there can be occasions when
      a FOB is unavailable or inapplicable. Therefore, we will try to devise a blind method to
      locate the blocker without the aid of FOB in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.

      After intubation of endotracheal tube (ETT), the UniblockerÂ® is inserted into the ETT and is
      advanced until the blocker balloon comes out of the ETT tip. At this time, the blocker
      balloon is inflated with air and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) will abruptly increase.
      And then, the blocker is rotated to the thoracotomy side and advanced to the carina step by
      step at 0.5 cm intervals. When the PIP drops abruptly, the blocker cuff is deflated
      completely and advanced to 3 cm further. The blocker cuff is inflated again. Using a FOB, the
      position of the blocker is recorded and we will evaluate the success rate of proper blocker
      position.
