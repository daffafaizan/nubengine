      I. To collect preliminary information to help design a study to look at longitudinal changes
      in markers of ovarian reserve and menstruation in premenopausal women undergoing tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in patients who elect to
      undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) for fertility preservation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transvaginal ultrasound for antral follicles analysis and collection of
      serum for ovarian reserve markers and hormonal analysis before TKI therapy and at 12, 24, and
      48 weeks.
