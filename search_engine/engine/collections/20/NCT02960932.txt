      the method " Supersonic Shear ImagingÂ® (SSI) " provide an important technological change
      measuring, swiftly and no invasive, a elasticity modulus reflecting the property
      visco-elastic of the muscle. A lot of ex vivo study led in isolated muscle and in vivo in
      healthy adults demonstrated the validity of the method SSI on the evaluation of the passive
      stiffness from a number of muscle group whose the gastrocnemius muscle. The main objective of
      this study must be checked the intersession reproducibility of the method SSI on the
      evaluation of the passive stiffness at the medial bundle of the gastrocnemius muscle
      therefore their passive lengthening in cerebral palsy children. The secondary objective is to
      test the correlation level of the relation elasticity modulus/ joint angle and couple
      force-angle obtained throughout the passive lengthening at the medial bundle of the
      gastrocnemius muscle in cerebral palsy children.
