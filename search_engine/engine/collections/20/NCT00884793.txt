    
      The "PLUS" study is a prospective, longitudinal pilot study to measure the effect of therapy
      intensification (with raltegravir and possible addition of a study PI or NNRTI-Non-Nucleoside
      Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor) on HIV-1 DNA/RNA levels in the gut-associated lymphoid
      tissue (GALT) and blood in patients on ART with viral load (VL) < 50 copies/mL (herein
      referred to as "suppressed"). We hypothesize that there is ongoing replication in the GALT
      despite suppressive ART and that this replication can be inhibited by the addition of one or
      two new antiretroviral drugs whose activity affects a distinct part of the viral life cycle.
      All study participants will have a colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at
      baseline (before intensification) and a second colonoscopy with EGD 12 weeks after
      intensification. These endoscopies will be used to obtain GALT mononuclear cells (for CD4+
      lymphocytes) as well as tissue for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies.
