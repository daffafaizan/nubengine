      investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD6738 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      AZD6738 is a a drug being studied as a potential treatment for individuals with
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia. It targets a specific pathway in
      cells that repairs damage to DNA, specifically by blocking a protein called ATR. ATR notices
      when there is injury to DNA, which is the blueprint that allows cells to function and
      replicate, and works to repair that damage. Studies done in a laboratory setting and cell
      lines suggest that MDS and CMML cells rely specifically on the ATR pathway to fix DNA damage
      and survive; by inhibiting ATR with AZD6738, MDS or CMML cells appear to selectively
      accumulate DNA damage and die, but healthy cells appear to be less sensitive to this target.
      This suggests that inhibiting ATR may be a way to selectively target MDS or CMML cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to first investigate the safety and
      tolerability of AZD6738. The investigators will also evaluate whether AZD6738 has any effect
      on tumor growth, measure the activity of AZD6738 in the bone marrow, and study how AZD6738 is
      cleared by the body.
