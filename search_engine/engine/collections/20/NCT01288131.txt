      recombinant DNA technology for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD). Although r-HuEpo raises hemoglobin levels in CKD and improves morbidity
      associated with anemia in CKD patients, the adverse immunological effect of r-HuEpo
      administered subcutaneously can result in anti-r-HuEpo associated PRCA. We aim to evaluate
      the effectiveness of two treatment protocol, cyclosporine combined with mycophenolate mofetil
      and cyclophosphamide combined with prednisolone for treatment of anti-r-HuEpo associated
      PRCA.
