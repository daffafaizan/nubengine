      be associated with increased risk for renal insufficiency and myocardial ischemia. Currently
      treatment of these hypotensive episodes is not proactive. Edwards Lifesciences has developed
      an algorithm using continuous invasively-measured arterial waveforms to predict hypotension
      with high accuracy minutes before blood pressure actually decreases. Hypothesis: the use of
      this algorithm will alter treatment of hypotension and reduces the incidence of hypotension.
