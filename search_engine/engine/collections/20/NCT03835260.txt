        -  Ensure that representative intended users are able to operate the Pivot Breath Sensor
           independently

        -  Validate appropriate mitigations of use related hazards identified in risk management
           documentation

        -  Uncover previously unforeseen use errors

      This human factors and usability testing is conducted to demonstrate that the Pivot Breath
      Sensor can be used by the intended users without serious use errors or problems, for the
      intended uses and under the expected use conditions.
