      it is suggested to randomize 30 patients per arm. An IDMC will come to a decision after the
      inclusion of 10, 20 ans 40 patients on the efficacy and the toxicity profile and on whether
      to maintain the current clinical position, justifying randomisation . In order to take into
      account any possible effects of prior concomitant radiochemotherapy, patient will be
      stratified according to whether they have already undergone chemotherapy or
      radiochemotherapy.
