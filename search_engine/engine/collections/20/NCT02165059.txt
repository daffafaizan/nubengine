      nausea, retching, bloating and fullness of stomach) and are undergoing surgery for the GES
      implantation. These patients will serve as our study group population. Biopsy samples of
      those who do not have gastroparesis but are undergoing surgery on the digestive system will
      be collected after the patients consent to be on the trial. These patients will serve as our
      control group population. Detailed medical history will be collected and the study group
      patients will be asked to complete two questionnaire to assess the severity of the symptoms.
      They will be followed in the clinic at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post implantation.
