    
      100 patients with stable angina pectoris will be recruited from the HPS-THRIVE cohort or from
      the cardiology outpatient department at the Fuwai Hospital in Beijing. Patients will attend
      the department first thing in the morning on two occasions, separated by at least 1 week. All
      subjects will be fitted with a 12-lead Holter monitor and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
      monitor. They will be issued with a diary to record their activities and symptoms.

      Patients will be randomised to wear a simple facemask for one of their visits (3M Dust
      Respirator 8812). When randomised to wear a mask, subjects will be asked to wear the mask as
      much as possible in the 24 hours prior to the study day and for the 24 hours of the study day
      (48 hours in total). Subjects will be instructed to wear the mask at all times when outdoors,
      and as much as possible when indoors.

      On both visits, patients will be asked to walk along a prespecified route for 2 hours in a
      city centre location in Beijing. During this period patients will walk at their own pace for
      15 mins and rest for 5 mins for a total of 120 mins (6 cycles). After the walk, subjects will
      return to the department and the pollution equipment switched off. A formal BRUCE protocol
      exercise stress test will be performed as soon as possible after finishing the 2-hour walk,
      and blood tests will be taken just prior to the exercise stress test (10-20mls in total).
      Subjects will be asked to wear the ambulatory blood pressure monitor and the Holter ECG
      monitor for a total of 24 hours, returning the following day to have this removed. Personal
      exposure to air pollution will be determined during the 2 hour walk with a series of monitors
      contained within a small backpack.
