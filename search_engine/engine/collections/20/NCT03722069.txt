      days in hospitalized patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure. It is a prospective
      cohort, randomized, with blinded intervention groups: low sodium diet (the patients will
      receive 3 g/day of dietary sodium intake), and normal sodium diet (patients will receive 7
      g/day of dietary sodium intake). Besides that, both groups will be submitted to a fluid
      intake limited to 1000 ml/day.
