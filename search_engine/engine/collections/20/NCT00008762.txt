      recruited from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Delaware Valley region.
      All subjects will have baseline measurements obtained at the Nutrition and Growth Lab at
      CHOP. A subset of subjects will return for 12-month follow-up measurements.

      We will evaluate the influences on bone health, including: gender, stage of pubertal
      development, body weight and height, food intake (especially calcium and vitamin D), use of
      steroid medications by mouth, IV administration or inhalation, physical activity and lung
      health. We will also follow the changes in bone health and growth over 12 months, and see
      what factors are associated with good and poor bone development.

      In addition, the information from this study will be very important to planning the future
      trials of medication and other interventions to treat and, hopefully, to prevent poor bone
      health in people with CF.
