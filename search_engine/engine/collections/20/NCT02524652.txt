    
      Patients scheduled to undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction under general
      anaesthesia will be randomly allocated to two groups: local infiltration analgesia or
      adductor canal block.

      The local infiltration analgesia will be performed by the surgeon at the end of surgery with
      20 mLs of ropivacaine 0.5%. The adductor canal block will be performed by the
      anaesthesiologist under ultrasound guidance after the surgery, before awaking the patient,
      using the same solution (20 mLs ropivacaine 0.5%)

      Postoperative analgesia will include intravenous patient-controlled analgesia of morphine
      (settings 1 mg/ml, 2 ml/10 minutes, 40 mg/4 hours), ibuprofen (3x400 mg) and acetaminophen
      (4x1000 mg).

      A research assistant and a physiotherapist, both blinded to the group allocation, will
      collect pain and rehabilitation data, respectively.
