      burden and distorted illness perception. These psychological burden include feeling of
      burned-out, fatigue, distress and depression, and in addition of distorted illness perception
      often lead to difficulty in coping with the demands of life-style changes and adherence to
      medication. Diabetes-related distress (DRD) and depressive symptoms (DS) were associated with
      glycaemic control and medication adherence, and life-styles behaviors, respectively. However,
      evidence on the relationships between DRD, DS and clinically significant outcomes are scarce
      in Asian adults with T2DM. Primary care patients who participated before will be re-invited.
      This is a repeated cross-sectional study of a cohorts of 700 patients who were first studied
      in 2013 (Emotional Distress in adults with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus & Quality of Life
      [EDDMQoL] study with the National Medical Research Register (NMRR) identification number:
      NMRR-12-1167-14158). Demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, religion, educational level,
      occupation and monthly income), smoking status, self-perceive social support and health
      literacy will be collected by questionnaires.
