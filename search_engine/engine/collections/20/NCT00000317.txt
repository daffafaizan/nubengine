      lead-in phase and terminal placebo phase. After two weeks of single-blind placebo, patients
      were randomly assigned to one of two schedules of medication:

      2 Week Baseline Weeks 1-6 Weeks 7-12 Weeks 13-18 Group 1 placebo risperidone placebo placebo
      Group 2 placebo placebo risperidone placebo

      The first 6-week phase provided an initial double-blind medication-placebo comparison. In the
      second six-week phase (weeks 7-12), patients crossed over to the opposite treatment. During
      weeks 13-18, Group 1 patients remained on placebo while Group 2 patients were tapered from
      risperidone to placebo. For six weeks after the end of the trial, patients were offered
      routine clinical treatment with counseling and psychiatrist visits as needed. Medication
      dosage was titrated upwards on a fixed-flexible schedule to a maximum dose of 4 mg per day.
      Medication began at Â½ mg risperidone for 3 days, then 1 mg for four days, 2 mg per day during
      week 2, 3 mg per day during week 3, and 4 mg per day during weeks 4-6. The titration schedule
      for risperidone in weeks 7-12 was the same as for weeks 1-6. In addition to treatment as
      usual, patients received a modified manual-guided relapse prevention counseling program in
      weekly meetings lasting approximately 20 minutes; these sessions provided cognitive and
      behavioral skills that were found to be helpful to patients in reducing cocaine use.
