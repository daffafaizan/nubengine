    
      In this prospective study, the extent to which severe burn injuries affect the morphology and
      function of liver, pancreas and thyroid. The evaluation of the liver will be performed
      non-invasively with liver fibrosis scores based on standard blood parameters, the
      ultrasound-guided measurement of the liver size and the measurement of liver stiffness
      (correlated with liver fibrosis) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP, correlated with
      hepatic steatosis) via transient elastography (FibroScanÂ©, Echosens SA, Paris, France). The
      thyroid will be assessed by ultrasound and standard blood parameters and the pancreas by
      standard blood parameters only, respectively.

      The patient will be enrolled during the first days on their admission to the intensive care
      burn unit, if they meet the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met. The first
      assessment of liver, pancreas and thyroid function will be performed within the first 48
      hours of admission. The same measurements maybe be repeated approximately weekly until
      discharge, respectively. Furthermore at any follow-up visit up to 15 years post-burn if the
      patient consents to further participate in the study.
