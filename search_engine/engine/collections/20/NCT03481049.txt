      improve outcomes and reduce costs in heavy drinkers with serious mental illness using alcohol
      biomarker ethyl glucuronide (EtG) to test of alcohol abstinence. In CM, patients receive
      tangible rewards for demonstrating drug abstinence.

      The investigators propose to examine whether 2 strategies - 1. Increasing reinforcer
      magnitude (High-Magnitude CM) or 2. Reinforcing light drinking before reinforcing abstinence
      (Shaping CM) - can improve outcomes in heavy drinkers with serious mental illness. The
      investigators will compare the efficacy of these 2 approaches to Usual CM in heavy drinkers
      with serious mental illness.

      A total of 400 participants receiving treatment as usual at 2 treatment agencies will take
      part in a 4-week induction period. Participants (n=240) who attain a mean EtG > 349 ng/mL
      (heavy drinking) during the induction period will be randomized to either a) 4 months of
      standard-magnitude CM for submitting alcohol-abstinent EtG samples (EtG < 150 ng/mL) (Usual
      CM), b) 4 months of high-magnitude CM for submitting alcohol-abstinent EtG samples
      (High-Magnitude CM), or c) 1 month of CM for submitting alcohol samples that indicate light
      drinking (EtG < 500 ng/mL), followed by 3 months of CM for submitting alcohol-abstinent EtG
      samples (Shaping CM). The primary outcome will be EtG-verified alcohol abstinence during the
      last 3 months of treatment (when all reinforcement is contingent on abstinence) and during 12
      months of follow-up.

      The investigators will also examine group differences in secondary outcomes, conduct a
      comprehensive economic analysis, and determine whether variables that make up the NIAAA
      Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) model moderate alcohol abstinence.
