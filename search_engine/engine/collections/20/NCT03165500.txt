      generates a great picture of anxiety in the patients, due to the expectation of pain and
      discomfort in the postoperative period, but mainly in the trans-operative period. One of the
      ways to try to minimize this situation is to use sedation, which is a relatively safe
      procedure performed by trained professionals and with an accurate indication for anxious
      patients. There are several protocols in the literature, but few comparative studies. Thus,
      the objective of this study was to evaluate three sedation protocols. For this purpose, 120
      patients who required surgical treatment for extraction of third molars, aged between 18 and
      30 years, and whose anxiety was moderate to severe according to the Corah Anxiety Scale from
      the School of Dentistry of São José Dos Campos (UNESP). These patients were randomly divided
      into three Groups: Group I - oral sedation with diazempam 5 mg; Group II - oral sedation with
      midazolam 7.5 mg and Group III - inhalation sedation with 40% of nitrous oxide . Prior to
      sedation, anxiety was quantified through the Corah Anxiety Scale. Vital signs (blood
      pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation) were measured before sedation, after sedation, in
      the trans-operative period and 15 minutes after the end of sedation. The results will be
      submitted to descriptive statistics and compared using the statistical analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) and Tukey test with significance level of 5%.
