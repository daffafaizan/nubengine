      smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to enhance efficacy, medication adherence, and reduce side
      effects. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability, and smoking
      cessation reverses the risk of mortality. However, cessation failure is common despite
      available cessation medications, which are associated with different efficacy, side effects,
      adherence, use constraints, and costs. This challenge can be addressed by improving current
      treatments via personalized medicine based on individual genetic markers to maximize efficacy
      and minimize side effects.

      The investigators propose a prospective, genotype-based stratified randomization trial to
      compare two smoking cessation medications (combination NRT [patch and lozenge], varenicline
      vs. placebo) for 3 months in 720 smokers with known genotypes.
