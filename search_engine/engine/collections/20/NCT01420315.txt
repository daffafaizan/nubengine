      it is well known that vitamin d deficiency causes to an increase in disease burden. As the
      role of vitamin D, the maintenance of balance, the improvement of muscle power, and the
      augmentation of innate immunity were proven. Some recent studies showed that vitamin D
      deficiency associates with cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and the risk of
      cancer.

      Vitamin D carries out your functions by vitamin d receptors (VDR) located in many cells.
      Brain neurons and glial cells are including VDR's. It is presumed that the functions of
      vitamin d in neurons are the regulation of neurotransmission, neuron protection, and
      immunomodulation. Also,vitamin D has a role in brain development and maturation. Except the
      functions in central nerve system, vitamin D has effects on peripheral nerve system. It was
      reported that nerve transduction velocity decreased in vitamin d deficiency.

      Vitamin D deficiency and Alzheimer's disease are major public health problems that their
      incidences increase in advanced ages.Recent studies indicate that there is a relationship
      between cognitive decline and vitamin D deficiency. VDR receptors in brain specially in
      hippocampus, hypothalamus, limbic system, subcortical and spinal motor areas were determined.

      Up to now, no study has investigated the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in patient with
      Alzheimer's disease. Our aim is to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and
      analysis the associated characteristics in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
