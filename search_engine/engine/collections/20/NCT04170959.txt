      fraction of tumour cells, improving radiosensitivity and promoting apoptosis, resulting in
      better outcome. This hypothesis will be evaluated in a trial with randomized design. All
      patients willing to participate will receive definitive radiotherapy, either in combination
      with metformin (arm C) or without metformin (arm B). Patients who refuse to participate in
      the randomized part can be included in the observational arm of the study (arm A). In
      addition, the validated biomarker of tumour hypoxia (18F-HX4 PET/CT scintigraphy
      (18F-flortanidazole positron emission computed tomography) and biomarkers of resistance,
      apoptosis and glucose metabolism will be evaluated for their potential predictive value.
