      Based on the literature, the development of POCD is associated with reduced cerebral
      oxygenation during one-lung ventilation which may be because of reduced cardiac output,
      impeded cerebral venous return due to mechanical ventilation. In our hospital, nonintubated
      thoracoscopic surgery is commonly conducted and achieves noninferior outcomes than intubated
      thoracoscopic surgery. Particularly, the application of nasal high flow oxygen may maintain
      intraoperative oxygenation despite the absence of controlled ventilation. Therefore, the
      nonintubated technique may be beneficial to maintain an improved intraoperative cerebral
      oxygenation and hopefully improves postoperative cognition recovery. In this randomized
      controlled study, we aim to investigate the differences in intraoperative cerebral
      oxygenation and postoperative cognitive recovery bewteen nonintubated and intubated
      thoracoscopic surgery. Patient will be randomly assigned to receive nonintubated or intubated
      thoracoscopic surgery. During surgery, bifrontal cerebral oxygenation will be monitored.
      Cognitive test will be arranged before and after surgery.
