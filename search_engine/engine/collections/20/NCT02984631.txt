      compromising cardiac function. During an invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET),
      catheters are placed within the heart and pulmonary vasculature to evaluate cardiopulmonary
      function in response to exercise. We will be testing whether pulmonary hypertension can be
      prevented during exercise by adjusting right ventricular pre-load. We will also be evaluating
      parameters of cardiopulmonary function during the study.
