      the Raising Well at Home pilot intervention delivered by peer coaches on weight
      (caregiver/child), behaviors (eating, walking), and the home environment. The Raising Well at
      Home intervention was delivered via home visits with additional support via text or phone
      over 6 months, beginning after completion of the baseline assessment. This study was
      implemented in partnership with the parent Raising Well programs located in three states:
      Florida, Louisiana, and Missouri. The caregiver and the child's height and weight were
      measured by trained staff in the home with the same scale and stadiometer at the pre- and
      post-intervention time points. Measures were completed on a paper survey with the same
      caregiver pre and post intervention delivery.
