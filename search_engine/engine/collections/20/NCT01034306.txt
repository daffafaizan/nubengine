      study in which patients with active RA and high A3AR expression at baseline will be
      randomized to the addition of either CF101 1.0 mg or placebo given orally q12h for 12 weeks.
      Screening examinations will occur within 1 month prior to dosing. Washout of other
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biological agents, will occur prior
      to dosing; if washout is necessary, patients must re-qualify for inclusion following the
      washout. Doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and corticosteroids must be
      stable for >=1 month prior to dosing and remain so during protocol participation. Disease
      activity will be assessed using swollen and tender joint counts, physician and patient global
      assessments (by visual analog scale, VAS), patient reported pain (by VAS), a Health
      Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index (DI), Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate (ESR, Screening, Weeks 0 and12), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Assessments will
      take place at Screening, Baseline (Week 0), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.
