      the prognosis for many patients is poor. We have pioneered work showing that estradiol has a
      positive role in the treatment of psychosis symptoms and cognitive deficits seen in people
      with schizophrenia. However, with the longer-term work from studies such as the Women's
      Health Initiative (1), it has become clear that long-term use of estradiol with progesterone
      may have associated increased risks of breast and other cancers. Hence, we began working with
      the Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator - raloxifene, which appears to be safer for longer
      term use with respect to the development of breast and other cancers. Building on our and
      others work, raloxifene used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia appears to produce
      inconsistent and varying responses in different sub-populations; gender, menopausal status,
      age, drug dose and delivery mode. We now propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo controlled trial of a third generation SERM - bazedoxifene - which is 4 times more
      selective for the alpha than the beta oestrogen receptor subtype. Bazedoxifene appears to be
      safer with respect to long term use than older SERMs, has additional actions on the
      glucocorticoid receptor, and together this different pharmacology speculatively has greater
      potential than other SERMs to impact favorably on both psychosis symptoms and cognition in
      men and women with schizophrenia. This study will test 160 women to determine if
      bazedoxifene, as an adjunctive hormone modulator, is effective for positive and cognitive
      symptoms of schizophrenia.
