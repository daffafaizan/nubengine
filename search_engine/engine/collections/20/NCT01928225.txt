      the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (qHPV) in HIV-infected women to prevent
      occurrence of cervical HSIL after LEEP/LLETZ. Participants will undergo colposcopy with
      directed biopsies, cervical cytology, and stored HPV testing prior to vaccination.
      Participants will be randomized to the quadrivalent vaccine or saline placebo to be given at
      entry, week 4, and week 26. Women will have LEEP treatment at week 4. Participants will be
      seen in follow-up for cervical cytology, colposcopy with directed biopsies at weeks 26 and
      52, and stored HPV specimens. Treatment assignment will be unblinded after study follow-up is
      completed for the last study participant. Women aged 45 or less randomized to placebo will be
      offered open label HPV vaccine after the study is concluded..
