        -  Determine the survival of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, or melanoma with
           minimal residual disease after surgical resection treated with maintenance immunotherapy
           using Corynebacterium granulosum P40.

        -  Determine leucocyte adherence inhibition, an indication of metastases, over time in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center and are matched with
      case-controls by disease type and stage.

      Beginning 2 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive Corynebacterium granulosum P40
      subcutaneously weekly for 6 weeks, followed by rest for 3 months. Treatment continues for
      life.

      Patients are followed for survival.
