      with a commercially available bed-side system (ATRÂ®, Curasan, Germany). In a clinical study
      soft tissue defects (n=5) were treated using a combination of surgical debridement and
      autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP). Time of healing as determined by epithelization as
      well as Laser Doppler Imaging to visualize blood flow were analyzed. Additionally, changes in
      "ease of surgical wound closure" were determined. Finally, the quality of life of patients
      was assessed using a validated questionnaire.
