    
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study.

      120 pregnant women will be recruited at 27 weeks gestation and randomized into two treatment
      groups; 400IU/d or 2000IU/d vitamin D supplementation from 27 weeks until delivery.

      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), urinary calcium/creatinine and serum
      calcium and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels will be assessed in mothers at 27 weeks and at
      delivery.

      25OHD, calcium and ALP levels, and urinary calcium/creatinine will be evaluated in offspring
      at birth and at one year age.

      Vitamin D and calcium intake and sun exposure will be evaluated in mothers and offsprings.

      Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement of tibia and radius will be performed to newborns
      and at the age of one year.

      Bone status of newborns at birth and at one year age in children will be compared between the
      2 groups.
