    
      The Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric
      Symptoms (TIME) is a multi-component intervention with a biopsychosocial approach, based on
      the theoretical framework of cognitive behavioral therapy and person-centred care. TIME
      consists of a manual based multicomponent program which includes a rigorous assessment,
      treatment, and the evaluation of neuropsychiatrc symptoms (NPS).

      The cluster RCT will contain two parallel groups, where randomisation is performed based on
      clusters. One municipality is one cluster, randomized to receive either the intervention with
      TIME or a brief two hours education-only intervention about dementia and NPS for the control
      group. Totally 10 municipalities will be included. Data will be collected at baseline before
      randomisation and at the end of the implementing phase. Measurements at patient level are
      taken at baseline prior to randomization and after 6 months. The primary outcome measure is
      difference in change between the intervention group and the control group from baseline to
      follow up at 6 months in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD).

      Data collection will be performed by project nurses recruited outside the home care services.
      They will interview the staff or family members who knows the patient best. The assessors
      will be blinded to the randomization of the home care services. Interviews will be done by
      telephone or face-to-face, depending on what is best for the person interviewed.

      After the intervention focus group interviews with staff and family members will be
      conducted.
