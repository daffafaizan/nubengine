      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of lonafarnib when
           administered with temozolomide in patients with recurrent primary supratentorial
           gliomas.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the mechanism of action of lonafarnib in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response to this regimen in patients who have measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of
      lonafarnib.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 2-6 of course 1 and on days 1-5 of all
      subsequent courses. Patients also receive oral lonafarnib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lonafarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 1 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients may be treated at the highest dose level
      achieved.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
