    
      The current study is an extension of the previous study #1010218 (ACTRN12618000121268) to
      further explore the safety and PK profile of GMA301 injection at higher dosage. The SRC
      (Safety Review Committee) will be responsible for the assessment of safety, tolerability, and
      PK data for each dose level and to make decisions with regards to study progression. A
      Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written after finalizing the protocol and prior to
      database lock. The SAP will detail the implementation of all the planned statistical analyses
      in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. Adverse events will be
      coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
