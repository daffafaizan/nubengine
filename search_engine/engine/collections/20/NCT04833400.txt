      cardiorespiratory fitness in patients after stroke. However, studies had suggested that
      patients may be undertrained for reasons such as a tight time schedule for other
      rehabilitation programs and lack of objective evaluation on the training intensity.

      To address the issue of inadequate cycle ergometer training in poststroke patients, in this
      study, an intelligent cardiopulmonary rehabilitation system was developed and incorporated
      into a bicycle ergometer, allowing dynamically auto-adjust paddling resistance considering
      the instant heart rate and cadence, with a goal to maintain the hear rate within the
      pre-determined heart rate zone. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the
      feasibility of the ICRS in stroke patients and whether it outweighs the traditional feedback
      on training intensity.

      A single-blind crossover trial is adopted with 40 participants estimated to be recruited and
      randomly assigned to the group A and group B. Group A received training with ICRS while Group
      B received training with TAET at the beginning. The intensity of ICRS is set as 60%~80% heart
      rate reserve (HRR) which is obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at pretest.
      The intensity of TAET is set as subjective rating of perceived exertion at "somewhat hard" to
      "hard" level. Both groups will receive 30 minutes of training per session, 3 sessions a week
      for four weeks followed by a washout period of 4-week break. Subjects are crossed-over to the
      alternate treatment afterwards. CPET evaluations will be conducted in a total of 4 times
      before and after treatment.
