      spread till under fascia iliaca, with the psoas major muscle provides a better protective
      barrier against accidental needle entry into the peritoneal cavity, the endpoint is injection
      within a fascial plane, rather than a specific motor response contact where the lumbar plexus
      stimulation is not sought, so there is minimal risk of nerve injury, inadvertent dural cuff
      puncture and intrathecal spread of local anesthetic. And finally optimal insertion of
      catheter in long axis of Q.L and psoas major if continuous analgesia is planned.
