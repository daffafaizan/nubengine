      variation of the inferior vena cava as a marker for volume status and fluid responsiveness.
      Little investigation has occurred regarding the mechanism of observed respiratory variation.
      Anesthetic plans for surgery (e.g. shoulder replacement) frequently employ interscalene
      injections to target and block the brachial plexus, which (on the same side) results in
      phrenic nerve palsy and paralysis of the diaphragm. The goal of this study is to examine the
      relationship between diaphragmatic function and variation in IVC diameter. Specifically, the
      investigators will evaluate and compare the size and variability of the inferior vena cava by
      point-of-care ultrasound before and after brachial plexus block.
