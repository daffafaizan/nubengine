           may relate to the development of TD, the investigators hypothesize that melatonin, an
           effective antioxidant, may attenuate the severity of tardive dyskinesia symptoms.

        2. Due to increased cognitive deficits in patients with TD and implication of oxidative
           stress in cognitive impairment, the investigators hypothesize that both cognitive
           impairment and tardive dyskinesia symptoms may be induced by the same pathophysiological
           stimulus--oxidative stress. Hence, the investigators further hypothesize that both
           tardive dyskinesia symptoms and cognitive deficits in patients with TD may be improved
           by melatonin simultaneously.
