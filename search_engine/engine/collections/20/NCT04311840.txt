      (DSA) of trans-cranial doppler imaging (TCD) of arteria cerebri media nimodipine is indicated
      because it is proven to improve the clinical outcome. The disfunction of cerebral
      microcirculation in rats with SAH has been documented [1-6]. Changes in sublingual
      microcirculation in patients with SAH with documented vasospasms with nimodipine has not been
      described.
