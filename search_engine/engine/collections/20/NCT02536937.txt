      subjects with severe renal impairment and normal renal function will be enrolled. Subjects
      with mild and moderate renal impairment may be enrolled in stage 2 if the results in subjects
      with severe renal impairment show a substantial effect of reduced renal function on
      pharmacokinetics.
