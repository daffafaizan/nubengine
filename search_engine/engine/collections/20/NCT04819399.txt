    
      The present Phase I dose escalation study (CATUNIBLA) in patients with non-muscle invasive
      bladder cancer (NMIBC) of high and intermediate risk for progression aims at investigating
      the therapeutic potential of Catumaxomab applied as intravesical instillation. Catumaxomab is
      an intact trifunctional bispecific monoclonal antibody and has the molecular targets EpCAM
      and CD3. It mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against human epithelial tumor
      cells including bladder cancer.

      The study consists of two parts: Part I is dose finding and will investigate 3 sequential
      cohorts consisting of 3 patients to be enrolled at the specified dose levels. After
      determination of the dose for Part II an additional number (n=X) of patients will be included
      at this dose level. Part I and part II have a screening period, 6 week treatment phase and a
      follow-up phase.
