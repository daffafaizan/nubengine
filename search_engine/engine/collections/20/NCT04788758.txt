      I. To determine the feasibility of training nurses to administer the Geriatric 8 (G8)
      screening tool in an oncology practice, to identify older patients (> 65 years old [y/o])
      that would benefit from a more extensive Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To report the positive predictive value of the G8 screening tool with the final frailty
      designation determined by the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment completed in patients
      referred to the Senior Adult Oncology Center (SAOC).

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I:

      Registered Nurses receive training on how to administer the G8 screening tool utilizing an
      Epic flowsheet to patients using a self-directed education module and by direct assessment by
      a geriatrician.

      PHASE II:

      Patients complete the G8 screening tool questionnaire over 10 minutes as part of their
      standard initial assessment, and their answers are entered into their electronic health
      record (EHR) flowsheet. Patients who score =< 14 on the G8 are referred for a CGA at SAOC,
      and these patients and their medical oncologists are made aware. Within 2 weeks of the
      initial screening, the results are communicated with the patient and medical oncologist at a
      2-hour SAOC visit. Patients with a score of > 15 on the G8 are made aware of their results
      without any referral generated.
