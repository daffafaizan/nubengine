      Palliative Care Unit. Patients excluded from participating would include those unwilling to
      participate for any reason. All patients will be invited to complete the McGill Quality of
      Life Questionnaire - Revised (McGill QOL-R) upon admission to the unit. The Questionnaire
      will not be part of the permanent medical record and the participants will remain anonymous.
      Afterwards participants will be asked if they would like to listen to music during their stay
      in the hospital. Music will be selected according to their choices from an i-Tunes playlist.
      Participants will be invited to listen to music at their own discretion. Prior to discharge
      from the hospital or after 3 days all willing patients will be again invited to complete the
      McGill QOL-R questionnaire. The participants will remain anonymous, but will be identified as
      to whether they listened or did not listen to music during their hospitalization.
