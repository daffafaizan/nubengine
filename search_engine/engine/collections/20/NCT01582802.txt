      entering prenatal care. Women will be invited to participate in a longitudinal study of Fe
      homeostasis across pregnancy and at delivery in the maternal / neonatal dyad. In all maternal
      and cord blood samples obtained, whole blood will be analyzed for hemoglobin, hematocrit,
      reticulocyte count, erythrocyte count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular Hb
      concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and red cell distribution width using standard
      procedures. Circulating Fe status indicators (serum iron, ferritin, C-reactive protein, IL-6,
      erythropoietin, transferrin receptor and hepcidin) and serum folate and vitamin B12 will be
      measured. Distributions of each variable will be examined and associations among variables
      will be explored. Multiple linear regression models will be constructed to examine specific
      relations between a) determinants of Fe deficiency anemia in the mother; b) Fe status
      indicators in the mother vs. those in the neonate; c) Fe status indicators in the mother and
      neonate with placental Fe binding proteins; and d) neonatal Fe status between siblings.
