      patients suffering acute respiratory failure. High-level evidence supports the use of NPPV to
      treat exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). More recently, NIV has
      shown to reduce the need for intubation in selected groups of patients with severe
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, immunosuppression, and respiratory failure after lung resection.
      In their subgroup analysis of the five randomized control trials, however, patients with
      acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS still couldn't avoid intubation and death even treated with
      NPPV. Till now, there has been no randomized controlled study of NPPV in patients with ALI or
      ARDS. We hypothesized that in patients with ALI/ARDS, early use of NPPV, providing
      appropriate inspired oxygen concentrations, would prevent intubation as the primary end-point
      variable, hence avert the poor outcome associated with the need of invasive ventilation.
      Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy
      of NPPV compared with a standard regime consisting of high-concentration oxygen therapy.
