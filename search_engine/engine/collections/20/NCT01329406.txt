    
      The study design is a Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Enriched Enrollment Randomized
      Withdrawal Study. This means that, upon entry into the study, all subjects will enter an
      open-label period during which they will take milnacipran for 4 weeks. Subjects will taper
      their dose up to one 100mg tablet twice daily for a total of 200mg per day. After 4 weeks,
      the subject will return to the clinic and be re-evaluated.

      Only subjects who meet certain criteria are then randomized to continue in the double-blind
      period of the study. Once a subject is randomized, he or she will take either milnacipran or
      placebo for another 4 weeks. Following the double-blind period, subjects will be tapered off
      the study medication and will receive a phone call once each week for 2 weeks for follow-up
      assessments.

      Throughout the study, subjects will complete various questionnaires and other test procedures
      aimed at sub-typing subjects based on pain mechanisms.
