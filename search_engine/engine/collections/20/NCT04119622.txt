      study. Patients who met the study criteria will receive the combination of toripalimab (240
      mg d1) with XELOX (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 QD, d1, capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, d1-d14) of a
      3-week treatment cycle up to two cycles. After the second cycle of treatment, clinical
      efficacy evaluation will be done by MDT according to iRECIST. For patients with CR/PR/SD,
      surgery will be performed within 4 weeks. For patients with disease progress, MDT will
      determine whether the surgery could be performed. If resection could not be done, the
      patients would receive Original chemotherapy with toripalimab for 1 more cycle,
      chemoradiotherapy or the second line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is Major pathological
      response.
