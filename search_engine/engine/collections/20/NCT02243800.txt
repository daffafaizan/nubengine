    
      This is an interventional, multicenter (13 rheumatology units) randomized, double-blinded
      study against placebo, lasting 24 weeks. The main objective is to demonstrate that treatment
      with cholecalciferol improves functional disability (HAQ) in patients with RA not in
      remission (DAS28 VS> 2.6 and the investigator does not think to change the treatment in the 3
      months after enrolment) and vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D <30 ng / ml). Secondary
      objectives will be to examine whether there is a decrease in disease activity (tender joint
      count, swollen joint count, VAS, EVA activity, ESR, CRP, EULAR criteria, ACR), a decrease in
      fatigue (FACIT EVA - fatigue), improved quality of life (SF36, EMIR, PASS, MOS) and the
      impact of RA (RAID).
