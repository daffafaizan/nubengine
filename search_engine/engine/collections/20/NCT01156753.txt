    
      CDX-011 consists of an antibody attached to a drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), that can
      kill cancer cells. The antibody delivers the drug to cancer cells by attaching to a protein
      called glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) that is expressed on the cancer cell. The MMAE is then
      released inside of the cell, where it interferes with cell growth and may lead to cell death.

      This study will examine the effectiveness and safety of CDX-011 in patients with advanced
      breast cancer that makes the GPNMB protein. To better assess this, the effect of CDX-011 will
      be compared to treatment with currently available cancer chemotherapy.

      Eligible patients who enroll in the study will be randomly assigned by chance to receive
      treatment with CDX-011 or with a chemotherapy chosen by their study doctor from a list of
      currently available drugs ("Investigator's Choice" chemotherapy). For each three patients
      enrolled, two will receive CDX-011 and one will receive treatment with "Investigator's
      Choice". Patients initially assigned to "Investigator's Choice" chemotherapy may be offered
      treatment with CDX-011 if their cancer worsens during this initial treatment.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is
      responding to treatment, and for any side effects that may occur.
