    
      Premenstrual Syndrome is an important collection of symptoms affecting approximately
      one-fifth of women in reproductive age.

      Acupressure is an intervention found in the nursing intervention system and defined as
      applying constant and powerful pressure on certain/specific points of the body in order to
      reduce pain, provide relaxation and relief, and to prevent or reduce nausea. Many studies
      conducted in gynecology have shown that acupressure decreased menstrual distress,
      premenstrual symptoms, back pain in women experiencing dysmenorrhea, labor pain and nausea
      and vomiting during pregnancy. In addition, it was shown in the studies that training given
      for PMS decreased the premenstrual symptoms
