      repetitive pulse magnetic stimulation and radiofrequency energy for toning of abdomen and
      reduction of subcutaneous fat. The study is a prospective multi-center open-label single-arm
      study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a single study group. Subjects will be
      required to complete three (3) treatment visits and two to three follow-up visits. All of the
      study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject device.

      At the baseline visit MRI will be performed, subject's weight and waist circumference will be
      recorded. Photos of the treated area will be taken.

      The treatment administration phase will consist of three (3) treatments, delivered once a
      week. The applicator will be applied over umbilicus and visible muscle contractions along
      with heating of the subcutaneous fat will be induced by the device.

      At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight and waist circumference will be recorded, and
      photos of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will receive Subject
      Satisfaction Questionnaire to fill in.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) including subject's
      experience of pain or discomfort after each procedure. Following each treatment
      administration and at all of the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate
      post-procedure adverse event assessment.

      During the post-procedure visits (at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits), the subjects will
      undergo MRI scanning. Also, subject's satisfaction will be noted and weight with waist
      circumference will be recorded. Photographs of the treated area will be taken. There will be
      an option of a 6-months follow-up visit, according to subject's availability.
