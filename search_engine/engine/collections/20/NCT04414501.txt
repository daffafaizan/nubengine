      I or II status children ages 4 - 10 presenting for surgery requiring general anesthesia were
      recruited for this study. They were assigned to either tablet- or VR-based groups. At our
      institution, tablet-based distraction is widely used and represents standard practice.
      Children in this control group were given tablets in the preoperative holding area before
      transport to the operating room. Content consisted of entertainment apps providing access to
      music videos, movies and games targeting various age groups.

      The study group was given a Virtual Reality Smartphone headset in the preoperative holding
      area prior to transport to the operating room. This headset was chosen because of its low
      cost and wide compatibility for a variety of smartphones. The content consisted of several VR
      environments that the child/parent could choose from.

      In both groups, the distraction with tablet or VR was continued throughout separation from
      caregivers, transport to the operating room, placement of monitors and mask induction of
      general anesthesia. Anxiety at time of separation was measured by the modified Yale
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Caregiver anxiety was measured using the State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI). Mask acceptance at induction of anesthesia was
      determined by using the Mask Acceptance Scale.
