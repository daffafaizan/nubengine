      water on amniotic fluid (AF) index in women with normohydramnios.

      Subjects and Methods: Women with normal AF index and gestational age between the 33 and 36
      weeks without maternal complications were randomized into three groups (isotonic solution,
      water, control). The isotonic solution and water groups were instructed to drink 1.5L of
      respective solution; the control group was instructed to drink 200mL of water. AF index was
      measured before and after hydration. The investigator performing the AF index was blinded to
      the subject's group.

      Results: Ninety-nine women completed the study without any maternal adverse effects. The mean
      increase in amniotic fluid index after hydration was significantly greater in the isotonic
      solution and water groups (12.1mm, p=0.02; 13.1mm, p=0.05; respectively) than the control
      group (1.4mm, p=0.74). There was no significant difference between the isotonic solution and
      water groups. Hydration with isotonic solution and water improved the chance of 20% of
      increase of amniotic fluid index in 10.2 (95% CI 1.9-98.9) and 6.0 (95% CI 1.0-45.5) times
      respectively.

      Conclusion: Maternal hydration with isotonic solution or water increased AF index in women
      with normohydramnios.
