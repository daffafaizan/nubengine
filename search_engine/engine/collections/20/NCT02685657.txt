      revealed several mechanisms of resistance to treatment. High frequency of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
      signal pathway activation was found in cells of triple negative breast cancer after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which correlated with high proliferation index and low pathological
      complete response rate. Thus, inhibition of MEK molecule - an intermediary transducer of this
      pathway may decrease activity of this pathway and restore tumor sensitivity to cytostatic
      agents.

      Hence, the use of SELUMETINIB, an oral selective inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2 kinases, in
      combination with Docetaxel should increase pathological complete response rate and in turn
      increase survival of patients with early and locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer.
