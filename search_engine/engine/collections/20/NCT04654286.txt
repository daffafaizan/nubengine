      brachial plexus injury (TBPI). However, despite the current major progress in diagnosis and
      microsurgical repair, the prognosis in TBPI remains unfavorable due to limited donor nerve
      and compromised regenerative capability of the nervous system arising from prolonged
      denervation. Therefore, there is a major need to devise new treatment strategies; and one
      possible approach is to develop cellular therapies to bioengineer new nerve tissue and/or
      modulate the endogenous regenerative mechanisms within the injured nerve.

      Our previous studies have shown that the peripheral nerve tissue engineering approach using
      human amniotic membrane seeded with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs to augment axonal
      regeneration in nerve transfer of TBPI patient revealed promising functional recovery of the
      shoulder range of motion (ROM). The investigators plan a non-randomized clinical trial in a
      single center to investigate the use of a hybrid (composite) between human amniotic membrane
      (HAM) and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC) as wrapping in the nerve
      transfer procedure of upper TBPI patients, with a focus on the augmentation of axonal
      regeneration
