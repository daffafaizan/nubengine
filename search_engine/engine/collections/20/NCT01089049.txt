      with anti-estrogenic activity, that have been shown to exert an estrogenic effect during the
      follicular phase [i.e. when estrogen is low] and an antiestrogenic effect in the luteal phase
      of a female menstrual cycle. These are plant-derived chemicals that can act as weak mimics of
      estrogen in the body. Overall these compounds have been found to be helpful in stabilizing
      the natural cyclical fluctuation of estrogen levels.

      The trial will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study in which 100 subjects
      will be recruited to one of two arms of the study: one arm will consist of pre-menopausal
      women; another will consist of post-menopausal women. Each arm of the study will be carried
      out concurrently and in one phase, with no washout period. The placebo assignment will be
      randomized within each arm of the study.

      Subjects in each arm of the study will follow the same protocol. Urine and blood samples will
      be collected from each group at both the first and last visit, and subjects will receive a
      month's supply of treatment or placebo at the first visit, which they will consume on a daily
      basis until their second lab visit 28 days later. Urine samples will be analyzed for the
      following estrogen metabolites: 2-OH-estrone and 16-Î± OH-estrone. Blood samples would be
      collected and assessed for levels of enterolactone. Pre and post-supplementation results will
      be assesses for any differences by statistical comparison.
