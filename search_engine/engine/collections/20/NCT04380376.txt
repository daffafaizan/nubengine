      therapeutic) doses inhalations of alkylating drug (melphalan) are effective in severe
      steroid-resistant bronchial asthma, a form of the disease often characterised by neutrophilic
      type of inflammation. The exacerbation frequency reduced after the treatment, steroid-sparing
      effect was shown, morphological signs of bronchial epithelial regeneration were revealed and
      quality of life of asthmatic patients, treated with ultra-low doses of melphalan, improved.
      In preclinical studies and studies with volunteers, it was found that inhalations of
      ultra-low doses of melphalan do not have cytotoxic properties, but have local and systemic
      anti-inflammatory effects and decrease the activation of lymphocytes due to blockade of heavy
      β-chain of the interleukin (IL)-2 surface receptor. In addition, in ultra-low concentrations,
      alkylating agents are able to disrupt the cell signalling through the receptor for tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF), thereby exerting a protective effect from the cytotoxic activity of
      TNF-α, which leads to the anti-inflammatory response.

      Taking into account, that severe cases of COVID are characterised with hyperergic
      inflammatory response (and in some cases even with the development of "cytokine storm") it
      can be assumed that the inhalation use of low-doses of melphalan due to its anti-inflammatory
      properties can be effective treatment for patients with COVID-associated pneumonia.
