      Participation was offered to every patient who qualified based on age and the presence of an
      active lesion in a root surfaces, in a furcation, or under an individual crown or crown
      abutment for a fixed prosthesis. The study was conducted at the dental clinic of the Roseman
      College of Dental Medicine in South Jordan, Utah. The University of California, San Francisco
      protocol for applying topical silver diamine fluoride was adapted for use with these
      patients. Lesions were flushed with water and then dried with compressed air, isolated with
      cotton rolls, and then 38% silver diamine fluoride (Advantage Arrest, Elevate Oral Care, West
      Palm Beach, FL) was applied repeatedly for two minutes with the manufacturer supplied dental
      applicator. The silver diamine fluoride was stored under the manufacturer's recommended
      conditions. If the patient complained about the taste, the lesion was coated with sodium
      fluoride varnish. All of the lesions were reevaluated for dental caries lesion activity about
      every six months and retreated regardless of their arrest status. Follow-up was for 30 months
      or until loss to follow-up.
