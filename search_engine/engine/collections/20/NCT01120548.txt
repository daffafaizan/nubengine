    
      Controlled, randomised, multicentre study. Patients will be assessed prior to starting the
      rehabilitation programme with regard to exercise tolerance parameters (cardiopulmonary
      exercise test, 6 minute walk test), ultrasound parameters and biological parameters (Na, Hb,
      BNP).

      The cardiac rehabilitation programme will include education, secondary prevention and
      physical training components in each of the two groups. The physical training component will
      include a minimal "base" of activities that is identical for both groups. The nocturnal
      therapy device will be adapted to the type of SDB specific to each patient (central, mixed,
      obstructive). The randomisation will be stratified by centre according to predictive factors
      for performance improvement during rehabilitation.

      The main objective is to evaluate the improvement in physical performance resulting from
      adapted ventilation on SDB compared to physical training alone in patients with heart
      failure.
