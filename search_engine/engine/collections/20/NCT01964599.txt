    
      Potato fiber (PF-RS, PF-RO1 and PF-RO2), supplemented in the diet of healthy individuals
      (n=60; 20 per group) and providing 30 g per day of fiber, will result in a significant
      changes in gastrointestinal function and microbiota profile.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the effect of potato fibers on stool frequency, gastrointestinal transit
           time and gastrointestinal symptoms.

        2. To determine the effect of potato fibers on microbial diversity in healthy individuals.
