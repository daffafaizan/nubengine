      retina which can cause lose in visual acuity.Some studies have shown that Half-dose
      photodynamic therapy(PDT) is effective on CSC,although accompanied with side-effects,such as
      choroidal ischemia, retinal pigmental epithelium(RPE) atrophy,and RPE rip,and with exorbitant
      price.Recent retrospective studies suggest micropulse laser (MPL) therapy may also be
      effective without obvious complications in this disease. But to date, there is no study on
      effectiveness of CSC between PDT and MPL.

      The study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial about 577nm micropulse laser
      versus half-dose photodynamic therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy.The null
      hypothesis of the study is that there is difference between MPL and half-dose photodynamic
      therapy on acute central serous chorioretinopathy at first month after treatment.The primary
      outcome measures is the proportion of eyes with complete absorption of subretinal fluid at 1
      month after treatment.
