      liver transplanted patients with early (10 POD) organ rejection (experimental arm); liver
      transplanted patients without early (10 POD) organ rejection (control arm) Primary Objective:
      Evaluation of a correlation between the reduction of Tacrolimus biliary excretion and the
      early liver failure Primary Endpoint: Increase of Tacrolimus blood-bile ratio measured before
      the onset of laboratory hepatonecrosis Secondary Objective: Analysis of the cause of any
      drug-related toxicity Secondary Endpoint: correlation study between drug dosage and biliary
      excretion level in case of blood overdose or clinical evidence of pharmacological toxicity
