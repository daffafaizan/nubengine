      generally occurs when the back tooth has a big filling and there is a risk for fracture of
      the tooth or a root canal has been performed on the tooth. An initial x-ray of the tooth and
      the surrounding teeth will be done to make sure that there is enough bone supporting the
      tooth that will be crowned.

      A receive local anesthesia will be used in the area where the crown will be made. The tooth
      area may need to be build-up with a filling material if there is not enough tooth structure
      remaining. Once this happens, then a high-speed drill will be used to a grind down of the
      tooth material using to a make smaller size of the original tooth. A small thread will be
      used to make space between the gums and tooth so an accurate replica of the tooth can be
      made. A temporary crown will be made to go over the prepared tooth and will cement until the
      final crown is ready to be cemented.

      The extra procedures will be done to measure bite force to see how much force is exerted with
      the teeth. Other extra procedures include the six month and yearly impressions as well as
      scanning of your teeth to aid in the measurement of wear.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (much like the flip of a coin) to receive either a
      crown that has metal in it or a crown that is all-ceramic. Both of these materials are
      considered standard of care in dental practice.
