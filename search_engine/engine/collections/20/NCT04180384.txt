      contain paclitaxel. HM30181 is a drug that helps the body absorb paclitaxel, a drug used to
      treat cancer. Initially this study is intended as an extension study of KX-ORAX-002
      pharmacokinetic study for patients who wish to continue Oraxol treatment and who are eligible
      to participate. Once the dose of Oraxol has been confirmed in the KX-ORAX-002 study, then
      enrollment of patients who have not participated in the KX-ORAX-002 study can be allowed. The
      purpose of this study is to check the safety and tolerability of Oraxol when it is
      administered on a weekly basis and to confirm the sustained oral bioavailability of
      paclitaxel following multiple dosing; also compare the relative bioavailability of paclitaxel
      tablets vs paclitaxel capsules (Group B only). Participants in Group B (N=8) will receive the
      same weekly paclitaxel capsule treatment as the remainder of the subjects except for 1 dosing
      week (at least 1 week following the paclitaxel capsule PK sampling period) during which they
      will receive paclitaxel tablets and undergo PK assessments.
