      significant differences in the serum vitamin C level after supplementation (3 months) between
      the intervention groups and the control group, b) to detect significant differences in health
      related quality of life (HRQOL), symptom burden, oxidative stress, and cardiac function after
      vitamin C supplementation (3 months) between the intervention groups and the control group.
