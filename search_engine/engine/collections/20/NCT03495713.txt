    
      Nivolumab 3 mg/kg will be administered on day 1 (pre-response assessment week 0) and on day 1
      and continued per standard of care and institutional practices. At the week 1 biomarker
      collection, research FDG PET/CT will be performed to assess for FDG "flare." At week 8-12,
      PET/CT will be performed for the first response assessment. If a complete anatomic response
      is seen, nivolumab monotherapy will be continued on day 1 and continued per standard of care
      and institutional practices.

      By contrast, if at week 8 less than a complete anatomic response is seen, radiotherapy to 4
      Gy x 2 fractions will be administered (post-response assessment week 0). The patient will be
      evaluated by a radiation oncologist while on treatment, and toxicities will be recorded.
      Nivolumab will be continued on day 1 and continued per standard of care and institutional
      practices.

      In either scenario, a second response assessment will be conducted ~8-12 weeks after the
      first response assessment. In either scenario, nivolumab monotherapy will be continued at the
      discretion of the treating medical oncologist.

      If there is less than CR post-RT and there is an additional untreated non-target lesion that
      can be followed, radiotherapy can again be administered when disease progresses to a
      previously untreated lesion, after which the patient will continue on the post-RT follow-up
      algorithm.
