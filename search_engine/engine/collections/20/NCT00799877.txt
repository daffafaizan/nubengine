    
      ESPRIT is a 10 year registry of patients taking HUMIRA® for Psoriasis. Patients who volunteer
      to participate will be asked to provide information about their medical history and
      experiences with HUMIRA®. No registry specific testing will be performed. Patients will be
      asked to provide data on their experiences with HUMIRA® approximately every 6 months, or as
      determined by the study doctor. No drug will be provided as a result of participation in the
      registry. All treatment decisions are independent of participation in the registry.
