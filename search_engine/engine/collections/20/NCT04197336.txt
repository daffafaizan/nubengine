      sham-controlled study that will assess the impact of bariatric embolization on the systemic
      levels of obesity-related hormones and, as a consequence, on weight loss. The goal of this
      study is to help treat obesity combining a lifestyle program and a minimally invasive,
      angiographic (i.e., through blood vessels) approach.
