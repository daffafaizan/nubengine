      blood vessels supplying blood to the heart, obstructing blood flow to the heart muscle.
      Research has also shown that blood clots may form in the blood vessels of the heart without
      causing a heart attack. At present, blood clots may be identified by techniques used during
      invasive coronary angiography, but we wish to determine whether a non-invasive test (MRI
      scanning) can be used to detect small blood clots within the blood vessels supplying blood to
      the heart muscle.
