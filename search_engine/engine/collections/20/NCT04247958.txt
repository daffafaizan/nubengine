    
      This is a prospective, single-center observational study to evaluate the performance of
      SureForm™ Staplers during robotic-assisted resections of either ascending or transverse or
      descending or sigmoid colon or rectum. Subjects with either a suspected or confirmed benign
      or malignant disease of the colon and rectum who are scheduled to undergo a robotic-assisted
      resection of the colon or rectum will be asked to provide informed consent for their
      participation in the study.

      The study will be conducted at one institution with two surgeons performing the colorectal
      procedures. The surgeons will be using either the da Vinci Xi or X Surgical System which ever
      they use as per their standard of care for the colorectal procedure. Stapling will be
      performed with SureForm™ Staplers and any of the reloads as per the surgeon's standard of
      care for the transection and/or creation of anastomosis during robotic-assisted colorectal
      procedures.
