      Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed
      advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD
      care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing
      unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and
      palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for
      patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive
      care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may
      prefer to avoid these interventions.

      To address these gaps, the investigators have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led,
      video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication,
      increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. The
      investigators will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with
      ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services
      of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids developed by the research team. This will be
      considered the standard of care for all patients meeting eligibility criteria. The ACP
      Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the
      palliative care team. The ACP Educator will work with older patients or patients with ADRD
      and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.
