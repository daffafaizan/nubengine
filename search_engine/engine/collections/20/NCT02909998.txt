      difficulty of treatment. 30% of patients are non-responders and / or relapse upon
      discontinuation of treatment. Some of these treatments are not always well tolerated,
      sometimes with infectious complications including tuberculosis limiting the use of biological
      therapies. This study will validate a battery of genetic markers to predict responders
      biotherapy, determine the prognosis of patients, these treatments are reserved for the most
      severe forms, and thus improve the care of patients.
