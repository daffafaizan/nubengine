      the University of SÃ£o Paulo since June 2013. The investigators are including patients with
      clinical diagnosis of supraspinatus tendinitis based on the Lateral Jobe Test.

      The patients are being randomized in two arms: Active (2% 5ml lidocaine for suprascapular
      nerve block and home exercises) and placebo control (saline solution as the nerve block and
      home exercises). The randomization is being performed in blocks of 4 and 6.

      The investigator, the raters, the MD who makes the procedure and the patients are blind to
      treatment.

      4 visits are being performed. Screening and initial evaluation visit, procedure visit, follow
      up 1 week after intervention and follow up 12 weeks after intervention.

      The sample size was estimated to be 54 in each arm.
