      women for antenatal care visit. Finger-prick blood (300 ÂµL) will be collected and used to
      test for malaria with the HS-RDT, as well as with conventional good quality RDTs, microscopy
      and local NAATs (LAMP and nPCR). Dried blood spots will also be collected for qRT-PCR
      testing. Patient information (demographics, obstetric history, malaria prevention measures,
      etc.) as well as laboratory results will be recorded and entered into a dedicated database.
