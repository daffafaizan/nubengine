      with all the pulmonary veins connecting to the right heart system through collateral vessels,
      accounts for about 3% of congenital heart disease. Pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO) is a
      major complication, with limited effective reinterventions and poor outcomes. The major
      challenge for surgical repair of TAPVC is to lower the incidence of PVO.

      Previous studies in our center showed the abnormal coagulation function, such as elevated
      International Normalized Ratio (INR), and decreasing of prothrombin activity, are associated
      with a higher rate of PVO. Some researches suggested that postoperative application of
      anticoagulants might reduce the incidence of PVO, however, the evidences are still limited.
      This trial will randomize patients to receive either conventional postoperative management or
      continuous infusion anticoagulant (Heparin) until the removal of deep vein catheter. The
      primary endpoint will be incidence of PVO, days of chest drainage more than 40ml/d, and
      mortality rate. Secondary endpoints including readmission, functional capacity assessment,
      quality of life and incidence of complications will also be collected.
