      that many macrosomic infants are born to non-diabetic mothers. However, this presents the
      question of whether our current accepted means of diagnosis is reflecting the true prevalence
      of GDM. The 3-hour GTT measures glycemic control over a limited period of time. A more
      prolonged period of monitoring makes more physiologic sense, as it would paint a picture of a
      patient's overall trend before a diagnosis can be confirmed or excluded. Given the ability of
      the CGMS and capillary glucose monitor to follow glycemic trends over an extended time
      period, these methods may prove more effective at identifying patients with abnormal glucose
      tolerance. As these modalities test the patients in their native environments, the effect of
      dietary changes prior to the testing period may be minimized, potentially providing an more
      accurate assessment of abnormal glucose utilization. Furthermore, both modalities should be
      more cost-effective than the 3- hour GTT.
