      recurrent during later life or have an onset beyond 60 years (late-life depression). The
      multifactorial genesis of depression in old age includes psychosocial, vascular and metabolic
      factors and requires multimodal and multi-professional therapy including physical activity
      and psychosocial interventions. However, there is still a percentage of older people who do
      not show improvement in depressive symptoms.

      In recent years, various types of virtual reality are gaining in popularity, primarily
      because of the availability and ease of use. A systematic review from 2018 concluded that VR
      treatment had moderate to large effects in anxiety and depression, compared to controls and
      it could be another effective choice available to clinicians and patients.

      Therefore, the aim of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual therapy in
      the elderly, in whom the previous multimodal therapeutic program has not brought the expected
      results.
