      design (Figure 1). Each subject was required to visit the laboratory on five occasions with
      72-96 hours between sessions. During the first laboratory visit, each subject performed an
      incremental test on a treadmill to familiarize the subjects with the testing procedures. For
      the second laboratory visit, each subject performed an incremental treadmill test to
      exhaustion to determine their ventilatory threshold (VT). The third laboratory visit was
      completed in the morning (06:00-09:00) and required subjects to consume a standardized meal
      after fasting overnight (8 hours) and sat quietly for 30 minutes before baseline heart rate
      and blood pressure values were recorded. The subjects were then randomly assigned to ingest
      the supplement (one or two doses) or placebo and sit quietly for another 30 minutes. The
      ingredients of the supplement (Cellucor, Bryan, TX) are provided in Table 1. The placebo was
      non-energetic and controlled for similar appearance and taste. At the 15-minute and 30-minute
      post-ingestion periods (of the pre-workout supplement or placebo), resting heart rate and
      blood pressure were recorded for a second and third time, respectively. Subjects then
      performed a 30-minute constant-velocity treadmill run at 90% of their VT. The subjects then
      returned to the laboratory for their fourth and fifth visits to ingest the remaining
      substances (1-dose, 2-dose, or placebo) and undergo the same testing procedures (including
      time of day) as the third visit. Each subject recorded 2-day food logs (MyFitnessPal, Inc.,
      USA) prior to each laboratory visit.
