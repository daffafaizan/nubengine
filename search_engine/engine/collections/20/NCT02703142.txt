      esophagogastrostomy often cause severe complications, such as leakage, necrotic organs, and
      strictures. However the evaluation and prevention before developing gastric conduit ischemia
      have been established. The investigators have built a hypothesis that the evaluation for
      gastric mucosal ischemia in early phase after esophagectomy predict the complication of
      gastric conduit. Thus, the purpose of this study is the safety and efficacy of endoscopic
      evaluation about reconstructive organs after esophagectomy. The investigators evaluate
      endoscopic predictions using classifications in acute phase after esophagogastrostomy.
