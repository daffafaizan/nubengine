      1985, with control of polio in China evidence of the effectiveness of its vaccine. The
      company plans to introduce a liquid formulation of bOPV (types 1 and 3) to meet increasing
      global demand with the phasing-out of tOPV. The proposed study is intended to provide data
      sufficient to obtain World Heath Organization (WHO) prequalification for the BBIBP bOPV, thus
      making the vaccine available to help meet global demand.

      Infants were enrolled and randomized prior to the birth dose of bOPV. The first dose of study
      vaccine was administered during the first two weeks of life and then co-administered with the
      primary Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) series vaccines in Kenya at 6, 10 and 14
      weeks of age. The Kenya EPI schedule includes the following additional vaccines:

        -  Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin Vaccine (BCG) at birth

        -  Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoid with Whole Cell Pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae Type V
           vaccine (Hib), and Hepatitis B Vaccine (DTwPHibHep) at 6, 10, 14 weeks;

        -  Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine (PCV) at 6, 10, 14 weeks

        -  Rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) at 6, 10 weeks
