        -  To evaluate the predictive value of proteomic profiling on the effect of second-line
           therapy with erlotinib hydrochloride vs standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed disodium or
           docetaxel) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To assess the role of other known tissue-based predictive markers (e.g., EGFR-gene copy
           number, EGFR-protein expression, pAkt, pMAPK, EGFR mutations, EMT markers, and k-Ras
           mutation).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to smoking status,
      performance status, proteomic profile, and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed disodium, docetaxel, or
           another standard drug.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard non-chemotherapy treatment with erlotinib
           hydrochloride.

      Serum is collected after failure of first-line therapy for proteomic analysis by
      matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. Tissue and blood samples are
      collected periodically for analysis including EGFR based on IHC and FISH, EGFR and k-Ras
      mutations, pAkt, pMAPK by IHC, and EMT markers based on IHC and breath condensate protein
      profile.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.
