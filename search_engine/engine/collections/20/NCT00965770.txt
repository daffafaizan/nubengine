      in the rates of repeat abortions between three groups: 1. women choosing to have an
      intrauterine device (IUD) inserted immediately post-abortion, 2. those choosing to begin oral
      contraceptives immediately post-abortion, and 3. all other choices for post abortion
      contraception including those stating an intention to obtain contraceptives at a later time
      or from an alternate location or to use no contraception. This data will then be used to
      conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of health system provision for cost-free IUDs
      post-abortion.

      The researchers will conduct a retrospective observational cohort study by chart review. The
      researchers propose to review the charts of 600 women undergoing abortions between January 1,
      2001 and December 31, 2004 at Kelowna General Hospital's Women's Services Clinic. The
      researchers will record the following data from each chart: age, parity, gestational age,
      date of index therapeutic abortion (TA), dates of subsequent TAs, contraception used at the
      time of the index conception, contraceptive method chosen post-abortion, and outcome of
      follow-up at two weeks, such as expulsion of IUD. The researchers will also record the
      recurrent pregnancy rates.
