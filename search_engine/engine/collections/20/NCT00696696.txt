      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathways, a
      strategy which has shown variable clinical efficacy. This inconsistency is not surprising,
      given the knowledge that tumors have a certain level of signal redundancy which may limit the
      effectiveness of any one single-targeted therapy. The dual blockade of the EGF and VEGF
      pathways takes aim at two of the most active cascades in tumorigenesis. Preliminarily, a
      phase II study done in pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine, bevacizumab and erlotinib or
      cetuximab has shown promising results and will most likely proceed to phase III study for
      definitive efficacy assessment (Kindler et al, 2006).

      In this study, targeted blockade is carried one step further with the inhibition of the
      signaling cascade downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases at the level of raf. Given the fact
      that the majority of pancreatic tumors display constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
      pathway, it is hoped that the addition of sorafenib to gemcitabine and erlotinib will obtain
      a more complete blockade of the signal transduction cascade responsible for pancreatic tumor
      growth and progression.
