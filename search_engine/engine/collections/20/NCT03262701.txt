      for a few decades. It is widely available in a bottle of 3% in liquid. The use of hydrogen
      peroxide in gel type in 1.7% as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy has been
      introduced but there are limited information on the efficacy. The current study is to design
      to evaluate the adjunctive treatment outcome of hydrogen peroxide gel in custom tray
      application in individuals with chronic periodontitis receiving non surgical therapy, scaling
      and root planing(SRP). To test the adjunct effect of HP gel in tray, there will be three
      parallel arms, one with the gel for the period of 26 week, one with the gel for 13 weeks and
      control group without the gel.
