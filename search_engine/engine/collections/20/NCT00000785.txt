      and associated with the concurrent HIV epidemic. The total number of CPCRA patients who will
      develop, or who have experienced, confirmed TB is unknown. It is critical to determine the
      depth and breadth of the current problem of drug-resistant TB.

      For both retrospective and prospective components of the study, demographic, geographic, HIV
      and TB risk factor information will be collected on CPCRA patients with confirmed pulmonary
      or extrapulmonary TB. Mycobacterial culture results will be recorded. Retrospective data will
      be collected on CPCRA patients with confirmed tuberculosis who have been diagnosed since
      January 1992 until the time of site registration. Prospective data will be collected on CPCRA
      patients with confirmed tuberculosis diagnosed during the period of 1 to 2 years following
      site registration.
