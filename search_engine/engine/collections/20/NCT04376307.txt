      informed about the study and their written consent will be obtained. On the morning of the
      operation, anesthesia gas monitor calibration and leak test will be started with automatic
      tests of the anesthesia device (Drager-Perseus A500).The leak test for the ventilator and
      breathing circuit for the patient will be repeated in all operations. The carbon dioxide trap
      will be evaluated in terms of its dryness and color and will be replaced at appropriate
      times. The patients who were taken to the operation table were venously opened with a
      20-gauge cannula from the back of the hand, and perfusion of 10 ml / kg / h 0.9% sodium
      chloride was started. ECG, SPO2, NIBP monitoring (Siemens SC-7700), starting before
      anesthesia (basal), after induction, after intubation 1.min and 5., 10., 15., 20., 25., 30.,
      40 ., 50th, 60th, 75th, 90th, 105th, 120th minutes and preoperative arterial blood gas (AKG)
      will be taken.1μg / kg fentanyl (Fentanyl Citrate, Abbott Lab. North Chicago, USA), 5-7 mg /
      kg thiopental (Pental) for anesthesia induction after preoxygenation in 100% O2 and fresh gas
      flow 4L / min with spontaneous breathing for 3 minutes with mask sodium, IE Ulagay, Istanbul,
      Turkey) and 0.1 mg / kg vecuronium (Norcuro, Organon, Oss. the Netherlands) was administered
      iv. When muscle relaxation was observed, orotracheal intubation was performed and the patient
      (Dräger Perseus) was adjusted with an anesthesia device to have a tidal volume of 7-10 ml /
      kg, respiratory frequency 12 / min, and the ratio of I: E 1: 2. The tube was placed by
      selective intubation with the help of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. MAC values will be kept
      between 4-6%. Alarm limits FiO2 30% lower limit, desflurane 10% vol upper limit, EtCO2 45mmhg
      upper limit Paw 5cmh20 six lower limit, 30cmh2o upper limit set. co2 absorbent, as sodalime
      (Sorbo-lime, Berk, Turkey) were used.

      Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis will be performed at zero and then half hour intervals of
      single lung ventilation. Special attention will be paid not to open the system. Muscle
      relaxant antagonism will be achieved in all patients with 0.01mg / kg of atropine and 0.03mg
      / kg of neostigmine. At the end of the operation, the recovery period characteristics of all
      patients at the 1st, 5th, and 10th minutes before and after extubation were evaluated with
      Aldrete Kraulik's post-anesthesia evaluation system. Gas consumption amounts will be
      monitored on the monitor and recorded.
