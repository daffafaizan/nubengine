    
      The study consists of a main study and a voluntary, open-label (participants and researchers
      are aware about the treatment participants are receiving), 24-week study extension. The main
      study includes a Screening Run-in Period (Week -6 to Week 0), an Open-label Treatment Period
      (Week 0 to Week 16), an Open-label or Double-blind Treatment Period (Week 16 to Week 52). The
      main study also includes a Follow-up Period from Week 52 through Week 64 for those
      participants who will not participate in the 24-week study extension. Participants,
      participating in 24-week extension (at Week 52), will receive open-label golimumab SC
      injections every 4 weeks from Week 52 up to Week 72 and will be followed-up up to Week 88.
      All eligible participants will initiate the treatment with open-label golimumab SC injection
      every 4 weeks up to Week 12. At Week 16, depending upon the treatment response either
      participants will continue to receive open-label golimumab SC injection every 4 weeks up to
      Week 48 or participants will be randomly assigned to receive following 2 treatments: 1-
      golimumab 50mg SC injection every 4 weeks along with placebo intravenous infusion every 8
      weeks through Week 48; 2- Placebo SC injection every 4 weeks along with golimumab 2mg/kg
      intravenous infusion every 8 weeks through Week 48. At Week 52, participants who choose to
      participate in the 24-week study extension will receive open-label golimumab 50 mg SC
      injections every 4 weeks through Week 72. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
