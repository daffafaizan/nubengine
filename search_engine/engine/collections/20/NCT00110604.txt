      have been associated with a variety of age-related diseases and disorders, including
      cardiovascular disease, dementia and hearing impairment. Extra folate, for example in the
      form of folic acid, is known to decrease the concentrations of plasma total homocysteine.

      We examined whether 0.8 mg/d folic acid could slow down atherosclerotic progression and the
      above mentioned age-related processes.
