      tomatoes is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), while, low intake is
      associated with an increased incidence of CVD. This beneficial effects have been attributed
      especially to lycopene, an antioxidant present in high concentration within tomatoes but
      other substances could be of importance.

      Endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of atherosclerosis leading to CVD. The aim of the
      present study is therefore to investigate whether consumption of tomato products ameliorates
      peripheral endothelial function, triggered by a high fat meal, in human volunteers in a
      randomised, crossover dietary intervention study.

      Study design:

      Investigators are randomising healthy men (N=14-28) to consume a high fat meal either with or
      without tomato sauce (80 gr) in a cross-over design with a 7 days wash-out period. During the
      week before the study all the subjects will be maintained in a low fibers diet and only
      subjects randomized to tomatoes will receive a daily dose of 80 mg of tomato sauce (80 gr for
      7 days= total load 560 mg).
