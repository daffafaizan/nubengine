      clinical settings. The properties of ICG ,which is a water-soluble amphiphilic molecule with
      a molecular weight of 775 Dalton and a hydrodynamic diameter of 1.2nm ,render it an excellent
      lymphatic contrast agents if injected into the lymphatic system. ICG near-infrared(NIR)
      fluorescent imaging has achieved satisfactory results in the localization of sentinel lymph
      nodes in patients with breast cancer,non-small cell lung cancer,and gastric cancer. Liang et
      al have suggested that 253 lymph nodes dissection in rectal cancer is technically demanding
      ,and that learning curve for laparoscopic 253 lymph nodes dissection requires minimally 20
      procedures. Currently,it was still controversial about 253 lymph nodes dissection in rectal
      cancer surgery. However, lymph node involvement is a major prognostic factor for survival
      after rectal cancer surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to harvest more station 253 nodes for
      the better long-term survival and the more precise staging.

      In this study, investigators will randomly assign patients to the indocanine green (ICG)
      group and control (CL)group. Number of harvested station 253 lymph nodes, number of positive
      station 253 lymph nodes, will be evaluated and compared. Investigators will also evaluate
      patients, operative time, blood loss, post-operative hospital stay and complications.
