    
      PD patients in need of IPG replacement will be screened to identify the ones eligible for
      enrollment.

      Randomized patients will undergo 2 days of experimental sessions (i.e. one per each type of
      stimulation mode, cDBS and aDBS), in a well-controlled environment (i.e. during
      hospitalization). During each experimental session experienced neurologists will collect
      information on safety and efficacy endpoints.
