    
      Cross-sectional study comparing bilateral ADL activities for stroke survivors, SCI
      paraplegics, UE amputees, adults with CP, and healthy controls. The study participants will
      perform 4 ADL tasks with the BiAS passive robots. From these tasks, the BiAS robots will
      provide information regarding position, velocity, distance, displacement, etc. This, along
      with video information provided by the 3D Kinect and EEG neuroheadset, will be used as the
      basis of the investigators data and aid in informing members of the research team on how the
      respective impairments affected upper limb kinematics on ADL tasks.

      Participation in the study will include the following steps:

        1. Informed Consent: After arrival, subjects will review and sign the consent form with
           study personnel present.

        2. Pre-Assessments: A member of the research team will evaluate the subjects' upper
           extremity and assess their ability to use it. Subjects will be evaluated using a battery
           of assessments such as, but not limited to, the Box and Block, Pin and Prick, and grip
           strength using a dynamometer.

        3. Break: Subjects will be given a 15 minute break.

        4. BiAS passive robot system: Subjects will be introduced to the device and each wrist will
           be placed on to the end of each robot. As common therapy tasks are performed by the
           subject, the BiAS devices will collect the data along with the video from 3D Kinect, ECG
           gelled electrodes, and the EEG neuroheadset. After each of the 4 ADL activities,
           subjects will be asked about their level of exercise and discomfort, if any. After
           subjects finish all exercises with the BiAS, they will be thanked for their
           participation in the study.

        5. Video and photos may be collected to determine subject quality of ADL movement.
