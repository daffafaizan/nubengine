      cases of severe bleeding. In all cases the functional is a major issue with a potential reach
      of walking ability and maintaining the seated and standing positions. The treatment of such
      lesions requires management to a specialist, or the ability to use such centers for advice or
      transferring patients. This organization was recommended after the symposium of the French
      Society of Orthopedic Surgery (SOFCOT) in 2009. With the aging population, the incidence and
      clinical features of these fractures have evolved to worsening the functional prognosis. Club
      Basin acetabulum, body SOFCOT, wants to achieve an observational study assessing needs and
      practices at national and regional level. The long-term objective is to propose a regional
      organization of care of these patients in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated.

      FORMAT OF RESEARCH retrospective observational study of SNIIRAM data on hospitalizations for
      broken pelvis and acetabulum (CCAM codes S32.40 / S32.41 / S32.30 / S32.31 / S32.10 / S32.11
      / S32.50 / S32 .51 / S32.70 / S32.71 / S32.80 / S32.81), with collection of the following
      data:

        -  Patient demographics: age, sex, comorbidities (DRG coding), place of residence.

        -  Length of hospital stay

        -  Treatment undertaken: CCAM coding during hospitalization

        -  Mortality at 30 days and 1 year.
