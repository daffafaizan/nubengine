      Trial will enroll up to 240 subjects (160 recipients and 80 donors). Qualified donors and/or
      CMV-seropositive recipients (donor/recipient pairs or recipient-only subjects) will be
      assigned randomly to receive either a CMV vaccine or a placebo vaccine. Donors will receive 3
      vaccines prior to donation and recipients will receive 1 vaccine pretransplant and up to
      three vaccines posttransplant. Recipients will be followed for up to 1 year after transplant
      to evaluate the safety of the vaccine and to see if there is a clinical benefit in the group
      that received the CMV vaccine. The incidence rates of CMV infection, disease, and other
      complications from immunosuppression and/or transplantation will be studied.
