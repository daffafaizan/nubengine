      prospective, randomized, multi-center fashion to determine if CAS without CPD is feasible and
      safe in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis.

      Study participants After the exclusion criterias were applied 279 patients were divided as
      139 patients in the CAS with CPD arm and 140 patients in the CAS without CPD arm. Our study
      population includes patients with severe carotid artery stenosis referred to the 3 study
      center hospitals.
