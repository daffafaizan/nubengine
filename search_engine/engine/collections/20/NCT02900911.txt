      Although current diagnostic and therapeutic protocols try to preserve swallowing and
      speaking, acute or late dysphagia as well as a poor quality of life are frequent in these
      patients.

      Some studies have reported an improvement in swallowing function after an exercise based
      intervention following radiation therapy (RT), regardless the need of concomitant
      chemotherapy (RT-QT). Other studies focus the interest in the use of prophylactic exercises
      to prevent or minimize post-swallowing dysfunction.

      Patients receiving RT or RT-QT refer worsening of their quality of life, especially during
      the first days after treatment. One study suggests that rehabilitation prior to cancer
      treatment could potentially improve quality of life. However, this observation should be
      contrasted with a randomized study.
