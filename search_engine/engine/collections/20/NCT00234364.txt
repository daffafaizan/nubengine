      correlation between treatment with the ergotamine derivative dopamine agonists (pergolide)
      and restrictive valvular heart disease. The mechanisms are thought to be the same as with the
      former used anorectikum, fenfluramine and other drugs stimulating the 5HT-2B receptor.

      In a blinded manner we make physiologic and echocardiographic examination on 160 Parkinson
      patients treated with either ergotamine or non-ergotamine derivative dopamine agonists (80
      patients in each group) to see whether Parkinson patients treated with ergotamine derivatives
      have more heart valvular disease
