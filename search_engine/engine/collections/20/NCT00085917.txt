      become more significant among patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. Several studies have
      shown that coinfected individuals develop earlier and more severe liver disease. Pegylated
      interferon alpha with ribavirin has become the therapy of choice among people with HCV alone.
      This is a randomized controlled study to address the safety and efficacy of a 4 week
      induction therapy consisting of twice-weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2a and daily
      ribavirin on HIV-1 and hepatitis C coinfected individuals. Twenty-two patients who are
      infected with both HIV and HCV and who also have evidence of chronic hepatitis will be
      randomized to receive peginterferon alpha-2a either twice weekly or once weekly for four
      weeks. They will then continue with standard weekly peginterferon for 44 more weeks. The
      patients will receive standard daily dose of ribavirin during the entire 48 weeks. These
      patients will be monitored for peginterferon level, HCV viral load, HIV viral load and CD4
      counts and undergo a baseline liver biopsy and another at the end of 72 weeks. The results of
      the study will enable us to better delineate the efficacy of twice weekly peginterferon
      induction therapy in suppressing the hepatitis C virus in the first 4 weeks of the therapy.
      Since viral suppression for hepatitis C in the early phase of the combination treatment has
      predictive values for long term eradication of the virus, a therapy that improves early viral
      suppression may improve the long term cure rate. This will be especially important given the
      current low cure rate of HCV among HIV coinfected individuals.
