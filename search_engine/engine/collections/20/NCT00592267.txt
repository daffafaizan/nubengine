    
      To address the urgent therapeutic needs of children and adolescents ages 4-17 with pediatric
      bipolar disorder, we have designed a series of clinical trials aimed at evaluating critical
      components of the treatment needs of this under-served and under-researched population. This
      approach will allow us to provide a full complement of clinical trials that will meet the
      most pressing needs of the bipolar children and adolescents and their families who are
      currently awaiting treatment.

      Although these protocols have received prior IRB approval, potential participants present
      with a widely varied set of complaints not always discernable in a telephone screening
      interview. This state of affairs makes it very difficult to ask subjects to sign a specific
      clinical protocol without obtaining additional clinical information. Because of this we are
      proposing potential subjects to consent to undergo an in-depth clinical assessment that will
      allow subjects to be screened by a clinician for eligibility to a diverse clinical trials
      program available to them.
