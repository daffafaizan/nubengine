      with pathogens that are normally found as commensal or possible pathogens in the
      gastrointestinal tract. This is probably a consequence of the illness that is the cause of
      their hospital admission.

      Most patients admitted to hospital are elderly. Those patients often have their natural
      functions down regulated including their ability to secure their airway from aspiration.
      Acute illness whether you are old or young leads to changes in the intestinal microbiological
      flora. Bacteria normally found in the colon or distal ileum frequently appear in the stomach
      and more alarming in the oropharynx. Weakened by the illness, acute or chronic, there is an
      increased risk of aspiration and when there are pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx,
      aspiration is likely to induce pneumonia - health related pneumonia.

      For intubated ICU patients we have demonstrated a reduction of colonization with enteric
      bacteria by applying probiotics in the mouth.

      After a screening period to find out what groups of patients that are most vulnerable, we
      will in a randomised way give probiotics to half of the included patients and to the other
      patients only the filling material (maltodextrin).

      With this procedure our aim is to show a reduction of pathogens in the oropharynx and as a
      secondary outcome we hope to see a reduction of pneumonia.

      Samples for microbiological analysis will be taken during the first day of admission to
      hospital and then at specified intervals.
