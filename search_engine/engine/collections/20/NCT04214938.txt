      magnification and the ability to take still and video images (3). NPL is a simple, safe,
      cost-effective, and generally well-tolerated procedure. However, a portion of patients may
      refuse to allow the procedure to be repeated as they find it uncomfortable, intolerable, or
      painful.To date, only a local anesthetic and/or decongestant substance is applied to the
      nostrils to relieve pain and increase the field of view and to reduce the duration of
      examination and unpleasant sensations for the patient on NPL procedures.This randomised
      control trial was undertaken to compare the application of nasal hypertonic sea water (3.5%)
      with nasal lidocaine 10%, topical nasal decongestant xylometazoline 0.1% (OtrivineTM) and
      nasal isotonic serum physiologic as placebo group in relation to how they effectively improve
      the adequacy of the examination and if they reduce pain and discomfort associated with
      endoscopic nasal examination.
