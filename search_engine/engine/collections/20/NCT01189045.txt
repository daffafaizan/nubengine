      To determine the effects of aerobic exercise after stroke on cardiorespiratory fitness,
      cardiovascular function, stroke risk factors, walking and health-related quality of life.
      This study will also examine the retention of these effects after the exercise program ends.

      Methods

      A randomized controlled study design will be used. Sixty participants will be randomized to
      participate in one of 2 treatment arms (6 months duration, 3 days / week, 1 hour / session):

        1. BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY (non-aerobic) PROGRAM will be comprised of individualized upper
           and lower body stretching, or balance activities, yoga- or Tai Chi-style classes.

        2. AEROBIC PROGRAM will be comprised of a structured, progressive aerobic training program.

      Participants will be evaluated at 3 time points - baseline (0 months), post-intervention (6
      months) and follow up (8 months) - for stroke risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness,
      arterial stiffness, echocardiography measures, inflammatory biomarkers, ambulatory capacity
      and health-related quality of life.
