      amenable to surgery or transplantation or manifested with oligometastasis. Recent studies
      have shown that SBRT plus immune checkpoint inhibitors may potentiate the effect of RT on
      tumor cell killing. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Combined With Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Patients in
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
