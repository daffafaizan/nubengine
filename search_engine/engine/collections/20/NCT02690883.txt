    
      Objective:

      To evaluate effect of exenatide on 24-UAER in patients with diabetic nephropathy

      Hypothesis:

      Compared with glargine plus lispro group, at 24 weeks, glargine plus exenatide group can: 1)
      take more significant reduction of 24h-UAER; 2) take more reduction of ACR; 3) take more
      weight loss, blood pressure reduction; 4) take lower hypoglycemia incidence and less insulin
      dosage.

      Primary endpoint： The proportion of reduction of 24h-UAER(urinary albumin excretion rates)

      Secondary endpoints： 24h-UAER at 24 weeks; the rate of urinary albumin to creatinine
      ratio(ACR) change at 24 weeks; HbA1c, FPG,PPG, weight , BP

      Treatment duration： 24weeks

      Patient/Sites： 90 patients / 3 sites

      Timeline (best case)： Planed duration of recruitment period: 6 month Planed date for first
      screening: 1 October 2015 Planed completion of the last subject: 1 March 2017 Planned
      completion of clinical trial report: 30 October 2017
