      versions of exposure psychotherapy to support the capability gap for the treatment of active
      duty service members and veterans with PTSD by comparing different exposure psychotherapy
      modalities. The overall objective of this study is to determine if compressed psychotherapy
      can be used as an effective alternative treatment for PTSD and to compare the impact of TMT
      and PE on social, familial, and occupational impairment. The primary objectives will be to
      compare 1) 3 week TMT with 12 week PE and 2) 3 week TMT with 2 week PE for the effectiveness
      of reducing PTSD symptoms in a gated approach or some other method to control for
      multiplicity. Outcomes will be determined based upon self-report, clinician ratings, as well
      as other aspects of psychopathology, and social/emotional functioning. The addition of the
      TMT group component will be assessed in particular to determine its impact on social,
      familial, and occupational impairment. Blood samples should be collected from participants at
      baseline and at the end of the treatment period in order to identify PTSD biomarkers, e.g.
      predictors of response, biological subtypes of PTSD, and therapeutic markers. Collection,
      storage, and transfer of the blood samples to DoD should be performed according to
      standardized protocols provided by the DoD. One or more site visits may occur in order to
      assess adherence to standardized protocols.
