      disabling, and expensive condition. Despite advances over the last 30 years, the prognosis of
      patients with IHF remains poor. At present, there has been increasing interest in attempting
      to repair the failing heart with the use of stem cells, since this approach has the potential
      to regenerate dead myocardium and thus alleviate the underlying cause of IHF.

      A very primitive population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been isolated from a
      continuum from the sub-amnion to perivascular region of umbilical cord, referred to as
      Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). WJMSCs retain a combination of most of their embryonic
      stem cell (ESC) and MSC markers in primary culture and early passages, thus retaining their
      multipotent stem cell characteristics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that WJMSCs can
      be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and to integrate into
      the vasculature and ischemic cardiac tissue, as well as to improve heart function
      significantly. Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with ischemic heart failure secondary to myocardial
      infarction to receive an intracoronary or intravenous infusion of WJMSCs or placebo, to
      investigate the therapeutic safety and efficacy of WJMSCs in patients with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy.
