      mineral density. Tenofovir alafenamide(TAF) is a novel tenofovir prodrug that reduces
      tenofovir plasma concentrations by 90%, thereby decreasing off-target side-effects. The
      investigators aimed to assess whether efficacy, safety, and tolerability were non-inferior in
      participants switched to TAF versus in those remaining on TDF. This is a prospective clinical
      study.
