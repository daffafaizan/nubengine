      processing. This makes red areas appear redder and white areas appear whiter. Thus, it is
      easier to recognize a slight difference in color of the mucosa. Based on previous experience,
      a new LCI based endoscopic diagnosis criteria called CMV (color- microstructure-vessel)
      criteria has been proposed, which could be used for judging the gastric mucosal lesions. LCI
      has the advantage of detecting color changes of the mucosa, and this could provide very
      valuable and useful evidence for making endoscopic diagnosis. In this study, a blinded random
      controlled clinical trial is designed to further validate the diagnostic value of LCI based
      CMV criteria for gastric diseases.
