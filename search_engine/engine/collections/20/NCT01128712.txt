      Interictal anxiety symptoms are reported in two-thirds of patients with epilepsy and
      represent an underrecognized and undertreated aspect of the disorder. Interictal anxiety is
      postulated to stem from both fear of seizure recurrence ("seizure phobia") and dispersed
      locus of control.In addition, anxiety and the most common forms of partial onset epilepsy are
      viewed to arise from dysfunction in a common neurobiological substrate-the amygdala and other
      structures within the limbic system.

      Background on Pregabalin

      Pregabalin (CI-1008,Lyrica) is a chemical analogue of the mammalian neurotransmitter
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),although it does not bind to or activates GABA receptors or
      inhibit GABA uptake. Pregabalin is an alpha-2-delta ligand that has analgesic, anxiolytic,
      and antiepileptic activity.

      Rationale

      Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used for mood disorders including anxiety.Pregabalin
      (PGB) the most recently FDA-approved AED for add-on therapy for refractory partial seizures
      also has demonstrated efficacy in Generalized Anxiety Disorder. PGB binds to the
      alpha-2-delta subunit protein of voltage-gated calcium channels, and in animal models, has
      anxiolytic and anti-epileptic effects via pre-synaptic inhibition of the release of several
      excitatory neurotransmitters.
