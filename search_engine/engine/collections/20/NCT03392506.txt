      estimate the benign and malignant lymph nodes indirectly through the quantitative and
      visualized analysis of the elastic coefficient of the bronchus through the CP-EBUS
      elastography mode.

      The purpose of this study is to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the
      intrathoracic lymph nodes by CP-EBUS elastography for the first time, and to make a benign
      and malignant diagnosis.

      120cases will be enrolled.Compared with the commonly used methods to evaluate intrathoracic
      lymph node metastasis, the accuracy of chest CT and PET-CT were compared. The lymph node
      staging method and the final pathological gold standard of the three groups were compared, so
      as to verify the accuracy and clinical popularization of the bronchial ultrasound
      elastography mode.
