    
      This is a double-armed, randomized clinical trial. The primary aim of this study is to
      compare whether a Stationary Brushing Technique (SBT) is more effective in the reduction of
      gingival inflammation than permitting people to brush the way they normally do without
      instruction (Non-Stationary Brushing Technique).

      Gingival inflammation is evidenced by the percentage (%) sites with Bleeding on Probing
      (BoP). The primary time-point will be at 4 weeks.

      The amount of toothbrush bristle deformation at 4 weeks, 12, and 16 weeks of brushing with a
      SBT and with a NSBT will also be evaluated. 3. The secondary evaluation of BoP will be at the
      12 and 16 week time-point.
