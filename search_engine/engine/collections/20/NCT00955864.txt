      hormonal influences like after puberty, during pregnancy, and with menopause. It has been
      determined that during pregnancy, prior to cervical ripening, cross linked collagen fibrils
      are organized in tight bundles which provide tensile strength, rigidity and stiffness. As the
      cervix ripens in preparation for labor, cervical collagen concentration is decreases and
      solubility increases. However, there are no noninvasive techniques available to evaluate such
      structural changes especially of the collagen of cervix. Developing a non-invasive way to
      evaluate the characteristics of cervical structure and collagen may aid in identifying women
      who are at risk of early cervical dilation. A specially designed polarized camera attached to
      a conventional colposcope can be used to take cervical images. Analyzing these images may
      enable us to visualize the collagen network in cervix. The purpose of this study is to
      explore the usefulness of polarized camera images in evaluating the cervical structure of
      healthy women at different ages. After evaluating and validating this approach in healthy,
      nonpregnant women, we plan to assess the cervical structure of pregnant women, some of whom
      may be at risk of early cervical dilation.
