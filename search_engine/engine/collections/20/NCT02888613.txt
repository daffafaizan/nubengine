      rapid recovery of respiratory, renal functions and intestinal transit, with limited cardiac
      events. Complications are still frequent after the classic open abdominal surgery.

      In abdominal aortic surgery, "mini" abdominal incision has been proposed as an alternative to
      the classic large surgical approach.

      Two mini surgical approaches are possible: mini lumbotomy with retroperitoneal approach, and
      mini laparatomy with transperitoneal approach.

      Previous studies have only compared classic versus mini surgical approaches and many are
      retrospectives studies. Pain control through the mini-incision surgery allowed early
      mobilization of patients, improved lung function, reduced muscle loss, and favoured
      intestinal motility.

      So far, no study has compared the results of two mini invasive aortic approaches.

      The aim of this prospective randomized study is to compare two mini-invasive surgical
      approaches and to determine which of them allows the improvement of surgical outcomes with
      less morbi-mortality.
