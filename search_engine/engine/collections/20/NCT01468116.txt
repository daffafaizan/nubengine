      and hence to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial function can be studied
      non-invasively by 31 Phosphor Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (31PMRS). In this study we will
      investigate changes in mitochondrial function using the combination of 31 PMRS and Near
      Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) after gastric bypass.
