      determined by the sponsor and FDA. The criteria set in this study have been previously used
      to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in cryoablation and radio-frequency ablation for the
      treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

      The analyses of the primary effectiveness objective will take place once all the subjects
      with a study cryoablation procedure attempt have reached 36 months of follow-up
      post-cryoablation procedure. The analysis of the primary safety objective will take place
      once all the subjects with a study cryoablation procedure attempt have reached 12 months of
      follow-up post-cryoablation procedure. The analyses for the secondary objectives will take
      place once all subjects with a study cryoablation attempt have reached 36 months of follow-up
      post-cryoablation procedure.
