    
      Investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be administered at only 1 dose level at a time.
      Following each of Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, there will be a period of interim analysis and
      review of safety, PK and available PD data from the previous period(s) in order to determine
      which SP 8008 formulation and dose to administer further regimens. Administration at the next
      dose level will not begin until the safety and tolerability of the preceding dose level have
      been evaluated and deemed acceptable by the investigator and sponsor, and the exposure of
      SP-8008 remains within the pre specified limits following interim review. There will be an
      interval of no less than 14 days between the dosing of successive cohorts, unless a subject
      cohort returns to a dose that is lower than that already given in a previous cohort eg to
      obtain dose linearity information. Dose escalation will be guided by emerging safety, PK and
      available PD data and confirmed after each interim data review meeting.

      There is the option to assess the safety, PK and PD of an alternative formulation. This
      formulation will be invoked if, following review of data from the preceding periods, it is
      decided that the exposure from the current formulation may not be ideal for future
      development.
