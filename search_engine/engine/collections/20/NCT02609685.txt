      States, Europe, Canada, and South America. Since nearly 50% of this increase is attributable
      to papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMC), it appears that greater detection and diagnosis
      of previously subclinical disease is a major factor driving this dramatic rise.

      The primary objective is to estimate the rate of disease progression (growth of primary tumor
      or development of loco-regional/distant metastases) over a 3, 5, and 10-year period in a
      series of PTMC patients followed with active surveillance in the United States.

      Patients who opt for immediate surgery can participate in a sub-study looking at quality of
      life and anxiety measures as compared to those patients who enroll in the active surveillance
      main study. Patients who enroll in active surveillance can choose to have surgery at any time
      that they and their treating physician feel that it is in their best interest.
