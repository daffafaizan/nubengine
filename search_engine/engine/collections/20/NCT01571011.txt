    
      Additional aims and hypotheses are provided here:

      Aim 2: To determine whether or not participants in the CURB primary care/Internet based
      depression prevention intervention will have a significantly lower cumulative incidence of
      any depressive episode at 3 months compared to adolescents in the usual care wait-list group.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to youth in the wait-list control condition, youth in the CURB program
      will have a lower incidence of depressive episodes at 6 month follow-up.

      Aim 3: To determine whether CURB is sustainable in primary care from the perspective of
      health care professionals and primary care physicians in urban primary care settings.

      Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that providers will rate the intervention (by component)
      feasibility, acceptability, willingness to perform intervention and sustainability > 7 on a
      1-10 scale (1, not feasible, 10 very feasible).
