    
      This is a non-interventional prospective chart review evaluating the clinical utility of SLND
      for detecting nodal metastasis of early stage endometrial cancer through data collection.

      Patients who are scheduled to undergo standard-of-care (SOC) surgical staging for EC
      (sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery,
      ±hysterectomy, ±bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)) (pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy
      may (or may not) also be performed in addition to SLND) will be approached for consent. After
      these patients have completed the above SOC surgical procedures, research staff will review
      and collect data from their medical charts. For the subset of these patients who are found,
      during their SOC surgery, to have positive nodes, research staff will continue to review and
      collect data from their medical charts after their standard of care follow-up visits with
      their oncologist

      All of the patients enrolled on this trial are those who were scheduled to have their
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) removed; that is, all patients enrolled on this trial were
      consented by the research team because they were already scheduled to undergo sentinel lymph
      node dissection (SLND) via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery, ±hysterectomy,
      ±bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)). As part of this same SOC surgery, some of these
      patients also may have undergone pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in addition to SLND.

      Within the research database built for this study, patients will be classified into risk
      strata (either low or high risk EC) as per the Modified Mayo Criteria. This classification
      will be partly based on the SOC post-surgical International Federation of Gynecology and
      Obstetrics (FIGO) staging. To establish progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS), research staff will intermittently perform medical chart reviews for only those
      patients with nodal metastasis for a minimum of 2 years (maximum of 6 years).
