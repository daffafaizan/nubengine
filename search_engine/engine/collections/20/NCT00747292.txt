    
      Patients will be randomized into one of 3 groups - A, B or C. In order to remove the major
      confounding factor of hypovolaemia, all patients will have an oesophageal doppler inserted in
      order to achieve fluid optimisation. Each group will then either have an epidural, spinal or
      a PCA for post operative analgesia depending on the randomisation. All patients will follow a
      common postoperative care pathway to standardize the other factors.

      Patients will be asked to report parameters including pain visual analogue score (VAS) chart
      three times a day. Recovery of bowel functions (passage of flatus, bowel movement, and diet
      intake), additional analgesia consumption, time to first ambulation, analgesia related
      side-effects and time to discharge will be recorded.

      In addition whilst the patients fluid status is optimized during surgery with the oesophageal
      Doppler, the physiological changes that occur with the steep trendelenberg position and the
      pneumoperitoneum will be recorded.
