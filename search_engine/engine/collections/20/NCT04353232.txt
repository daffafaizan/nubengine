      and there is increasing evidence that air pollution is a risk factor for developing
      subclinical cardiovascular diseases. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate this
      correlation. The DEHM/UBM/AirGIS model calculates air pollution in a high temporal and
      spatial resolution and track air pollution retrospectively back to year 1979. We link the
      results from this model to a population-based cardiovascular screening cohort of 33 723
      individuals in the age of 60-74 to assess the contribution of the specific accumulated air
      pollution to the presence of subclinical arteriosclerosis in the coronary vessels, abdominal
      aortic aneurysms and peripheral arterial disease. This correlation will be further analyzed
      in relation to specific air pollutants.
