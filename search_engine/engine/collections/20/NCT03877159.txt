      cells. The caspase family of enzymes are the key performers of controlled cell death and
      caspase-8 is frequently mutated in oral cancer. This study will perform DNA sequencing to
      determine if the gene is wild-type (not mutated). The abundance of inactive (uncleaved) and
      active (cleaved) caspase-8 will be determined. The levels of the proteins that caspase-8
      interacts with (including caspase-3) will be determined. Results will be correlated with
      tumour stage, patient outcome and the presence of immune cells and other microscopic
      features. This will improve the understanding of the importance of caspase-8 in oral cancer.
