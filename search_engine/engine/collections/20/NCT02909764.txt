    
      This is a within- and between-subjects randomized controlled trial on children consuming
      either a low sodium or a higher sodium cereal over a 2-month period to determine if repeated
      exposure to the low sodium cereal is effective for reducing preference for salt in that food.
      Children will be genotyped for markers related to taste, dietary intake will be recorded, and
      anthropometric and physiological measures will be collected at baseline.
