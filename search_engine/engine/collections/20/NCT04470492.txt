      Conditioning Device (DoctormateÂ®) (200mmHg) twice daily and conventional medication; patients
      in the control group will be treated only with conventional medication. In the study, the
      RLIC treatment will be comprised of 5 cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia and
      reperfusion, which will be induced by 2 cuffs placed around the upper arms respectively and
      inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation.
