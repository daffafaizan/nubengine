      (chemoradiation).

      This study is a phase I trial to determine the safety of dietary manipulation during
      chemoradiation for lung cancer. Specifically, pre-clinical data from mouse studies indicates
      a ketogenic diet increases tumor cell killing.

      Participants will:

        -  Utilize a specialized ketogenic diet designed by bionutritional services of the clinical
           research unit. This diet begins 2 days before chemoradiation and continues through at
           least 5 weeks of chemoradiation.

        -  Have blood drawn for research purposes weekly to determine measurements of oxidative
           stress

        -  Have urine collected sporadically through the study to determine measurements of
           oxidative stress

        -  Keep a diary of concomitant medications, side effects, and blood sugars

        -  Have follow-up to monitor for outcomes and overall survival
