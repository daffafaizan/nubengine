      inhalation of various antigenic particles in the environment. Patients often experience
      irreversible physiological disorders and severe dyspnea in the future. Common disorders in
      these patients are lung function abnormalities, decreased exercise capacity, muscle weakness,
      oxygen diffusion limitation, impaired quality of life, physical inactivity and fatigue. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation training on exercise
      capacity, dyspnea, respiratory functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength,
      inspiratory muscle endurance, physical activity level, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea,
      anxiety, depression in patients with chronic fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The study
      was planned as a prospective, double-blind, case-control study. At least 30 patients with
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis will be included in the study. The cardiopulmonary
      rehabilitation program will be included inspiratory muscle training, upper extremity aerobic
      exercise and progressive resistance training will be performed in the exercise training group
      during 24 sessions. Alternative upper extremity exercises combined with breathing exercises
      will be performed in the control group. Functional exercise capacity, respiratory functions,
      respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, physical activity
      levels, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety and depressions will be evaluated before
      and after treatment.
