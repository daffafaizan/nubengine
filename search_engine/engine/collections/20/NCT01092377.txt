      coexisting with a low intake of n-3 fatty acids could synergistically compromise both the
      intellectual performance and immune system of children.

      Therefore, specific cognitive processes (domains) and specific immunization status markers
      and immune function modulators, that have been found to be affected by iron and n-3 fatty
      acid deficiency in children in previous studies will be assessed.

      This will be the first human study that assesses the interactions of iron and n-3 fatty acid
      supplementation to iron deficient children in a two-by-two factorial, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
