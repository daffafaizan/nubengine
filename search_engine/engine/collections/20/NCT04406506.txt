    
      -  The study was conducted on monitoring of four pillar for 13 days (data collected one day
           before feeding and every three days for 12 days). the first pillar comparing the effect
           of the two enteral feeding methods on the clinical condition of the acute severe
           pancreatitis and this monitored clinically and laboratory by fixed parameters,
           clinically, by abdominal pain which assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). and
           laboratory, by both markers of severity of pancreatic acini destruction which assessed
           by serum amylase, lipase and Markers of severity of interstitial pancreatic tissue
           destruction which assessed by the level of Lactate Dehydrogenase level (LDH), Aspartate
           aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein, prostacyclin and interleukin 8. The second
           pillar include effect of the two enteral feeding methods on the patient's tolerance and
           these monitored in our study by both post-feeding vomiting and post feeding attacks of
           osmotic diarrhea and also abdominal pain. Third pillar include effect of the two enteral
           feeding methods on the patient's general condition and these monitored by follows the
           APACHE II Score, hemodynamics of the patients in both groups (Mean arterial blood
           pressure and pulse) and arterial oxygen saturation (Spo2). Fourth pillar include effect
           of the two enteral feeding methods on achieving satisfactory nutrition parameters of the
           patients and both albumin level, radium blood sugar and electrolytes (sodium and
           potassium level) used as indicator for this.

        -  All parameters observed one day before starting feeding and every 3 days for 12 days
           (duration of the study).
