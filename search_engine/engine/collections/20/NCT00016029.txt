        -  Compare the accuracy of air contrast barium enema, computed tomographic colonography
           (virtual colonoscopy), and colonoscopy for the detection of colonic lesions in patients
           with factors related to colon cancer.

        -  Compare the patient experience during each of these imaging tests.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      A repeat fecal occult blood test is performed. Patients then undergo an air contrast barium
      enema (ACBE). At 7-10 days after ACBE, patients undergo a computed tomographic colonography
      (virtual colonoscopy) followed by a colonoscopy on the same day.

      A repeat ACBE may be performed if there is a discrepancy between the initial ACBE and
      colonoscopy. If the repeat ACBE continues to show an abnormality, patients undergo a second
      colonoscopy.

      Within 24 hours of completion of each test, patients fill out a questionnaire about their
      experience. At 5-7 days after completion of all tests, patients complete a final
      questionnaire comparing all 3 tests.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,133 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
