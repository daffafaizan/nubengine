    
      We propose to characterize the etiology and natural history of rare inborn errors of
      metabolism and other genetic disorders, both known and yet-to-be discovered. In so doing, we
      will expand our knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest
      for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Individual patients seen under this protocol
      have prompted the establishment of specific disease-related protocols involving intensive
      natural history studies and innovative therapies. In the past, this protocol provided an
      avenue for admitting patients as part of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP).
      Currently, this protocol continues its

      longstanding role in investigating individuals who are of interest to the Section on

      Human Biochemical Genetics or to the protocol s Associate Investigators.
