      Cancer Institute (A. Frankel, MD - PI) and M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with 15 evaluable
      patients enrolled by the end of 2011 (table 1). The 3rd patient enrolled in the 40 μg/kg dose
      cohort was the first to experience dose limiting toxicity (grade 3 neurological: lower
      extremity weakness) receiving only 3 of the 4 planned doses. Per study design, the 40 μg/kg
      would enroll an additional 3 patients to confirm dose limiting toxicity. It is at this point
      the Texas centers discontinued involvement in the study.

      Approximately 15 months after the last patient was enrolled under the original study plan,
      the protocol was redesigned by the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota,
      building on the experience of the 1st 15 patients enrolled through the Texas centers. To
      increase efficiency, the study design was changed from the standard 3 x 3 dose escalation to
      a Continuous Reassessment Method (CRM) model testing 3 doses levels (40, 60, and 80 ug/kg)
      with an added feature of a dose level -1 (30 ug/kg) in the event dose level 1 proves too
      toxic. The maximum tolerated dose will be identified once 20 evaluable patients are enrolled.
