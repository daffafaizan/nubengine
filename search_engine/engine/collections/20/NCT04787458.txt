      controversial because of a lack of evidence for their effectiveness and because they also
      confer disadvantages. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the
      effects of abdominal binder after laparoscopic cholecystectomy on pain, degree of comfort,
      time until ambulation, walking ability, return of bowel function, and diet resumption.
