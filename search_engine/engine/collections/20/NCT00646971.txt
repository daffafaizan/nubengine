      will be immediately preceded and followed by measurements of oxidative stress in exhaled gas
      and vascular relaxation. Patients included in the OSAS group will be randomly assigned to
      treatment by either CPAP or Placebo (sham CPAP) for 4 weeks. Measurements of oxidative stress
      in exhaled gas and vascular reactivity will be repeated immediately before and after PSG2 and
      PSG3 at D7 and D30, respectively.
