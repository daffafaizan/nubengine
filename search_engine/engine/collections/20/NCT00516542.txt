        -  To determine the maximum tolerable dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of
           dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) when given together with letrozole in patients with
           androgen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative
           metastatic breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dehydroepiandrosterone and oral letrozole once daily. Physical
      exams and blood collections are performed every two weeks. Tumor assessments are performed
      once every three months.
