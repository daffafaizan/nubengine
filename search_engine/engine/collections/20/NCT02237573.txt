      (versus only 43,2% in Netherlands). A french medical thesis published in 2013 showed that
      drugs prescriptions were not a priority for patients. Rather than medicine's prescription,
      patients preferred attentive listening associated with personalized advices from their GPs.
      Several studies also showed that a commercial relationship exists between doctors and
      patients. The prescription is like an exchange currency against the patient money.

      We aim to assess the impact of handing to patients with viral gastroenteritis or upper
      respiratory tract infections, a copy of the consultation report on their medicine
      consumption.
