      Nationwide Children's Hospital that is looking to test the effectiveness of a brief treatment
      engagement intervention termed Suicidal Teens Accessing Treatment After an ED Visit (STAT-ED)
      for adolescents seeking treatment in the ED for non-psychiatric concerns but identified via
      systematic screening as being at risk for suicide. In this study, investigators from both
      institutions will recruit and randomize 160 adolescents (80 per site) to either(a) the
      STAT-ED intervention or (b) enhanced usual care group (EUC). The EUC group consist of a brief
      consultation by an ED social worker and a mental health referral for the participant
      facilitated by the Psychiatric Intake Response Center. The STAT-ED intervention targets
      family engagement, problem solving, motivational interviewing, assistance with referral and
      limited case management during the transition from the ED to outpatient care with the goal of
      maximizing the initiation of mental health treatment and aftercare among youth screening
      positive for previously unrecognized suicide risk. A study trained research coordinator who
      is blinded to the participants treatment allocation will contact the participants via
      telephone at two months and six months post ED visit in order to ascertain initiation and
      attendance of the mental health follow-up, as well as an assessment of suicidal ideation and
      depression.
