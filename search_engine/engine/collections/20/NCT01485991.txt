    
      This study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance like flipping a coin), double-blind
      (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), double-dummy (patients
      receive both active and inactive pills also called placebo), 2-arm, multicenter Phase III
      clinical study in adult treatment experienced Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) genotype-1 infected
      patients who failed to respond during at least 1 previous course of PegINFα-2a/ RBV therapy.
      The purpose of the trial is to study the efficacy of TMC435 in combination with PegINFα-2a
      and RBV for 48 weeks of treatment compared to the approved regimen of telaprevir in
      combination with PegINFα-2a and RBV for 48 weeks of treatment. The study will consist of a
      screening period (maximum 6 weeks), treatment period (48 weeks) and post-treatment period
      (until 72 weeks after the start of treatment). For the first 12 weeks one group of patients
      will take TMC435 and TVR placebo, plus PegINFα-2a and RBV. The other group will take TMC435
      placebo and TVR, plus PegINFα-2a and RBV. After 12 weeks, patients in both arms will only
      take PegINFα-2a and RBV up to week 48. After patients stop taking study medication, they will
      continue to go to the doctor's office for study visits until a total of 72 weeks after they
      start study treatment. Patients will be monitored for safety throughout the study. Study
      assessments at each study visit may include, but are not limited to: blood and urine
      collection for testing, electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments (a measurement of the electrical
      activity of your heart), patient questionnaires, and physical examinations.
