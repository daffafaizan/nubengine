      preventing preeclampsia in women identified in the first trimester to be at high risk. We
      will also obtain maternal blood, cord blood and placenta specimen for basic science studies
      to attempt to dissect biological mechanisms of aspirin effects. In addition we will conduct a
      cost-benefit analysis to determine the cost effectiveness of screening and using aspirin
      prophylaxis for screen positive women.

      Rationale for Design: The randomized control trial is the 'gold standard' of research design.
      Other designs such as case-control, retrospective cohort and prospective cohort are limited
      by potential bias and confounding. Randomly assigning subjects to different interventions
      minimizes selection bias. The random assignment also results in groups that are likely to be
      similar with regards to important confounding variables. This minimizes confounding by both
      measured and unmeasured factors. While random allocation does not guarantee the groups will
      be identical, it does ensure that any differences between them are due to chance alone.
      Finally, randomization produces groups that are random samples of the population. This
      permits use of standard statistical tests that are based on probability theory.
