      endocrine therapy (ET, i.e. aro- matase inhibitors (AI) or Fulvestrant) has significantly
      increased objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of first- and
      second-line treatments in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative (luminal)
      mBC. Now this combination is the standard treatment for luminal mBC. Recommendation for
      endocrine therapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of luminal mBC is endorsed by
      the main international guidelines such as ASCO and ESO-ESMO guidelines. Endocrine therapy
      should be used as initial treatment except in cases of immediately life-threatening disease,
      tumors refractory to endocrine therapy, visceral crisis, or rapid progressive disease that
      mandate a high response rate treatment. The aim of this study is to provide real-life
      treatment patterns data for luminal MBC with a focus in population of Moscow
