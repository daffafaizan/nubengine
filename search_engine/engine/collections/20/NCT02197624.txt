      samples and extracted DNA from these blood samples. HFE genotype was determined as CC, CT,
      and TT and used to assess possible differences in iron status as a function of genotype. To
      measure the impact of genotype on non-heme Fe absorption, a sub-group of women with the CC
      (n=10) or TT (n=11) genotype were invited to return for an Fe absorption study. Each
      volunteer consumed stable 57Fe (as ferrous sulfate). Two weeks after ingesting this tracer, a
      blood sample was collected from each woman and the amount of non-heme (57Fe) iron
      incorporated into red blood cells was measured with magnetic sector thermal ionization mass
      spectrometry. Possible associations between iron status and iron absorption as a function of
      genotypes were explored. Data from this study will provide information that aims to improve
      human health by better understanding the iron requirements of individuals with different
      genetic background.
