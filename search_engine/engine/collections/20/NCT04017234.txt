    
      This is an experimental study. A sample size of 25~40 participants from an elementary school
      will be recruited in the randomized controlled study.The sequential arrangement is arranged
      in a random manner for the participating children. A investigation of four groups will be
      designed for the PMP: Group 1 (frequency following response, Group 2(frequency following
      response,and eye exercise), Group 3 (frequency following response, eye exercise,
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and stimulating auricular acupoints), and Group
      4, the control group. The PMP implement a 30 minute intervention two times per the
      investigators. Pre-test and post-test (eyeball diopter detection and Sellen's vision chart)
      will be carried out. The duration of each intervention is provided for two days. The washout
      period following next intervention is 7 days at least. After completing four intervention,
      the effect of the best intervention of eight the investigator will be conducted.The
      evaluation time of the interventions will be observed at first-time and one-month
      observations. A descriptive and inferential statistics by SpSS will be used for data
      analysis.

      The investigators will apply the frequency following response, eye exercise, and
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on PMP among Taiwan schoolchildren. The findings
      of the study may provide information for promotion of visual health for schoolchildren and
      their parents.
