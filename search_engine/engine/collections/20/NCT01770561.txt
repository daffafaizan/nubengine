      (absolute relative difference), median ARD, Clarke Grid Analysis. Meter BG values will be
      used as reference. Descriptive statistics will be used to assess non-inferiority of the
      Integrated sensor and infusion sets sensors compare to control Enlite sensors.

      Insulin delivery functionality will be evaluated based on BG profiles obtained during
      peri-prandial periods during which BG measurements will be performed at 15, 20, 30 min
      intervals according to a SMBG schedule. Post-prandial pharmacodynamic profiles will be
      analyzed to demonstrate the effect of insulin delivered using the Integrated sensor and
      infusion set. Specifically, rise in glucose levels followed by their fall will be used as an
      indication that insulin was delivered and absorbed. Post-prandial BG areas under the curve
      (AUC), Tmax (time to maximum rise of BG), and Cmax (maximum post-prandial BG) values will be
      calculated for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) consumed during both inpatient days
      and compared. Intra - and inter-subject mean values and standard deviations will be
      calculated. Paired and unpaired T-tests will be used to evaluate statistical significance.

      Longevity of device performance will be assessed by comparing the listed parameters obtained
      during two inpatient days.
