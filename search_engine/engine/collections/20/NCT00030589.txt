        -  Compare the efficacy of 2 different doses of bexarotene administered with ultraviolet A
           light therapy with methoxsalen (PUVA) in patients with stage IB or IIA cutaneous T-cell
           lymphoma.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a lower dose of oral bexarotene once daily on weeks 1-26.
           Patients also receive ultraviolet A light therapy with oral methoxsalen 3 times weekly
           on weeks 2-26.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a higher dose of oral bexarotene once daily on weeks 1-26.
           Patients also receive ultraviolet A light therapy as in arm I.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
