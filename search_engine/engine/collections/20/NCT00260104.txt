    
      This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical
      characterization of individuals with coronary artery disease. The study group will consist of
      consecutive patients who are undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery
      disease. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease will be confirmed by coronary angiography
      performed with the Judkins technique using a quantitative coronary angiographic system.
      Coronary artery disease will be considered to be present if there is a diameter stenosis of
      at least 50% in at least one of the three major epicardial coronary arteries. The number of
      diseased vessels will be determined and a classification of 1-, 2-, and 3-vessel disease will
      be used. Coronary artery segments will be defined according to the Coronary Artery Surgery
      Study classification. Blood samples from vein and coronary artery will be collected. We will
      study coronary arteriovenous difference of various markers. Urinary samples will be obtained
      the day of coronary angiography. We will explore the environmental (including family history,
      life style, diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of
      oxidative stress factors, angiogenic factors, and inflammatory markers, etc.) and genetic
      (including oxidative stress factors and inflammatory factors, etc.) risk factors. We will
      study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical
      characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of
      coronary artery disease.
