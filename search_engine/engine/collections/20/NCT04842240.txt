      option of pre- versus sub-pectoral breast reconstruction. Both approaches are well
      established and have proven safety in terms of low rate of complication rates. However, we do
      not know if there is a significant difference in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)
      between the two surgical techniques over time.

      The study aims to investigate if the difference in the surgical technique for immediate
      implant breast reconstruction (pre- versus sub-pectoral) influences patient perceived
      outcomes. This is a prospective non-randomised longitudinal cohort study which will aim to
      recruit consecutive eligible patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate implant based
      reconstruction surgery for early breast cancer or risk reduction using repeated measures and
      mixed methods.

      This study will utilise a well validated patient questionnaire for breast reconstruction
      (BREAST-Q; http://qportfolio.org/breast-q/breast-cancer/) and will be carried out at a
      teaching hospital breast unit. The specific objectives will be to compare aesthetic outcome,
      post-operative pain and functionality as reported by PROMs. The study participants will be
      followed up for 12 months. The PROMs data will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, as well as
      at 3 and 12 months post-surgery. Matching data will be collected for each study participant
      including the type of surgery performed, patient characteristics, post-operative
      complications, and any recommended adjuvant treatment. These data will be correlated with the
      matching questionnaire results in order to explore for potential clinical factors which may
      influence PROMs.
