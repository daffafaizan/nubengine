      of a binge meal. It was intended to study the effects of increasing doses on antagonist on
      normal individuals to find an effective dose in a non-binge meal before moving to a binge
      meal. Once the effects of the antagonist on a binge meal were found, the compound would be
      used on patients with bulimia nervosa. However, the product expired and more was not
      available before the patients were tested. Data are presented for the normal participants who
      were instructed to eat normally, followed by a group that was instructed to binge eat.
      Comparisons were made between groups with different instructions and between binge and normal
      meals.
