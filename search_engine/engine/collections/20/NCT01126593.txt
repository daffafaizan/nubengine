      Randomization will be performed by a random numbers table. Envelopes will be sealed with the
      accompanying randomization group.Patients will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they
      have a full-thickness rotator cuff tear that has been deemed reparable by preoperative MRI.
      They will be included in the study if they are medically stable to undergo the surgery and
      consent to involvement in the study.

      Patients consenting to the study will undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by one of the
      two senior authors. The surgery will be performed as an outpatient procedure under general
      anesthesia. The procedure will be performed utilizing the standard techniques of the senior
      authors. All concomitant pathology found at the time of arthroscopy will be treated in the
      usual appropriate fashion. At the completion of the rotator cuff repair, patients will be
      randomly allocated to one of three groups. This will be done by opening a sealed envelope
      with the randomization allocation. The patients will either be placed into the study group,
      the placebo group or the control group.
