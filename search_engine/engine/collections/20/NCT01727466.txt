      symptoms following the delivery of the FYF intervention. Given these initial successes, there
      are two primary purposes of this study. First, to train outpatient clinicians to fidelity on
      the FYF intervention for 8-14 year old children with high-functioning ASD and clinical
      anxiety. Second, to develop an optimal training model for learning the FYF intervention. The
      primary aims of Phase 1 are to develop a training manual and deliver a workshop on the FYF
      model to a group of outpatient clinicians in preparation for the clinicians to deliver the
      FYF intervention to four groups of children with ASD and anxiety. In Phase 2, the primary
      aims include comparing three instruction methods of learning to clinicians at three different
      outpatient clinics, by assessing increases in clinicians' acquisition of the intervention
      techniques and estimating the degree of reduction in anxiety symptoms on the primary outcome
      measures for the children with ASD. Instruction methods are: a) Manual, b) Workshop, c)
      Workshop-Plus. We hypothesize that clinicians receiving the Workshop-Plus (workshop plus
      ongoing consultation) condition will achieve treatment fidelity at a faster rate than
      clinicians receiving the other two instruction methods, and the children with ASD in the
      Workshop-Plus condition will display greater reductions in anxiety symptoms compared to the
      children in the other two conditions.
