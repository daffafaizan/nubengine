      typically consist of a lower than average IQ, impaired visual-spatial learning, attention
      problems and impaired executive functioning. These deficits have a substantial influence on
      the daily life of pediatric and adolescent individuals with NF1. One of the key underlying
      mechanisms of these deficits is an increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition
      and a subsequent decrease in synaptic plasticity. The ENCORE laboratory has recently shown
      that loss of the NF1-gene is associated with attenuated function of the
      hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (HCN1). These channels,
      enriched in membranes of inhibitory interneurons, play an important role in the
      pathophysiology underlying the cognitive deficits in NF1. Lamotrigine, an HCN-agonist,
      restored function of HCN1, together with the electrophysiological and visual-spatial learning
      deficits in Nf1-mice. Thus, lamotrigine is a novel candidate drug for treating cognitive
      deficits associated with NF1.
