      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) in patients with
           metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) subcutaneously on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first 3 weeks of
      study therapy. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Blood samples are collected from patients after the first and fifth doses of the study drug
      for pharmacokinetic correlative studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
