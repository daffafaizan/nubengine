      of these women require cervical ripening in order to "ready" the cervix for induction. In the
      setting of an unfavorable cervix, induction of labor with oxytocin alone can be associated
      with longer times to delivery, uterine tachysystole (uterine contractions that are too
      frequent), and increased rates of cesarean delivery.

      Outpatient cervical ripening is an attractive option for both women and their physicians, as
      this allows for the potential to spend less time in the hospital and more time in the
      comforts of the patient's own home.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing outpatient to
      inpatient cervical ripening using a transcervical Foley catheter. Women will be randomized to
      undergo inpatient or outpatient transcervical Foley catheter cervical ripening beyond their
      39th week of gestation. Women and their infants will be followed until the time of their
      discharge from the hospital.
