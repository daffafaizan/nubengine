      equi-minimum alveolar concentration of various volatile anesthetic agents may produce
      different spectral entropy or bispectral index values. However, there is no study that
      demonstrate the difference between analgesic potency of volatile anesthetics. The aim of this
      clinical trial is to evaluate the ratio of hypnotic to analgesic potency of sevoflurane and
      desflurane at equi-minimum alveolar concentration using SPI and EEG analysis.
