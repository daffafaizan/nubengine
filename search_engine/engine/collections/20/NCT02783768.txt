      detecting and characterizing the anticipated acute pulmonary toxicities of e-cigarettes.
      Hyperpolarized helium (3He)-enhanced MRI may be more sensitive than spirometry, a global lung
      function measure, for determination of airway toxicities. 3He-enhanced MRI has been used to
      demonstrate the extent of ventilation defects in healthy persons with normal spirometry; to
      measure ventilation changes in asthmatics pre- and post-challenge with bronchodilators and
      methacholine; and to predict pulmonary hospitalizations in persons with COPD. Meanwhile,
      until recently, non-invasive measures of pulmonary vascular toxicities were lacking. The
      investigators have developed an innovative measure of pulmonary microvascular blood flow on
      gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRA, which the investigators found to be markedly abnormal in early
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, and to be associated with
      increased endothelial microparticles, a marker of endothelial dysfunction. Nonetheless,
      neither of these sensitive, non-invasive, repeatable, and reproducible measures has ever been
      used to assess e-cigarette toxicities.

      It is hypothesized that e-cigarette vapor inhalation will result in an acute increase in
      global and regional ventilation defects and an acute decrease in global and regional
      pulmonary microvascular perfusion.

      This pilot work will provide the experience and data to support subsequent funding
      applications powered to definitively establish the acute toxicities of e-cigarette vapor of
      various compositions (e.g., with and without nicotine, with and without flavoring) in persons
      with and without chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma) on pulmonary ventilation and
      microvascular perfusion. Furthermore, confirmation of the hypotheses in this sample would
      provide important preliminary evidence of e-cigarette pulmonary toxicities to inform interim
      regulatory decisions, as well as potentially generating vivid images of e-cigarette harms
      that may be meaningful to the general public and therefore suitable for use in public
      education campaigns.
