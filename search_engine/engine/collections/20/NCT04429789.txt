      MS-related fatigue that have shown to be beneficial for individuals with cancer and other
      medical conditions in the management of their symptoms. One of these methods, the
      active-alert hypnosis has helped people to manage fatigue and may have important advantages
      over the more traditional relaxation hypnotic approaches in the treatment of fatigue, since
      the hypnotic inductions and the self-hypnosis methods use activation instead of relaxation.
      Therefore, the goals of this study are to determine if a comparison study of these two
      hypnotic conditions is feasible, and, if so, to determine which treatment may be more
      effective for helping individuals with MS gain more control over fatigue. Additionally, it
      will explore the mechanisms of these two approaches to hypnosis treatment to determine which
      might be most helpful to individuals with MS and fatigue.
