      participating in the study suffer of benign adnexal deseases and there is an indication for
      removing them for diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic reasons. A flexible gastric scope
      is put transgastric into the abdomen, developing an pneumoperitoneum and removing the adnexes
      with a monopolar knife. The adnexes then are put out of the abdomen either transvaginally
      after colpotomy or even transgastric. We already performed an appendectomy in 24 patients and
      were able to show the feasibility in acute infectios situations.
