      of pancreatic tumors in 2016. The standard of care for pancreas cancer is cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, but this is not particularly effective with best response rates reported of
      20-30% and no significant long-term 5-year survival for patients who are not surgical
      candidates. Talimogene laherparepvec (previously known as OncoVEXGM-CSF) is an intratumorally
      delivered oncolytic immunotherapy comprised of an immune-enhanced herpes simplex virus type-1
      (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in solid tumors. Talimogene laherparepvec was the first
      oncolytic viral therapy to be approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of cancer, specifically melanoma. There is the potential that talimogene
      laherparepvec could exert a systemic effect mitigating the potential of PDA to metastasize.

      This is a phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in
      PDA. To find out which doses are safe, all participants enrolled in this study will receive
      up to 4 injections of T-Vec. At least two doses will be evaluated in this study, depending on
      how many side effects are seen at each dose. Participants will not be able to pick the dose,
      as this will be determined based on the study experience with participants enrolled
      previously.
