      support health workers to deliver evidence-based practices to women and newborns around the
      time of institutional childbirths. At the program's core is the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a
      31-item list of essential practices that target the major causes of maternal and newborn
      mortality in low-resource settings globally. The program was developed over 3 years by a
      partnership of WHO and HSPH, working with a large international network of experts and
      stakeholders in maternal, fetal, and newborn health. Pilot testing of the program at a
      public-sector birth center in south India demonstrated dramatic improvements in health worker
      adherence to essential childbirth-related clinical care standards. The current study is a
      matched-pair, cluster randomized trial to measure the efficacy of the program in reducing
      severe maternal and newborn harm. This trial will be conducted at approximately 120 health
      facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India.
