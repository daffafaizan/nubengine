      between 2 and 19%. Postoperative Pulmonary Complications are associated with an increase of
      morbi-mortality and longer hospital stays. However, few possibilities are available to
      identify Postoperative Pulmonary Complications except predictions scores and SpO2, which
      decreases only face to a significant lung disease. Besides, the respiratory variability
      decreases during pulmonary stress situations, and is associated with an increase of mortality
      during mechanical ventilation. The hypothesis is that a decrease of the respiratory
      variability between the preoperative and the postoperative measures is associated with an
      increase of Postoperative Pulmonary Complications . However there is no mesuring tool of easy
      access in clinical practice. That is why, in a first step, a thoracic sensor belt will be
      tested on healthy subjects. This sensor belt is available to measure the respiratory
      variability.
