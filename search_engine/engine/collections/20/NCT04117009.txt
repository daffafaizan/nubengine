      function evaluated with transthoracic echocardiagraphy on ASA 1, 2 individuals with grade 1
      or 2 diastolic dysfunction. Methods: 30 ASA 1-2 individuals with grade 1 or 2 diastolic
      dysfunction whose left ventricular ejection fraction is above 50% will be recruited. The
      patients will be selected among the ones who planned to undergo elective surgery either under
      general or regional anesthesia.

      Patients with atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, severe heart valve disease,
      tachyarrhythmia-bradyarrhythmia, left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% and regional
      contraction anomaly, patients with liver, renal dysfunction, patients with lung disease,
      acute coronary syndrome, body mass index >30 kg/m2, no oral intake for solid food more than 8
      hours will be excluded from the study.

      Baseline echocardiographic examination will be performed in the spontaneously breathing
      subjects right before the surgical procedure and study drug begins. Then remifentanil
      infusion will be started at a rate to reach target plasma level of 2 ng/mL. A target
      Controlled Infusion pump will be used to infuse the study drug. Once the target drug
      concentration is reached, the final echocardiographic examination will be performed.

      After recording the baseline heart rate, respiratory rate, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse
      oximeter, sedation level, the same parameters will be recorded every 5 minutes during the
      remifentanil infusion period. Once the final echocardiographic evaluation is performed
      abovementioned parameters will be recorded for the last time.

      Statistical analysis: The sample size calculation is made according to an increase or
      decrease in E/e' (alpha <0,05; beta= 0,8).
