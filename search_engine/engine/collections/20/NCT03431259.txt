      collect via surveys and are often significantly influenced by selection bias. Patient
      interaction apps like Patient Gateway are thought to facilitate greater participant
      involvement and adherence to treatment regimens. The investigators will explore if inpatient
      enrollment into Patient Gateway would improve clinic follow-up rates. Increasing follow-up
      rates could improve the quality of care delivered.

      In addition, self-administered survey questionnaires are an important data collection tool in
      clinical practice, public health research and epidemiology. However, survey completion rates
      are typically poor in orthopaedic trauma.

      With the evaluation of modern technology, electronic applications are being increasingly used
      in both hospital and personal settings. In outpatient clinics, questionnaires to measure
      outcomes and monitor quality of care are administered by staff members using hospital owned
      tablet devices. Recently, applications to complete these surveys on personal devices have
      been developed.

      In a recent Cochrane review on the comparison of self-administered survey questionnaire
      responses collected using mobile apps versus other methods it was concluded that there are no
      data available on response rates. The investigators will attempt to address this question.

      All Patient Gateway na√Øve patients aged 18 years or older able to consent for themselves and
      admitted to the hospital for an orthopedic condition with the need for outpatient follow-up
      will be invited to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria will be patients unable to
      consent for themselves, inability to communicate in English, and no possession of a
      smartphone.
