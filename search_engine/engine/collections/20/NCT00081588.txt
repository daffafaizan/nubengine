      treatment, they must have participated in the TMC114-C213 or TMC114-C202 for at least 12
      weeks and meet specific virologic failure criteria. It is estimated that approximately 150
      patients may meet these criteria. Major inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below.
      For new patients, they must have been on prior antiretroviral therapy, including more than
      one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), one non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and a protease inhibitor (PI). At least one primary PI
      mutation must be present at screening. Many of the same centers that are participating in the
      TMC114-C213 and TMC-114 -C202 studies are also participating in the TMC114-C215 study. All
      sites have the chance to recruit rollover patients into the TMC114-C215 study and some sites
      listed had approval to recruit new patients into the study. The recruitment of new patients
      for the TMC114-C215 trial has been fully enrolled. The TMC114-C202 and TMC114-C213 have
      completed so no more patients are enrolled in this study. Two 300mg/100mg Darunavir/Ritonavir
      tablets twice daily for 144 weeks.
