      It draws upon the so-called "fan effect" of associative priming. Transposing this principle
      to the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), we hypothesized that the sprouting
      of new and the strengthening of existing neutral associations to core OCD cognitions will
      reduce their fear-evoking properties by depriving the chain of OCD-related cognitions of
      associative strength. Patients with OCD are randomly allocated to either associations
      splitting (AS) or cognitive remediation (CogPack training). Blind to treatment assignment,
      both groups are assessed before intervention and eight weeks as well as six months later with
      the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory
      (OCI-R) and cognitive tests. OCD severity derived from the Y-BOCS and the OCI-R serves as the
      main outcome parameters. We also explore if AS changes the OCD-related semantic networks with
      cognitive tasks. It is assumed that association splitting will improve OCD severity to a
      greater extent than CogPack training.
