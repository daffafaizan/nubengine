      observational study in 2013 showed that the total average annual adjusted direct medical
      cost/person for DPN patients was $4,841, and the total average annual adjusted indirect
      medical cost/person was $9,730. A retrospective study in the United States in 2015 showed
      that the total annual direct medical cost per person for diabetes was $6,632, DPN ($12,492),
      DPN ($27,931), and severe DPN ($30,755) were 4.6 times higher than those for patients with
      diabetes alone. According to the 2015 European survey, the total annual direct medical cost
      per person for DPN patients in the United Kingdom was €2,963 (£2,511), of which 40% was used
      for hospitalization.

      At present, there are no studies on the population epidemiology, depression and drug use of
      DPN in China. This study mainly investigates the above problems.
