      years, undergoing hypotensive anesthesia in the operation of the septoplasty in Recep Tayyip
      Erdoğan University Medical Faculty Training and Research Hospital. Participants with
      uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, cogulopathy, morbid
      obesity (BMI ≥35) and renal disease will not be taken. Anesthesia induction and management
      will be standardized. Hypotension in the participants will be maintained by reducing the mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) by 30% or 55-65 mmHg according to the initial value. In the study,
      the heart rate (HR), MAP, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2), ETCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide)
      values, and BIS (Bispectral index) values showing anesthesia depth are to be followed.
      Participants will receive venous blood sample of up to 2 ml before the anesthesia induction
      and 10 minutes to finish of the hypotensive anesthesia, from the untreated vein. Thiol
      disulfide levels from this blood sample will be studied in the biochemistry research
      laboratory using the method developed by Erel et al.
