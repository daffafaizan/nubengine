      and maintenance of anesthesia. It is not irritative on the airways and has a pleasant smell.
      Within their properties are: low partition coefficient blood / gas (rapid induction and
      awakening), low heart, liver and kidney toxicity. Inhalational induction in pediatric
      anesthesia with this agent is frequent to avoid vein puncture in awake patients and is
      generally done with maximum doses available to obtain a fast loss of consciousness.

      Emergence delirium (ED) is frequent in children. It is defined as a mental disorder during
      recovery from general anesthesia that may include hallucinations, delusions and confusion
      expressed by crying, restlessness and involuntary physical activity. It usually lasts for 30
      minutes and is not necessarily related to pain. During this episodes, children can hurt
      themselves or others, lose vascular catheters or other invasive devices. ED can generate
      anxiety and stress in caretakers, delay transfer from Post-Anesthesia Care Units (PACU),
      increase costs of medical attention and increase use of opioids or other sedatives.

      Many interventions have been used to decrease the appearance of ED such as dexmedetomidine,
      clonidine, benzodiazepines, propofol among others but with no consistent results. The use of
      sevoflurane has been linked with ED in children and it can induce seizures in high doses
      (over 2 MAC).

      The aim of this study is to test whether using a lower dose of sevoflurane (5%) during
      induction of anesthesia in children results in less ED than using higher doses (8%).
