    
      Patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic assisted total hysterectomy at Erlanger Hospital
      will be randomized into one of two groups to receive either laparoscopic assisted TAP block
      with liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine (Group A) or pre-incisional bupivacaine (Group B).
      The remaining aspects of the perioperative care, including the general anesthesia care and
      postoperative care will be similar for all patients. Ideally, patients will be informed and
      consented for the study in the preoperative clinic setting. They will be randomized in the
      pre-anesthesia care unit.

      Patients in Group A will receive laparoscopic-assisted bilateral TAP blocks using 10cc
      liposomal bupivacaine, 10cc Bupivacaine 0.25% and 10cc Normal Saline one each side. Patients
      in Group B will receive a total of 20cc pre-incisional Bupivacaine divided between each of
      the trocar sites. All patients will receive Ketorolac 30 mg, IV at the conclusion of surgery.
      All patients will be offered either oral pain medications or patient controlled anesthesia
      (PCA) opiate pain medication as indicated. Morphine equivalents will be calculated.

      Postoperative pain control will be assessed using Visual Analog Pain Score (VAS). This will
      be done by recovery room personnel who will be blinded as to whether the patients received
      TAP block or pre-incisional anesthetic. VAS will be assessed at rest at 1 hour and 2 hours
      after arrival to PACU. Patients will be assessed with Overall Benefit of Anesthesia Score
      (OBAS) questionnaires at postoperative days 1, 2 and 7. OBAS questionnaires will be done by
      personnel blinded to anesthesia technique. Patients will also be blinded as to which group
      they were in. Total morphine equivalents of intraoperative and postoperative pain medications
      will be calculated through postoperative day 7.
