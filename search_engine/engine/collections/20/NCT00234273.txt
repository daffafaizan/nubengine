      among type 2 diabetics.

      Secondary objectives are to assess and analyze the effects of a six month programme in APA
      of:

        -  arterial tension

        -  weight, body composition and abdominal perimeter

        -  quality of life

        -  treatment dosage

        -  number of hospitalisation thick a diabetes complication acute for one year and for each
           patient Compare two exercise's intensity: first lactate threshold (SL1) and crossover
           (PCGL).
