    
      PET imaging will be broken down into 2 groups of subjects (dosimetry and kinetic dynamic
      imaging/[11C]palmitate comparison) with entry into these groups will occur simultaneously.
      All PET imaging will be performed with a Siemens Biograph 40 PET-CT scanner. All patients
      will undergo routine clinical evaluation as dictated by the treating heart failure
      cardiologist. The results of the PET studies will not be provided to the patient or the
      treating cardiologist unless, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, the images
      demonstrate an unsuspected abnormality that may warrant further evaluation. Subjects will be
      instructed not to eat after midnight the night before the study. However, patients will be
      instructed to continue their heart failure and diabetic medical regimens. The morning of
      their PET study, subjects will have two intravenous catheters placed. One will be placed in
      each arm for the purpose of administering radioactive tracers ([15O]Water, [11C]Palmitate,
      and [18F]FluorbetaOx), drawing blood samples for safety laboratory analysis. Urine samples
      will be obtained along with an Electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs. A follow-up telephone
      contact will be done 2-3 days post imaging study to capture unanticipated and serious adverse
      events (SAEs).
