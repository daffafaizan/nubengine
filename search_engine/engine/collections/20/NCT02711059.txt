      >6.1 and HbA1c without medical treatment will be included after informed consent and
      randomised to parathyroidectomy (PTX) within three months or not. The groups will be examined
      4 ±4 weeks before and 12±2 weeks after PTX, similar for the control group. The number of
      participants will be estimated by power calculations based on a pilot study including 20
      patients.

      The test protocol includes glucose load with control of glucose and insulin, (0, 30, 60 and
      120 min) together with measurement of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation.
