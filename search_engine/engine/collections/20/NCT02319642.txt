      Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) for 6 months as additional medication to methotrexate (MTX) with or
      without folic acid in Chinese subjects with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who participated
      in the main feeder study, RA0044. All subjects will continue to receive their established
      treatment with MTX with or without folic acid. The dose of MTX may be decreased by the
      Investigator due to toxicity, but should not be discontinued completely. Concomitant
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral corticosteroids will be permitted. For each
      subject, the study duration will last a maximum of approximately 32 weeks.
