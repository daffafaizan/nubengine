      randomly selected and the participant will not be told which treatment they are receiving.
      Subjects will fall into one of the four treatment groups described below:

        1. 2 weeks of active rTMS treatment followed by washout and then by 2 weeks sham

        2. 2 weeks of sham followed by washout and then 2 weeks of active rTMS treatment

        3. 4 weeks of active rTMS treatment followed by washout and then 4 weeks of sham

        4. 4 weeks of sham followed by washout and then 4 weeks of active rTMS treatment

      For the washout period between the two interventions, we will plan a minimum of 2 weeks to
      avoid the problem of carryover effects. Prior to starting the next intervention after the
      washout period, we will re-assess subject's tinnitus severity. To ensure no carryover effect,
      the washout period will be extended for those subjects whose tinnitus severity, as defined by
      the THI, is more than 20 points different than their baseline THI score.
