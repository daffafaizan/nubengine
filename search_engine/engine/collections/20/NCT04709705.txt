    
      A randomized, parallel group, active comparator-controlled trial to evaluate the
      non-inferiority or superiority of Cryopreserved Platelets with Liquid Stored Platelets in
      controlling blood loss in patients undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery. Patients
      planning to undergo Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery with risk factors for significant bleeding
      post-surgery will be approached. Subjects will be randomized using clinical site and presence
      of an underlying congenital or acquired hypercoagulable state as a stratification variable in
      a 1:1 ratio to receive either Cryopreserved Platelets or Liquid Stored Platelets. Eligible
      subjects will undergo Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery and at the completion of bypass and
      heparin reversal subjects will likely be assessed for eligibility before coming of bypass.
      Study platelets will be given either intraoperatively after heparin reversal and return of
      active clotting time (ACT) to < 140 sec or post operatively (after chest closure).
