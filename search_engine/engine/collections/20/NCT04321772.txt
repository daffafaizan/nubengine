      with different legs. HIIRT technique consisted of three sets of: 6 repetitions at 6RM (6
      repetitions maximum) and then 20 seconds of rest and 2/3 repetitions (until exhaustion)
      repeated for 3 times with 2'30" rest between sets; while TRT consisted of 3 sets of 15 reps
      with 75 sec of rest between sets. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken at baseline
      (pre), immediately (0h) at the end of training, 6 hours (6h) and 24 hours (24h) after
      training. Western blot and RT-PCR mRNA (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction)
      analysis were performed to assess muscle signalling pathway activation
