      treated with bryostatin 1. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. For patients with stable or
      responding disease after completion of course 2, treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
