      participants. These experimental sessions will be performed on three separate days. Each
      session will last between 1.5 and 2 hours.

      The first session will correspond to a familiarization session with the different tests that
      will be performed during the two next sessions. During this first session, different
      functional tests will be also performed : 1-minute sit-to-stand tests and postural tests,
      with and without a concomitant cognitive task.

      The second and third sessions will correspond to experimental sessions during which the
      participants will accomplish a fatiguing task in single or dual-task situation (randomized
      order). The cognitive task will be a memory cognitive task, called n-back task. The fatiguing
      tasks will involve submaximal isometric contractions of the knee extensors performed until
      task failure. The neuromuscular fatigue will be evaluated regularly during the fatiguing
      tasks (i.e. about each minute) using the magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve in order
      to assess to central and peripheral determinants of the neuromuscular fatigue. Moreover, the
      autonomic nervous system activity (via cardiac recordings), perceived exertion and cognitive
      performance (in dual-task situation) will be continuously recorded during the fatiguing
      tasks. Before and after each fatiguing tasks, several questionnaires will be completed (i.e.
      mood, motivation, subjective workload) in order to evaluate the psychological determinants of
      performance.
