      Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant with 3M No-Rinse Cleanser and Coloplast Conveen Critic
      Barrier with Easi-Cleanser) against standard care (Skin wipes and Conveen Critic Barrier) in
      the management of Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis (IAD) in hospitalised patients.

      To date, there is no conclusive evidence on the "best treatment" for patients presenting with
      IAD. This has led to current clinical practices tend to select IAD products based on its cost
      and availability, which can be heavily influenced by marketing and commercialisation efforts.

      This study allows investigation of the effectiveness of IAD products to ensure the provision
      of optimal care.
