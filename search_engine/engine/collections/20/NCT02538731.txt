    
      Purpose Very large bile duct stones are difficult to remove.Dilation-assisted stone
      extraction, also termed small endoscopic sphincterotomy plus endoscopic papillary large
      balloon dilatation, is safe and effective technique for the treatment of large CBD
      stones.However, in approximately 5-10% of patients, the removal of large bile duct stones may
      be difficult. For this selected group of patients for whom all conventional endoscopic stone
      treatment devices have failed, laser lithotripsy technology has provided an approach to the
      fragmentation of difficult bile duct stones.

      A single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) system(SpyGlass Direct Visualization System, Boston
      Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) has overcome most of the conventional cholangioscopy
      limitations.We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Spyglass-guided laser lithotripsy
      for difficult CBD stones not amenable to conventional dilation-assisted stone extraction
      therapy.

      Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Allocation: Randomized Endpoint Classification:
      Safety/Efficacy Study Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Masking: Single Blind (Subject)
      Primary Purpose: Treatment Official Title: Randomized Trial of Spyglass Guided Laser
      Lithotripsy Versus Dilation-Assisted Stone Extraction for the Endoscopic Removal of Difficult
      Large Bile Duct Stones

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      • Bile Duct Stone Clearance Confirmation that no further stones remain in the bile duct of
      the patient by cholangiography. Additionally, serum laboratory abnormalities in AST, ALT,
      Alkaline Phophatase, or bilirubin, or epigastric abdominal pain attributable to bile duct
      stones.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Number of ERCP

        -  The number of ERCP procedures required to complete clearance of bile duct stones.

        -  Total Procedure Time

        -  The total time in minutes for all the ERCP procedures required for stone removal.

        -  Estimated Procedure Cost

        -  The cost of patient management for bile duct stones based on the cost of the procedure,
           hospitalization, and associated costs of complications of cholangitis, pancreatitis,
           perforation, and bleeding.

        -  Cholangitis Cholangitis after or between ERCP procedures will be defined as a
           presentation with epigastric abdominal pain, temperature greater than 38.5 Celsius
           accompanied by either laboratory abnormalities of the AST, ALT, Alkaline Phosphatase, or
           Bilirubin or abnormal imaging of the biliary tree on ultrasound,computed tomography
           scan, or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.

        -  Pancreatitis

        -  Pancreatitis following or between ERCP procedures will be defined as the onset of
           epigastric abdominal pain and either amylase or lipase greater than 3 times the upper
           limit of normal or findings on ultrasound, computed tomography scan, or magnetic
           resonance cholangiopancreatography suggestive of pancreatic inflammation.

        -  Bleeding

        -  Bleeding attributable to stone therapy will be defined as a drop in hemoglobin by more
           than 1 gm/dl following or between ERCP procedures with no other cause identified on
           standard clinical evaluation.
