      would only be opened if Arm A is deemed tolerable.

      The study consists of 2 periods: Screening (up to 28 days) and treatment period. The Dose
      Limiting Toxicities (DLT) observation period is set at the beginning of the treatment period.
      A subject can continue to participate in the study after the end of the DLT observation
      period until discontinuation criteria are met. After discontinuation of study drug treatment,
      all subjects will complete an end of treatment visit and safety follow-up visits.
