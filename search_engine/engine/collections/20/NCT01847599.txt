    
      200 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria treated by capecitabine +/- lapatinib,
      will be enrolled into the study. Adherence to treatment of all subjects will be assessed
      during a first adherence evaluation period of 3 cycles in order to identify patients who need
      educational intervention(non adherent patients). Only nonadherent patients (adherence rate <
      80%) will receive an education intervention. During the educational program, the efficacy of
      the implementation of an educational program on adherence to capecitabine alone or in
      combination to lapatinib will be evaluated for the 6 subsequent cycles.
