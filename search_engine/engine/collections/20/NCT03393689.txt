    
      The radioligand 68Ga-NODAGA- E[c(RGDyK)]2 targets the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence known to
      bind with the αvβ3 integrin that is expressed on the surface of angiogenic blood vessels or
      tumor cells. The radioligand can be used to visualize tumor angiogenesis using PET/MR.

      A total of 40 patients diagnosed with sporadic vestibular schwannomas will be subjected to an
      angiogenesis-PET/MR scan. Follow-up MR-only scan will be performed (from the time of the
      angiogenesis PET/MR) minimum 2 months later in regards to calculate growth rate. The uptake
      of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 (Standardized Uptake Values, SUVmax) in tumor lesions will be
      quantified as Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean) and compared with PFS, DSS and OS
      (dichotomized above/below median SUVmax and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier).
