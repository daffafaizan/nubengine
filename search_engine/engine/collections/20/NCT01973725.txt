      carcinoma.More effective therapy for patients with this disease who developed disease
      progression after first line therapy is needed.Although Erlotinib is recommended in NCCN
      Guideline Version 2.2013,there is still insufficient evidence on EGFR-TKI as second-line
      therapy for esophageal squamous carcinoma.Therefore,further research is necessary.In this
      phase II study,we evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib Hydrochloride as treatment for
      patients with recurrent or metastasis esophageal squamous carcinoma after failure of
      conventional chemotherapy,and analyse the value of biomarkers of these patient to identify
      who benefit.
