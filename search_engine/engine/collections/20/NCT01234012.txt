      (SEREX), using tumor mRNA and autologous serum from an esophageal cancer patient. Reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that NY-ESO-1 displayed the
      typical expression pattern of cancer testis antigens (CT antigens). NY-ESO-1 mRNA was
      expressed only in testis of normal tissues tested and in various types of cancer, including
      lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma and bladder cancer. Since testis is an immune
      privileged organ where HLA molecules are not expressed, these antigens can be considered
      tumor-specific.

      IMF-001 is a CHP-NY-ESO-1 complex consisting of recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein and cholesteryl
      hydrophobized pullulan (CHP). CHP forms colloidally stable nanoparticles in water and
      complexes with substrate such as NY-ESO-1 protein.

      It is well known that exogenous antigen proteins can induce specific CD4+ T cells but not
      specific CD8+ T cell. Dendritic cells pulsed with IMF-001 induced NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+ T
      cells in blood samples of 4 healthy volunteers. These data suggest that immunization of
      patients with IMF-001 can evoke not only specific CD4+ T cells responses but also specific
      CD8+ T cell response to NY-ESO-1 more effectively than NY-ESO-1 protein alone. Similar
      results for both cellular and humoral immunity in response to NY-ESO-1 protein were observed
      in previous clinical investigational studies with IMF-001.
