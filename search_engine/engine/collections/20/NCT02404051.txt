      irreversible steroidal aromatase inactivator that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment
      of postmenopausal patients with ABC. Exemestane is indicated for adjuvant treatment of
      postmenopausal women with HR+ EBC who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are
      switched to exemestane for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant
      hormonal therapy. It is also indicated for the treatment of ABC in postmenopausal women whose
      disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy (in the USA) or following antiestrogen
      therapy (in Europe). In 2011, the BOLERO-2 trial reported (5; 33) a significant benefit for
      HR+ HER2- postmenopausal pretreated women in the ABC setting by combining everolimus with
      exemestane. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial a statistically
      significant improvement in PFS by adding everolimus to exemestane versus exemestane alone was
      reported. Adding everolimus determined a 2.4-fold prolongation in PFS from 3.2 up to 7.4
      months and so lowered the risk of cancer progression by 56% for these women. These findings
      were confirmed by an independent assessment (4.1 vs. 11.0 months, risk reduction: 64%). The
      QoL data shows positive trend in the everolimus plus exemestane treatment arm.
