      in education or employment and thereby improve integration of refugee families.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of various social and health promoting
      activities such as physical activity workshops, community gardening, entrepreneurship
      training, MindSpring course, family excursions and language education on health, well-being,
      social relations and success with job and education. Increased success with self-sufficiency
      can support action competence and play a key role in the integration process. Outcome
      measures are based on self-reporting, biological measures and municipal registry data.
