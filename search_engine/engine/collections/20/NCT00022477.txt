        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
           colorectal cancer treated with BMS-247550.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response, median and overall survival, and time to progression
           in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-10
      months.
