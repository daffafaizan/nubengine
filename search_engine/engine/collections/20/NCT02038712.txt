      fast. Following baseline measures they will be provided wither with a 600mL (600kcal) liquid
      meal (Fed condition) or a volume matched amount of plain water (Fasted condition) to consume
      within 15 min in a randomized crossover design. Blood samples will be collected for during
      the subsequent 120min to measure the glucose, insulin and gut hormone responses, and
      subjective appetite ratings will be collected. 1500mg of acetaminophen will be added to each
      of the test drinks so that the appearance in the blood can be used as a proxy measure of
      gastric emptying. Participants will then undergo a 45min brain scan to assess the responses
      to visual and auditory food cues.
