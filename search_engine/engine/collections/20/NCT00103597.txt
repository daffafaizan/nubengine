      symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Each patient will fill out two validated questionnaires
      to determine if they are candidates for the study. Baseline patient details, such as their
      medications and UPDRS, will be recorded. Medications must be held stable during the period of
      the study.

      Each patient will then have three weeks of conservative therapy, three weeks of therapy with
      fludrocortisone, and three weeks of therapy with domperidone. Autonomic testing, a symptom
      questionnaire, bedside blood pressure testing, and UPDRS will be performed after each
      intervention.
