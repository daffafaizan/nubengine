      is among the most common diabetes-related cause of hospitalization and the leading cause of
      diabetes-associated lower limb amputation. The effectiveness of various systemic antibiotics,
      particularly the fluoroquinolones, in treating infected DFUs has been demonstrated.

      An alternative or adjunct to systemic antibiotic treatment of infected DFU's is topical
      antibiotic treatment. Topical treatment would have the advantages of avoiding systemic
      adverse effects, providing increased target site concentration, and allowing the use of
      antibiotics not approved for systemic treatment.

      AppliGel-G is a topically applied hydrogel formulation of gentamicin sulfate (GMS). Once in
      place the product remains in contact with the wound bed and releases Gentamicin to the wound
      bed.
