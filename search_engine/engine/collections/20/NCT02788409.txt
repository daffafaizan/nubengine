    
      Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride) is an alpha-emitting pharmaceutical, which was approved for
      the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), symptomatic bone
      metastases, and no known visceral metastatic disease. The long-term safety profile of Xofigo
      is evaluated in the prospective REASSURE study, which estimates the incidence rates of second
      primary malignancies in patients with CRPC receiving Xofigo.

      To provide context on that, this retrospective study is conducted to estimate background
      rates of second primary malignancies among patients with CRPC similar to those who are
      treated with Xofigo.
