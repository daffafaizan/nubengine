      population. PTSD symptoms include re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of reminders
      of the trauma, and increased arousal. The primary treatments of PTSD are psychotherapy and
      antidepressant medications. While both are effective, many patients continue to have
      significant symptoms. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a new research
      and treatment modality that uses a small powerful electromagnet to directly stimulate the
      brain. This stimulation may increase or decrease brain activity. The treatments have been
      shown to be effective in other disorders such as depression. Initial treatment of patients
      with PTSD using rTMS has been hopeful. This study is the first randomized controlled trial to
      examine the efficacy of rTMS for PTSD.

      This study would be the first randomized placebo controlled trial to examine the efficacy of
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for PTSD. The primary hypothesis is that there will
      be significant improvement in the patients' PTSD symptoms from pre-treatment to
      post-treatment with rTMS. A secondary hypothesis is that the patients' co-morbid depressive
      symptoms will improve from pre-treatment to post-treatment. Forty subjects with PTSD will be
      recruited from the White River Junction VAMC. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      either active rTMS or sham rTMS. Patients, staff performing the treatments, and staff
      completing the assessments will all be blinded to active or sham treatment.
