    
      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of pomalidomide, based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of pomalidomide
      will be tested for the Phase I portion of this study. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled
      at each dose level in the Phase I portion, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in
      Phase II. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group
      will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were
      seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pomalidomide is found.

      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive pomalidomide at the highest
      dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone and melphalan. If
      intolerable side effects are seen at the lowest dose level, then the melphalan dose will be
      lowered.

      After 2 cycles of therapy, you may be referred to a transplant specialist, if you are
      eligible for a stem cell transplant.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Treatment Phase:

      You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-21 of each cycle. You should take each
      dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow the pomalidomide capsules
      whole with water at the same time each day. Pomalidomide should be taken without food (at
      least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal). Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If
      you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss
      taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (DO NOT
      take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You should tell the study
      doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide. If you take more than
      the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care, if needed, and
      contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused pomalidomide and empty
      bottles to the clinic at each study visit.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan or
      dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets
      you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to
      review.

      On Days 1-4 of each cycle, you will take melphalan pills by mouth one time each day. You
      should take melphalan in the morning at least 2 hours before or after a meal.

      You will take dexamethasone pills on Days 1-4 of each cycle.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You will receive a
      blood thinner to prevent blood clots. The study doctor will decide what type of blood thinner
      you will receive.

      Maintenance Phase:

      You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle during the maintenance
      phase. You should take each dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow
      the pomalidomide capsules whole with water, at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or
      open the capsules. If you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the
      same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next
      scheduled day (DO NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You
      should tell the study doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide.
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical
      care, if needed, and contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused
      pomalidomide and empty bottles to the clinic at each study visit.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan, or
      dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets
      you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to
      review.
