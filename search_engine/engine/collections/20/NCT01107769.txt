      instrumentation following analysis of health economic data. It is hypothesized that patient
      matched cutting block technology VISIONAIRE™ may reduce TKA operative time, blood loss,
      surgical error and adverse event risk as well as providing improved mechanical alignment. In
      order to test this hypothesis, subjects will be randomized to either VISIONAIRE™ or standard
      TKA instrumentation groups. One site will enroll a total of 38 patients; 19 patients per
      group. All patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in this protocol will
      be asked to participate in the study. If the patient consents to participate, they will be
      enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two study arms. Patients requiring TKA
      will be implanted with Legion, Genesis II or Journey BCS (Smith & Nephew) total knee implant
      systems. Standard instrumentation will be used to assist the surgeon in placing the implant
      in the control group. In the VISIONAIRE™ group, standard instrumentation will not be used in
      the surgery. Patients randomized to the VISIONAIRE™ arm will have an MRI preoperatively that
      will be used to create the customized cutting blocks. All patients will have an x-ray at each
      postoperative interval.
