      assessments of the patient and his caregiver will be made by the rehabilitation's therapist
      himself.

      Twelve weekly interventions at home are planed. The first five are needed to define a
      realistic and achievable goal of treatment which is accepted by the dyad and the therapist.
      The following seven interventions will achieve this goal by rehabilitation's intervention
      (e.g. occupational therapy, psychomotor approach).

      Four filmed sessions for dyad's assessment are planned (at inclusion, at weeks 5 and 12 after
      inclusion and 3 months after the last intervention).
