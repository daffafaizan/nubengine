      treatment to improve heart muscle perfusion in patients with chronic CAD. Patients treated
      with MSCs had significant increased exercise capacity, reduction in angina, angina attacks
      and medication and in life quality at 6 months follow-up. For all the parameters there was a
      tendency towards improved outcome with increasing number of cells. The treatment with MSCs
      was safe.

      The investigators have now established a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients
      with CAD to test efficacy and safety of treatment with MSCs to improve perfusion in the heart
      muscle and exercise capacity, and reduce the patient's symptoms.
