      For this study, participant will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the
      interview, participant will be asked questions about participant's demographics (age, sex,
      etc.), any chemicals participant may have been exposed to, participant's medical history,
      family history of cancer, participant's diet, and participant's smoking and alcohol use
      histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview.

      Participant will also have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for special tests. These tests
      will look for any biologic factors associated with AML.

      The interview and the blood draw may be done during a regularly scheduled visit to M. D.
      Anderson, or may be scheduled at the time and place of participant's convenience.

      Participant may be contacted at home by phone so that researchers can collect information
      about any changes in participant's health status.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,200 participants will take part in this study.
