    
      This trial is a prospective, observational, non-randomized controlled study. A total of 1000
      patients requiring mobile intensive care unit intervention for a septic shock in the
      pre-hospital setting will be included. Pre-hospital blood lactate levels will not be taken
      into account to decide patients treatments and/or ED or ICU admission. In the pre-hospital
      setting, each patient will benefit from 2 measurements of blood lactate level: initial
      measurement at the first contact, and final measurement at the hospital admission with a
      specific point of care medical device.
