      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still obscure. BSP is characterized by excessive
      involuntary closure of the eyelids. Pathological changes in excitability in the primary motor
      cortex (MC) and secondary motor areas, such as the anterior cingulate (AC), pre-and
      supplementary cortex (PMC, SMA) are suggested from electrophysiological and brain imaging
      studies. It is conceivable that modulation of excitability in some of these areas may lead to
      amelioration of the symptoms of BSP. Cortical excitability can be experimentally changed by
      various well-established electrophysiological techniques non-invasively.

      METHODS: In this pilot protocol, studying 30 patients with BSP, we will use repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the AC, PMC, SMA and MC in two different
      inhibitory modes: low frequency rTMS ((lf) rTMS) and continuous theta burst stimulation cTBS.
      Furthermore, we will apply transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) in an inhibitory mode
      (cathodal tDCS) over the MC and low intensity high frequency supraorbital electrical
      stimulation; the latter will be performed in patients and in 7 healthy subjects. The effects
      on blepharospasm will be objectively measured by electrophysiological measures (blink reflex
      recovery curve (BRR), blink rate observation by an investigator blinded to the intervention,
      and a subjective rating by the patient.

      OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that we will find variable amounts of clinical improvement in BSP
      patients with these different methods. With this study, we aim to get more insight to the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of BSP and identify which method of non-invasive
      brain stimulation may be clinically most efficacious.
