      healthy subjects will participate in the study. The movement of the diaphragm will be
      measured during tidal breathing then, during holding a load corresponding to 20% of the
      subjectÂ´s body weight and finally, during voluntary contraction of the trunk muscles. Trunk
      muscles contraction will be measured by a special device with pressure sensors placed on a
      trunk surface. Breathing activity will be measured by spirometry.
