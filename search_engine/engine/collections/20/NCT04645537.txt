      with age, and it presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms and severity. It has been
      estimated that number of AF patients is about 150 000 in Finland, and this number will be
      increased at least two-fold until year 2050.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence and risk of stroke, systemic
      thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, major bleeding events, and mortality in
      relation to different attitudes regarding stroke prevention treatment among AF patients.

      An important part of the study is also the assessment of cost effectiveness of different OAC
      therapies. The risks mentioned above are separately evaluated with different management
      levels of warfarin therapy as well as with different NOACs and in patients without OAC
      treatment. The study population is also characterized according to co-morbidity, interactive
      medications and antiarhythmic drugs in use.

      The study with cohort design is conducted as a nationwide retrospective register-based
      linkage study using data obtained from the Finnish health care registers. The study cohort
      consists of patients from six hospital district areas having a diagnosis of AF. The catchment
      population of these six districts is about 3.5 million; 64 % of the total Finnish population
      5.5 million.

      The study is register-based and patients will not be contacted in any phase of the study.
      Thus, no patient consents will be needed according to Finnish legislation. All patient data
      handled by the researchers will anonymous, ensuring full data protection of the patients.
