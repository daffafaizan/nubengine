      facilitate lung cancer screening completion in an extremely high-risk group, NYC Chinese
      livery drivers who smoke or who quit within the past 15 years. A series of focus groups with
      Chinese livery drivers who smoke, a series of in-depth interviews with livery base management
      and staff, primary care physicians (PCPs), clinic directors, hospital CFOs, heads of
      financial services and counseling, and heads of radiology facilities serving the Chinese
      community were conducted to explore barriers and factors related to cancer screening.
      Findings were used to develop adapted intervention materials, including a CHW Manual for
      Facilitating Shared Decision Making and Lung Cancer Screening. Once adaptation is complete,
      we will conduct a pre-pilot to refine our adapted CHW intervention materials. We will then
      conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility of the refined
      CHW model (intervention) versus written materials (control) to facilitate SDM and LCS (when
      appropriate) in an extremely high-risk group, NYC Chinese livery drivers eligible (by USPTSF
      criteria) for LCS. Feasibility results will be used to inform the planning and design of
      large scale RCTs, targeting Chinese drivers, as well as other driver populations in NYC and
      throughout the U.S., and other high risk Chinese smoking populations in other occupations
      (e.g. restaurant work, construction). The study is currently in the pre-pilot phase and
      expects to launch the pilot phase by the summer of 2020.
