    
      Postinfectious-IBS (PI-IBS) can be defined as the acute onset of new IBS symptoms in an
      individual, who has not previously met the criteria for IBS, immediately following an acute
      illness characterized by 2 or more of the following: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or a positive
      bacterial stool culture.

      Our group previously have reported clinical course of PI-IBS in a homogenous cohort which was
      comprised of patients recovered from Shigellosis. And in current study, we finally report a
      collective result of 10-year long-term follow-up of our small, but well-followed, homogenous
      cohort of PI-IBS after Shigellosis.
