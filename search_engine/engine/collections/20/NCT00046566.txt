      At least 50 million adult Americans have high BP, which is one of the most important
      modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease, stroke, and end-stage kidney disease.
      Nutrient intake has been related to the development of high BP, and nutritional modifications
      have become an important approach for the treatment and prevention of high BP. While the
      effect of sodium, potassium, and alcohol on BP has been studied extensively, the effect of
      dietary macronutrients, such as protein, has not been as well studied. Results from this
      study may provide justification for recommending protein supplements for the prevention and
      treatment of high BP in the general population.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will enroll 280 healthy participants with BP levels higher than optimal or with
      stage-1 hypertension (systolic BP of 120-159 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 80-95 mm HG).
      Participants will be recruited by a mass mailing and a worksite/community-based BP screening
      in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. Following a two-week screening period,
      eligible participants will receive either 40 grams of soy protein, 40 grams of milk protein,
      or 40 grams of complex carbohydrates (control) daily for eight weeks. Following those eight
      weeks, participants will not receive any supplements for three weeks. Participants will then
      repeat the process with the other two supplements. The primary outcome will be difference in
      BP during the soy protein supplementation, milk protein supplementation, and placebo control
      phases. In addition, changes in serum lipids; waist and hip circumference; and fasting plasma
      insulin, glucose, leptin, and homocysteine will be monitored and examined in terms of impact
      on BP level.
