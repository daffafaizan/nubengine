      gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers in Brazil. Subjects are eligible if they
      have low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia according to FIGO 2000 criteria and the
      FIGO/WHO prognostic risk score. The study includes two treatment arms: immediate treatment
      with single-agent chemotherapy (center choice of agent) or second uterine curettage. The
      primary outcome is the rate of primary remission. Secondary outcomes are the number of
      chemotherapy cycles required to achieve remission, rate of primary chemotherapy resistance,
      rate of relapse, and overall survival.
