    
      This study is a multicenter, national and international, prospective observational
      comparative effectiveness study.

      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of echinocandin versus
      amphotericin B or triazole antifungal therapy for pediatric invasive candidiasis and for
      invasive candidemia. The primary effectiveness endpoint for study aim 1 is the comparison of
      global response at 14 days of antifungal therapy between antifungal therapeutic classes. The
      secondary effectiveness endpoints for study aim 1 are comparative effectiveness of the 1)
      global response to antifungal therapy after 30 days and 2) all-cause mortality at 30 days.

      The secondary aim is to characterize the frequency of pediatric candidiasis by describing the
      incidence of pediatric candidiasis relative to all pediatric admissions. For this aim, the
      investigators will use descriptive statistics to establish the frequency of hospital
      admissions involving an invasive candidiasis per total hospital admissions and total hospital
      days during the study period.
