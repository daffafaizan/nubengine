      intravenous chemotherapy, with six fold higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [1].
      Anticoagulation for malignancy associated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) can be difficult
      because of different limitations like bleeding, drug-drug interactions with chemotherapy and
      inconvenience with repeated subcutaneous injections of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)
      [2]. In comparison with patients without active malignancy, patients with cancer who are on
      warfarin therapy have 2 to 6 folds more major bleeding events and 2 to 3 times more VTE
      recurrence [3,4]. The American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines recommended (LMWH) as
      standard therapy for management of acute VTE in patients with active malignancy [5].
      Recently, Rivaroxiban and Edoxaban were considered as an alternative to weight-adjusted
      subcutaneous LMWH after pulmonary embolism in patients with active cancer without
      gastrointestinal (GIT) malignancy [6]. Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor approved by
      FDA for treatment of DVT and VTE [7]. However its efficacy in management of acute DVT and VTE
      associated with cancer is still unresolved issue. The aim of study was to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Apixaban in patients with acute deep venous thrombosis and active
      malignancy compared with weight adjusted subcutaneous (LMWH).
