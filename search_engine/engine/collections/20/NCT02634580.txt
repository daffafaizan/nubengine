      allocation ratio of 2:2:1:1 into 4 groups: evolocumab (AMG 145) 420 mg administered by
      subcutaneous injection monthly and placebo pill daily; evolocumab 140 mg administered by
      subcutaneous injection every two weeks and placebo pill by mouth daily; placebo 420 mg
      administered by subcutaneous injection monthly and ezetimibe 10 mg pill daily; placebo 140 mg
      administered subcutaneous injection every two weeks and ezetimibe 10 mg pill daily.
      Randomization was stratified by screening LDL-C level and baseline statin use. Participants
      on low or atypical statin dose therapy must have been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks
      prior to screening and throughout the blinded portion of the study; the dose could not be
      adjusted during screening and for the duration of the study. After Week 12, ezetimibe was
      discontinued and participants moved to an open-label dose of evolocumab administered by
      subcutaneous injection either every two weeks or monthly and their standard of care.
