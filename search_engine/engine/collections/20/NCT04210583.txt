      floor therapy with electrical stimulation of the vaginal musculature to promote muscle
      strength. Although surgery to tighten the vaginal introitus has been used, pain at the
      incision site leading to dyspareunia, sometimes for months, limits its use. Surgery is also
      recommended to reduce protuberant mons pubis and the outer labial lips of the labia majora.
      Most often, the mons pubis has been treated by fat reduction, either by liposuction or open
      excision along with a pubic skin lift. Surgery to reduce the excess skin of the labia majora
      tends to be avoided due to a lack of operative techniques and a fear of creating sexual
      dysfunction. Development of alternative methods of treatment, avoiding the usual surgical
      complications is warranted.

      The use of non-ablative radiofrequency (RF) therapy has been used previously for the external
      and internal female genitalia without incident or complications. The use of Multi-Polar RF
      and PEMF technology was already demonstrated to be safe and efficient in delivering heat to
      the tissue. A previous study investigated the safety and efficacy of combining these
      technologies for the treatment of vaginal laxity and in the treatment of the mons pubis and
      labia for the improvement in skin laxity at four-months post-treatment. Efficacy and safety
      was confirmed up to 4-months post-treatment. (Venus FioreTM CS0716 study, unpublished raw
      data). However, the durability of the treatment is not known.

      This study will investigate whether Multi-Polar RF and PEMF technologies for the treatment of
      vaginal laxity and for the treatment of the mons pubis and labia is safe and efficacious at
      six-months and twelve-months post-treatment.
