    
      This is a mutlicentric, open-label non-randomized, national, 1-stage phase II trial to assess
      efficacy and safety of a weekly Carboplatin-Paclitaxel adjuvant chemotherapy after intensity
      modulated extended-field chemoradiation in patient suffering from of locally advanced
      cervical cancer with para-aortic positive nodes.

      Patients

        -  will be registered in the first part of the study at diagnosis and will receive a first
           part of treatment corresponding to a standard of care (standard concomitant
           radio-chemotherapy, "Part 1 of the study").

        -  will be included in the second part of the study for the second part of treatment
           (experimental adjuvant chemotherapy, "Part 2 of the study"), providing they fulfill
           eligibility criteria at this stage (no progression during Part 1 of the study and no
           medical contra-indication to the study treatment).

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy with
      Carboplatin-Paclitaxel administrated in adjuvant situation after concomitant
      radio-chemotherapy in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients treated for a
      locally advanced cervical cancer presenting positive lombo-aortic lymph nodes.
