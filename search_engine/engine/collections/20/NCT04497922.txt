      about a patient's emergency department course of their satisfaction surrounding the emergency
      department stay. The experience of patients in the emergency department has been
      significantly altered by the COVID-19 pandemic due to decreased in-person encounters, and the
      use of PPE. Delivering information about their clinical course and expected hospital course
      is more difficult now given the emphasis on less in-person interaction. In response, the
      investigators have deployed in collaboration with e-ink, a virtual e-paper white board that
      can be remotely edited to help display pertinent hospital course information to patients in
      the emergency department. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      understand the effect of deploying these white boards on patient satisfaction in the
      emergency department.
