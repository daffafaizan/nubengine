      pure tone audiometry by the responsible examiner for the study, Pernille Vandborg, MD. The
      aim was to see whether the exposed group suffered any long term sequelae to the extreme
      neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, i.e. impaired motor development or hearing impairment, compared
      to a control group. The examinations took place at the local hospital.
