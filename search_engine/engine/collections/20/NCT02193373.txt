      rib-raising, and stellate ganglion release, impact autonomic nervous system tone. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of four cohort groups, receiving either sub-occipital
      release, rib-raising, stellate ganglion release or all three treatment techniques. A shift
      towards sympathetic tone will be induced in all subjects using a tilted-to-seated-position
      test (Tilt-Seated Position test) and cognitive challenge test, consisting of computerized
      questions that become progressively more difficult, and which subjects are asked to answer as
      quickly and accurately as possible. These stress tests will be induced twice, once without
      any OMM treatment and a second time with the designated OMM treatment(s). The
      sympathetic-dependent response to orthostatic change and cognitive challenges will be
      determined by Fourier analysis of heart rate variability, recorded using an EKG attached to
      each subject.
