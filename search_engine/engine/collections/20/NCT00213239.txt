      lumbar puncture. Propofol provides amnesia, anxiolysis, and hypnosis, but because propofol
      has no analgestic properties patients often respond to the pain of LP needle insertion. To
      ensure patient immobility, the dose of propofol is often increased, resulting in a duration
      of action that is excessive for lumbar puncture. Remifentanil is an ultra-short acting opioid
      which can be used to provide analgesia and sedation for short painful procedures with minimal
      residual pain. However, when used as the sole agent, remifentanil is associated with a high
      incidence of respiratory depression and/or arterial oxygen desaturation and does not provide
      amnesia or anxiolysis. The combination of propofol and remifentanil may be particularly
      suitable for short duration procedures, providing a shorter recovery time and fewer side
      effects than either drug used alone.

      The objective is to determine the minimum effective dose of remifentanil required to prevent
      movement for insertion of a lumbar puncture needle when co-administered with propofol. The
      results obtained from this study will be used in a future study of the recovery
      characteristics of propofol and remifentanil in children undergoing lumbar puncture.
