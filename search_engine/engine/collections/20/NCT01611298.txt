    
      To participate in this study, patients will need to have given informed consent to have a
      bone marrow transplant. Before receiving the tetanus vaccine, we would like to test the
      patient's immune system against tetanus. We will again want to test the patient's immune
      system against tetanus on the day the patient receives the bone marrow transplant.
      Approximately 3 months after transplant, if the patient is still eligible, they will receive
      an additional tetanus booster shot. We will again draw blood to test their immune system
      against tetanus at the time points listed below.

      TREATMENT PLAN:

      If the subject meets eligibility requirements and consents to be part of this study, we will
      collect 8 mL (1.7 teaspoons) of blood from the subject to test their immunity 7 to 10 days
      before their bone marrow transplant. The subject will receive a tetanus vaccine (given as an
      injection into the upper arm or thigh muscle) on that same day. We will then collect
      approximately the same amount of blood (2 teaspoons) on the day the patient would receive the
      bone marrow transplant. We will also collect the same amount of blood 1 week, 2 weeks, 4
      weeks and 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the transplant. This will help us to see how
      the patients immune system responded to the vaccine.

      Three months after the transplant, the patient will receive an additional tetanus vaccine
      (known as a booster shot), but only if the patient is still eligible to receive it. Patient's
      will only be eligible to receive the booster shot if they remain well and do not have any
      other problems such as severe infection, graft versus host disease or relapse. We will
      collect 8 ml (1.7 teaspoons) of blood 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after receiving the booster
      shot to determine if they respond to the vaccine.
