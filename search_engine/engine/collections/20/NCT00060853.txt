      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex in planning, problem solving, economic exchange and reasoning; and the role
      of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will
      ascertain the relationship between so-called [cold] cognitive processes such as planning and
      [hot] social processes such as mate choice and specific brain regions within the prefrontal
      cortex. We will also attempt to determine the relationship between non-frontal neural
      structures involved in emotional expression, such as the amygdala, and those frontal neural
      structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion. In addition, we will
      attempt to determine the requirements for frontal-parietal versus frontal-temporal network
      involvement in spatial landmark tasks. The data that we collect in this protocol will be of
      value in identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of
      knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal cortex. These questions will be addressed
      over seven separate studies with healthy, normal adult volunteers. The studies will employ
      within- and between-subject, event-related fMRI designs. The data collected will consist of
      behavioral measures of cognitive and emotional performance/judgment and corresponding fMRI
      images.
