        -  To determine a unique molecular "finger print" of primary Wilms tumor arising in
           ethnically diverse children who are at increased risk to develop this lethal malignancy
           and subsequently relapse.

        -  To determine a unique protein "finger print" from the urine of ethnically diverse
           children who develop Wilms tumor and subsequent relapse.

      OUTLINE: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and snap-frozen primary tissue samples, and urine
      samples collected at the time of diagnosis and before treatment, are analyzed for molecular
      and protein profile by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, western blotting, immunohistochemistry,
      and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays.
