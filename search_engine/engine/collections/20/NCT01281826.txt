      which vertebra to treat is frequently difficult. In such patients, the treatment location is
      commonly determined from findings at imaging, which includes magnetic resonance (MR) imaging,
      bone scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT).

      The bone marrow edema (BME) in acute/subacute VCFs is useful in determining the vertebra that
      is to be treated.

      MR imaging provides information on anatomic vertebral collapse and the loss of normal T1 high
      signal intensity from the marrow space of vertebrae with acute fractures. Loss of normal T1
      high signal intensity indicates the presence of BME, which is the important sign for the PVP
      treatment of VCFs.

      Dual-energy (DE) CT has been used to create a virtual unenhanced scan by subtracting iodine
      from contrast agent-enhanced CT examinations.We expect that the same technique can be used to
      calculate a virtual noncalcium image from an unenhanced image, which makes bone marrow
      accessible for CT diagnosis.
