    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate engraftment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) allografts given after conditioning with total-body irradiation (TBI) (200 cGy)
      and post-grafting immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CSP)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in
      myeloma patients initially cytoreduced with high-dose melphalan.

      II. To evaluate non-relapse mortality at day 100 post allografting. III. To evaluate the
      efficacy of this allografting strategy in terms of long-term progression free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive high-dose melphalan intravenously (IV) over 15-20
      minutes on day -2.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) on
      day 0.

      NON-MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Beginning 40-120 days after autologous transplant,
      patients undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily (BID) on days -1 and 0 and
      orally (PO) BID on days 1-80 with taper based on evaluation of disease response and
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days
      0-27.

      POST-TRANSPLANTATION DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION (DLI): Beginning 4 weeks after
      immunosuppression, patients achieving persistent or progressive disease may undergo DLI over
      30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 3 treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
