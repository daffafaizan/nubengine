      I. To determine if the addition of OBP-301 to chemoradiation with carboplatin/paclitaxel is
      safe.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess toxicities associated with the addition of OBP-301 to chemoradiation.

      II. To assess the number of clinical complete responses (cCR). III. To assess the number of
      patients alive/without progression (progression-free survival [PFS]) and the number of
      patients alive (overall survival [OS]) at 1 and 2 years.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To report correlate outcomes - cCR, PFS and OS - with immune and virus-based correlative
      assays.

      OUTLINE:

      This study will evaluate an initial dose of OBP-301 and a de-escalated dose, if needed.

      Patients receive OBP-301 by intratumoral injection via endoscopy on days -3, 12, and 26.
      Patients also receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over
      60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, and undergo radiation therapy on Monday through
      Friday beginning day 1 for 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks. All treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 6-8 weeks, then every
      3 months for 2 years.
