      the abnormal hemoglobin to form fibers that stiffen and distort red blood cells and
      consequently, cause vaso-occlusion in the small vessels of the tissues. Currently,
      hydroxyurea is the only approved drug for treating sickle cell disease, but is only partially
      effective. This protocol seeks to identify by high sensitivity in vitro screening methods
      additional compounds that inhibit sickling. Subjects with sickle cell trait or disease and
      normal volunteers will be asked to donate blood samples for studies to verify their
      hemoglobinopathies and then periodically donate small volume samples of fresh blood for use
      in ongoing high throughput screening tests to identify potentially clinically useful
      anti-sickling drugs.
