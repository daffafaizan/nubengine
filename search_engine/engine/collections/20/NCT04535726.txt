      considered as a disease with simple diastolic dysfunction, but after the 21st century, HFpEF
      was considered as a heterogeneous disease with multi-organ and multi-system design, which is
      related to various complications, such as hypertension, obesity and arteriosclerosis. Other
      studies have found that hypertension and obesity are respectively associated with increased
      arterial stiffness. However, there is still no research investigating the the relationship
      between blood pressure and arterial stiffness in HFpEF patients with different levels of
      obesity.
