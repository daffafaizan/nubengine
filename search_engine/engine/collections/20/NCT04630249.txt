    
      Participants: 100 adult, pregnant women receiving prenatal, mental health and/or substance
      use disorder treatment within the MUSC Health System.

      Intervention: Listening to Women is a mobile phone-based program designed to enhance delivery
      of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), an evidence-based
      approach for mental health and substance use screening and treatment for perinatal women.
      This program was created as a result of key informant interviews with obstetric providers and
      pregnant and postpartum women with opioid use disorders. The program utilizes mobile phone
      text message-based screenings with immediate automated feedback, paired with remote care
      coordination and, if appropriate, home-based telemedicine mental health and substance use
      disorder treatment services.

      Design: This is a two-arm pilot RCT (N=100) with 2:1 allocation will examine feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of LTW, compared to TAU. The investigators aim to identify and address
      barriers in recruitment, retention, use of LTW, as well as provide effect size estimates for
      a larger RCT.
