      injury (AKI) complicates as many as 36% of these procedures, doubling total hospital costs.
      Even minor changes of serum creatinine in the postoperative period have been associated with
      decreased survival. When dialysis is required, short-term mortality may exceed 60%. Moreover,
      AKI predicts increased long-term mortality regardless of other risk factors even when kidney
      function has recovered. Despite this, clinicians have limited tools to preoperatively
      identify patients at risk for AKI. Identification of high-risk patients preoperatively could
      impact clinical decision making around surgical technique (e.g. off-pump) and timing of
      surgery in addition to perioperative management (hemodynamic monitoring, use of certain
      drugs, fluid management etc.).

      The prospective single-center study investigates whether abnormal preoperative Doppler-based
      renal venous flow profiles as surrogates for right heart failure predict risk of acute kidney
      injury after cardiac surgery.
