      compared with natural cycle, including the conventional single long acting GnRH agonist
      injection in the mid luteal phase of the previous cycle of the endometrial priming and the
      single daily antagonist injection (Cetrorelix 0.25 mg) administered in the early follicular
      phase followed by endometrial priming. Endometrial biopsy will be taken in luteinizing
      hormone

        -  7 or with P4 +5 in cases with endometrial priming with oestrogens therapy.
