    
      The aim of this study is to characterize the diagnostic accuracy of both multi-parametric
      pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (T2-weighted, Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI),
      Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) and 68Ga-chelated Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen
      ligand (68Ga-PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET /CT) in three
      cohorts of patients:

        -  COHORT 1 Guiding prostate biopsies in men with clinical suspicion and/or unconfirmed
           clinically-significant prostate cancer (CS-PCa) on initial prostate biopsy;

        -  COHORT 2 Targeting repeat prostate biopsy in patients on Active Surveillance (PRIAS
           Study), scheduled for PRIAS repeat biopsy;

        -  COHORT 3

      Providing pelvic / whole-body pre-surgical staging in:

        -  3a: men with high-risk PCa (HR-PCa);

        -  3b: men candidates for nerve sparing surgery (NSS);
