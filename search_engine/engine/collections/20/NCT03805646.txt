    
      Broadly, this study aims to answer three questions. (1) Is it feasible to call discharged
      trauma patients on their mobile phones to check up on them? (2) Can a defined set of
      questions help determine which discharged trauma patients require further medical care (and
      which discharged trauma patients do not require further medical care)? (3) Will checking in
      on discharged trauma patients reduce their experience of disability and economic
      consequences?

      If an individual was a trauma patient who was admitted at and then discharged from one of the
      study's partner hospitals in Cameroon, the discharged individual (hereafter referred to as
      "the participant') will be receiving phone calls from one of the study's research assistants
      at the following post-discharge timepoints: 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Whether
      the research assistant administers the defined set of questions developed by the study's
      investigators (see question 2, above) will depend on when the participant was discharged from
      the hospital. Regardless, all participants will be asked other important questions about the
      injury and any associated disabilities and economic consequences.
