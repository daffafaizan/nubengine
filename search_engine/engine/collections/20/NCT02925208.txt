      insertion or cochleostomy, if we have to. In cases with very laterally placed vertical
      segment of the facial nerve a trans- mastoid trans- attic approach used with trans canal
      monitoring as an alternative approach. Position of the vertical segment of the facial nerve
      (VFN) determined by coronal view HRCT of temporal bone, bone window of 0.6 mm thickness by
      using the cut posterior to the internal auditory canal at the level of lateral semicircular
      canal (LSCC) and then drawing a line parallel to the bony canal of the VFN and another
      parallel line on the outer bony wall of lateral semicircular canal (LSCC), and comparing
      level of both. The location of the facial nerve classified into normal if the FN is medial,
      same level or lateral to LSCC . Investigators referred the laterally placed FN (LPFN) when
      the whole vertical segment of facial nerve is lateral to LSCC. In addition, distance between
      VFN and LSCC was measured in cases of laterally placed FN.

      Investigators proposed a radiological classification system of the mastoid segment of facial
      nerve to predict round window niche accessibility through posterior tympanotomy
      pre-operatively by using coronal view computed tomography scan of temporal bone. Facial nerve
      position classified into 3 types in relation to LSCC:

        1. TYPE I Medial to LSCC

        2. TYPE II Same level of LSCC

        3. TYPE III Laterally placed to LSCC III a) Less than 2mm III b) More than 2mm
