      underlying human memory and use direct brain stimulation as a tool (intervention) to study
      the relationship between those dynamics and memory performance. The investigators will
      collect recording and stimulation data from 250 patient volunteers as they perform
      carefully-matched verbal and spatial memory tasks. During non-stimulation sessions, the
      investigators will measure correlative neural biomarkers of memory encoding and retrieval
      using standard clinical depth electrodes and micro-wire recordings. To test the causal role
      of these biomarkers, the investigators will employ direct brain stimulation to briefly
      modulate neural activity, and measure ensuing changes in behavioral performance. With a set
      of causal biomarkers and predictive models in hand, the investigators will finally ask
      whether model-driven stimulation paradigms offer the investigators the ability to reliably
      modulate neural activity, and consequent behavior, in real-time.
