    
      Study IPI-145-22 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two-arm Phase 3 study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of DBR vs
      PBR in subjects with previously-treated iNHL (including follicular lymphoma [FL], small
      lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL] and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]).

      Approximately 600 subjects will receive 25 mg of duvelisib or placebo, orally BID for 28 day
      continuous cycles, in combination with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab given on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6
      and 90 mg/m2 of bendamustine given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycles 1-6. Subjects will receive
      duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
