      participants will be allocated into midazolam, dexmedetomidine and propofol group. Resting
      and task fMRI will be performed at awake (BIS>90), mild sedation (BIS 80-85), moderate
      sedation (BIS 65-75), deep sedation (BIS 45-55) and recovery states (BIS >90). The primary
      outcome of our study is the effect of different levels of sedation for brain network
      connection. The secondary outcomes are the effect of different levels of sedation for
      default, executive control, sensory and motor networks and their subnetwork connectivity; the
      sedation state, circulatory and respiratory parameters of the participants, and the adverse
      events.
