      >3 months. PHN develops in about 10% of patients following an episode of AHZ. 95% of adults
      ate seropositive for varicella zoster virus antibodies, and are, therefore, at risk for AHZ
      and PHN. Wider use of AHZ vaccine approved in 2006 may reduce the incidence of PHN.
      Nevertheless, PHN may be severe and frequently interferes with daily activities and with
      sleep.

      First line management of PHN pain currently is tricyclic anti-depressants and
      anti-convulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, and use of a 5% lidocaine patch. second
      line therapies include opioid analgesia and topical capsaicin: combinations of topical and
      systemic therapies may be used as well. These therapies have common side effects of dry
      mouth, constipation, sedation, urinary retention, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, weight gain
      and peripheral edema.

      there is an unmet medial need for topical therapies that demonstrate efficacy without the
      significant side effects o the therapies mentioned above. 3VM cream, a low concentration of
      copper in a cream vehicle may b such a therapy.
