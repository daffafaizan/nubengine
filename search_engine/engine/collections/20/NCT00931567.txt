    
      Main evaluation criteria :

      Time duration between the operation and the complete wound healing. The wound healing is
      considered complete when the skin is closed and when the patient do not need to have
      dressings. A picture of the wound at the end of the wound healing process is taken for each
      patient.

      Secondary criteria of evaluation :

      At day 1, day7, day 14, day 21 and day 28 two data will be collected :

        -  The pain during the dressings' change using a visual scale going from 0 (no pain) to 10
           (very painful).

        -  The bleeding (and "exudate") of the wound which can be absent, low, moderate or
           abundant.

      The investigators will collect all the side effects described by the patients for each wound
      healing technique.
