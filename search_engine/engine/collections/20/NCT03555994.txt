    
      This is a 2-part exploratory Phase 2 study.

      Part A is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of
      MEDI0382 (also known as Cotadutide) administered once daily subcutaneously (SC) for 28 days
      on hepatic glycogen metabolism in overweight and obese subjects with T2DM. Part A is planned
      to randomise up to 20 subjects. Subjects from Part A will not be re-enrolled in Part B.

      Part B is an exploratory Phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label
      active comparator study to evaluate the effect of MEDI0382 on hepatic glycogen metabolism in
      overweight and obese subjects with T2DM. Part B is planned to randomise approximately 30
      subjects (not to exceed a maximum of 35 subjects). Subjects in Part B will be randomised to
      receive double-blind MEDI0382 or placebo, or open-label liraglutide once daily for 35 days.
