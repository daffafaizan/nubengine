      I. Testing if steady state (SS)-cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are superior to dynamic
      susceptibility contrast-(DSC)-CBV maps in visualizing of brain tumor blood volumes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Development of the SS-CBV mapping for quantitative CBV estimation. II. Assessment of
      therapeutic response. III. Association with survival. IV. Correlation of relative cerebral
      blood volume (rCBV) with histology. V. Assessment of late ferumoxytol (ferumoxytol
      non-stoichiometric magnetite) enhancement at various stages of disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 2 doses (2nd dose optional) of gadoteridol intravenously (IV) and undergo
      MRI including DSC or dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE)-CBV mapping over approximately
      45-60 minutes on day 1. Within 3 days, patients receive 3 doses of ferumoxytol
      non-stoichiometric magnetite IV and undergo MRI including DSC and SS-CBV mapping after each
      dose over approximately 90 minutes. Patients undergo MRI without contrast 24 hours after
      ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite over approximately 30 minutes. This 2-3 day series
      of imaging repeats at different stages of disease and may be performed up to 5 times: prior
      to surgery, prior to chemoradiation therapy, 4-6 weeks post-chemoradiation therapy, at time
      of progression on gadolinium MRI per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria,
      and again at time of progression (if the previous time of progression showed
      pseudoprogression).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks.
