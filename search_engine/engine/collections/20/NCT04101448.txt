      any real increased prevalence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD? Does the presence of
      bronchiectasis have an impact on the clinical characteristics, prognosis, or response to
      treatment in COPD, to the extent that it can be considered a distinct clinical phenotype?
      Should bronchiectasis in patients with COPD be seen as merely a comorbidity, or as a
      consequence of the disease's natural history? Is there a causal relationship between COPD and
      bronchiectasis? If this is the case, what are the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible
      for this relationship? And, finally, what is the role of chronic bronchial infection and
      exacerbations in this relationship?
