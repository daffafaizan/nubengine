      reaction to self-antigens or an innate inflammatory reaction secondary to an external
      stimulus. Corticosteroids are considered the gold standard in management of acute AU, but it
      is necessary to combine them with other immunosuppressive drugs. Finally, biological
      anti-inflammatory agents (for exapmle antagonists of tumor necrosis factor alpha like
      Infliximab and adalimumab) are also showing very promising results. Follow-up visits of
      subjects with uveitis must be frequent and focused on monitoring the recurrence of acute
      outbreaks, , if any. They should be aimed to determine the evolution of inflammatory signs
      until their complete resolution, thus ensuring the least possible consequences. After the
      initial phase of the treatment, the duration of use of the maintenance medication is directly
      related to the diagnosis, treatment and control of the underlying disease. This will help to
      determine if a patient is badly controlled and requires a more aggressive therapeutic plan.
      Also, a complete physical exam must be done each time the patient sees to the physician in
      order to monitor ophthalmological complications or development of adverse effects secondary
      to the treatment.
