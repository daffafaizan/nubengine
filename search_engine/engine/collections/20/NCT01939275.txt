      I. To compare tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab) in
      gastric cancer patients with pathologic evaluation of tumor human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)/neu expression.

      II. To compare copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab-PET-CT scan with standard radiographic imaging
      for staging patients with gastric cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and then undergo
      PET/CT scan on days 2 or 3.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 15 days and periodically for up to 6
      months.
