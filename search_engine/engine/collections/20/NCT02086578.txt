      placement. As is the current practice at MSKCC, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy will
      undergo expansion during chemotherapy, with exchange for a permanent implant to be performed
      approximately one month after chemotherapy and radiation to begin approximately one month
      after exchange. Patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy will undergo "rapid expansion"
      of the expander and begin radiation at least 4 weeks following surgery, although it may be
      performed sooner if the patient has recovered from surgery and the treating physician deems
      it safe to proceed with treatment. In these patients, exchange for the permanent implant will
      occur at the discretion of the treating plastic surgeon (approximately 5-8 months after the
      end of radiation).
