      investigation. Soldiers will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group 1 will consume
      the probiotic plus HMB, group 2 will consume HMB only, group 3 will consume only the
      probiotic, and group 4 will consume only placebo. All four groups will be garrisoned
      together, eat the same meals, and perform the same activity. All groups will be tested before
      as well as after an 8-week advanced infantry training program. During each testing session
      resting blood samples will be obtained to assess cytokine, inflammatory, and muscle damage
      markers. Additionally, questionnaires will be used to determine digestive health.
      Anthropometric, performance, and muscle volume measures will also be assessed prior to and
      immediately following the supplementation and training protocol.
