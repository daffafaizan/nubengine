      patients with pulmonary infection are included in a retrospective study and 100 patients go
      through metabolomics research. All patients receive clinical questionnaires, laboratory
      examinations and pulmonary function tests. Investigators study on pathogen distribution and
      infection ratio of patients above depending on follow-up survey. 1:1 nested case-control
      study is carried out involving 100 cases from pulmonary-infected group paired with 100
      control cases matched for gender, age and fasting blood-glucose. The final purpose is to
      create a precise warning model in order to develop a rapid detection of pathogen of lower
      respiratory infection in diabetes patients. Now investigators wish to register this study to
      do a further research, in order to improve the early diagnosis of diabetes complicated with
      pulmonary infection and to reduce the mortality.
