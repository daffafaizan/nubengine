      focus for the coalitions to prioritize their planning and action; developing coalitions that
      have a shared vision and mission; developing a strategic plan focused on structural changes
      to reduce risks associated with HIV; documenting processes; providing feedback as technical
      assistance to the coalitions; hosting regular working group meetings; and on-going capacity
      building. The National Coordinating Center (NCC), operating under the direction of the
      Protocol Chair, provides guidance, training, technical assistance and feedback to coalitions.

      The evaluation of C2P includes both process evaluation (i.e., documentation of coalition
      actions and achievements of structural changes; and outcome evaluation to qualitatively
      assess (via Key Informant (KI) interviews) if and how C2P efforts, including completed
      structural changes, have influenced the risk environment within each community. In addition,
      local health surveillance data and HIV testing data will be used to evaluate changes in HIV
      testing patterns and HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) morbidity among youth.
