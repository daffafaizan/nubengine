      in the workplace and particularly true for nurses practicing in a hospital environment. A
      number of factors (e.g. an aging population, the obesity epidemic, patients presenting with
      multi-system diseases, etc.) have dramatically increased the demands on hospital nurses in
      the past decade. This increased stress has potential ramifications at a personal level (e.g.
      increased risk of ill health) as well as an institutional (e.g. higher staff turnover).
      Meditation has been shown to be an effective tool for stress management. A self-directed,
      computer-guided meditation training program that can be pursued independently may be
      particularly useful for hospital nurses where scheduling challenges may preclude the use of
      scheduled classes. Healing Rhythmsâ„¢ is a computer program that teaches meditation and uses
      biofeedback (heart rate variability and galvanic skin response) to reinforce the training.
