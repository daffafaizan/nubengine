    
      Primary objective

      - To determine whether vedolizumab is present in significant quantities in the stool of
      patients receiving induction therapy with vedolizumab for active UC.

      Secondary objective (s)

        -  To evaluate whether the presence and quantity of vedolizumab in stool can be used to
           predict primary non-response to vedolizumab.

        -  To explore whether a correlation exists between stool vedolizumab concentrations, serum
           vedolizumab concentrations and UC disease activity and extent.

        -  To determine whether there is a correlation between stool and serum vedolizumab levels
           and trafficking of Th1/Th17 effector memory CD4+ T-cells (the key pathogenic subset in
           IBD) to the colon in UC.
