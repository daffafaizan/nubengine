      stage of P. falciparum. It is produced as an 83-kDa polypeptide by mature schizonts in
      infected erythrocytes. In clinical studies in malaria-unexposed adults in the USA and in
      malaria-exposed adults in Mali, AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel was safe and immunogenic. This study will
      evaluate its safety and immunogenicity in malaria-exposed children living in an area of
      seasonal malaria transmission.
