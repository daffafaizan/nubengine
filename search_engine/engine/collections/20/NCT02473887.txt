      Emergency Department in the state of Qatar between September 2014 and January 2015, with
      acute gastroenteritis with mild to moderate dehydration, more than 2 episodes of vomiting in
      the last 24 hours, and who had failed oral rehydration trial in the department as per the
      department oral hydration protocol. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as diarrhea and
      vomiting for less than a week period.

      Hydration level was assessed for all patients on arrival, and eligible patients were enrolled
      after obtaining an informed written consent.Enrolled patients received intravenous
      ondansetron form orally after being flavored 1:1 with ORA-sweet, the dose of ondansetron was
      determined based on the patient presenting weight. Palatability was evaluated by the primary
      investigator within one minute fom drug administration applying taste scores for children and
      recorded according to a specific scoring system. All patients were kept nil per oral for 30
      minutes and then oral rehydration trial was started as per the department rehydration
      protocol. If the drug was vomited within 30 min of administration, a similar second dose was
      given. Blood level for ondansetron was collected 4 hours after the successful drug
      administration and was sent to the department laboratory within 5 min. Patients were sent
      home when they were ready for discharge as per the treating physician discretion. All
      patients were followed by a telephone call after 24 hours to assess the safety and efficacy
      of the orally taken ondansetron.
