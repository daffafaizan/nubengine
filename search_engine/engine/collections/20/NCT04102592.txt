    
      This is a two-phase, mixed-methods pilot study of insecticide-treated lesus to reduce the
      incidence of P. falciparum malaria among infants in a rural area of western Uganda.
      Participants will be recruited from four villages immediately adjacent to the Bugoye Level
      III Health Centre (Bugoye, Kanyanamigho, Izinga, Rwakingi 1a) in the Kasese District of
      western Uganda.

      The first phase will consist of a series of focus group sessions with mothers of young
      children and their male partners to gain further insight into lesu use, to include location
      of purchase and frequency of washing, as well as exploring initial perceptions of
      insecticide-treated clothing and inform the protocols for the open-label study.

      The second phase will consist of a prospective, open-label study. Twenty-five (25) mothers
      and their young children will be provided with insecticide-treated lesus and twenty-five (25)
      controls who will be provided untreated lesus. After an initial visit, bi-weekly follow up,
      including finger-prick blood collections will continue for a period of twelve (12) weeks.

      Collected blood spots will be transported to Epicentre for real-time PCR to identify
      sub-microscopic parasitemia and to the French Research Institute for Development
      (https://en.ird.fr) in Marseille, France for quantification of the mosquito salivary antigen
      (gSG6-P1 peptide). Remaining samples will be stored for future analysis.
