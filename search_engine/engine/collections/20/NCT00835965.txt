      laparoscopic abdominal surgery. PONV is multifactorial, and the treatment is multimodal.
      Preoperative treatment should target the specific mechanism of PONV to minimize its
      incidence/consequences to the benefit of the patients.

      Aprepitant, a selective antagonist of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors, blocks the emetic
      effects of substance P.5 Substance P action on the NK-1 receptors in the central nervous
      system (CNS) is one of the final pathways to an emetic response. Dexamethasone is an
      inexpensive and effective antiemetic drug with minimal side effects after a single-dose
      administration. The commonly used minimal effective dose is 8 to 10 mg, but the dose 5 mg is
      suggested for PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. Based on the literature
      review, occurrence of PONV does not significantly differ at dosing of Dexamethasone equal or
      higher than 4 mg.

      This study compares the incidence of nausea, vomiting, need for rescue medication, prolonged
      PACU time, and unplanned hospital admission in patients with high risk for PONV treated with
      oral aprepitant and dexamethasone or aprepitant alone preoperatively.
