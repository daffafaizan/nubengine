      therapeutic intervention to reduce plasma glucose levels (amount of glucose found in the
      liquid part of blood) and HbA1c.

      In this study, the investigators hope to define the role of increased plasma glucagon,
      decline in plasma insulin, and fall in plasma glucose concentration. The investigators will
      examine whether the signal for the increase in EGP (endogenous glucose production) caused by
      glucosuria (an excess of sugar in the urine, typically associated with diabetes) is mediated
      via the decrease in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, or by the increase in plasma
      glucagon concentration.
