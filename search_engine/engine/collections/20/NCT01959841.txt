    
      A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of ASP2151 (200 mg and 400 mg) in comparison with valaciclovir (VACV) 3000 mg in
      patients with herpes zoster. The efficacy will be evaluated for the primary endpoint defined
      as, "the proportion of subjects achieving cessation of new lesion formation by Day 4 of study
      treatment" to demonstrate the non-inferiority of ASP2151 to VACV. The safety will be
      evaluated based on adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs.
