      prevention of falls and fractures among patients aged 65+
      (http://www.chu-montpellier.fr/fr/crepc/). The FPC that opened in 2015 is a member of the
      European Commission in its European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP
      on AHA) A2 action plan. The main mission of the clinic is to identify the underlying causes
      of the patients' falls, and to address modifiable risk factors in collaboration with family
      physicians in order to prevent injurious falls.

      Based on a geriatric assessment performed by a geriatrician, a podologist, a occupational
      therapist, and a physiotherapist, the likely diagnoses and recommendations are notified in
      the medical report that is handed over to the patient or the caregiver for the patient's GP,
      along with the prescriptions, and sent also by mail to the GP. Recommendations remain under
      the GP's control with the possibility of another consultation if needed.

      All patients admitted to the FPC are reassessed by phone at 3 months to register falls and
      injuries, and at 6 months to register falls and injuries, assess fear of falling, mobility
      and ability to perform activities of daily living, and satisfaction for the programme, and
      list proposed measures effectively applied.
