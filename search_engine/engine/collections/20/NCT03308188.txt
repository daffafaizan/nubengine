      with reduced opioid reliance in chronic pain patients, which can, ultimately, reduce risks of
      unintended opioid overdose and death. Importantly, the study will contribute to a better
      understanding of the mechanisms contributing to opioid use reduction while managing pain. The
      findings may assist in developing treatment options for a population at risk for opioid
      adverse effects.

      Potential participants will be identified through electronic health record (EHR) queries at
      participating sites. Participants will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the 4-month
      treatment period, and at 6 months following end-of-treatment through an electronic data
      capture system accessed by the participants. Other outcome data will be obtained from the
      participant's EHR data.
