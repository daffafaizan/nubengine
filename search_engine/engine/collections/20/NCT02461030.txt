      dentin hypersensitivity on subjects undergoing non-surgical periodontal treatment, over a
      period of 8 weeks. The study was conducted in Piracicaba Dental School, Piracicaba, SÃ£o
      Paulo, Brazil, using a double-blind/two treatment design. Sixty subjects (30 per group) that
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to the groups: Test group
      (Non-surgical periodontal treatment + In-office application of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief -
      CSPR + tooth brushing with at home CSPR toothpaste) and Control group (Non-surgical
      periodontal treatment + In-office application of a fluoride-free prophy paste + tooth
      brushing with a Colgate Cavity Protection Toothpaste). Air blast sensitivity assessments were
      used to compare the efficacy of the two approaches using both the Schiff scale. The
      sensitivity parameters were measured at baseline, 1, 4 and 8 weeks.
