      heart failure, in both as the bridging to heart transplantation or as the destination
      therapy. These patients have highly impaired systolic function which contributes to global
      heart dysfunction. The main complication is arising of pulmonary vascular pressures and
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and, consequently, right heart dysfunction. From the data
      in literature, RV dysfunction exist in approximately 25%-40% of patients with implanted LVAD,
      and in approximately 20%-30% of those died or have need for the RV assist device due to RV
      failure refractory to medications. Capability of the RV to maintain appropriate output and
      the fill of the LVAD is the main point for correct LVAD functioning and patients' early and
      late postoperative outcome. Preimplantation evaluation by echocardiography estimation of RV
      function, geometry and tricuspid valve function are the criteria for the diagnose of RV
      dysfunction. Laboratory analysis which can lead to the diagnose of RV dysfunction are also
      included in preimplantation evaluation. Specific inotropic therapy in patients with moderate
      or severe RV dysfunction and/or dilatation can improve RV function in preimplantation period.
      This is predominantly important in patients who were on the prolonged inotropic support with
      beta-agonist therapy before LVAD implantation and in whom their beta receptors are exhausted.
      The investigators will exam the hemodynamic effects of levosimendan administrated day before
      in patients underwent LVAD implantation. Further, investigators will analyze and evaluate
      early and late outcome in participants with implanted LVAD.
