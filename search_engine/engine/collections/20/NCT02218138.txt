      of two 6-week group programs: 1) Learning to BREATHE - a mindfulness-based program, or 2)
      Colorado Blues - a cognitive-behavioral program. After the group, girls return for three
      follow-up visits over the course of a year. The main outcomes are depressive symptoms and
      insulin resistance. We also are assessing stress, eating behavior, fitness, and mindfulness.
