      package of IMI DIRECT (WP2). These two cohorts are designed to address the area of glycaemic
      deterioration by amassing data and biomaterials that will be used to discover novel
      biomarkers for glycaemic deterioration in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes
      (Study 1) and in those who have recently been diagnosed with the disease (Study 2).
