      development. These properties are still maintained in the adult age and potentially activated
      in case of brain lesion. In the present study authors hypothesized that a significant
      recovery of voluntary muscle contraction in post stroke patients experiencing severe upper
      limb paresis can be obtained, when proprioceptive based stimulations are provided. The
      proprioceptive based training (PBT) aims to stimulate the emergence of voluntary contraction
      and to foster motor recovery. It is based on motor learning principles, such as the
      repetition of tasks with concurrent use of feedbacks. The proposed concept is based on the
      concurrent repetitions of movements performed with the non-affected limb and with the
      affected one, passively mobilized by physiotherapist in charge of guaranteeing the optimal
      kinematic execution.
