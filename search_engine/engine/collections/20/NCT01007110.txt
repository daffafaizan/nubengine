      heart rate (HR) and higher heart-rate variability (HRV). In another study, we found that
      infants on DHA supplemented formula have lower HR. Because DHA supplementation in infancy is
      associated with improved neurobehavioral outcomes and infants with lower HR and higher vagal
      control have been found to have improved developmental outcomes, the first aim is to conduct
      a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether maternal DHA supplementation
      during pregnancy results in lower HR and higher HRV in the fetal period. We will document
      other fetal neurobehaviors (body and breathing movements) as they are hallmarks of fetal
      well-being and influence HR and HRV.
