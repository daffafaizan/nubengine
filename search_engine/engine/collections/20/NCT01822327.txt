      parameters to patient characteristics. Such a one-size-fits-all approach is problematic
      because of the heterogeneity of the clinical population. Additionally, the approach is often
      subject to opposing biases either towards constraining costs or maximizing efficacy. This
      project includes two sequential clinical trails examining variations of the CRA + Vouchers
      treatment for cocaine dependence that are designed to explore matching treatment parameters
      to patient baseline characteristics known to moderate treatment response among
      cocaine-dependent outpatients. In Trial 1, all patients were randomly assigned to receive 24
      weeks of CRA therapy but randomly assigned to one of three voucher-based incentive
      conditions: (a) 6 weeks of vouchers contingent on abstinence and incentive monetary value at
      usual level; (b) 6 weeks of vouchers contingent on abstinence but incentive value set at
      usual level for low-severity patients (intranasal cocaine users or married patients) and at
      twice the usual value for high severity patients (i.e., unmarried cocaine smokers/injectors),
      or to (c) a control condition where incentives were provided independent of recent cocaine
      use. In Trial 2, all patients receive 12 weeks of abstinence-contingent incentives, but
      randomly assigned to also receive (a) 24 weeks of CRA therapy or (b) 4 weeks of CRA therapy.
      The overarching goal of the two trials is to strike a balance between the aforementioned
      biases towards constraining costs or maximizing efficacy and thereby facilitate cost
      containment without compromising efficacy, especially among more severe patients.
