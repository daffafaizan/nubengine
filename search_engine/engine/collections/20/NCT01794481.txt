      (with/without chemotherapy) to avoid large surgical procedures. However, definitive radiation
      treatments can cause side effects (like mouth sores, difficulty swallowing) that often cause
      weight loss. It has been shown that a significant percentage of the weight loss is due to
      loss of muscle mass. Resistance exercise training works to increase muscle strength and
      endurance by doing repetitive exercises with weights, weight machines, or resistance bands.
