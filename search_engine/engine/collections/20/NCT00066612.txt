        -  Determine the probability of response (confirmed complete and partial response) to
           treatment with irinotecan in patients with recurrent or refractory advanced transitional
           cell carcinoma of the urothelium previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior pelvic
      radiotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-10
      months.
