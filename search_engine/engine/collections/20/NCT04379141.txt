      state in a short period of time. Hypotension after anesthesia induction is closely related to
      many organ injuries. Gastrointestinal surgery patients' prohibition of fasting is an
      important mechanism of severe hypotension after anesthesia induction. At present, ultrasonic
      measurement of inferior vena cava and internal jugular vein has been proved to be a
      convenient and non-invasive means to evaluate patients' blood volume. The purpose of this
      research was to study the relativity between ultrasonic measurement of inferior vena cava and
      internal jugular vein and hypotension after anesthesia induction in patients.
