      phase 2 trial that evaluates the concurrent treatment of cisplatin (Day 1: 75mg/m2) and
      pemetrexed (Day 1: 500mg/m2 for non-squamous cell lung cancer) or etoposide (Day1-3 100mg/m2
      for squamous cell lung cancer), 3-weekly regimens, together with radiotherapy (24 daily
      fractions of 2.42 Gy to the mediastinal lymph nodes with an integrated boost of 2.75 Gy to
      the primary tumour). An interim analysis is planned following the first cohort of 25 patients
      to assess safety.
