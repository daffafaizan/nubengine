      Approximately 100 of these cases will be completed in an office setting, with the remaining
      400-500 cases completed in a hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center. Subjects will
      undergo a hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure to remove intrauterine polyps and submucosal
      fibroids.
