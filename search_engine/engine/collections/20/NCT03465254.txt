    
      This is a cohort study that aims to determine the relative risk of developing
      virologically-confirmed dengue among Philippine children who are eligible to receive dengue
      vaccine during the DOH Mass Dengue Vaccination. Additionally, it also aims to determine the
      relative risk of developing severe and/or hospitalized virologically-confirmed dengue among
      Philippine children who received the Dengue vaccine, describe the epidemiologic trends and
      characteristics of virologically-confirmed dengue among these children, and assess the
      performance of simpler tests such as dried blood spots and serum IgG for the assessment of
      dengue seroprevalence at the population level. We will enroll children who are residents of
      selected areas in Region 7, Philippines. Children should be eligible to participate in the
      Department of Health mass dengue vaccination. They will be prospectively venipunctured for
      baseline dengue serologic status. The blood samples will be stored for serologic testing
      using neutralization tests and commercial IgG tests. Children in the cohort will be followed
      up, and those who present with <5 days of fever will be identified and blood drawn for dengue
      LAMP and RT-PCR.
