      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as defined by a set of patient-specific tumor mutations. The
      analysis will be undertaken using the Signatera Assay from Natera. Circulating tumor DNA in
      plasma samples obtained over the course of pembrolizumab treatment will be assessed by
      high-intensity, next-generation genetic sequencing to identify genomic alterations in genes.
      The assay will target 16 defined patient specific mutations. Data acquired will be analyzed
      to characterize the association between these genetic elements, clinical response, and
      durability of responses. There will be prospective and retrospective groups for the study.
      Samples will be collected from patients in the prospective cohort who have been treated with
      pembrolizumab monotherapy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center under standard of care
      treatment. Subjects in the retrospective cohort will provide genetic data.
