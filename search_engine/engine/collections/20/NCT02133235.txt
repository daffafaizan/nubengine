      blockers (EBB) have been presented effective and safe alternative for lung separation in
      vedio-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) operations. However, there were previous reports showed
      that it takes longer time to position the EBB versus the double lumen tubes. Placing EBBs
      need three-step procedure (one is placing an endotracheal tube, the second is inserting the
      EBB, the third is confirmation of the position by fiberoptic bronchoscopy). In this study,
      the investigators will randomize the patients receiving VATS operation with EBB into two
      groups: one group will receive the conventional 3-step procedure, the other group receive two
      step procedure without confirmation by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
