      promote erythropoiesis on patients with chronic kidney disease. Two phase 3 clinical trials
      have verified the efficacy and safety of roxadustate as therapy for anemia in patients with
      CKD and undergoing dialysis. A high increasing rate of Hb or Hb overshooting triggered by
      roxadustat need dosing reduction or even drug withdrawal, possibly leading to a large Hb
      variation and adverse subsequences. Therefore, we were of interest to investigate whether a
      lower starting dose of roxadustat could achieve comparable Hb target at week 12 while
      lowering the risk for Hb over 130g/L through a prospective peritoneal dialysis (PD) cohort.
      Peritoneal dialysis patients diagnosed with renal anemia will be divided into standard
      roxadustat dosage group and lower roxadustat dosage group. After 12 weeks, we will compare
      the target-met, overshooting and variation ratio of hemoglobin between these two groups.
