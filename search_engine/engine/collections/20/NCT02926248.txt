    
      Adult primary unilateral TKA patients with less than 90Â° of knee flexion between 5 and 12
      weeks after their index surgery will be screened for trial eligibility based on the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria above. Only patients from the protocol surgeons will be eligible to
      participate in this trial. MUA will be performed prior to 12 weeks after the index TKA.
      Patients will be randomized to either oral colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 6 weeks
      (treatment arm) or to oral placebo twice daily for 6 weeks in the placebo arm. All patients
      will follow a standardized post-MUA physical therapy protocol. Data will be collected
      prospectively, including study data collection sheets and medication diary. Other data
      sources will include office and inpatient medical records, operative reports, physical
      therapy records, hospital picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and radiology
      records. Outcomes will be collected at MUA, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year.
