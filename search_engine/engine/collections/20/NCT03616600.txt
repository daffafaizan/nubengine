      approximately 80% of children are myopic by the end of childhood. Current treatment
      strategies to control (i.e. slow) myopia progression in children are primarily designed to
      harness the natural "emmetropization" process, in which visual feedback from retinal image
      clarity regulates the rate of eye growth. There is intense interest currently in the
      potential role of peripheral defocus as a clinical treatment to slow myopia progression, not
      least since this approach permits clear central vision. One of the most successful treatments
      for myopia is orthokeratology, which is a therapy of using custom-made rigid gas permeable
      contact lens. The special design of this contact lens can reshape the corneal profile to
      minimize the central refractive error while producing beneficial peripheral defocus.
      Currently, Breath-O correct lenses are new designed ready-made orthokeratology lenses which
      are made of new material with more elasticity as compared traditional lens material. This
      study is to evaluate the safety of wearing this new orthokeratology lens and the
      effectiveness of clinical performance in young adult.
