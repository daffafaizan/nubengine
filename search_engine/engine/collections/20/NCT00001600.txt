    
      This protocol is designed to screen individuals with either third molars ("wisdom teeth") in
      need of removal, or with chronic orofacial pain as potential research subjects.

      Each individual will be thoroughly evaluated during the screening process, including past
      medical history and an appropriate physical examination. Other routine diagnostic procedures
      and tests may also be completed in order to help determine a subject's eligibility. These
      tests and procedures are of minimal risks and will be described in more detail in section
      III: "Study Procedures".

      Once the screening process is completed and eligibility determined, the subjects will be
      informed of their options to participate in one or more of the current NIDCR research
      studies. If no appropriate protocol is identified, recommendations for other treatment
      options may be given to the individual, their primary doctor, or referring physician/dentist.
