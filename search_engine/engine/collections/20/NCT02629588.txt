      United States each year. About 17% of survivors have a period of "coma". Duration of coma
      contributes significantly to functional outcomes.

      Objective: To appraise the evidence of effectiveness of sensory stimulation to improve
      arousal and alertness for persons in a coma or persistent vegetative state after TBI.

      Data Sources and Study Eligibility Criteria: Databases searched included Medline, PsycINFO,
      CINAHL, OTseeker, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was limited to
      outcomes studies in the hierarchy described by Sackett and colleagues (1996), published in
      English in peer-reviewed journals between 2006 and 2014.
