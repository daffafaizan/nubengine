      pneumoperitoneum and it could cause significant changes in cerebral homeostasis and lead to
      cognitive dysfunction. We compared changes in haemodynamic variables, regional cerebral
      oxygen saturation, and early postoperative cognitive function in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic gastrectomy in the reverse Trendelenburg position with those patients that
      underwent conventional open gastrectomy.
