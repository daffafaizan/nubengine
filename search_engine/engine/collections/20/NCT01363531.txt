      prescribing strategies, compared to direct antibiotic treatment and no antibiotic treatment,
      for the treatment of non-complicated acute respiratory infections, in terms of symptoms
      duration and severity. Moreover, antibiotic consumption, patient satisfaction, efficacy
      perception and number of medical visits will be also assessed for each therapeutic strategy.

      The PDA is a multicentric study, parallel, randomised controlled trial to compare four
      antibiotic prescribing strategies in the non-complicated acute respiratory tract infections.
      The trial will include acute pharyngitis and/or acute tonsillitis, rhinosinusitis, acute
      bronchitis and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (mild to
      moderate) in adults. The expected number of patients to be included in this trial is 600.
      Therapeutic strategies include: direct antibiotic treatment, no antibiotic treatment, and two
      delayed antibiotic prescribing strategies (prescription given to patient with advice to use a
      course of antibiotics if needed in case of worsening of symptoms or not improving, and
      prescription left at the reception of the primary care center 3 days after the first medical
      visit). Follow-up period will be one month. The primary outcome will be symptom duration and
      severity. Other outcomes included will be use of antibiotics, patient satisfaction,
      perception of antibiotic efficacy, complications, and number of medical visits.
