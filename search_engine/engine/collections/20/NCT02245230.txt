      Angiotensin (1-7) are currently in development for the treatment of hypertension based on
      findings from animal studies. There are limited and contradictory clinical studies, however,
      and it is unclear if this peptide even contributes to blood pressure regulation in humans.
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the cardiovascular effects of Angiotensin
      (1-7) in essential hypertension, and to examine interactions of this peptide with the
      autonomic nervous system for blood pressure regulation. The investigators propose that the
      difficulties in showing Angiotensin (1-7) cardiovascular effects in previous clinical studies
      relates to the buffering capacity of the baroreceptor reflex to prevent changes in blood
      pressure. In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that Angiotensin (1-7)
      produces negligible effects with intact baroreceptors, and that the cardiovascular effects of
      this peptide are unmasked following elimination of baroreflex buffering. To test this
      hypothesis, the investigators will examine the effects of acute intravenous Angiotensin (1-7)
      infusion on blood pressure in subjects with essential hypertension under intact conditions
      and following acute autonomic withdrawal with the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan. The
      primary outcome will be the decrease in systolic blood pressure produced by Angiotensin (1-7)
      infusion, with comparisons made between intact and blocked study days. As a secondary
      objective, the investigators will examine for changes in systemic hemodynamics and
      circulating hormones in response to the Angiotensin (1-7) infusion, to determine potential
      mechanisms underlying any changes in blood pressure.
