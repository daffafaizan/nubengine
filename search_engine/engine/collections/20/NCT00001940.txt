    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and toleration of
      voriconazole in the treatment of systemic or invasive fungal infections due to fungal
      pathogens for which there is no licensed therapy or that are unresponsive or intolerant to
      treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents. This trial is an extension of the Phase
      III multicenter, open label study investigating the utilization of voriconazole for the
      treatment of systemic or invasive fungal infections. Enrollment is targeted for 100 patients
      to be recruited from multiple centers. The patient population will consist of patients with
      proven deeply invasive fungal infection for which there is no licensed therapy or if the
      patient is failing or intolerant to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents and
      currently on the voriconazole (99-C-0094) protocol. Voriconazole will be administered
      intravenously at 3-4 mg/kg q 12 hours or orally at 200-300 mg BID. Efficacy will be evaluated
      by clinical, radiological and microbiological response.
