    
      This study will be conducted as a single site parallel-arm, 1:1 randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) through a web-based quantitative survey uploaded in online forums. Participants will be
      randomized to either the intervention group (video information about mammography screening
      followed by a survey about mammography screening) or the control group (video information
      about energy systems followed by the same survey). The survey computer programme will
      randomly assign each respondent to either the intervention arm or the control arm in the
      beginning of the survey.

      The allocation will be concealed from the researchers. The survey computer programme will
      deliver the intervention right after randomization. Participants will be aware of the
      allocation. However, they do not know about the study design. Data analysts will be kept
      blinded to the allocation.

      Choice, knowledge and opinions related to mammography screening will be compared between the
      control group and the intervention group at one timepoint.
