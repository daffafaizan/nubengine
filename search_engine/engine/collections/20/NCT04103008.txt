      patients with isolated severe mitral stenosis (MS) and is determined primarily by the
      hemodynamic variables of MS severity and reduced LV filling. BMV results in rapid recovery of
      LV systolic function in these patients through improvement in LV diastolic loading. These
      findings suggest that LV contractile properties in MS are modulated predominantly by LV
      diastolic filling rather than myocardial structural abnormality.
