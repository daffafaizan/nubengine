      of MZL patients experience a relapse within 10 years. However, Relapsed or refractory MZL
      represent a therapeutic dilemma in every day clinical practice and no prospective studies on
      large series have been published so far. The rarity of these disorders and some difficulties
      in the differential diagnosis from other low-grade lymphoma subtypes are obstacles in
      conducting epidemiological surveys and in properly describing clinical features and outcomes.

      Oxaliplatin, a platinum coordination complex with an oxalato-ligand as the leaving group and
      a 1,2-diaminocyclohexane carrier, possesses higher cytotoxic potency on molar basis than
      cisplatin and carboplatin and was reported to be active in patients with NHL as a single
      agent. In addition, the substitution of cisplatin by oxaliplatin in the DHAP regimen, another
      commonly used one in relapsed or refractory NHL, showed meaningful antitumor activity with
      favourable toxicity profile.

      In the previous phase II study of oxaliplatin for treatment of patients with
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, a total of 16 patients with MALT lymphoma of
      various sites of origin (four of the ocular adnexa, five of the salivary glands, three of the
      stomach, two of the lung, and one of the colon and the breast) were administered oxaliplatin
      at a dose of 130 mg/m2 infused during 2 hours every 3 weeks. Fifteen patients responded to
      chemotherapy, with nine achieving CR (56%), six (37.5%) achieving partial response, and one
      achieving stable disease; the median time to response was 4 months (range; 2 to 4 months).

      Based upon the promising results of oxaliplatin regimen in refractory NHL and first-line
      treatment of MZL, The investigators are willing to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      oxaliplatin and prednisolone (Ox-P) combination in patients with previously treated MZL who
      have a few clinical trial data.
