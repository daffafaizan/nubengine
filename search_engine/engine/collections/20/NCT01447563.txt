      before the commencement of the study and were randomized using ExcelÂ® 2007 to receive the
      test formulation followed by the reference formulation, or viceversa. No food was allowed
      from 10 h before until at least 4 h after drug administration. On the subsequent morning, a
      peripheral venous 21G catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein of the subjects and blood
      samples were collected (zero time). The subjects then received a single 75 mg tablet of
      either the test or the reference formulation, given with 250 mL water. Blood samples were
      collected at 0.16, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0.83, 1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 h
      after drug administration. The blood samples were collected in coded EDTA tubes and plasma
      was obtained by centrifugation (2,053 g for 10 min at 5 C), after which the plasma was
      immediately transferred to prelabeled vials and stored at or below -70 After a week of
      washout, the alternative formulation was administered to the subjects and samples were drawn
      and analyzed as before.
