      GI function after colon resection. 8 A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, phase 3 trial demonstrated that Alvimopan, a peripherally acting mu-opioid
      receptor antagonist, appears to accelerate GI tract recovery by 1 day, and reduces
      postoperative ileus-related morbidity without compromising opioid analgesia. 9 Asao et al
      demonstrated that gum chewing can accelerate recovery of GI function, also by 1 day, after
      abdominal surgery. 10 Epidural anesthesia has been shown to shorten duration of POI, as well
      as improve pain control, decrease pulmonary complications, and quicken recovery times.
      However, it does not appear to reduce overall length of stay. 4 However, Neudecker et al.
      were unable to reproduce the results of previous trials evaluating the effect of thoracic
      epidural analgesia on duration of postoperative ileus following laparoscopic sigmoid
      resection. 11 Given conflicting data, no one single measure has been adopted for the
      prevention POI.

      Recent evidence has shown that coffee may be a stimulant for the GI Tract. A small study of
      16 healthy volunteers demonstrated that coffee appears to increase rectal tone thus implying
      an impact on defecation mechanics.12 Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated
      caffeinated coffee to be a stimulant of motor activity in the colon.13,14 Given its potential
      pro-motility properties in the GI tract, it seems reasonable to postulate that coffee, a
      commonly consumed product by the general public, may play a role in shortening and possibly
      preventing POI. This directly impacts overall patient satisfaction but will reduce length of
      stay and overall hospital costs.
