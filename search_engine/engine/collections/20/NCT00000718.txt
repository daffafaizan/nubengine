      inhibit the growth of HIV. When AZT or ddC is given continuously over a prolonged period of
      time, toxic effects occur that are not found when the drugs are given for 4 - 6 weeks. It is
      hoped that by alternating the drugs or by giving one drug intermittently, the toxic effects
      can be decreased without lowering the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs.

      Patients will be assigned to 1 of 7 treatment groups. Both AZT and ddC will be given by mouth
      every 4 hours. One group will take AZT continuously for 52 weeks. One group will alternate 1
      week of AZT with a week with no drug for 48 weeks and another group will alternate 1 week of
      ddC with a week of no drug for 48 weeks. Other groups will alternate AZT and either low-dose
      or high-dose ddC on a weekly basis or a monthly basis for 48 weeks. Patients will be seen
      weekly for the first 8 weeks of study and less often thereafter. Blood samples will be
      withdrawn frequently and evaluated for possible changes in the immune system, toxic effects,
      and possible changes in the amount of HIV in the blood. Lumbar punctures and skin biopsies
      will also be performed.

      AMENDED: All patients receiving continuous AZT will be switched to a lower dose of AZT if
      they have not already been switched. This is in accordance with results of NIAID ACTG 002,
      016, and 019 which demonstrate that this dose of AZT delays progression of HIV symptoms.
