      tool for radical and safe hepatectomy [1]. New technical improvements of IOUS have been
      reported in recent years both for tumor characterization and staging [2] and for resection
      guidance [3-5]. However, intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) still represents the gold
      standard for studying the biliary tract anatomy as well as for guiding reconstruction in case
      of bile duct resection and, moreover, with the advent of living donation it is the standard
      reference for validating preoperative imaging [6]. Conversely, it could be affirmed that IOUS
      in this sense has no role, if not for guiding intraoperative dilated bile duct drainage [7].
      Nevertheless, IOC has not negligible costs, it implies the use of x-ray, iodated contrast
      agents and is time consuming.

      Herein is proposed a technique for bile duct exploration by means of intraoperative
      cholangio-ultrasound (IOCUS) validated on a consecutive series of patients undergoing liver
      resection.
