      acid, and energy regulatory hormone levels are altered in comparison to plasma levels among
      pregnant and non-pregnant individuals with varying degrees of insulin resistance.
      Furthermore, we seek to understand the effects of pregnancy on central and peripheral energy
      metabolism using metabolomic profiling as well as traditional hormonal measurements in
      maternal blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid as well as cord blood.
