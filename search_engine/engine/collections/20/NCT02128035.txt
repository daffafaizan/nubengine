    
      Patients referred for coronary angiography or PCI will be randomized to undergo their
      procedure with or without the pelvic lead shield and the operator will wear a radiation
      protection cap.

      Clinical efficacy will be assessed based on the total radiation dose that the interventional
      cardiologist got exposed to as well as a secondary outcome measuring the total radiation
      exposure dose per minute.
