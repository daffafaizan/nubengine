    
      Since antidepressants and antipsychotics have common receptorial mechanisms of action (H1
      antagonism, 5HT2 antagonism), the impact of antidepressants in terms of metabolic syndromes
      is a matter of concern.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the differential impact of antidepressants in
      terms of weight gain and metabolic syndromes.

      Prospective 6-month naturalistic cohort study, comparing 4 classes of antidepressants (SSRIs,
      SNRIs, TCAs and others) to a control group (ECT and r-TMS), in 600 patients with a major
      depressive disorder requiring the beginning of either antidepressant or ECT/r-TMS treatment.
