      ideal slim and thin body. So that they follow harmful unhealthy diet to achieve the ideal
      body shape they are seeking. These types of diet can lead to malnutrition, menstrual
      disturbances, and bone loss, and these three components form a triad called female athlete
      triad. A limited number of studies have examined the effect of acupuncture and soy products
      on irregularities related to female athletes so the aim of this study is to investigate the
      effect of both acupuncture in line with diet modification using soy products on osteopenia in
      female athlete triad. Study Design: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, pre-post-test,
      controlled trial.

      Sixty female athletes with ages ranged from 14 to 18 years, playing gymnastics and all
      diagnosed and referred with female athlete triad resulting in decreased bone mineral density
      and osteoporosis. All participants will be treated with soy products and acupuncture and will
      be closely followed for three months. DEXA will be used to assess bone mineral density before
      and after the treatment program.
