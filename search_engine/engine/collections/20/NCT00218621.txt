      impacts fetal neurophysiology independently of maternal physiology. Buprenorphine is a new
      therapy for opiate dependent individuals, and its use during pregnancy is currently being
      evaluated. Some research has shown that buprenorphine lessens the neonatal abstinence
      syndrome when compared to methadone. Thirty methadone and 30 buprenorphine maintained women
      will be evaluated at 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks gestation using a state-of-the-art computerized
      fetal actocardiograph and data analysis program to simultaneously evaluate fetal movement and
      heart rate and maternal physiologic parameters. Investigators will be blinded to treatment
      group. Longitudinal neurodevelopment of the fetuses in each group will be explored. The
      differential effects of methadone and buprenorphine on the neonatal abstinence syndrome will
      also be explored.
