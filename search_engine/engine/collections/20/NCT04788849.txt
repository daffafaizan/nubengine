      selection criteria will be asked, after written informed consent, to self-collect a
      first-void urine (with UriSponge™ 8E031S100 device) and a vaginal sample (with FLOQSwab®
      5E089N device), prior to undergoing colposcopy. Just before colposcopic examination, a
      clinician will also collect a cervical sample using a Cervex-Brush.

      A colposcopy-targeted biopsy or histology following excisional treatment of a cervical
      precancer lesion will be undertaken if appropriate. The colposcopy and/or histological
      findings will be used as the gold standard. In case of normal satisfactory colposcopic
      findings without biopsy taking, colposcopy will provide the study outcome.

      Virological accuracy of HPV testing using: [a] BD Onclarity on FLOQSwab® 5E089N vaginal
      self-samples, [b] BD Onclarity on UriSponge™ 8E031S100 urine specimens, will be compared to
      BD Onclarity testing on a cervical samples collected by a clinician.
