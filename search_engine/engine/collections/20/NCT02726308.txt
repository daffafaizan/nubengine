      blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were connected. All
      patients received standardized anesthetic technique. At the end of surgery, gastric contents
      were suctioned via an orogastric tube before extubation. Atropine and neostigmine (1/2.5 mg)
      was given slowly I.V. to antagonize the residual neuromuscular block. Then, the trachea was
      extubated. Then, patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit in a stable
      condition. Patients were allowed to drink liquids as soon as requested.
