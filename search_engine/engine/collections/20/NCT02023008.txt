      I. To determine the feasibility of implementing a 6-week biweekly yoga intervention delivered
      by multi-point videoconferencing in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data on changes in depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality pre-
      and post-intervention in women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy.

      II. To obtain preliminary data on acute effects of the yoga classes on fatigue and distress.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo 12 sessions of cancer-adapted integral yoga classes using an
      internet-based videoconferencing platform. Integral yoga includes postures, deep relaxation,
      breathing practices and meditation to create a profound experience of peace and well-being.
      Participants take part in study classes from home (or other location that is convenient for
      the participant and that allows them to access the internet-based classes) with two-way
      interaction with group instructors and members alike over 75 minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks
      during radiation therapy. Participants are encouraged to complete additional yoga practice
      sessions outside of the twice weekly study sessions.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 week.
