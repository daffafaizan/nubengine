    
      Primary Objective: To determine whether the combination of dasatinib with melphalan and
      prednisone provides therapeutic benefits and is safe in patients with relapsed/refractory
      Multiple Myeloma.

      Study design, dose and mode of administration, and duration of treatment: Multicenter,
      open-label, single arm, two-stage, Phase II study of dasatinib in combination with melphalan
      and prednisone (D-MP) in advanced, refractory MM patients. The three drugs will be
      concurrently administered through 6 cycles; each cycle will be 28 days long (1 cycle = 4
      weeks), for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment schedule will be the following:

        -  Melphalan 0,18 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles;

        -  Prednisone 1,5 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles;

        -  Dasatinib 100 mg QD continuously (from day 1 to day 28). After the 6 cycles of D-MP
           treatment, Dasatinib will be continuously administered alone as maintenance, until
           occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal.

      This is a two-stage Phase II trial according to Simon with a bivariate endpoint design, by
      which treatment efficacy and safety are jointly evaluated. This design allows the trial to be
      early stopped after the first stage if the number of observed partial responses (PR) is
      inadequate and the number of observed toxicities is too high. In the first stage of the
      protocol 17 patients are required.
