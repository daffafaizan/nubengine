      anti-cancer agents through the development of drug resistance. Therefore, alternative
      approaches to the direct targeting of cancer cells are urgently needed. Bavituximab is the
      generic name for a chimeric (human/murine) monoclonal antibody directed against
      aminophospholipids. Bavituximab is Peregrine's first investigational product under its
      anti-phospholipid therapy technology platform. Anti-phospholipid therapy is a novel approach
      to treating cancer. It is based on the finding that aminophospholipids, which are basic
      components of the inner surface of cells become externally exposed in response to certain
      disease states such as cancer. Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that
      bavituximab specifically targets cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in a variety of
      experimental cancer models. This study will examine the safety and tolerability of
      bavituximab when administered to patients with advanced solid tumor cancers that are
      unresponsive to current therapies. Cohorts of 6 patients each will be treated at the starting
      dose of 0.1 mg bavituximab per kilogram body weight (0.1 mg/kg). Successive patient cohorts
      will receive 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg of bavituximab. Patients will be followed for a total of
      56 days. Patients who demonstrate an objective tumor response will be offered further
      bavituximab treatment on an extension protocol.
