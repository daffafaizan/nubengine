      recovery, as well as a better management in daily activities compared with immobilization
      with splint. In addition, follow-up of these fractures is difficult due to poor compliance,
      since patient profile is young people who give little relevance to their pathology in the
      hand.

      The purpose of our study is to carry out a randomized clinical trial of good methodological
      quality to assess whether immobilization with syndactyly for 3 weeks does not imply loss of
      functionality or residual symptoms, avoiding rigidity, postinflammation arthritis or loss of
      grip strength, demonstrating that early mobilization of fractures of the fifth metacarpal
      provides clinically satisfactory results compared to prolonged immobilization provided that
      the volar fracture angle does not exceed 70 Â° nor does it produce digital movement
      disruption.
