      screening several miRNAs by microarray which can evaluate the prognosis of sepsis . We will
      collect serum samples from patients with sepsis in SICU, RICU and EICU of 301 Hospital since
      September 2009 , and then use the chip and qRT-PCR to Screen miRNAs which can evaluate the
      prognosis of sepsis, and statistical analysis the miRNAS expression correlation with SOFA
      score.
