    
      Randomized, two treatment groups

      Number of Subjects : 54 subjects (n=27 per group)

      Group 1 : gait rehabilitation with hip assist robot / 10 sessions (5sessions - treadmill gait
      training / 5sessions - overground gait training), 30min per session

      Group 2 : gait rehabilitation without hip assist robot / 10 sessions (5sessions - treadmill
      gait training / 5sessions - overground gait training), 30min per session

      Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal
      parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA,
      USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc.,
      Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary
      metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and foot pressure distribution measured by F-Scan
      Mobile system (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA).

      Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function
      improvement evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti performance oriented mobility
      assessment (POMA), Korean version Modified Bathel index (K-MBI), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS),
      Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), Fugl-Meyer assessment for lower extremity (FMA),
      Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES), Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion
      (ROM).
