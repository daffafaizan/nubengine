      disease. Despite documented clinical benefit, many patients on aspirin still experience
      severe cardiovascular events. Several laboratory reports have shown lack of platelet
      inhibition in 5-40% of aspirin-treated patients, and the term aspirin resistance has been
      introduced. The clinical relevance of these laboratory findings is, however, still unknown.
      New antiplatelet drugs have been developed, and the adenosin diphosphate (ADP) receptor
      inhibitor clopidogrel has at least the same efficacy as aspirin with an acceptable safety
      profile. Laboratory methods for determination of platelet reactivity and treatment efficacy
      have been complicated and time consuming. New methodologies, like the PFA-100Â® system, have
      made such analyses more suitable for clinical use.

      Design: In the ASCET study, 1000 patients with documented coronary heart disease will be
      randomized to either continued treatment with aspirin 160 mg/d or change to clopidogrel
      75mg/d after initial determination of their platelet reactivity while on aspirin treatment.
      Clinical endpoints will be recorded for at least 2 years and related to the initial aspirin
      response.
