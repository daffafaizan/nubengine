      functionality and user acceptability. Biological functionality is the integrated result of
      safe and effective anti-HIV compounds incorporated into dosage forms or devices that
      successfully deliver those compounds to target tissues, fluids, and pathogens. Acceptability
      is a multi-factorial phenomenon that accounts for the personal, dyadic, product-related, and
      social contexts that potentiate - or not - a woman's decision to use a microbicide.
      Acceptability (assessed, in part, by the users' sensory perceptions of products during use)
      depends strongly upon dosage forms and/or delivery systems with biophysical functions and/or
      mechanical and materials properties that are most conducive to human use. Without both,
      microbicides' potential to decisively alter the public health impact of HIV/AIDS and other
      sexually transmitted infections will be largely limited. The current protocol will
      specifically study the impact of gel volume on user perceptions, as well as extend user
      perception scale development to include those properties and product "behaviors" experienced
      when using a vaginal film.
