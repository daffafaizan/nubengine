      termed necroptosis.

      In this project, the investigators aim to investigate the mechanisms and the effects
      ofneutrophil necroptosis and apoptosis: 1. to investigate the cells and the molecular
      mechanisms that induce neutrophil necroptosis or delay apoptosis, mainly focusing on the
      roles of HMGB-1,TNF-Î± and LPS, 2. to illustrate the effects of some molecules such as TLR,
      TNFR, RIP1/RIP3, Caspase8, ATP and ROS in the process of sigal transduction and membrane
      damage during necroptosis or apoptosis , 3. to identify the similarities and differences
      between traditional necrosis and necroptosis in the aspects of morphologigical changes and
      inflammatory cytokine release, 4. to find out the effects and mechanisms of neutrophil
      necroptosis or apoptosis in a rheumatoid arthritis mouse model and the therapeutic effect of
      blocking one or several pathways in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.

      This study will not only unravel the mechanisms of neutrophil necroptosis and apoptosis,
      elucidate its roles and significances in inflammation and infection, but also shed new light
      on anti-inflammatory and anti-infection therapy.
