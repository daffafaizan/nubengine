      have higher risk of cardiovascular mortality during the night.

      Respiratory alterations (hypoxia, hypoxia- reoxygenation) that these patients suffer during
      the sleep may induce modifications in platelet function, clotting-fibrinolysis factors and
      endothelial function, that may accelerate cardiovascular events during the night

      DESIGN: Prospective and controlled study

      METHODS: 20 SAHS patients and 20 controls will be studied. The study includes:

      a) medical history; b) anthropometric variables (weight, height, body mass index, waist-hip
      ratio); c) sleepiness tested by Epworth scale; d) conventional polysomnography (PSG); e)
      testing every 4 hours for a 24 hours period: clotting-fibrinolysis factors (factor V, VII,
      VIII; C and S protein, plasminogen tissular activator (t-PA) and inhibitor of plasminogen
      activator (PAI-1); platelet activation markers (CD62, CD63 and GPIIb/IIIa) and endothelial
      dysfunction markers (endothelins, nitrites/nitrates and asymmetrical dimethyl-arginine); f)
      basic biochemical profile and hemogram. Patients will be revaluated after 6 months of CPAP
      treatment.
