      conditions to optimize care, improve quality of life and increase life span. Children with NM
      conditions are followed in regional multidisciplinary clinics in Ontario and across Canada.
      At each visit they can be seen by 8 health care providers each focusing on and making
      recommendations for the different aspects of their care. Currently, there are no evidenced
      based interventions for children with NM conditions evaluating the ability of children to set
      and attain their care goals and/or other personally meaningful goals.

      Self-determination is defined as the ability to "use skills, knowledge and beliefs that
      enable a person to engage in goal directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior." The
      development of self-determination is a process that begins in childhood. Solution Focused
      Coaching (SFC) is a strengths- based, client-centered approach to service delivery that
      supports clients to build on their existing capacity to move closer to meaningful goals. This
      study will evaluate the impact of SFC on goal setting, achievement and self determination in
      children with NM conditions.
