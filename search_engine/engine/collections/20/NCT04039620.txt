    
      Background: Sarcopenia is a nutrition-related disease leading to physical impairment and
      adverse clinical outcomes. Data regarding its characteristics in hospitalized patients are
      limited.

      Aim: This study will assess in older patients admitted to acute medical wards, the
      prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for development of sarcopenia, or alteration in its
      severity, and evaluate associated clinical adverse outcomes.

      Methods: This collaboratively-designed, longitudinal prospective observational study will be
      carried out in patients aged >70 admitted to acute geriatric units in 9 European centers. The
      new sarcopenia diagnostic criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia 2 (EWGSOP2)
      will be tested at admission and discharge, using isometric handgrip dynamometry, gait speed,
      and, pragmatically, calf circumference. There will be 3- and 12-month telephone follow-up
      (including the SARC-F questionnaire).

      Discussion: Our study will be the first collaboration to assess the prevalence and incidence
      of sarcopenia (EWGSOP2) and its risk factors in hospitalized patients across Europe.
