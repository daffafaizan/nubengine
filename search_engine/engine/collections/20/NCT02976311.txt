      However, there is not a unique cesarean surgery technique. Pfannenstiel , reported his own
      technique in 1897. Because of the applicability of the technique, it went down well among
      obstetricians. After three decades, Kerr evolved this technique, and Pfannenstiel-Kerr
      technique became the method of choice until late 70's. In 1972, Stark et al defined the
      Misgav Ladach technique and in the following years this technique became popular among
      obstetricians. In late 80's Misgav Ladach technique was modified and started to be more
      popular. But, still Pfannenstiel-Kerr technique continued to be used frequently and studies
      comparing clinical outcomes of these two techniques were conducted for several times.
      However, the inflammatory responses which occured subsequent to application of these
      techniques were not investigated. This is the first study investigating the inflammatory
      response emerged after different cesarean surgery techniques.
