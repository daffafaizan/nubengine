      pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of these complaints. None are new nor
      experimental. Very little research has been done in the ED setting to determine which of
      these agents is most effective with the least adverse effects. Our own previous research
      found that droperidol but not prochlorperazine and metoclopramide is more effective than
      placebo. Because of the recent FDA black box warning added to droperidol, the use of this
      agent has suddenly ceased in many EDs. Promethazine remains a very commonly used antiemetic
      in many EDs but one recent study found it less effective than prochlorperazine which was in
      turn found no more effective than placebo in our own study. As a result many physicians have
      turned to ondansetron, a newer and more expensive agent. Experience among anesthesiologists
      and oncologists has shown ondansetron to be highly effective with a minimum of adverse
      effects. These patient populations, however, are very different from those found in the ED.
      It is our hypothesis that promethazine and ondansetron are equally effective for the ED
      treatment of unselected patients with nausea and vomiting with similar rates of adverse
      effects.
