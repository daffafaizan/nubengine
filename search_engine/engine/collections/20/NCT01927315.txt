      development of diabetic retinopathy are incompletely understood and include alterations in
      bone marrow derived vasculogenic cells called "endothelial progenitor cells".

      Fenofibrate is a PPAR-alpha agonist used for the treatment of mixed dislipidemia and
      hypertriglyceridemia. In addition to lowering triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, PPAR-alpha
      agonism with fenofibrate has several additional molecular benefit on the vessel wall, such as
      reduction of inflammation. In a trial conducted in type 2 diabetic patients, the drug
      fenofibrate has reduced retinopathy-related endpoints suggesting a direct effect of the drug
      on the mechanisms that drive the development of this complication.

      Preliminary data of ours on the effects of fenofibrate on cultured EPC show that this drug
      has the potential to improve EPC and, consequently, may benefit patients with retinopathy.

      Herein, the investigators hypothesize that fenofibrate treatment can increase circulating EPC
      levels in diabetic patients with retinopathy, compared to placebo.
