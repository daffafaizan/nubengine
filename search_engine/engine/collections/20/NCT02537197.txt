      disordered gambling. It will also examine the changes of neurological functioning to tasks
      associated with addiction. Converging evidence suggests that disordered gambling shares
      similarities with substance dependence and disordered alcohol use. Naltrexone is a medication
      that is used to reduce the cravings and euphoria from opioids and alcohol use and some
      studies have shown that it also has efficacy as a treatment for problematic gambling. Pilot
      data suggest the prefrontal cortex is activated for a healthy subject during a
      delay-discounting task, possibly indicating some consideration of the delayed value of a
      hypothetical money amount. If discounting rates can be correlated with treatment outcomes and
      neurological activation, these tasks may provide a new predictive tool for treatment outcome.
      However, no previous study has examined the neurological changes from pharmacological
      treatments of gambling. This study will provide data on the differences between pre- and
      post-treatment of regular naltrexone dosing for disordered gamblers
