      evaluate the effect of oral metformin in preventing GC-induced alterations of systemic
      metabolism, and in particular GC-induced diabetes. Other clinical objectives of the study
      consist in investigating the impact of metformin on precocious mortality, deterioration of
      ECOG PS and local (brain) disease control rate at one month. As an exploratory analysis, the
      effect of dexamethasone plus/minus metformin on other metabolites or growth factors
      (including amino acids, fatty acids, ketone bodies, IGF-1), as well as on the number,
      activation status and metabolism of peripheral blood immune cell populations will be
      evaluated
