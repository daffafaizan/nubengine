    
      The present trial is a prospective multicentric GIMEMA study, in which adult ALL patients are
      extensively analyzed at diagnosis by a multiparametric approach including CC and molecular
      analysis for the following gene rearrangements: BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, MLL,
      p15 and p16 deletion in order to give place to a carefully characterization of the genetic
      lesions occurring in adult ALL and to evaluate their prognostic significance in a large
      cohort of patients homogeneously treated.

      This study requires a central handling and analysis of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood
      samples at presentation.
