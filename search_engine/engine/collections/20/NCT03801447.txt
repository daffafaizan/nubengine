      only clinical signs & symptoms and standard biological tests are available for patient
      individualized care. Hence, a new diagnostic tool to distinguish and stratify the different
      patients referred is in need of proper triage.

      (sFlt-1/PlGF ratio) in clinical decision making in preeclamptic women.
