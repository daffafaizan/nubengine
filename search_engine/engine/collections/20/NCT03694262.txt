      relationships between antiangiogenic and immunotherapy and antiangiogenic and PARPi.
      Increasing genetic instability by PARPi and double-strand breaks may lead to a
      proinflammatory state that would enhance the activity of immunotherapy, leading to
      synergistic response in a category of solid tumors that lack active therapy. It is expected
      that increased double-strand breaks may lead to increased expression of immunogenic antigens,
      increasing the effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy. Phase I data combining the PD-L1 inhibitor
      durvalamab with either olaparib or cediranib showed good tolerability and evidence of
      response.
