    
      A randomized pilot study will be conducted, the goal of which is to determine which format
      represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with 18-25 year olds.
      Specifically, participants will be randomized to one of three arms; all arms will receive a
      12-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including identical dietary, physical activity,
      and weight loss prescriptions. Behavioral goals / prescriptions will be the same, and basic
      content delivered will also be the same; only the format by which the intervention is
      delivered will differ among the treatment arms. A total of 45-55 participants, 18-25 years of
      age, with a BMI between 25 and 45 kg/m2 will be randomized to one of three groups: 1)
      Face-to-face brief behavioral weight loss (FBWL), 2) Web-based brief behavioral weight loss
      (WBWL), or 3) Web-based brief behavioral weight loss PLUS optional group sessions (WBWL
      Plus). Assessments will take place at 0 (baseline), 3 (post-treatment), and 6 months
      (follow-up).
