      improvements in their motor symptoms, as measured by the UPDRS, no significant changes were
      found on any of the neuropsychological measures after six months of treatment with
      rasagiline. Further, the participant group who received placebo also did not show significant
      change on any of the neuropsychological measures over the six month course of our study.
      Finally, the cognitive performance of our treatment and placebo groups did not differ
      significantly from one another at baseline or after six months of study participation.
