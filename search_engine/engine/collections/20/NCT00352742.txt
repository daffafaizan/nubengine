      but rarely curable. Angiogenesis, defined as the growth of new blood vessels from
      pre-existing vessels, is a requirement for the growth of nearly all tumors. An increase in
      bone marrow angiogenesis is present in Multiple Myeloma and correlates with disease
      progression. Several new therapies that target angiogenic pathways have shown clinical
      efficacy. ATN-224 is a small molecule that has been shown in pre-clinical studies to be
      antiangiogenic.

      Using one agent to overcome resistance of another agent is a treatment regimen used in
      oncology. A preclinical study with the combination of ATN-224 and bortezomib shows that the
      combination is more effective than either single agent in a bortezomib resistant cell line.
