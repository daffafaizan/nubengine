      and BCG revaccination. The study will be conducted in previously BCG vaccinated healthy
      adolescents, and will entail a thorough immunogenicity evaluation of these regimens
      incorporating unbiased systems vaccinology approaches and novel assessments of baseline and
      elicited responses that may impact vaccine responses. A major goal for this study is to
      generate immunological data on a wide range of immune responses using a variety of approaches
      including validated assessments, unbiased strategies, and novel exploratory assays to
      increase the likelihood of detecting responses correlating with risk or protection in the
      prevention of infection study. Investigators contributing to the proposed study have
      participated in a correlates analysis for an HIV vaccine exhibiting modest efficacy in which
      2 correlates of risk were identified.

      An additional aim of this study is to explore factors affecting vaccine induced responses
      that may also impact efficacy. For example, it is hypothesized that exposure to environmental
      mycobacteria may alter protection provided by BCG vaccination. Reagents for evaluating levels
      of exposure to environmental mycobacteria are in development as part of a concurrent
      collaborative study. An exploratory objective for this trial is to apply these reagents to
      examine whether such exposures influence immune responses elicited by the study vaccine and
      regimens.
