      treatment on word retrieval in persons with aphasia. The planned investigations are designed
      to further the development of semantic feature training so that it may serve as not only a
      mechanism for improving disrupted lexical semantic processing, but also as a compensatory
      strategy during word retrieval failures. The proposed research will also address the issue of
      exemplar typicality (Kiran & Thompson, 2003) by examining the effects of training typical
      versus atypical exemplars of various categories with individuals with different types of
      aphasia. A series of 24 single subject experimental designs will be conducted in the context
      of a group design to address the following experimental questions:

        -  Will training atypical examples of living and artifact noun categories using semantic
           feature training result in a significantly different outcome* than training typical
           examples of living and artifact noun categories?

        -  Will training of one category of nouns using semantic feature training result in
           improved retrieval of untrained categories of nouns?

        -  Will effects of semantic feature training vary across aphasia types?

        -  Will semantic feature training result in increased production of content during
           discourse?

        -  Will generalization to untrained typical examples vary across generalization lists that
           are repeatedly exposed and those that are limited in exposure? (i.e., Does repeated
           exposure appear to contribute to generalization?)

             -  Outcome measure will reflect acquisition, response generalization within category,
                and response generalization across category effects of treatment.
