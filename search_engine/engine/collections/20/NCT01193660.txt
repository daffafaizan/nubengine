      or injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood onset disability through
      one's life. Umbilical cord blood(UCB) is suggested as therapeutic method for cerebral palsy
      which resulted from animal studies. Stem cells included in UCB is expected to exert
      therapeutic efficacy for functional recovery.

      It is also suggested that erythropoietin is useful to repair neurological injury in brain.
      The main mechanism of erythropoietin is supposed to be neuroprotection and neurogenesis which
      would reinforce the effect of stem cell as well.

      Although autologous umbilical cord would be safe, the children who have problems at birth
      seldom have autologous umbilical cord blood. Allogenic umbilical cord blood might be useful
      for these children if its effect is approved.
