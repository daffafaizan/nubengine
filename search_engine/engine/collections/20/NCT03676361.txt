      Uni-nephrectomy from donation results in decreased number of glomeruli and research has shown
      that there is glomerular hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertrophy. Uni-nephrectomy also
      results in a decreased number of tubules, but there is not much data about possible tubular
      injury post donation and its long term effects on donors.

      Our overall hypothesis is that post uni-nephrectomy tubular function, measured by maximum
      urine concentration capacity, will be decreased and may be a more sensitive marker of kidney
      damage than standard tests, such as urine albumin, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR), or measured urine creatinine clearance (CrCl). The goal of this study
      is to evaluate the effect of uni-nephrectomy on renal tubular function and its potential in
      being an early and more sensitive marker in kidney injury when compared to standard tests.
