      Considering the possibility of adverse effects of antidepressants and previous meta-analyses
      showing the positive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation
      in reducing depressive symptoms, omega-3 PUFAs may provide a safe strategy. The investigators
      evaluate efficacy and safety of omega-3 PUFAs for pregnant women with depressive symptoms.
      (Participants who skipped taking supplements for more than 7 days will be excluded from a per
      protocol analysis.)
