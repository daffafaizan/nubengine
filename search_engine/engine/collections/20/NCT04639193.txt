      regimen, subjects will take the study drugs at home; on day 3 of each drug regimen subjects
      will take the study drugs as part of an overnight inlab sleep study (including assessments of
      sleepiness/alertness, sleep quality and blood pressure). Initially subjects will take
      dual-therapy (acetazolamide+eszopiclone) vs placebo in random order; if sleep apnea resolved
      with dual-therapy, then subjects will undergo an open-label single-drug regimen
      (acetazolamide), else an open-label triple-drug regimen (acetazolamide + eszopiclone +
      venlafaxine).
