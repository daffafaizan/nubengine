      general population. Recent evidence in the literature and collected in our laboratory confirm
      that constipation can be a consequence of intestinal dysbiosis, which may affect the motility
      and metabolic environment of colon.

      Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is temporarily effective for patients with slow
      transit constipation. However, the transplanted microflora cannot maintain for a long time.
      Along with the gut microbiota returning to the original state, the symptoms relapse.

      Pectin is a kind of soluble dietary fiber, producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) after a
      series of fermentation by gut flora to supply the energy for epithelial cells, regulate
      intestinal PH, promote intestinal motility and join effort in immune regulation with
      intestinal lymphoid tissue. Therefore, we conceive that pectin could promote the colonization
      of probiotics and reduce adhesion of pathogens.
