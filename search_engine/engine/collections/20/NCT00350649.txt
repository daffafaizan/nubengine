      CBT and CM, respectively. To maximize the effectiveness of CBT, the investigators will
      evaluate the benefit of adding CM, with reinforcement for session attendance and homework
      completion, to standard individual CBT for outpatient marijuana abusers, in order to expose
      participants to more skill training and opportunities for practice of skills. To maximize the
      effectiveness and durability of CM, we will evaluate the benefit of integrating it with
      skills training, specifically designed to reduce drop off effects, in order to extend CM's
      benefits beyond the active treatment period. We propose to conduct a Stage II trial which
      will: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of four conditions for 160 marijuana dependent outpatients:
      (a) Standard CBT, (b) CBT with CM reinforcement for attendance and completing homework
      (CBT+CM/adherence), (c) CM for abstinence alone (CM/abstinence), (d) CM for abstinence
      integrated with CBT (CM/abstinence+CBT), and (2) Evaluate the longer-term durability and / or
      delayed emergence of treatment effects after termination of the study treatments through a
      one-year follow-up. Secondary aims will be to conduct (a) detailed process studies to
      evaluate whether the proposed enhancements affect proximal and distal outcomes as
      hypothesized and (b) economic analyses. Study treatments will last 12 weeks.
