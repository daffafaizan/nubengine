      epilepsy, much remains to be done when it comes to improving their psychosocial well-being.
      Many individuals with epilepsy have difficulty adhering to treatment, documenting their
      seizure types, coping with memory difficulties, dealing with stress, and suffer from
      depression. These factors limit the quality of life of epilepsy patients and prevent them
      from realizing their full potential.

      Patients will enroll in one of four interventions that help improve medication adherence,
      increase seizure awareness and documentation, improve memory and deal with stress and
      depression. Patient assessments will be conducted before and after intervention to gauge the
      efficacy of the programs.

      The specific aims of this study are to assess the feasibility and patient acceptability of
      incorporating multidimensional self-management and psychosocial interventions into routine
      epileptic care, as well as, determine whether these incorporations improve self-management,
      quality-of-life, and other measures of well-being.
