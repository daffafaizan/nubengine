      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose of R115777 (tipifarnib) in combination with
      OSI-774 (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      II. To describe the toxicity profile of this combination. III. To evaluate the effect of
      OSI-774 on the disposition of R115777. IV. To evaluate in vitro markers of farnesyl
      transferase (FT) inhibition and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 (days 8-28
      of course 1 as of 11/4/2013) and tipifarnib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (Closed to
      accrual as of 2/2/06)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.
