      advantages such as improved success rate, faster onset time, fewer needle passes, shorter
      performance time, and reduced procedural pain and vascular puncture. However, there is no
      information about postoperative analgesia.

      Therefore, the investigators tested whether nerve stimulator (NS) - guided interscalene block
      was inferior to ultrasound-guided block in terms of duration of postoperative analgesia for
      shoulder surgery.
