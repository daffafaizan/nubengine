      was generated based on our previous clinical studies. This study was conducted to collect
      more data to advance the algorithm.

      Patients with thyroid dysfunction including hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis were eligible
      for this study. During the study period, each subject wears a smart band (Fitbit Inspire 2
      TM) and gets 3 times of thyroid function tests with 1-month interval. Study participants will
      use a mobile app (Glandy TM) to collect the symptom scores.
