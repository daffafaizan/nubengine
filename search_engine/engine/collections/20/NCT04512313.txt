      patients will require surgery and anesthesia within the next decades. Elderly patients are at
      higher risk of major morbidity and mortality and are characterized by a reduction in cardiac
      output, liver function and renal function. These physiological changes influence
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs administered during anesthesia.

      Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug with an onset time of
      approximately 70 s and a clinical duration of action of approximately 50 min. according to
      previous studies. During anesthesia rocuronium is administered to facilitate intubating
      conditions and reduce the trauma to the larynx and vocal cords. Rocuronium is primarily
      metabolized in the liver (70 % unmetabolized via the bile) and excreted via the kidneys.

      Onset time and duration of action of rocuronium should be assessed by objective neuromuscular
      monitoring. Also, this reduces the risk of residual neuromuscular block which is defined as a
      train of four (TOF) ratio less than 0.9. Especially elderly patients have a high incidence of
      residual neuromuscular block.

      The collected data regarding the effect of rocuronium in elderly patients may change the
      treatment so these patients receive the correct dose for optimal intubating conditions. Also,
      detection of duration of action of different doses of rocuronium may reduce the risk of
      residual block and postoperative respiratory complications

      The aim of this study is to determine the onset time, duration of action and effect on
      intubating conditions after rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg in patients with age â‰¥ 80
      years.
