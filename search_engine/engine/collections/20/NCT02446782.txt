    
      This is a prospective randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
      cefazolin 2g IV for the prophylaxis of surgical site and pleural space infections during
      medical thoracoscopy.

      Consecutive patients who are planned to undergo a medical thoracoscopy (rigid or semirigid)
      will be enrolled in the study if they satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria. One
      hundred patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either of the following: (a) A
      single dose of intravenous cefazolin 2 gms dissolved in 100 mL of normal saline administered
      over 10 minutes, between 15 and 30 minutes before the incision, OR (b) 100 mL normal saline
      administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes between 15 and 30 minutes before the
      incision. Thoracoscopy will be performed in the bronchoscopy suite on a spontaneously
      breathing subject (fasting for 8 h) under conscious sedation (using midazolam, pentazocine,
      and tramadol) observing complete aseptic precautions.
