      that caregivers need to know about the properties of early crying in normally developing
      infants that are uniformly frustrating to caregivers. The study will be implemented and
      evaluated in 1000 new mothers, by public health nurses during newborn home care visits in the
      Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health Authorities. There are two treatment arms in the study.
      The first half of all subjects (n=500) will receive the PURPLE intervention materials (a
      video and a pamphlet) about infant crying. The second arm will receive comparable materials
      on infant safety and SIDS.

      Specific goals of the research program are:

        1. To change the understanding (i.e knowledge and attitudes) and reduce the frustration of
           parents of new infants about the normality of the frustrating properties of crying;

        2. To change the behaviour of parents to increase care giving contact in response to crying
           but to 'walk away' if frustrated or angry;

        3. To provide parents with the ability to educate other caregivers (relatives, baby
           sitters) to reduce frustration induced by inconsolable crying and obtain help if needed;

        4. To provide parents with the knowledge to protect their infants from occasional
           caregivers who could harm their infants because of the frustrating nature of early
           crying;

        5. To provide effective knowledge, skills and teaching materials to regional health care
           providers in direct contact with parents concerning crying, shaking and abuse.
