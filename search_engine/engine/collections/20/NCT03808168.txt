      detectable and quantifiable, which presents many opportunities for evaluation or early
      treatment, intervention and eventually, for cancer prevention. High-grade dysplasia is
      typically detected during cervical cancer screening with a pap smear. To determine the
      pathologic response rate of high grade cervical dysplasia with PD-1 checkpoint modulation
      with Nivolumab.This is a randomized phase II trial with two experimental arms (1 dose of
      nivolumab and 3 doses of nivolumab).
