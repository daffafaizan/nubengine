      plasma concentration of DOAC in patients with suspected or known intake of DOAC plays a vital
      role in making decisions in relation to the administration of i.v thrombolysis therapy-
      ''Time is brain'' or to consider the administration of an antidote in acute hemorrhagic
      stroke patients. Moreover, acute stroke patients presenting with aphasia are not in the
      position to provide information on how regular and when last the anticoagulant was taken.

      Although dabigatran for example has lab tests such as the diluted thrombin time (dTT) and the
      ecarin clotting time (ECT) available, major challenges faced are due to the scarcity of these
      tests in many hospitals. Also, just like many other lab tests, results could take up to 30-60
      minutes (turn-around time due to transport and sample processing) making it inconvenient in
      critical situations.

      In our previous studies, we have been able to show a concentration-dependent effect of
      Dabigatran on Hemochron® Signature POCT (Werfen, Barcelona, Spain) with all 4 test cards used
      (PT, aPTT, ACT-LR und ACT+). Dabigatran however failed to show a concentration-dependent
      effect when tested with the CoaguChek®XS Pro POCT device (Roche, Switzerland) together with
      the then available prothrombin time (PT) test card. This finding could be attributed to the
      known low response of dabigatran plasma levels on PT but rather a better response of
      dabigatran plasma levels on aPTT.

      Our study therefore aims to test CoaguChek® Pro II POCT device which is widely available in
      Europe with the new aPTT test card on all 4 DOAC in order to assess a possible correlation
      between the aPTT values and the DOAC plasma concentration detected by mass spectrometry, and
      to evaluate its ability to rule out even very low but clinically relevant DOAC concentrations
      (e.g., above the currently recommended 30 and 50 ng/mL treatment thresholds). In order to
      avoid POCT results indicating no relevant DOAC concentrations despite DOAC concentrations
      being actually elevated, our specificity target is predefined as >95% for detection of
      elevated DOAC concentrations.
