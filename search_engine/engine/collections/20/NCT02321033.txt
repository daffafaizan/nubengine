    
      The duration of the study is 7 weeks: two x 2 weeks intervention (phase A and phase B) with 3
      weeks washout phase inbetween. Each 2-week intervention phase consists of an active week
      followed by an inactive week.

      in phase A subjects consume high GI (maltodextrin and sucrose) soft drinks during the
      inactive week. In phase B subjects consume a low GI soft drink (palatinose) during the
      inactive week.

      subjects were randomly assigned to either start with phase A or with phase B (cross over
      design).

      During the whole study duration all food is provided (55% CHO, 30% fat, 15% protein)

      Physical activity will be assessed by a step counter (active phase 7000-10000 steps/d and
      inactive phase 3000-4000 steps/d).
