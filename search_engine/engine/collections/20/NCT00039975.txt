      incidence and prevalence may increase over time as the infected population ages. Standard
      pharmacologic interventions for these illnesses often include calcium channel blockers
      (CCBs). Many of the calcium channel blockers are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP
      3A4), which is inhibited by some protease inhibitors (PIs). Thus, there is potential for
      clinically significant interactions between CCBs and PIs. The presence of significant
      drug-drug interactions may influence the dosing, monitoring, and choosing of CCBs and/or PIs
      when used in persons with HIV infection. Because of the potential concomitant use of CCBs
      with the PI combination IDV/RTV, this study will evaluate bi-directional drug-drug
      interactions between 2 commonly used CCBs and IDV/RTV. This information should assist
      clinicians in choosing the appropriate CCBs to treat hypertension or cardiovascular disease
      in persons taking PIs.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of the following 2 arms:

      Arm A: diltiazem CD interaction with IDV and RTV. Arm B: amlodipine interaction with IDV and
      RTV. From Days 1 to 7, patients take diltiazem CD (Arm A) or amlodipine (Arm B). Plasma is
      collected for PK over a 24-hour period beginning on Day 7. From Days 8 to 19, patients stop
      taking their assigned CCB and take IDV and RTV. Plasma is collected for PK over a 12-hour
      period on Day 19. From Days 20 to 26, patients continue to take IDV and RTV and add diltiazem
      CD (Arm A) or amlodipine (Arm B). Patients stop all 3 drugs after the last dose on Day 26.
      Plasma is collected for PK for a 24-hour period beginning on Day 26. Blood work, liver and
      kidney function tests, urinalysis, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) are performed at some
      visits.
