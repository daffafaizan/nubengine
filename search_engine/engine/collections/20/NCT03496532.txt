      sets of stimulation parameters will be compared. The efficacy of every set will be measured
      on induced changes in LFP recorded from the STN electrodes. LFP will be compared between
      before, during and right after each stimulation conditions. The stimulation order will be
      randomized. All other stimulation parameters will be the same (macrocontact with most
      beta-oscillations, 1 minute, 1.5mA) .

      Study III: Patients who participate undergo their first pulse generator implantation,
      performed under general anesthesia because of wire tunnelisation. The depth of anesthesia
      will be documented, recording the BIS spectral analysis index. The difference in spectral
      amplitude density of LFP, in particular in beta band oscillations will be correlated with the
      depth of anesthesia as measured with the BIS index at the time of 2 minutes recordings.
