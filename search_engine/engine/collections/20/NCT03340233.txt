      "free-breathing" versus "breath-holding" measurements. Twenty-five normal volunteers will
      undergo MRI to refine "free-breathing" cardiac imaging and enable construction of
      patient-specific computer models of the heart. The second aim of the project is to validate
      and test the myocardial stiffness evaluation framework derived through the first objective in
      human subjects. Twenty-five normal volunteers will undergo MRI and the data from these images
      will be compared to specially constructed 3D printed models of the heart, enabling refinement
      of the EMS framework to separate structural stiffness from material stiffness. The third aim
      of the project is to measure changes in myocardial stiffness in patients with HFpEF.
      Thirty-three subjects with current diagnostic criteria for HFpEF will be evaluated at
      baseline and at six months to evaluate myocardial stiffness and cardiac MRI biomarkers.
      Specifically, this aim will establish the diagnostic sensitivity of the EMS framework with
      comparison to cardiac MRI biomarkers of increased stiffness, thereby providing mechanistic
      insight to one critical underlying cause of HFpEF.
