      high risk recurrence factors after radical surgery will be enrolled. Adjuvant treatment of
      Donafenib combined with anti-PD-1 antibody will be given for 6 months. The primary endpoint
      is the cumulative percentage of patients without recurrence in the first year. The
      recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), tumor recurrence time (TTR), ECOG
      physical condition (ECOG PS) score, the changes of FACT-Hep based quality of life score,
      changes of AFP, and adverse events will be recorded and analyzed, to evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of this combination treatment.
