      characterization of abnormalities of stress and rest myocardial perfusion (ischemia,
      infarction).

      A common problem is attenuation artifacts that are due to tissue interposition attenuating
      radiation from some cardiac regions. These artifacts originate activity decreasing and thus
      perfusion abnormalities potentially in all walls of left ventricle, especially the inferior
      wall in men (attenuation by sub-diaphragmatic organs) and the anterior wall in women
      (attenuation by mammary glands). These artifacts are observed in rest and stress acquisitions
      and can lead to a wrong diagnosis of infarction.

      Attenuation artifacts can be identified with analysis of contraction kinetics with
      "gated-SPECT" (normal kinetics and thus discordant with aspect of infarction). With D-SPECT
      camera some artifacts can be prevented with a 30-35Â° forward tilted position of acquisition.
      This position, also called biker position, can take cardiac area away from sub-diaphragmatic
      structures. It can also reduce the distance between heart and detection surface of camera and
      limit respiratory movements of thoracic wall.

      In this study, patients with abnormal results at stress myocardial perfusion tomoscintigraphy
      will undergo a rest tomoscintigraphy. Acquisition will be done in forward tilted position and
      in one of 2 other positions: dorsal decubitus or semi sitting.
