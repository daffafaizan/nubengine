      AKI after septic AKI and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Few biomarkers
      were validated as outcome-specific biomarkers in patients developing AKI after cardiac
      surgery at initiation of RRT. This study was designed to not only verify the prognostic value
      of functional kidney biomarkers on survival, but also predict it severity in order to
      optimize clinical decision making with respect to dialysis initiation and discontinuation.
