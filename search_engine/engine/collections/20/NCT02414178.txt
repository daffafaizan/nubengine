        -  Demonstrate the presence of tau fibrils in the brain during the pre-symptomatic stages
           of cognitive decline, prior to cerebral atrophy, hypometabolism (as measured by 18F-FDG
           PET imaging), and dementia.

        -  Demonstrate that the phenoconversion from cognitively normal (CN) status to early stages
           of cognitive impairment will be closely correlated with neocortical F 18 T807 uptake and
           that amyloid positive CN individuals who are positive for F 18 T807 will demonstrate
           conversion to early dementia.

        -  Correlate closely with the appearance of CSF markers of tau, including tau, p-tau, and
           VILIP-1.

        -  Co-localize with specific cognitive deficits (i.e. patients with tau deposition in the
           left lateral temporal lobe will have primarily language deficits).

        -  Predict the onset of dementia more accurately than existing biomarkers.
