      with acute hypoxemic respiratory pressure remains elusive and controversial.

      Several approaches with different algorithms exist. Among them, Low PEEP algorithm approach
      and High PEEP algorithm approach. These approaches are characterized by a generalized
      application of certain level of PEEP according to a predefined algorithm. However, these
      algorithms fail to account for inter-individual variations between patients with different
      diseases and with different severities of the same underlying process. Therefore, we advocate
      for an individualized application of PEEP. Whereby, PEEP will be determined individually for
      each patient based on familiar and well established physiological parameters.
