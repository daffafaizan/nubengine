      imaging of the aortic functional anatomy. The progress in surgery of the aortic root and the
      evolution of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as an alternative to surgical treatment
      in selected patients have refocused the need for quantitative imaging of the aortic root
      during transcatheter aortic valve replacement and valve-sparing aortic root surgery. In this
      study, we aim to assess the ability of semi-automated quantitative modeling (eSie Valves,
      Autovalve prototype version, Siemens Medical Solutions, USA) of the aortic valve and root in
      patients with clinical normal aortic valve and root, who are indicated for both 3D
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and computed tomographic (CT) due to atrial
      fibrillation or patent foramen ovale. Measures of the aortic valve and root obtained by 2D
      TEE, 3D TEE and CT are compared, and the ability of the semi-automated 3D TEE modeling
      software is tested. Given the workflow advantages of automation, this 3D TEE approach may
      enhance the clinical adoption of routine 3-dimensional imaging beyond CT.
