    
      Primary Objective: To demonstrate that proportion of Performance Status 2 participants with
      progression-free survival at 12 weeks is not inferior to the corresponding proportion of
      Performance Status 0-1 patients.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To demonstrate that incidence of treatment-related adverse events at 12 weeks in the
           Performance Status 2 group is not higher than that occurring in the Performance Status
           0-1 groups.

        -  To demonstrate that change in overall quality of life/global health status at 12 weeks
           is not inferior in the Performance Status 2 group compared to the change in the
           Performance Status 0-1 group.

        -  To demonstrate that proportion of participants with deterioration in lung-cancer
           specific symptoms at 12 weeks in the Performance Status 2 group is not higher than the
           corresponding proportion in the Performance Status 0-1 group.
