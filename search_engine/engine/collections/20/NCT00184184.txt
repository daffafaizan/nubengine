      this population's use of coffee, tobacco and substances. We will determine whether this
      differs from other populations, between diagnoses, age, etc.

      We will also compare results of substance in immunologic rapid urine tests taken by the nurse
      at the hospital with substance in urine tested in laboratory with LC/MS (liquid
      chromatography/mass spectrometry).
