      Invasive Bladder Cancer) patients who failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis,
      Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who
      have failed BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) intravesical therapy (standard of care) usually
      have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is a surgery associated with
      major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity and long term tedious
      medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most patients at this stage do
      not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of metastasis, making surgery
      a very difficult decision. CG0070, if successful in this trial, will serve to provide a
      therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need.
