      survivors are alive today. Many stroke survivors need the help of a family caregiver. A
      family caregiver is a family member or close friend who helps the stroke survivor once they
      go home. Many caregivers need information and support during the first few months after the
      stroke survivor is discharged home. One group of caregivers will receive the TASK II
      intervention and another group of caregivers will receive existing educational materials
      about stroke and caregiving through an information, support, and referral (ISR) process. Both
      groups of caregivers will receive written materials about stroke and caregiving by mail and
      weekly telephone calls by a nurse for a total of 8 weeks, with an additional call at 12
      weeks. A research assistant will also call by telephone at the beginning of the study, and at
      8, 12, and 24 weeks after the beginning of the study, with a follow-up call at 1 year to
      interview both groups of caregivers about their caregiving activities and about their own
      health and well-being. If shown to be efficacious, our next goal will be to translate the
      TASK II intervention into practice settings to meet current recommendations and guidelines
      that emphasize follow up care for stroke survivors and their family caregivers.
