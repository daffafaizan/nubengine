      I. Compare the time to progression of patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab.

      II. Compare the objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      III. Compare the toxicity of these regimens when administered to these patients.

      IV. Compare the median and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      V. Assess plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and serum vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 levels before, during, and after study therapy as predictors of outcome in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to histology (epithelial vs other) and ECOG performance status (0 vs
      1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over
      30-60 minutes (beginning after gemcitabine infusion) and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      (beginning after cisplatin infusion) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable
      disease (SD), complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) after the sixth course may
      receive bevacizumab as a single agent once every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine and cisplatin as in arm I and placebo IV over 30-90
      minutes (beginning after cisplatin infusion) on day 1. Treatment repeats as in arm I.
      Patients who achieve SD, CR, or PR after the sixth course may receive placebo as a single
      agent once every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression.
