    
      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of DFP-14927 in patients with refractory or
      relapsed advanced solid tumors. The study will be guided by a standard "3+3"dose escalation
      by observing the drug-related toxicities and dose-limiting toxicities following weekly IV
      infusion of DFP-14927 for each 28-day cycle (4 doses per cycle). In addition, the
      maximum-tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose for DFP-14927 will be determined.

      Furthermore, the study will determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of DFP-14927
      during the first cycle of treatment using the weekly dosing schedule.
