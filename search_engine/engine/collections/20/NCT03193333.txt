      Statistical methodology:

      The data will be expressed with measures of central tendency: mean and standard deviation for
      quantitative variables. The qualitative variables will be presented in frequencies and
      percentages. Statistical analysis will be done by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test for
      quantitative variables. The difference between qualitative variables will be analyzed using
      an square chi An alpha ≤ 0.05 would be considered as significant.
