      (allergic reaction). Triggers of these allergic reactions may be e.g. pollen, dust mites,
      mold or animal hair. Common allergic symptoms include itchy, stuffy, runny nose, sneezing,
      itchy and watery eyes and respiratory complaints. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only
      treatment that eliminates the causes of allergic disease. An example of such immunotherapies
      is the sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). During SLIT, side effects may occur such as local
      oropharyngeal reactions, e.g. manifesting as itching, swelling or irritation.

      The current study aims to investigate the efficacy of Ectoin Lozenges (EHT02) in patients
      suffering from oropharyngeal allergic symptoms. The symptoms are induced by SLIT.

      Patients are dedicated to one of three groups: a) preventive application of Ectoin Lozenges
      before SLIT-initiation, b) therapeutic application of Ectoin Lozenges after SLIT-initiation
      or c) control: SLIT-initiation without application of Ectoin Lozenges.

      The symptoms itching, swelling and irritation of mouth, lips and throat will be documented by
      the patients once 30 minutes after SLIT-initiation.
