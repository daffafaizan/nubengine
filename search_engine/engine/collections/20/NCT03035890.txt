      checkpoint inhibitors, since radiation can disrupt a tumor's physical barriers to T-cell
      infiltration and augment antigen presentation, thus serving as an "in situ personalized
      vaccine" to activate the immune system and potentially enhance the systemic response.

      The rationale for this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of combined immune
      checkpoint inhibitors and radiation therapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      patients.
