      Any other swellings that were caused by trauma and/or fracture, extended below the neck or
      patient reluctant to undergo US were excluded from the study. This study was approved by the
      (Research Ethics Committee) (REC), Faculty of Dentistry, Minia University before starting the
      research and all the entire patients had signed a standardized informed consent laid down by
      REC.

      A comprehensive questionnaire was used to assess history and through extra-oral & intra-oral
      examinations were carried out and recorded on the basis of criteria reported by Das.11 The
      ultrasonographic investigations were carried using an ultrasound diagnostic modality (LOGIQ-
      P5) (GE Medical System, Korea) with color Doppler function by using a linear array
      transducer, operating at a frequency of (7.5-12 MHz). All the examinations were performed
      over the swellings and also compared to the contra-lateral/normal side whenever needed. (Fig.
      1) All sonographic images were interpreted by an expert sonologist (15 years experience) and
      US features were recorded to extract ultrasonographic guided (USG) diagnosis and patient's
      swellings were categorized into five groups: inflammatory/infection/abscess swellings (Group
      I), cystic swellings (Group II), lymph node swellings (Group III), benign swellings (Group
      IV) and malignant neoplastic swellings (Group V).12 Finally, the included patients were
      subjected to either fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or surgical intervention for
      histopathological examination to extract the histopathological diagnosis
