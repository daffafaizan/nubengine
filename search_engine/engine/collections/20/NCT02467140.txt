      inguinal hernia repair comparing the ProGripTM self- fixating mesh with tack fixation. The
      ProGripTM laparoscopic self-fixating mesh has been approved for implantation to reinforce the
      abdominal wall during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (TAPP). The mesh delivers tack free
      fixation above and below the inguinal ligament potentially eliminating pain associated with
      traditional tack fixation. The present study is a prospective randomized clinical trial
      designed to collect information about complications such as acute and chronic pain and hernia
      recurrence rate from patients referred for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Patients who
      qualify to take part in the study will be randomized for a procedure using either a
      self-gripping ProGrip mesh or a conventional polypropylene mesh attached with AbsorbaTackTM.
      Data will be collected from operations performed at 6 high volume hernia centers in Denmark.

      Patients eligible for study will be recruited from the referral list for inguinal hernia
      repair at each participating institution. Prior to scheduled surgery, patients will be
      consented and will complete a questionnaire on inguinal pain intensity and quality of life .

      The mesh will be placed intraperitoneally after the component separation is complete. The
      peritoneal layer will be closed with a V-loc stitch in both groups.

      After surgery, key clinical data will be recorded, such as type of mesh used, size of the
      hernia defect, number of tacks used etc.

      The participating patients will receive postoperative questionnaires following the first year
      after surgery.
