      titration period of up to 6 weeks, and a double blind treatment period of 12 weeks.

      Participants entered the open label titration period and received hydrocodone ER tablets
      beginning with 15 mg every 12 hours for 3 to 7 days. The objective of the open label
      titration period was to find the successful dose of hydrocodone ER tablets that produced
      stable pain relief (defined as an Average Pain Intensity (API) score of 4 or less on the
      11-point numerical rating scale for either 3 consecutive days or 3 out of 5 consecutive days
      while the patient was maintained on the same dose of study drug for up to 7 days). Patients
      returned to the study center prior to each dose adjustment.

      Participants who met the criterion of a stabilized dose were randomly assigned into the 12
      week, double blind, placebo controlled treatment period on the final day of the open label
      titration period (baseline visit). Patients began treatment with double blind study drug at
      the effective dose of hydrocodone ER tablets achieved during the titration period or matching
      placebo. Rescue medication was permitted in addition to the study drug during the double
      blind treatment period.
