      capillaroscopy (NFC) is recommended for patients presenting RP, to eliminate systemic disease
      such as systemic sclerosis. NFC is not easily available in clinical practice. Dermoscopy,
      used for pigmentary skin lesion screening, may help to detect giant loops, hemorrhages or
      other capillaries anomalies. However, no study evaluated the performance of dermoscopy in
      primary RP. A preliminary study (Tenon Hospital) showed an interest of dermoscopy in primary
      and secondary RP, with a negative predictive value of dermoscopy of 100% for capillaroscopy.

      This is a prospective, multicentric French study comparing dermoscopy and capillaroscopy in
      patients attending dermatology or vascular medicine departments for the first evaluation of a
      RP.

      The objective is to determinate which items in dermoscopy are correlated with a normal NFC
      and predict with a good negative predictive value, a normal NFC in RP patients. The secondary
      objective is to assess inter-observer reproducibility of dermoscopy in patients with RP.

      The main hypothesis is that a normal dermocopy on five items is highly predictive of a normal
      NFC.

      During a first consultation for RP, NFC will be realized with a clinical exam and a
      biological test (antinuclear antibodies), as official recommendations. Dermoscopy of
      peri-ungueal area will be realized by another investigator, if possible during the same
      consultation. Photographs of all fingers, except thumbs, will be made and will be reviewed by
      another investigator of another center. There will be no follow-up.
