      recognizing cardiac arrest to performing CPR, together with the dispatcher. The one hours
      training session is split into four parts:

        1. Video self-instruction manikin practice (30 min), including a brief introduction to
           automated external defibrillator (AED).

        2. Practice in pairs (15 min). Practicing the dispatcher and rescuer role in a simulation
           to enhance learning.

        3. Debriefing. Questions, answers and reflection (15 min).

        4. Homework. Leaflet with tasks like learn how to activate the speaker function on your own
           phone.

      The main difference between dispatcher-assisted basic life support (DA-BLS) and traditional
      BLS training is that DA-BLS provides the scenes and interactive experiences on calling
      emergency medical service (EMS) and receiving CPR instruction via telephone speaker function,
      following up the skill training by scenario simulation training.
