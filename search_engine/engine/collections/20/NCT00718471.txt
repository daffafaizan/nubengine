    
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, randomized, active-control arm
      trial. The study population consists of subjects with ST-segment elevation MI who are
      randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset. Subjects presenting between 12 and 24 hours of
      symptom onset should present with recurrent or persisting chest pain and/or recurrent or
      persisting ST elevation suggesting ongoing ischemia, and an indication of primary PCI.

      Approximately 850 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 50 sites in several countries
      including Austria, France, Germany and the United States. Informed consent will be obtained
      from subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria prior to any study related
      procedures. Subjects will be randomized and begin treatment in the Emergency Department or in
      the ambulance or in the hospital room if in-patient. Eligible subjects will be randomized
      (1:1) to receive either UFH IV bolus (ACT-adjusted) or enoxaparin 0.50 mg/kg IV bolus without
      monitoring. Randomization to treatment group will be performed using an interactive voice
      response system (IVRS). All treatment groups will be given aspirin (160 to 500 mg/day
      according to local practice) and clopidogrel (300 to 900mg as loading dose according to local
      practice). All other concomitant medications will be consistent with local standard of care.
