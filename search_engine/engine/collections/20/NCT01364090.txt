      hepatitis C genotypes 2/3 in current injection drug users or receiving opiate substitution
      therapy. Treatment will be with pegylated interferon alfa 2b (directly observed) and
      ribavirin for 12 weeks in those that have non-quantifiable (<15 IU/ml detected and <15 IU/ml
      undetected) HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 and 24 weeks in
      those that have quantifiable (â‰¥15 IU/ml) HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay
      at week 4.
