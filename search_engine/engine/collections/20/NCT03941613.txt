      seizures. SEEG is not only a diagnostic method to locate the origin of the epileptic seizures
      but also a media to treat or to cure this disease. Using radiofrequency thermocoagulation, we
      are able to coagulate some part of the brain guided by SEEG. However, until now, we don't
      have high level evidence for the efficacy and safety of RF-TC. In our resent series, we found
      the 1 year seizure free rate of mTLE patients after RF-TC is about 80% without any notable
      complication.

      In this trail, we will compare the efficacy as well as the safety of anterior temporal
      lobectomy with RF-TC for the mTLE patients, including the 1 year Engel class, perioperative
      complications, cognitive function, visual field, etc. Thus we can provide more high level
      evidence on the usage of SEEG guided RF-TC on mTLE patients.
