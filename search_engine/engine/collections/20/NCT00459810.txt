      Primary

        -  Determine the PSA response rate in patients with androgen independent metastatic
           prostate cancer treated with paclitaxel poliglumex and transdermal estradiol.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to PSA progression and measurable disease progression in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to death from all causes in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate levels of serum estradiol, serum cathepsin B, and bone turnover markers with
           PSA response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive transdermal estradiol continuously (patches changed every 7 days) until the
      PSA level rises. Patients whose PSA increases above baseline or PSA decreases < 10% after 4
      weeks of estradiol therapy or whose serum PSA reduction is < 50% after 12 weeks of estradiol
      therapy also receive paclitaxel poliglumex therapy. These patients receive paclitaxel
      poliglumex IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Treatment with paclitaxel poliglumex repeats every
      28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
