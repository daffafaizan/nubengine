      is clinically beneficial, which can be inferred from prior study data and single case
      reports, this study aims to generate additional information on feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of this treatment approach in a larger group of EGFR mutated NSCLC patients. This
      study is a hypothesis generating two-stage trial for future phase III studies of neoadjuvant
      CTx with intercalated TKI. Hence, the study design relies entirely on a single treatment arm.
      To demonstrate efficacy it is sufficient to compare to historical data of the conventional
      treatments of NSCLC.
