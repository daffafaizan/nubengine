    
      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) -- a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -- has important manifestations outside the pulmonary
      parenchyma, including microthrombosis and macrothrombosis, with venous thrombosis being the
      most common form of thrombotic involvement. Existing studies, depending on the type of
      outcome assessment and type and dose of prophylaxis, have reported thrombotic events in 7-85%
      of patients with COVID-19.

      However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen in these patients remains uncertain. Although
      many clinicians continue to consider standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, other
      believe that more intense anticoagulation may reduce the thrombotic events, and improve
      outcomes. However, limited high-quality data exist to inform clinical practice and the
      existing guidelines recommendations are mostly based on expert opinion and consensus.

      In addition, exuberant inflammatory response is known to play a role in the pathophysiology
      of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19. It is possible that the
      pleiotropic effects of statins, which include anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects,
      prove beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19.

      This study plans to investigate the safety and efficacy of two pharmacological regimens on
      outcomes of critically-ill patients with COVID-19 using a 2x2 factorial design.

      First, patients will be assessed for the eligibility criteria for the anticoagulation
      hypothesis. Those meeting the criteria, will be assigned to intermediate versus standard dose
      prophylactic anticoagulation. These patients will subsequently be assessed for eligibility
      for the second randomization, and if meeting the criteria, will be assigned to atorvastatin
      20mg/d or matching placebo.
