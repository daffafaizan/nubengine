      they are scheduled for 90Y SIR spheres therapy for clinical reasons. Before 90Y SIR spheres
      therapy, patients will receive a diagnostic examination with injection of MAA (group A) or
      B20 (group B) into the common hepatic artery to rule out a relevant shunt volume to the lung
      or other extra-hepatic locations (e.g., stomach) as recommended by the manufacturer. After
      the diagnostic scan, therapy with SIR- spheres will be conducted in 2 separate sessions with
      selective injection of 90Y labeled SIR spheres into the right and left hepatic artery at two
      separate occasions (routine procedure at the University of Magdeburg, Germany). In addition,
      therapeutic sessions will include the selective injection of MAA or B20 into the right / left
      hepatic artery according to a predefined plan (either alone or as a mixture with the SIR
      spheres).The intra-hepatic distribution of 90Y labeled SIR spheres will be assessed using
      "Bremsstrahlen"- Single- Photon- Emission- Computed- Tomography (SPECT)- imaging, the
      distribution of MAA and B20 will be assessed using SPECT imaging.
