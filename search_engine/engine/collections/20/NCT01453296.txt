      long-acting agonist of the β2-adrenoceptor, in asthmatic subjects aged 5 to 11. GW642444 is
      currently under development as the long-acting beta-agonist component of a combination
      product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a longacting beta-agonist.

      Subjects will receive a single dose via a novel dry powder inhaler, then 7 days once-daily
      repeat dosing following a washout period. The study will be a randomized two-way crossover,
      with a placebo control. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the
      aim that 20 will complete the study. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and glucose and
      potassium levels will be investigated.
