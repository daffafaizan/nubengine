    
      To determine whether the surgical implantation of a human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal
      pigmented epithelium (hESC-RPE) monolayer seeded onto a polymeric versus hESC-RPE injections
      into the sub retinal space is a safe procedure.

      6 Patients will receive hESC-RPE cell injections (100000 cells) in the sub retinal space (2
      Dry Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 2 Wet AMD with disciform scar and 2 with
      Stargardt's disease).

      Also 5 patients Dry AMD, 5 patients with Wet AMD with disciform scar and 5 patients with
      Stargardt's disease with receive a subretinal implantation of the hESC-RPE seeded in a
      monolayer in a polymeric substrate.

      Patients will be enrolled sequentially, and after the procedure the patients will be followed
      for 1 year.
