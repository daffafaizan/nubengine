      Loss of arm function affects 69% of people who have a stroke [2]. Only 12% of people with arm
      weakness at the onset of stroke make a full recovery [3]. Improving arm function has been
      identified as a research priority by stroke survivors, carers, and health professionals who
      report that current rehabilitation pays insufficient attention to arm recovery [4].

      Robot-assisted training enables a greater number of repetitive tasks to be practiced in a
      consistent and controllable manner. Repetitive task training is known to drive Hebbian
      plasticity, where the wiring of pathways that are coincidently active is strengthened [5, 6].
      A dose of greater than 20 h of repetitive task training improves upper limb motor recovery
      following a stroke [7] and, therefore, robot-assisted training has the potential to improve
      arm motor recovery after stroke. We anticipate that Hebbian neuroplasticity, which is
      learning dependent, will operate regardless of the post-stroke phase. We, hereby, describe
      the protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial to determine whether
      robot-assisted training improves upper limb function following a stroke in the sub-acute
      stage.
