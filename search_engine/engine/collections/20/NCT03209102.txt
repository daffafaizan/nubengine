      and behavioral responses to stressful events, impulsivity, and risk-taking behavior. It has
      been shown to begin in adolescence. However, very few studies have addressed the
      physiopathology of BPD in adolescents. In order to gather rational information for targeted
      care, the heterogeneity of BPD determinants needs to be disentangled. To this aim, a
      multimodal approach to BPD dimensional aspects is proposed.

      BPD adolescents will be compared to typically developing controls in two complementary
      experimental designs: (1) Monitoring of neurovegetative, hormonal and body motion responses
      to an acute stress, with the hypothesis that stress reactivity might account for the
      physiopathology of the disorder; (2) Structural and functional imaging (fMRI BOLD) in the
      context of a reward processing task to delineate the neural/functional basis of BPD risk
      taking behavior.
