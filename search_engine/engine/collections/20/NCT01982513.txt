      aorto-caval compression in pregnant women placed in different positions. The results of this
      study will help us to determine the optimal patient positioning for each individual. This in
      future may help us in improving outcomes not only during labor and anesthesia, but also
      during maternal resuscitation in critical cases.

      The results of this study will help us to determine the best technique to minimize
      aorto-caval compression in the term pregnant patient. The results of this study will be
      useful to establish firm maternal resuscitation guidelines. We will be able to determine the
      optimal maternal position during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and this may improve both
      maternal and fetal resuscitation outcomes.
