    
      This Phase 1, open-label, two-period, single-sequence study is designed to evaluate the
      effect of steady-state ketoconazole on the PK profile, safety, and tolerability of a single
      1.5-mg tivozanib dose. On Day 1 of the first period, subjects will receive a single 1.5-mg
      dose of tivozanib and remain at the unit for at least 48 hours postdose followed by
      outpatient visits for PK sampling and safety assessments up to 3 weeks postdose. For Period
      2, subjects will be administered 400 mg of ketoconazole once daily (QD) for 3 days. On the
      4th day of Period 2, 1.5mg of tivozanib will be administered with 400mg of ketoconazole. PK
      sampling will continue for 3-weeks postdose while the subjects continue to receive 400mg of
      ketoconazole daily. An end of study visit will be completed 1-week after the last dose of
      ketoconazole.
