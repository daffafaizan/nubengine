      excellent 5 year survival rate of 83%, addressing longer term cancer effects in this group is
      an important aspect of cancer survivor care. Unfortunately, women with a history of
      endometrial cancer may report persistent levels of fatigue, depression, and anxiety that are,
      on average, higher than those of healthy, gynecologic out-patients. Physical activity is one
      potential approach to reducing these symptoms, but little is known about the effects of
      physical activity in endometrial cancer survivors specifically. Furthermore, current evidence
      is insufficient to make recommendations regarding the optimal exercise amount, type, and
      duration for improving fatigue, depression, or anxiety after a cancer diagnosis (any cancer
      type).

      This pilot, randomized trial is unique in its focus on endometrial cancer survivors, a
      previously understudied population with a large potential for benefiting from regular
      physical activity. Two separate walking intervention groups will work with an exercise
      specialist three times a week to walk for either 75 minutes (group 1) or 150 minutes (group
      2) weekly. The participants will start out slowly and then gradually increase to the
      particular group goal of 75 or 150 minutes. The stretching exercise group will work with an
      exercise specialist doing stretching/flexibility exercises three times a week starting with
      15 seconds and then gradually increasing to 30 seconds of holding the stretch.
