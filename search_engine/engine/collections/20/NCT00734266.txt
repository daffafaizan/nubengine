      correlated with the impairment of the lung function after cardiac surgery in patients with
      COPD. If such hypothesis is substantiated in the study, it would allow us to propose the use
      of leukotriene inhibitors in the peri-operative period to improve pulmonary function and to
      decrease complications after cardiac surgery in COPD patients.
