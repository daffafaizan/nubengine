      and is associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Use of calcium(Ca)-containing
      phosphorus-binders is an exogenous source of Ca that can elevate the CaxP product. In HD
      patients, an ultrasonographically-demonstrated increase in intima media thickness of the
      carotid artery has been associated with elevated serum P levels.Peripheral arterial vascular
      disease (PVD) accounts for significant mortality and morbidity in HD patients.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of sevelamer hydrochloride to
      calcium-containing phosphorus binders in reducing the rate of progression of femoral and
      carotid intimal media thickness (IMT) thickening as measured by B-mode ultrasound in stable
      HD patients.

      Subject randomization numbers was provided by the Epidemiology and Research Unit, E. Wolfson
      Medical Center, Holon, Israel. After meeting all inclusion criteria, subjects were randomized
      to one of two treatment groups: Renagel or calcium carbonate. Prior to receiving treatment,
      baseline femoral and carotid IMT were measured, medical and pharmaceutical history was
      documented, nutrition assessment was undertaken and midweek blood chemistry and blood count
      were measured. No change in patient medication prescription was required during this study,
      with the exception of phosphorus binders. All other concomitant medications were continued.
      During the year of the study, routine monthly blood tests were obtained for chemistry, blood
      count, and PTH was measured once every 4 months.

      After a year of treatment, femoral and carotid IMT were measured again, midweek blood
      chemistry and blood count were measured.
