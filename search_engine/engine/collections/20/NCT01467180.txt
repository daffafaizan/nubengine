      associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). The rapid elimination of myoglobin by standard
      dialysis membranes is limited to its molecular weight of 17.8kDa, although some removal can
      be achieved when a convective therapy is applied.

      Significant clearance for myoglobin has been reported for high flux membranes from < 8 mL/min
      (5) up to 22 mL/h (CVVH) (10) and for high cut-off (HCO) membranes a mean clearance rate of
      36.2 mL/min in HD mode (7) and 39.2 mL/h in CVVH mode (5). The use of high cut-off (HCO)
      continuous veno- venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for
      effectively reduction of myoglobin in the patient's serum to ameliorate the course of AKI.

      Previously, a case study of the removal of myoglobin by HCO-CVVH in one single patient with
      severe rhabdomyolysis was published.
