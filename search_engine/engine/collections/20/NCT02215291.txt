    
      This is a prospective, multi-site registry with longitudinal follow up for patients
      undergoing EGD or endoscopy. The primary objective is to provide a collection of patient
      NvisionVLEâ„¢ procedural data for participating physicians, including, but not limited to,
      imaging data, clinical utility data, demographics, pathology, treatment, and surveillance.

      Up to 1000 patients from up to 20 sites nationwide.

      There are no protocol defined follow up visits. Patients will undergo an initial baseline
      Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) procedure. A patient with a negative screening
      examination may not require additional screening endoscopies. For patients with established
      disease, further surveillance endoscopies will vary based on the extent of the disease (e.g.
      every 3 months, every 6 months, annual), which is based on the following American Society for
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guideline: the role of endoscopy in the surveillance of
      premalignant conditions of the upper GI tract. If patients have additional VLE procedures
      during the enrollment period, associated data will be collected.
