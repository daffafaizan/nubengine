    
      This is a single-center, prospective, single arm phase II study. Eligible patients will
      receive neoadjuvant therapy with pegylated liposome doxorubicin (PLD)/albumin-bound
      paclitaxel/trastuzumab regimentation.

      This study consists of two phases, the first phase aims to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of PLD, and the second phase will explore the efficacy and safety of the regimen.
