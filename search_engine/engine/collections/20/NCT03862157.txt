    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax in combination with
      azacitidine and pevonedistat in patients with previously untreated secondary acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination regimen, as
      defined by the rate of complete response (CR) plus complete response with incomplete bone
      marrow recovery (CRi) within 6 cycles of treatment. (Phase II [AML]) III. To determine the
      efficacy of the combination regimen, as defined by the rate of CR within 6 cycles of
      treatment. (Phase II [myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Newly Diagnosed]) IV. To determine the
      overall response rate (defined as CR + marrow CR [mCR] + partial remission [PR] +
      hematological improvement [HI]) within 6 cycles of treatment. (Phase II [MDS/chronic
      myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) post-hypomethylating agent (HMA) failure])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine efficacy outcomes, including CR rate, leukemia response rate (CR + CRi +
      partial response [PR] + morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]), minimal residual disease
      (MRD) negativity by flow cytometry, duration of response, transformation to AML (in the MDS
      cohorts), relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, azacitidine
      intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7, and pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes on
      days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 6
      months thereafter.
