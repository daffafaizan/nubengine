        1. whether the knee and function scores and the radiographic results of the knees with a
           PFC Sigma RP knee prosthesis would be better than those with an LCS RP prosthesis.

        2. whether the patients with a PFC RP knee prosthesis would have a better range of knee
           motion than those with an LCS RP prosthesis.

        3. whether patient satisfaction and preference would be better in the patients having a PFC
           Sigma RP knee prosthesis than those of patients having an LCS RP knee prosthesis

        4. whether complication rate would be less in the knees with a PFC sigma RP knee prosthesis
           than in the knees with an LCS RP prosthesis.
