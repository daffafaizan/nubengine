    
      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the initial one-year changes in health resource use before and after the
           initiation of mepolizumab treatment

        -  To further characterize rates of change in health resource usage and/or costs in
           subpopulations of interest (sex, age groups, severe asthma, uncontrolled asthma, COPD,
           diabetes)

      This retrospective, non-interventional (not involving human subjects) database study will
      compare real-life patient health resource consumption before versus after a first injection
      of mepolizumab. Data concerning patients receiving mepolizumab will be collated for a
      12-month period (the "baseline period") preceding a first index treatment (at "T0") and
      compared to a 12-month period occurring after the index treatment (the "exposure period").
