    
      Two questionnaires (truncated versions of previously validated surveys), one for parent and
      another for teacher, for which written consent was previously obtained are being sent to
      parents. The teacher questionnaires will be delivered via parents. A clinic visit will
      accompany age appropriate neurodevelopmental examination, administration of the Functional
      Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM) survey, and hearing and visual screening exams (if
      appropriate).
