      aims to compare immediate (1T1T) versus delayed loading with a final PICN screw-retained
      crown (DL-PICN), performed with CAD-CAM system. A total of 28 consecutive patients (56 teeth)
      above the age of 18 and presenting two single-unit edentulous space in the posterior region
      (molars or premolars, upper or lower jaw), will be considered for possible inclusion in the
      study, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (patients with high occlusal stress
      will be included).

      The performance of the different protocols will be tested in terms of (1) prostheses and
      implants survival and success rates following international standards (2) Patient reported
      outcome measures (PROMs); (3) time and cost. Moreover, restorations and antagonistic teeth
      wear will be studied trough ex-vivo analysis by profilometry of replica. The evaluations will
      be carried out at a follow-up period of 7 days, 2, 6 months and then every year up to 5
      years.

      Hypothesis is that the type of loading technique with a final PICN crown (1T1T or DL-PICN)
      does not influence prostheses and implants survival and success rates, but that 1T1T protocol
      improves patient-centered outcomes as well as time and cost effectiveness in comparison with
      DL-PICN.

      The overall cost of the restoration treatment will be 1600€ (instead of 2100€), which
      represents a saving of 500€ for the patient.
