      cause different diseases that are spread in different ways. New evidence suggests that the
      Meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero速) licensed outside of Kenya against meningococcal B disease
      may also be effective against gonorrhoea due to genetic similarities between the two
      organisms causing the two diseases. Investigators will conduct a clinical trial of the
      Meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero速) in approximately 50 male and female participants aged
      18-25 years who are in follow up in KEMRI cohorts (including HIV-uninfected and infected
      individuals) at the KEMRI clinic in Mtwapa. This is not an efficacy trial. Instead,
      investigators will assess if immunisation of individuals at risk for gonococcal infection
      with 4CMenB (Bexsero速) elicits humoral and T cell cross-reactive responses against Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae (Ng). Participants will make six study visits, including a screening visit, an
      enrolment visit and 4 follow up visits. InvestigatorsF will offer vaccination with the
      Meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero速) vaccine at the enrolment visit and approximately 2 months
      later. Investigators will collect a 20ml blood sample at enrolment, and following the first
      vaccination, and a 70ml blood sample following the second vaccination. At study completion
      (month 6), investigators will collect a 4ml blood sample. Investigators will collect a throat
      swab, a urine sample (for men), vaginal swab, and an anal swab at the enrolment, month 3 and
      month 6 visit to test for Chlamydiae and Gonorrhoea infection. Total study participation for
      participants is 6 months. Upon study completion, participants will continue to receive
      research care at the KEMRI clinic in Mtwapa.
