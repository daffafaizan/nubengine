      Connections) designed to improve retention in HIV care services among youth ages 15-21 years
      living with HIV enrolled in ART services. A randomized control trial in which youth living
      with HIV (YLHIV) will be allocated to standard of care (control) or standard of care plus an
      online support group and followed for 12 months. Structured questionnaires will be
      administered to participants at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Clinical data will also be
      extracted on participants. In-depth interviews with a subset of participants and intervention
      implementers will be completed at the end of the intervention period. Although participants
      will be recruited from health facilities, the intervention is conducted "virtually," by
      trained facilitators, not within the health facilities.
