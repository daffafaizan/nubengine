      oromandibular defects is well established, whereas few attentions were focused on
      postoperative analgesia for the donor area. Conventional postoperative pain management
      following oromandibular reconstruction consists of systemic opioids, which can cause nausea,
      vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, constipation and respiratory depression. Adequate
      postoperative analgesia decreases the incidence of cardiopulmonary complications. Peripheral
      nerve blocks can attenuate the sensory innervations.The purpose of this trial is to determine
      if using lower limb nerve blocks in patients undergoing free flap-based oromandibular
      reconstruction can significantly decrease use of pain medications and to evaluate the safety
      of lower limb nerve blocks.

      Patients with oromandibular defects, who were scheduled for elective reconstructive surgery
      using free fibular or ALT flaps, were divided into two groups in a randomized, single-blind
      fashion. In Group PCA, only intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCA) was used
      postoperatively. In Group PCA+B, both intravenous PCA and lower limb blocks were used. For
      patients with fibular flaps harvested, femoral nerve block and common peroneal nerve with
      ropivacaine were administered. For patients with ALT flaps harvested, femoral nerve block
      with ropivacaine was administered. Post-operative narcotic usage, post-operative pain score,
      post-operative anti-emetic usage, vital signs, onset and duration of sensory and motor block,
      the presence of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting were recorded.
