      recruited from Zhongda Hospital. Only patients who treated with paclitaxel plus nedaplatin
      will be included in the analysis. All patients receive paclitaxel (135-175mg /m^2) and
      nedaplatin (100 mg/m^2) infusion on day 1, and then take Anlotinib 12mg/d orally on day 7-21,
      every 3 weeks. Once patients reached CR or PR, Anlotinib was continued on 12mg/d maintenance
      therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was noted.
