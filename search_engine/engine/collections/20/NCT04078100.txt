      necessitate surgical intervention.

      as the Modern international guidelines substantially recommend mitral valve repair whenever
      possible there is significant decrease in mitral valve replacement rates.

      Cardiothoracic surgeons have to face the problem of Making a decision regarding mitral valve
      repair, reconstruction or replacement which requires excellent valve exposure for precise
      anatomical definition and manipulation taking in mind cases with specific anatomical
      challenges.

      Since the beginning of modern cardiac surgery only two basic approaches to the mitral valve
      have been described by Effler who wrote in 1958 " the actual entry into the left atrium may
      be accomplished in either of two ways : through the Fossa Ovalis by way of the right atrium
      or through the posterior interatrial groove " Nowadays median sternotomy is still the most
      commonly used incision for mitral valve surgery which allows the best exposure for the valve
      through transseptal incision or through Sandergaard's groove.

      Although the latter approach is the preferred method for most surgeons the transseptal
      approach has been revisited in more recent years in various forms by those seeking better
      exposure of mitral valve especially in cases with difficult anatomy.

      In this paper we try to compare the transseptal approach with the conventional left atrial
      approach for mitral valve procedures to review previous literatures' results and to clarify
      the effect of using each of the two approaches in preoperative ,intra and postoperative
      course .
