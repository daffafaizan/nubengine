      with low back pain are different from those of healthy, pain-free individuals. Specifically,
      the researchers will test whether "glial cells" (the immune cells of the brain and spinal
      cord) are more active in patients with low back pain than in healthy volunteers. The
      investigators' previous study showed that patients with chronic low back pain demonstrated
      elevations in brain levels of the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of glial
      activation.

      To test this hypothesis, the study team will image the brains and spinal cords of patients
      suffering from low back pain using integrated magnetic resonance- positron emission
      tomography (MR-PET), and a radiotracer called [11C]PBR28, which tracks levels of glial
      activation.

      The efficacy of minocycline as a treatment for chronic low back pain will also be evaluated.
      A recent study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain in those with
      lumbar radiculopathy after treatment with minocycline, leading the investigators of this
      study to believe that minocycline may have potential efficacy in treating other back pain
      populations.

      The study team will observe whether a short course of minocycline hydrochloride may reduce
      glial activation along with self-reported low back pain symptoms. To this end, patients will
      be evaluated clinically and/or re-scanned after completing a 2-week trial of minocycline or
      placebo (a sugar pill).

      This study will be enrolling individuals who have been suffering from sub-acute (short-term)
      and chronic low back pain.
