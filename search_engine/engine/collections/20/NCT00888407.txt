      adults (ages 18-64) that have been serologically tested for Hepatitis B. Investigators will
      work with lay health workers to promote serologically testing for Hepatitis B and increase
      knowledge of Hepatitis B among Hmong adults. The effectiveness of the lay health worker
      intervention will be evaluated by conducting a randomized, controlled trial among Hmong
      adults aged 18-64 not previously tested for hepatitis B.

      The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of Hmong adults, ages 18-64 reporting
      serologically testing for Hepatitis B at post-test will be significantly greater in the
      intervention group than in the control group.

      Secondary hypotheses are:

      There will be greater increases in knowledge of Hepatitis B and liver cancer in the
      intervention group than in the control group.

      Participants with greater knowledge of hepatitis B and liver cancer at post-test will be more
      likely to be serologically tested for hepatitis B.
