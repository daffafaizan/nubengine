      against infectious organisms following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We are
      particularly interested in cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can cause serious problems in
      patients following transplantation. In the future, we hope to design ways to improve immune
      responses to CMV in transplant recipients, such as vaccinating transplant donors and/or
      patients against this virus. In order to characterize the effect of any such intervention on
      CMV immunity, we first need to better understand CMV immune responses in normal, healthy
      persons. This involves designing and validating an in vitro assay, which can reliably and
      consistently detect immune responses against CMV. Furthermore, we hope to define the temporal
      variability that exists in CMV responses in healthy individuals, which is essential for the
      design and implementation of all future studies. We plan to collect blood samples from 20
      normal volunteers who have been previously exposed to CMV (CMV seropositive individuals).
      Eligible individuals will be asked to donate blood on five occasions, once a week for four
      weeks and a fifth time, two months later. Eligible individuals must be 18-65 years of age,
      otherwise healthy, and seropositive for CMV exposure.
