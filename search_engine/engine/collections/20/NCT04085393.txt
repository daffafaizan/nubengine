    
      All patients eligible for the study receiving moderately emetogenic (MEC) chemotherapy will
      receive GERSC receptor antagonist on day one. All patients eligible for the study receiving
      highly emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) chemotherapy will receive GERSC receptor antagonist on
      day one including dexamethasone and NK-1 Receptor antagonist during cycle 1.

      The primary objective is to measure the Complete Response (no emetic episodes, no use of
      rescue medications) in patients receiving GERSC as a replacement for the second generation 5
      HT3 receptor antagonist palonosetron used in the first chemotherapy cycle for those patients
      receiving MEC or HEC and developed Breakthrough CINV. Complete response would be recorded
      specifically for the acute (0-24 hours post-chemotherapy), delayed (24-120 hours
      post-chemotherapy), and overall periods (0-120 hours post-chemotherapy).

      This study has two study groups.

        -  Group 1 (HEC) will receive GERSC, dexamethasone and NK-1 antagonist prior to
           chemotherapy

        -  Group 2 (MEC) will receive GERSC and dexamethasone prior to chemotherapy

      During the study:

      Participants will be completing questionnaires on day 1 prior to treatment and at
      approximately the same time treatment was given each day for the next seven days. Participant
      will be assessed each day on the amount of nausea, vomiting, and/or sedation experienced in
      the previous 24-hour period. The assessment should take less than 5 minutes to complete each
      day.

      Participants will be registered for Quality of Life measurement. Validated QOL measurements
      of fatigue and overall perception of QOL will be assessed upon registration in this study.
      Fatigue and overall well-being clearly can impact how well patients will do in terms of being
      able to tolerate and experience nausea and vomiting
