    
      Subjects will be considered enrolled that provide written informed consent to participate,
      and with thereafter be scheduled to attend up to up to five (5) ultrasound scans per day
      lasting up to 60 cumulative minutes each with approximately a 15 minute break before starting
      another study scan (limited to 15 cumulative minutes of scan time per eye, per day for
      ophthalmic scanning) as long as they remain eligible per the study inclusion and eligibility
      criteria. Vital sign information about subjects may be collected and subjects will be
      positioned for scanning of a variety of target anatomic areas using a variety of
      non-invasive, transcutaneous techniques, such as scanning abdominal, musculoskeletal,
      breast(s), peripleural, transcranial, cervical/neck, cardiac, ophthalmic, vascular,
      extremity, soft tissue, and other accessible anatomical regions. The subject will be
      monitored for adverse events throughout the research study scan. The resultant images and
      associated data will be recorded and stored as part of study data.
