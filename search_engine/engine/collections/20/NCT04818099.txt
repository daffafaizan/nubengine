      China. The incidence of depression and anxiety in HNC patients after radiotherapy is as high
      as 12% - 45% due to appearance changes, decreased swallowing function, dry mouth, pain and
      other discomfort. At the same time, radiotherapy, as mainstay of therapy for HNC, also causes
      different degrees of damage to the brain around the tumor, leading to secondary cognitive
      dysfunction. Depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment seriously affect the quality of
      life of HNC patients after radiotherapy. Recent studies have found that votioxetine has
      multimodal pharmacodynamic activity, which can not only improve symptoms of depression, but
      also significantly improve the cognitive function of patients. In this study, investigators
      will discuss the therapeutic effect of vortioxetine on the depression after radiotherapy in
      HNC patients through a multi-center, randomized and double-blind comparative clinical trial.
