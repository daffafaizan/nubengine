      destination therapy and optimal medical management in a Swedish end stage heart failure
      population ineligible for cardiac transplantation.

      The secondary objective is to compare treatment groups with respect to organ function,
      functional capacity, quality of life and adverse events.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be followed through 2 years. Patients who continue to
      be on going with the HM III or on OMM past 2 years will continue be followed for their
      outcomes and adverse events for up to 5 years. Patient recruitment was expected to occur over
      24 months, but due to difficulties in recruiting patients will be longer (approximately 48
      months)

      The study will be conducted in Sweden at all 7 University Hospitals and implantations will be
      performed in 5 sites.
