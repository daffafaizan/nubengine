      cervical spinal surgery using intraoperative monitoring. Patients will be enrolled in
      registry after signing informed consent. Data will be collected prior to surgery, during
      surgery, immediately following surgery and 4 to 6 weeks post surgery. The registry will serve
      as a database for surgeries using IOM.

      Specific outcome measures will be: neurological assessment, length of hospital stay, pain
      intensity, and complications.
