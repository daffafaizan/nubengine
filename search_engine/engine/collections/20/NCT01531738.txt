      known as 'obesity surgery' or 'weight loss surgery') is a well known treatment for severely
      obese individuals. The way in which these operations achieve weight loss is not fully
      understood. The investigators hypothesize that some of these changes in the reduced appetite
      after surgery may be due to alterations in taste. The aim is to compare obese patients before
      and after bariatric surgery (gastric bypass and banding) to define the reward value of sweet,
      fatty and vegetable/fruit taste in obese individuals, and how this changes after surgery.
