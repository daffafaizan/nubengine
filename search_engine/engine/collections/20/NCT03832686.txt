      recently seen a dramatic rise in the United States due to a rise in the incidence of
      oropharyngeal cancers related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) . The majority of patients
      diagnosed with HNC receive radiation therapy at some point in their treatment, either in the
      definitive or post-operative setting. Dysphagia is a common consequence of treatment for HNC,
      experienced by approximately 50% of patients treated with radiation therapy. Post-treatment
      dysphagia has been associated with increased risk of morbidity/mortality as well as
      well-recognized deterioration of quality of life. Performance of swallowing exercises during
      radiation significantly reduces dysphagia risk; however, patient adherence to swallowing
      exercises during radiation treatment is limited. Thus, poor adherence stands as a major
      obstacle to achieving the best swallowing outcomes. In response to this, a mobile health
      application was developed to directly address barriers cited by patients as reasons for
      non-adherence. The objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the impact
      of the mobile application on adherence to prophylactic swallowing therapy during radiation
      for HNC.
