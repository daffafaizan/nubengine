      that occurs in approximately 2 to 3% of children with neuroblastoma. Children with
      neuroblastoma associated opsoclonus-myoclonus tend to have a favorable prognosis from the
      standpoint of the cure of their cancer. Unfortunately,approximately two-thirds of this
      subgroup of patients are left with long term sequellae of the syndrome, including residual
      symptoms of opsoclonus, myoclonus, ataxia, learning difficulties and disturbance of sleep and
      mood.

      Multiple lines of evidence indicate an immune mechanism to this rare disorder. This includes
      occurence of OMS in the post-infectious state, aggressive lymphocytic infiltration of the
      tumor in children with OMS, and documented responses to therapries that act through
      suppression of the immune system.

      The current study utilizes four weekly doses of anti-CD 20 antibody (rituximab) to treat
      children with refractory OMS. Refractory disease is defined as continued symptoms of OMS
      despite surgical resection of the tumor and a minimum of one month of steroid therapy.

      All patients have baseline OMS evaluation and detailed neurocognitive testing with all
      studies being repeated at the completion of the four weekly infusions. OMS testing is
      repeated at Month 3. OMS testing and detailed neurocognitive testing is conducted at 6 months
      intervals until 2 years from the initial infusion.

      The goal of the study is to utilize this novel therapy to improve long term neurologic and
      neurodevelopmental outcome in children with refratory neuroblastoma associated
      opsoclonus-myoclonus.
