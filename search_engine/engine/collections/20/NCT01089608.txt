      contact time with the lid margin but with little penetration into eyelid tissue. Azithromycin
      eye drops may offer on advantage over these preparations because azithromycin achieves
      sustained high concentration in various ocular tissues including the lid margin.

      Patients will be treated during 7 days (1 drop twice daily the first day following by one
      drop once daily for 6 days) following by a period of 2 weeks without treatment. This
      therapeutic scheme will be repeated two times.

      Efficacy will be evaluated by change from baseline (Day 0) to Day 63 Â± 3 Days of the global
      ocular discomfort evaluation (VAS).
