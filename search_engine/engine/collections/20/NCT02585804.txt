      intraglomerular hypertension, leading to hyperfiltration and proteinuria. Given that SGLT2i
      corrects early hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with diabetes, our aim is to determine
      if a similar benefit may extend to patients with FSGS. Based on previous experimental and
      clinical data, we hypothesize that SGLT2i will improve renal hemodynamic abnormalities
      characteristic of FSGS that promote renal injury and proteinuria.
