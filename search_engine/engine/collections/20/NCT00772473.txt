      the headache intensifies. Levels of CGRP will be measured during the premonitory, mild,
      moderate, and severe phases of a single migraine attack and compared to the baseline value
      determined when the subject was headache free. Understanding of the clinical evolution of
      migraine CGRP release may have significant implications in acute treatment.
