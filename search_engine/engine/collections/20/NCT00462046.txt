      in the treatment of diabetes. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      berberine in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia. 116 patients with
      type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia were assigned in a randomized, double-blind, and
      placebo-controlled 4-clinical center study to receive berberine (1.0g daily) or placebo for 3
      months. The primary efficacy outcomes were changes in plasma glucose and serum lipid levels.
      The glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to
      assess insulin resistance in a randomly selected subjects of 54 patients. The baseline
      characteristics were similar in berberine and placebo groups. After 3 months, fasting and
      post load plasma glucose levels, HbA1C, triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels were
      all significantly reduced in the berberine group compared with the placebo group (p<0.0001,
      p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.002, p<0.0001 and p<0.0001 respectively). The GDR was significantly
      increased after 3 months of berberine (p=0.037), while no change was found in the placebo
      group (p=0.86). BMI, systolic blood pressure and serum IL-6 levels were all significantly
      reduced after treatment in berberine group as compared with the placebo group (p=0.016,
      p=0.041 and p=0.014, respectively). Our results show berberine to be effective and safe in
      the treatment of persons with diabetes and dislipidemia. This agent may be useful in the
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, and could play a role in treatment of metabolic
      syndrome.
