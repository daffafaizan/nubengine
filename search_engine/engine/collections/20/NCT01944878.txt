    
      Retrospective case-control study

        -  Investigators will analyze the medical records of hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG)
           and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) cases who had liver cirrhosis (LC) or chronic
           hepatitis in a single tertiary hospital (Chuncheon Sacred Heart hospital, Korea) within
           2008~2012.

        -  Portal hypertension is assessed using HVPG measurement via transjugular approach.

        -  Peptic ulcer is evaluated through EGD within 3 months of HVPG measurement

        -  The association of Peptic ulcer with LC, chronic hepatitis and total population (LC or
           chronic hepatitis) will be assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis

        -  There is no specific time frame, because this study is retrospective observational
           study, however EGD data is enrolled if it was done within 3 month from HVPG measurement.
