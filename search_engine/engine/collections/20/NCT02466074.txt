      been seen in patients with all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes and is well established as
      occurring early in relapsing-remitting disease.

      Previous research in our laboratory has shown that reduced cerebral perfusion in MS patients
      is a precursor to the formation of chronic lesions. In addition, studies have suggested that
      "virtual hypoxia", resultant from the combination of diminished cerebral perfusion and
      increased energy demand, contributes to tissue damage that strongly correlates with clinical
      disability in persons with MS. Our preliminary studies have already shown short-term
      increases in global and regional cerebral perfusion in MS patients after therapy with
      acetazolamide (ACZ).

      The central hypothesis is that if cerebral perfusion is important in tissue injury, then MS
      lesions within hypoperfused areas are more likely to develop permanent tissue damage, and
      medications that improve cerebral perfusion might beneficially alter the evolution of MS
      plaques, enhance remyelination and repair and diminish clinical disability progression.

      Sixty MS patients will be enrolled in this single-center exploratory RCT. Half of the
      patients will be randomly assigned to get ACZ treatment in phase 1 consisting of 24 weeks on
      ACZ, followed by another 24 weeks on ACZ during phase 2. The other half of the patients will
      be assigned to placebo for 24 weeks in phase 1 and then switched to ACZ and followed for 24
      weeks in phase 2. This study will utilize various imaging techniques to determine the degree
      to which cerebral blood flow is improved in MS subjects after administration of ACZ.
