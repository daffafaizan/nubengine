      The site will be randomized to receive either type of surgeries. Both types of surgeries are
      considered minimally invasive procedures to obtain root coverage for gingival recession. Both
      surgeries are clinically utilized in clinical practice and yield comparable results according
      to the literature, however, No prospective studies are published to compare between the
      outcomes of both techniques. patients will receive intra oral scan before the surgery and 6
      months after the surgery to compare change in root coverage and gingival thickness outcomes
      between the two techniques. Post operative pain as well as patient satisfaction will be
      measured by visual analog scale and compared between the two techniques. Patients will be
      monitored at different time points to asses healing.
