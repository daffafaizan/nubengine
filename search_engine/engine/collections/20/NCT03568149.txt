    
      Patients undergoing routine gynecological examinations are included in the study.

      Patients are divided into 2 groups:

        -  Group A: with endometriosis

        -  Group B: without clinical or ultrasound signs of endometriosis This is an observational,
           monocentric, prospective, exploratory study. The aim is to assess PCS incidence,
           associated symptoms and ultrasound characteristics in patients with endometriosis and to
           compare those findings to those of patients who do not present clinical or ultrasound
           signs of endometriosis.

      The study also evaluates the correlation between:

        -  Type of pain symptoms (dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, ovulation pain, dyspareunia,
           dysuria, dyschezia) and PCS

        -  Pain severity (assessed according to VAS scale from 0= no pain to 10= unbearable pain)
           and PCS

        -  Symptoms and ongoing medical treatments

        -  History of pelvic surgery and PCS.

      Ultrasound parameters of pelvic vascular insufficiency are:

        -  Ovarian vein diameter <4mm

        -  Slow ovarian blood flow (<3cm/sec)

        -  Retrograde blood flow

        -  Dilated arcuate veins communicating with pelvic varices

        -  The presence of pelvic varices is evaluated qualitatively as normal, moderate and
           serious

      This evaluation includes the study of uterine and ovarian vessels, using different
      techniques:

        -  Standard 2D study: it allows to measure vessels diameter

        -  Vascular doppler study: it allows to evaluate flow direction and blood speed

        -  3D color study: it allows a three- dimensional reconstruction of vessels and a more
           accurate qualitative assessment of the congestion degree.

        -  Ultrasound images are evaluated independently by two operators.
