      for biopsy. According to 2018 American Cancer Society report, breast cancer is still the most
      common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women.

      Radiological measurements are more difficult to appreciate when lesions are ill-defined or
      when the breast is dense. Thus, density alone may be insufficient for differentiation of
      benign from malignant tumors. Therefore, imaging modalities to reveal and analyze other
      morphological changes may help distinguishing malignant from benign.

      Our vision is to complement US imaging with new biomarkers such as quantitative information
      of microvascular morphology that is relevant to disease progression.
