      residents, nurses, stretcher-bearers, technicians, hygiene and cleaning) who are members of
      the health teams that care for patients with COVID-19. Participants with a history of having
      COVID-19 disease or who are consuming vitamin D at that time will be excluded. Through
      randomization, two groups will be formed: the Vitamin D group taking 4,000 IU orally daily
      for 30 days, the control group being given a placebo (starch) during the same time period.
      Participants and researchers will be blinded regarding the maneuver.

      At the beginning of the study anthropometric variables (weight, height, BMI) will be taken,
      the short medical history can be identified to identify comorbidities such as diabetes
      mellitus, hypertension or obesity, and a fasting blood sample will be taken to determine the
      changes in Vitamin D (25 (OH) VD), in addition to saliva samples by RT-PCR, as well as
      detection of antibodies in serum to determine whether or not they have SARS-CoV-2 disease.
      Participants who test positive for COVID-19 will be eliminated by the RT-PCR test.
      Participants will follow each other 45 days. Contacted weekly to verify the consumption of
      the capsules, as well as evaluation of adverse effects of vitamin D. Monitored for suspicious
      data of COVID-19 and in case of presenting the disease by COVID-19, a study will be carried
      out to confirm the infection through RT-PCR and will be monitored to determine the course of
      the disease. At the end of 45 days, new samples will be taken to determine levels of vitamin
      D and antibodies against SARS-Cov-2.
