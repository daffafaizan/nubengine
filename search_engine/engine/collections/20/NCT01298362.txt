      therapy or as maintenance therapy after initial treatment with chemotherapy. The total study
      duration will be 24 months comprising of a recruitment period of 12 months and a follow-up
      period of 12 months for each participating subject. The primary outcome variable is the mean
      percentage variation in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) during the 12 month
      follow - up period. Measurements will be taken before and after chemotherapy and at the end
      of the 12 month follow - up period.
