      Organization), the investigators are currently gathering fresh frozen cell pellets at CLL
      stage, and lymph node biopsies at Richter stage. The investigators also gathered lymph node
      biopsies from DLBCL, as a reference group.

      The investigators will perform genomic and proteomic comparative studies between CLL and
      Richter, as well as between Richter and primitive DLBCL, to understand the biological
      determinants of clonal evolution and chemorefractoriness of Richter Syndrom.
