      anesthesiologist. The supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves emerge from the orbit, and a
      needle was introduced above the eyebrow perpendicular to the skin with ropivacaine and was
      then gradually withdrawn with simultaneous injection of solutions throughout the entire. The
      zygomaticotemporal nerve emerge lateral to the orbit, equal to the position of pterion, this
      nerve was blocked with ropivacaine. The auriculotemporal nerve was blocked bilaterally
      anterior to the ear at the level of the tragus, the needle was introduced perpendicularly to
      the skin and infiltration was performed deep to the fascia and superficially as the needle
      was withdrawn. Care must be taken to avoid destroying superficial temporal artery. The
      greater, lesser, and third occipital nerves may be blocked using a needle, with infiltration
      along the superior nuchal line, approximately halfway between the occipital protuberance and
      the mastoid process.

      For group I patients, neurosurgeons infiltrated the planned incision by a needle penetrated
      deeply to the skin with 0.75% ropivacaine throughout the entire thickness of the
      scalp.Neither scalp block nor local infiltration was performed in the control group (group
      C).
