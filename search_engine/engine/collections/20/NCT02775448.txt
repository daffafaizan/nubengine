      from premenopause to postmenopause. This increases the risk for morbidity and mortality from
      cardiovascular diseases. Carduus marianus is a homeopathic medicine that traditionally has
      been used for hepatic diseases. Silymarin, isolated from Carduus marianus, owe its
      therapeutic and hepatoprotective effects to its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      properties. Carduus marianus is frequently used in clinical practice and reduces plasma level
      of triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL in humans with dyslipidemia. Not all homeopaths
      agree on dosage and potency when prescribing homeopathic medicines. The aim of this study is
      to assess: (1) the most effective dose of Carduus marianus in centesimal scale for reducing
      hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia in climacteric women; (2) the effect of
      Carduus marianus in other metabolic parameters (glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin
      resistance, weight, body mass index, waist circumference).

      This is a 8-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel, four-group, dose-response study to
      assess the safety and efficacy of Carduus marianus in 6cH, 12cH, 30cH and placebo plus diet
      and exercise, for reducing hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia in climacteric
      women.
