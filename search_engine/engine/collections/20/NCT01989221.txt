      of nausea and vomiting in patients with gastroparesis.

      The specific objectives of this study are to determine:

        1. Determine the treatment response of Sancuso® in gastroparetic patients with nausea
           and/or vomiting.

        2. Determine which specific symptoms of gastroparesis improve - nausea, vomiting, early
           satiety, abdominal distension, abdominal pain

        3. To determine symptomatic responses in both diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis

        4. To determine the time course of symptom improvement (with Sancuso® for symptoms of
           gastroparesis;

      The hypotheses to be tested include:

        1. Sancuso® improves symptoms of gastroparesis.

        2. Symptoms of nausea and vomiting improve to a greater degree than abdominal pain.

        3. The beneficial response of Sancuso® is seen in both diabetic and idiopathic
           gastroparesis.

        4. The symptom reduction occurs on days 3 after starting treatment and continues throughout
           the treatment course.
