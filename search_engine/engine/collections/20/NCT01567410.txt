      for pressure ulcers is the first step. Epidemiological studies are also an important element
      in the prevention of PU and requires consistent registration based on standardized
      definitions and tools. Staff knowledge is critical in this work. However showed a Norwegian
      pilot study on the prevalence of PU deficient knowledge among nursing staff in terms reliable
      classification of PU and PU-assessment of risk. The pilot study showed the need for training
      to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers and to ensure data quality in future studies.

      E-learning is an alternative to traditional courses and will help to streamline and
      standardize training by allowing a larger number of personnel be reached with this method of
      training. It is not designed Norwegian e-learning program that addresses the use of risk
      assessment instrument or classification of PU. We have developed one program to train
      personnel in the PU-classification and risk assessment and plan to evaluate this. The program
      will be an important contribution to the PU-prevention as well as the program will be used in
      the execution of a multicenter prevalence study of PU-prevalence.

      Nurses will randomly assign to a lecture, e-learning or to a control group. The lecture and
      e-learning are based on the same content. The nurses will score five patient cases with
      braden scale before and after intervention and 20 pictures of pressure ulcers in different
      categories before and 40 after intervention. The control group will only do a pretest.
