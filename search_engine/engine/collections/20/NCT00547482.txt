      subjects with type 2 diabetes ranging from low BMI to BMI 45 (BMI ≥ 28 and ≤ 45) will be
      enrolled.

      The duration of subject participation in the main portion of the study which includes the
      initial study and study extension periods is expected to be approximately 12 months. Upon
      completion of this period, subjects with a TANTALUS device shall continue to be followed
      clinically at six-month intervals (Safety Monitoring Period) until the FDA has made a
      determination regarding the safety and efficacy of the device.
