    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm study to evaluate six weekly doses of
      RGI-2001 in combination with standard of care treatment for the prevention of aGvHD in
      subjects following alloHSCT. The study will include a Safety Run-in Phase to assess the
      safety and tolerability of 6 weekly doses of RGI-2001 followed by an Expansion Phase in which
      the potential efficacy of 6 weekly doses of RGI-2001 in addition to standard of care for GvHD
      prophylaxis will be assessed. Comparison will be made to a contemporaneous control group.
