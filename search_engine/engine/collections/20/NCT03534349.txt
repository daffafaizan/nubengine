      Extremity Functional Classification Scale were included in the study. Flexibilities of
      hamstrings, hip flexors, tensor fascia latae, and gastrocnemius muscles were evaluated in
      dominant lower limb. Popliteal angle test, hip flexor flexibility test, tensor fascia latae
      flexibility test and gastrocnemius flexibility test were used for flexibility asssessments.
      Functional performance was assessed with 6 Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) and Timed Performance
      Tests. The correlation between the flexibility of lower limb muscles' and performance tests
      were examined.
