    
      PCV13 efficacy for the prevention of vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia (VT-CAP) and
      invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was established in the Community-acquired Pneumonia
      Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA) aged 65 and older. However, there are still few
      available real-life effectiveness estimates in adults. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the PCV13 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalised VT-pneumococcal CAP among adults
      aged ≥60 years in the Region of Madrid (Spain). Determination of the effectiveness of PCV13
      to prevent hospitalised vaccine-type (VT)-pneumococcal CAP among adults aged ≥60 years in
      Madrid will be evaluated using a test- negative design study, overall and among
      immunocompetent persons only.
