      C1INH-nf for the treatment of 1 or more HAE attacks and were analyzed for efficacy. The study
      design also allowed for short-term prophylaxis with C1INH-nf prior to emergency or
      non-cosmetic surgical or dental procedures, and an additional 12 subjects received C1INH-nf
      only for this purpose. All 113 subjects were exposed to C1INH-nf and analyzed for safety.
