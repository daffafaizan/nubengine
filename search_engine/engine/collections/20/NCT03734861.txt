      are managed on daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). 75 children will be randomized 2:1 into
      one of two arms:

        -  50 children will be randomized to BreatheSmart, comprised of:

             -  BreatheSmart mobile application that tracks medication usage and sends real time
                reminders

             -  HeroTracker sensor that counts dosage and monitors real-time medication adherence

             -  CoheroConnect provider portal that allows the Investigator to monitor real-time
                adherence and to provide targeted outreach to children with low adherence
                (intervention arm)

        -  25 children will be randomized to "standard of care"(control arm). These patients are
           reminded to adhere to the prescribed standard of care therapy provided by their
           clinician during their clinical encounters and when the family calls to report an
           illness.
