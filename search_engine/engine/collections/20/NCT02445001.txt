      for periods up to 20 minutes by autologous re-injection of a small volume (about 1 mL) of
      indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded erythrocytes, making possible for the first time
      quantification of blood flow in individual capillaries, including abnormal structures like
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and it makes possible characterization of vasomotion in
      ocular vasculatures.
