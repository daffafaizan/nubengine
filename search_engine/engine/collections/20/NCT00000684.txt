      in humans to determine its effect on HIV when dextran sulfate is given orally have not been
      conclusive. It is hoped that this study will show that dextran sulfate administered
      intravenously will have antiviral effects in patients who are infected with HIV.

      Following tests for evaluation, patients are hospitalized for 14 days. They are admitted to
      the hospital in the afternoon and, starting the next morning, receive a continuous infusion
      of dextran sulfate through an intravenous line for 14 days. The infusion is adjusted to
      maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 50 to 65 seconds. Blood is
      withdrawn 5 times on the first day that patients receive dextran sulfate and at least once a
      day thereafter for safety. Patients' clinical condition, blood clotting, and blood platelets
      are monitored very closely.
