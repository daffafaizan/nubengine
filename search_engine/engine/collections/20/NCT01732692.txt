      experimental morning-only regimen arm will prepare and take MOVIPREP® solution in the full
      dose - 2 litres of MOVIPREP® preparation in the early morning on the day of the colonoscopy
      clinical procedure. Participants in the standard split-dose regimen arm will prepare and take
      MOVIPREP® solution in split doses - ½ of dose (1 litre) the evening before + ½ of dose (1
      litre) of MOVIPREP® preparation in the morning of the day of the colonoscopy.

      The study consists of three visits. Participation in the study lasts no more than 11 days; 3
      days as minimum.

      There is no follow-up period planned except in case of any adverse events (AEs) when the
      follow-up period will last until the participant has recovered or until all AE-related
      queries for the participant have been resolved.
