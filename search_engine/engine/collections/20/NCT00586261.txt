      similar improvements have not been seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD
      constitutes one of the highest risk populations for cardiovascular disease. When the
      creatinine clearance is ≤ 60 ml/min the risk for cardiovascular events is greater than that
      of diabetes. However, few studies have focused on the prevention or treatment of coronary
      artery disease (CAD) in CKD patients.

      The development of endothelial dysfunction and increased inflammation appear to be critical
      in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The broad long-term
      objective of this grant proposal is to determine unique therapies to reduce endothelial
      dysfunction and inflammation, and thereby help to prevent cardiovascular disease and preserve
      renal function in patients with CKD. Thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone appear to
      improve endothelial function and decrease inflammation, an effect that may be present in
      patients with or without diabetes.

      To address this hypothesis the following Specific Aims are proposed:

        1. To determine the effects of chronic pioglitazone therapy on endothelial function in
           non-diabetic patients with CKD (creatinine clearance ≤ 60 ml/ min, but not on dialysis)

        2. To determine the effects chronic pioglitazone therapy on inflammation and oxidative
           stress in non-diabetic patients with CKD

        3. To determine the effects chronic pioglitazone therapy on progression of renal disease in
           non-diabetic patients with CKD
