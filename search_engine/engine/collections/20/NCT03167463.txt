      Endoscopic drilling combined with dissection of the atretic plate and its surrounding
      structures has been introduced more recently. The approaches have been through transnasal,
      transpalatal, and transseptal routes. Each of which have experienced varying popularity
      through time. Regardless of the access route and repair technique used, re-stenosis is a
      common postoperative complication. To prevent re-stenosis and subsequent re-operation, many
      authors advocate meticulous preservation of mucosa for use as flaps, which in most cases are
      combined with postoperative stenting. However, stenting, is controversial

      The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Preoperatively, cotton pledgets
      soaked in a solution of topical vasoconstrictors are placed against the nasal mucosa for
      topical decongestion. Local anesthesia is infiltrated into the nasal septum, the atretic
      plate, the middle turbinate, and the superolateral nasal wall. An endoscopic view of the
      surgical field is maintained at all times during the procedure using a 4-mm nasal endoscope
      with 0-degree or 30-degree visual angulation. Firstly, mucosa is elevated bilaterally from
      the underlying cartilaginous and bony septum on both sides. Then the posterior half of the
      septum including the vomer is removed using Blakesley forceps and a 1-mm or 2.5-mm diamond
      burr. After that, the flaps are fashioned using the preserved mucosa. At last, the flaps are
      secured in position with a thin layer of fibrin glue or gel foam. No packing or stenting is
      used. The patient is extubated immediately following the procedure and early oral feeding
      encouraged. The intended length of stay is overnight.
