      most severe with consequences such as neurovascular disruption, pulp necrosis, and root
      resorption. Healing depends on factors such as the level of root development, the extent of
      damage to periodontal tissues, and the effects of bacterial contamination from the oral
      cavity .

      The course of healing of the severed periodontal ligament will determine the treatment
      outcome of these injured teeth .As a result, all treatment procedures are directed to
      minimize undesired consequences which might lead not only to loss of tooth, but also to loss
      of alveolar bone.

      The common treatment of luxated teeth is repositioning and splinting to achieve stability and
      to prevent further damage to the pulp and periodontal structures during healing. Splints
      should ensure adequate ﬁxation, prevent accidental ingestion or inhalation, and should
      protect teeth against traumatic forces during the vulnerable healing period .

      The current guidelines for treatment of traumatic injuries by the International Association
      of Dental Traumatology (IADT) specify a short term functional splint for luxated teeth.
      However these protocols are based on clinical studies and animal experimentation employed
      rigid ﬁxation techniques so the results of these investigations are not representative of the
      current protocols . Also splinting times in IADT guidelines are derived mainly from animal
      studies which considered of low quality evidence .

      As a result of, surgical tooth extrusion as treatment modality in cases of crown root
      fracture was chosen as a controlled traumatic injury to examine the true cause-effect
      relationship between splinting time and healing outcomes of periodontal ligament aiming to
      decrease the effect of bias, con-founders and probability of chance associated with the other
      types of luxation injury.
