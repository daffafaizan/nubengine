      Study (WHS/WGHS) to improve the phenotypic characterization of GWAS of PD: (1) Addition of
      CDC-AAP (Centers for Disease Control - American Academy of Periodontology) periodontal
      disease instrument to the WHS annual follow-up survey. (2) Validate existing Periodontal
      Disease (PD) status in the WHS/WGHS (subset). Request of dental records for 180 women sampled
      from the WHS who had reported diagnosis of PD in the past. (3) Correlation and validation
      analysis of new periodontal disease information with requested dental record (most recently
      dated). Phone interviews and request of dental records for 180 women sampled from the
      WHS/WGHS who visited a dentist within recent 36 months.

      In addition, the investigators propose to identify genetic determinants of PD shared with
      CVD, DM, or osteoporosis via an integrative computational biological networks approach.
      Although the systemic links between PD vs. DM, CVD or osteoporosis have been established in
      clinical genetics as well as in experimental models, high-throughput investigations for
      gene-gene interplays between the associated conditions (CVD vs. PD; DM vs. PD; osteoporosis
      vs. PD) have not been explored yet. The investigators propose to approach this using an
      integrative in silico method, combining existing diverse biological information including
      genomic, epigenetic, expression and protein data. To our knowledge, this is the first time
      that hierarchical levels of integrative precision medicine will be tested for PD vs.
      CVD/DM/osteoporosis to generate plausible hypotheses and experimental targets.
