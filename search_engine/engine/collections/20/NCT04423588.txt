      gastric Bypass surgery and receiving 6 months of postoperative PPI prophylaxis with Dexilant
      (dexlansoprazole). The aim is to examine if the LPRYGB has an impact on the absorption of
      dexlansoprazole. Peripheral blood samples from the study participants are obtained at fixed
      time points after oral Administration of a capsule Dexilant preoperatively as well as 3 and 6
      months after surgery. The incidence of marginal ulceration in the same patient population is
      assessed by upper endoscopy 6 and 12 months after surgery. The surgery, the PPI prophylaxis
      and the upper endoscopy 12 months post-surgery aren't for study purpose. Data collection is
      made by measuring serum drug concentration, patient questionnaires, pill count and upper
      endoscopy.
