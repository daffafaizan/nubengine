      I. Compare the efficacy of methotrexate vs dactinomycin, as measured by complete response
      rate, in patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

      II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine whether the
      definition of persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is accurate (as determined by
      the likelihood that the beta human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] titer would decline on the
      day treatment is initiated).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive methotrexate intramuscularly once weekly in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive dactinomycin IV over 15 minutes every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients continue on treatment until 1 beta
      human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) titer is below the institutional normal. Patients then
      receive 1 additional consolidation treatment.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 1 year.
