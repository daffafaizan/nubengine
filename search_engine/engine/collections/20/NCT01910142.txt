      nutrition on bone calcium turnover far more accurate, within a shorter time frame and
      therefore less intensive for the volunteers in clinical studies as compared to presently
      existing methods. This method will enable screening for promising food concepts for combating
      osteoporosis within a relatively short time. Recent developments show that use of the nuclide
      41Calcium (41Ca) and measurement by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) has great potential
      in measuring effects on bone level within a relatively short period of time. When introducing
      a diet change (intervention) the bone metabolism of calcium may change resulting in a changed
      41Ca-signal in the urine. So far a few medication studies with osteoporotic volunteers have
      been performed and it appears that this ultrahigh sensitive technique may also be applicable
      for nutrition studies in healthy volunteers.
