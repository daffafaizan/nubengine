      I. To determine the safety, and tolerability of combined immune checkpoint blockade with 3
      fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy (stereotactic ablative radiotherapy [SABR])
      of up to two metastatic lesions in patients with recurrent and or metastatic cervical,
      vaginal, or vulvar cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical response rates and assess toxicities of treatment to durvalumab
      combined with tremelimumab with 3 fractions of SABR of at least one and up to two metastatic
      lesions in patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.

      II. To estimate progression-free survival, overall survival, and time to next treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of immune response to combined immune-checkpoint
      inhibition with SABR and correlate this with clinical response to treatment.

      II. To evaluate potential biomarkers of immune response including cervical and rectal
      microbial diversity, cervical immune cell infiltration and peripheral immune cell activation
      as correlates of clinical response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour followed by durvalumab IV
      over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle. Participants also undergo SABR over 30-45 minutes on days
      8, 10, and 12 of cycle 1. Treatment with tremelimumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4
      cycles, and treatment with durvalumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 8 cycles in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, at 2, 3, 4, 6,
      8, 10, and 12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
