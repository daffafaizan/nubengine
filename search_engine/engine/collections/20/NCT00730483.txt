      Primary

        -  To gather preliminary data and determine the feasibility of a randomized study of
           patients with unresectable hepatic neuroendocrine metastases using PVA microporous
           hydrospheres/doxorubicin hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: A catheter is placed into the right or left hepatic artery. Patients with unifocal
      tumors will have the catheter or microcatheter placed more selectively into the 2nd or 3rd
      order branch off the right or left hepatic artery in closer proximity to the tumor. Polyvinyl
      alcohol (PVA) microporous hydrospheres/doxorubicin hydrochloride mixture is injected into the
      delivery area.

      Patients with less than 75% necrosis at 1 month undergo a second (and possibly a third a
      month later) chemoembolization.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1
      year, and then every 3 months for 1 year.
