    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST]) and one-year overall survival to the study drugs temsirolimus and AZD6244
      (selumetinib) hydrogen sulfate in BRAF V600E mutant unresectable stage IV melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate 6-month progression-free survival in patients receiving temsirolimus and AZD6244
      hydrogen sulfate.

      II. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of temsirolimus and AZD6244 on pERK, s6K, PTEN and
      mediators of apoptosis.

      III. Determine the toxicity profile of temsirolimus with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      OUTLINE:

      Treatment Phase: This period begins with the first intravenous (through the vein) infusion of
      TEMSIROLIMUS and the first AZD6244 administration by mouth (visit 2, Week 1) and will
      continue until Week 8 (Visit 4).

      As many as 38 patients will receive the same dosage of TEMSIROLIMUS injected in the veins
      once a week for 8 weeks, and the AZD6244 will be given as capsules by mouth twice a day for 8
      weeks. That is one cycle. The TEMSIROLIMUS and AZD6244 will be given to participants as an
      outpatient, unless admission to the hospital was needed for treatment of related side effects
      or underlying disease. The subsequent cycles of TEMSIROLIMUS and AZD6244 will be given every
      8 weeks. The TEMSIROLIMUS will be injected in a vein over 30 minutes.

      The continuation phase begins with visits at weeks 12 in patients who receive at least two
      cycles of treatments.
