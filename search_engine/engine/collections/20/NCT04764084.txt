    
      This is a single-arm, single-center, phase I study to investigate the DLT and MDT, safety and
      efficacy of Niraparib combined with Anlotinib in the treatment of advanced solid tumors with
      HRR gene mutations. In this study, 52 histological or cytological diagnosis, previous
      treatment failure patients of HER2 negative breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric
      adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer are included and receive Niraparib combined with
      Anlotinib. Patients are required to carry pathogenic or suspected pathogenic gBRCA or sBRCA
      mutations, or HRR gene mutations defined by the inclusion criteria. The study will be divided
      into two phase. The first phase will include 6-12 patients on a 21-day cycle to determine the
      DLT and MTD. In the second phase, 40 patients will be included to treated with Niraparib plus
      Anlotinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of the trial.
