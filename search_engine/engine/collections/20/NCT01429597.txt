      glycosphingolipids in the vascular endothelium of several organs in the body. Progressive
      endothelial accumulation of glycosphingolipids accounts for the associated clinical
      abnormalities of skin, eye, kidney, heart, brain, and peripheral nervous system. Fabry
      disease manifesting predominantly in men. Female heterozygotes also present with features of
      Fabry disease. It is suggested that the mean age of hemizygotic men at the onset of
      symptomatic stroke is 29 - 34 years. The mean age of female heterozygotes at the onset of
      symptomatic strokes is 40 - 43 years.In Europe the prevalence of Fabry disease seems to be
      massively underrepresented; actual textbooks describe 1 per 40.000. However, recent data (Lin
      HY, et al., 2009) demonstrate the identification of eight different mutations in the
      alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) gene in 110 027 newborns who were screened by assaying
      the alpha-Gal A activity followed by genetic analysis. Hwu and co-workers (2009) have shown
      in 90,288 male newborns screened for Fabry disease that 73 males had GLA gene mutations.
      Surprisingly, 86% had the c.936+919G>A (also called IVS4+919G>A) splice mutation. In
      contrast, screening 81,689 females detected two heterozygotes. Summarizing, newborn screening
      identified a surprisingly high frequency of Taiwanese males with Fabry disease (approximately
      1 in 1,250), 86% having the IVS4+919G>A mutation previously found in later-onset cardiac
      phenotype patients.The late-onset mutation N215S is discussed to be a so-called cardiac
      variant (Perry Elliott, 2006; Eng et al., 1993, Sachdev et al., 2002). The prevalence of most
      mutations is low, i.e. Fabry disease spontaneously and individually inheriting so-called
      private mutations. However, there are some mutations that occur more frequent. Besides for
      instance R112H, A143T and R227X, also N215S belongs to this group (Dobrovolny et al., ASHG
      Abstract, 2008). The enzyme activity is only moderately affected, but hemizygous patients
      display a clearly decreased activity in leucocytes and fibroblasts.

      In 2005, Young and colleagues (Acta Paediatr Suppl.) concluded that Gb3 is not an ideal
      biomarker using the example of N215S. All heterozygotes were unconspicuous and only 50% of
      the examined hemizygotes had increased levels. However, globotraosylceramid (lyso Gb3) seems
      to reveal all (genetically) found patients with a pathologically elevated level (with a mean
      of 1,17ng/ml (females) and 2,43ng/ml (males) respectively).

      In a case study from 2004 (Meehan et al., American Journal of Kidney Diseases) was shown that
      a hemizygous male 75 years of age had a renal manifestation of mild proteinuria and a mildly
      decreased renal function due to high Gb3 accumulation in podocytes, to a lesser extent in
      tubular endothelial cells. Furthermore, he had mild congestive heart failure, a reduced left
      ventricular ejection fraction, and hypercholesterolemia. Thus, it is obvious that in Fabry
      patients with the N215S mutation disease progression can be mono- to oligosymptomatic, but
      show a tendency for the cardiac and renal phenotype rather than classical manifestation.
