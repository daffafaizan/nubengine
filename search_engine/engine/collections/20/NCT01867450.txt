      research on the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust exposure. Most recently, a 20 year effort
      in collaboration with NIOSH has resulted in a seminal publication showing a dose-response
      relationship between air levels of elemental carbon, a surrogate for diesel exhaust, and risk
      of lung cancer in underground miners (Silverman et al. 2012). This study made a critically
      important contribution to the recent IARC decision to categorize diesel exhaust as a Group I
      carcinogen. Despite years of experimental studies, and small and limited workplace biomarker
      studies, there are still major uncertainties about the mechanism by which diesel exhaust
      causes lung cancer in humans. To address this gap in knowledge, we have identified a diesel
      truck engine testing facility in China, where workers are exposed to very high levels of
      diesel exhaust, which provides what we believe to be the very best opportunity to conduct a
      study to provide new insights into diesel exhaust carcinogenesis. We propose to carry out a
      cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study of 50 highly exposed workers in this facility
      and 50 unexposed comparable controls to study potential mechanisms of action for diesel
      exhaust exposure. These include upper-airway nitro-PAH-DNA adducts; inflammatory effects
      determined by alterations in cytokines and related markers that have been linked
      prospectively to risk of lung cancer; and alterations in gene expression in a wide range of
      potentially relevant pathways.
