        -  Compare the incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxic effects occurring within the first 12 weeks
           of treatment with 2 different schedules of oxaliplatin, bevacizumab (Avastin™),
           leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil or with oxaliplatin, Avastin™, and capecitabine in
           patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the overall response rate, progression-free survival, and time to treatment
           failure in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the composite toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab (Avastin™) IV over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV
           over 2 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil (5-FU) IV
           over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive Avastin™ IV over 30-90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours
           on days 1 and 15 and leucovorin calcium IV over 10 minutes and 5-FU IV over 3 minutes on
           days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive Avastin™ IV over 30-90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours
           on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for at least 2 years, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
