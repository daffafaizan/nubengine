    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating the performance of
      the Cordis SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent as compared to angioplasty only.

      It is anticipated that a total of 150 patients will be entered into the study. Patients will
      be randomized on a 1:1 basis of stent versus angioplasty only.

      150 patients with de novo or restenotic native SFA occlusions (5-22 cm) with reference vessel
      of >= 4.0 to <= 6.0 mm in diameter will be randomized to the SMART™ nitinol self-expanding
      stent or to angioplasty only.

      All patients will be followed for 12 months post-procedure, by telephone contact at 3 and 6
      months, and a 12 month clinical and duplex ultrasound assessment. This study will be
      conducted at up to 12 investigational sites.
