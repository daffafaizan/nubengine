      subjective perception of time and causality.

      To carry out this work, the investigators will rely on an experimental paradigm (derived from
      Michotte's paradigm) which makes it possible to explore the links between temporal sequencing
      and perception of causality, validated in the normal subject. subjective consequences of
      these alterations will be explored using a phenomenological-inspired clinical scale (EAWE
      time-scale items)
