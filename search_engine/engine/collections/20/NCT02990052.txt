      fractures. The incidence of surgically treated patients with distal radius fractures has
      increased many fold from the beginning of this millennium, owing mostly to increased number
      of volar platings. The most striking increase of plate fixations has occurred in older
      patient groups, especially in females. With volar fixed-angle plate, very near-anatomic,
      stable fixation with relatively low complication rate, can be achieved even in osteoporotic
      bone. There are only few randomized, prospective studies comparing results of volar plating
      and conservative treatment, comparing patients aged over 65 years. Quite little is known of
      the results comparing conservative treatment and volar plating in patients aged below 65
      years.

      Main goal of our study was to compare the functional and radiological results of conservative
      treatment and volar fixed-angle plating in the management of distal radius fracture in
      patients aged over 50 years an older.
