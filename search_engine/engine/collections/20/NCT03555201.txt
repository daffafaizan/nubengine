      affect this joint, the masticatory muscles and the structures associated with and involved in
      TMJ movements. This dysfunction represents a subclassification of musculoskeletal disorders,
      and presents with different symptoms and signs that include pain in the jaw joint or in the
      tissues that surround it, generalized myofascial pain, crackling or crackling joint noise
      associated with the movement, decrease in joint range, functional limitation, and deviation
      to the opening of the jaw.

      Objective. The main objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a myofascial soft
      tissue treatment versus a control group in people diagnosed with TMD of myofascial origin.

      Material and methods

      Sample. Subjects with dagnosis of TMD according to the diagnostic criteria for the
      investigation of temporomandibular disorders.

      Study design. Randomized clinical trial with 2 groups: Group 1. Manual therapy protocol of
      SOFT TISSUES; Group 2. Regular treatment control.

      Evaluations. Clinical interview with anthropometric data and characteristics of the
      pathology.

      There will be 3 evaluations: at the beginning of the study, at the end of the treatment (at 4
      weeks) and at 8 weeks as part of the follow-up period.

      In addition, it includes the following evaluation instruments:

        -  Visual Analog Scale (EVA)

        -  Algometry of the masseter, temporal and ECOM muscles.

        -  Oral opening range.

        -  Range of cervical joint movement.

        -  Quality of life questionnaire related to oral health OHIP-14.

        -  Quality of life questionnaire SF-36.

        -  Index of clinical dysfunction of Helkimo.

        -  Cervical disability index.
