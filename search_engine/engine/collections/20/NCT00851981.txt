    
      Methods: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty patients with
      stable alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey Score < 32) without cirrhosis who meet entry criteria
      will receive either 400 mg of SAMe (n=15) or placebo (n=15) three times a day for the
      duration of one year. History, physical assessment, various blood tests and a liver biopsy
      will be performed prior to treatment. Patients will have repeat blood tests on subsequent
      follow-up visits every month for the first two months, then every two months thereafter. They
      will also be encouraged to abstain from alcohol during these visits. A post-treatment liver
      biopsy will be obtained at the end of the trial. The primary outcome parameters include serum
      homocysteine, SAMe and TNFalpha levels, and the expression of key hepatic enzymes of the
      methionine cycle and of hepatic SAMe and glutathione levels. Histological progression of
      alcoholic liver disease, clinical and biochemical indices of liver disease, and quality of
      life assessment will also be examined.
