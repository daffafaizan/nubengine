    
      This two-part trial is designed to evaluate the clinical significance of the PRO Onc assay
      when used in patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. The first part of this
      study will determine the incidence of HER overexpression/activation, as determined by the PRO
      Onc assay, in patients previously judged to have HER2-negative breast cancer by FISH
      analysis. Blood specimens will be obtained from patients with HER2-negative breast cancer;
      CTCs will then be isolated and tested for HER2 overexpression/activation using the PRO Onc
      Assay. When clinically indicated, fine needle aspiration biopsy will also be obtained and
      submitted for the PRO Onc Assay. If the incidence of HER2 overexpression/activation, as
      determined by the PRO Onc Assay, is >10%, the study will proceed to Part 2. Part 2 of this
      study will assess the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy in a group of patients with
      HER2-negative breast cancer who are identified as having HER2 overexpression/activation by
      the PRO Onc Assay. Patients will be treated with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab. Patients
      who progress during the first 8 weeks will have HER2-targeted treatment discontinued and will
      be removed from study. After 8 weeks, patients who have stable disease will be allowed to add
      chemotherapy to HER2-targeted therapy. Patients who have an objective response to
      single-agent, HER2-targeted therapy after 8 weeks will continue single-agent therapy.
