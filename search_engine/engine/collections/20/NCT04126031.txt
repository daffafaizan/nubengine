    
      This is a 2-part, Phase 2a, non-randomized, open-label multicenter, multinational study of
      intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam in hospitalized neonates and infants with suspected or
      confirmed bacterial infection. In Part A of the study, patients already receiving intravenous
      antibacterial therapy with another antibiotic will receive a single intravenous dose of
      ceftazidime-avibactam followed by observation for 48 hours and a Late Follow-Up assessment
      4-5 weeks later. In Part B of the study, patients with suspected or confirmed Gram-negative
      bacterial infections requiring intravenous antibacterial therapy will receive multiple doses
      of intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam for up to 14 days. At the discretion of the
      investigator, patients may also receive other antibiotics if the infection is suspected to
      include Gram-positive bacteria, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, or anaerobic
      bacteria. At the discretion of the investigator, patients may be switched to oral therapy or
      outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy with an alternative antibiotic after receiving
      intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam for at least 48 yhours. Clinical outcomes will be assessed
      at the End of Intravenous (EOIV) treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam, the End-of-Therapy
      (EOT), the Test-of-Cure (TOC) at 7-14 days after the last study therapy and at a Late
      Follow-Up (LFU) visit, 28-55 days after the last dose of ceftazidime-avibactam. Safety
      assessments will occur throughout the study. Ceftazidime-avibactam blood levels will be
      assessed during the first 12 hours after the single dose of ceftazidime-avibactam in Part A
      and during 12 hours after at least 3 consecutive doses of ceftazidime-avibactam in Part B.
