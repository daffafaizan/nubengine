      male-like characteristics. Glucocorticoids are a member of a class of drugs called
      corticosteroids, which are used in hormone replacement therapy. In order to counteract the
      effects of 21-OHD CAH, women with the disease are given hormone replacement therapy with
      glucocorticoids beginning at infancy. Glucocorticoids are known to cause bone loss. Despite
      many years of treatment with glucocorticoids, however, young women with 21-OHD CAH seem to be
      protected against bone loss. Researchers believe that the increased androgen levels in these
      women leads to increased estrogen levels, which in turn increases OPG production. The
      increase in OPG levels may protect women against bone loss. This study will evaluate bone
      density and OPG levels in women with and without 21-OHD CAH to determine the relationship
      between OPG and bone loss.

      Participants in this observational study will attend only one study visit. At this visit,
      they will undergo a blood draw; a scan of their lower spine, hip, and forearm; height and
      weight measurements; and a body fat analysis test. This last test will entail a weak and
      painless electrical signal being sent from foot to foot. Participants will not attend any
      follow-up visits for this study.
