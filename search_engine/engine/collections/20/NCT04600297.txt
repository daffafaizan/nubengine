      after three year. The project includes 3-unit posterior fixed dental prosthesis (FDP) for 70
      cases.

      Patients participating in the investigation are going to be informed by the "Clinicians" on
      the background and risk of the investigation. Patients have to give their written consent to
      participate in the investigation.

      The treatment procedure includes the following steps:

      Preparation scanning, colour determination, design of the restoration, printing the
      restoration, adjusting occlusion, finishing and polishing and cementation of the FDP.

      The control procedures:

      Two weeks after cementation, baseline control will be performed according to USPHS and FDI 2.
      The restorations will be evaluated at 3 years recall.
