      performance of activities of daily living (ADL) such as tying shoe laces, hand-writing, using
      remote controls, smartphone or tablet. These difficulties further add to the burden of the
      disease, leading to reduced quality of life (QoL). A relatively new, but rapidly growing
      aspect of training in PD neurorehabilitation is exergaming. To enhance training effects a
      combination of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with exergaming will be
      tested.
