      chest syndrome. ACS is a common cause of morbidity in SCD patients and is the most common
      cause of death in SCD. Multiple factors are involved in the severity of acute pulmonary
      injury in SCD. Nitric oxide has a multitude of related functions, many of which could impact
      favorably on ACS in SCD. Nitric oxide is an important inflammatory mediator which is produced
      by the conversion of L-arginine to citrulline by nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide and its
      precursor, arginine, are known to be low in SCD patients with ACS, suggesting that therapies,
      such as arginine, aimed at increasing nitric oxide production will improve the clinical
      course of ACS. Patients will receive 1 of 3 doses of arginine hydrochloride orally 3 times a
      day for 3 days while hospitalized. The efficacy of arginine will be measured by the increase
      in nitric oxide production and the physiological effects will be assessed.
