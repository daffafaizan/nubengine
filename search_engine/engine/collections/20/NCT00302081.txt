    
      This is a randomized, open-label, multinational study designed to evaluate the "standard"
      regimen, PegIntron 1.5 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly plus ribavirin 800-1200 mg daily [Arm
      PEG2b 1.5/R (24 weeks)], compared to a lower dose regimen, PegIntron 1.0 µg/kg subcutaneously
      once weekly plus ribavirin 800-1200 mg daily [Arm PEG2b 1.0/R (24 weeks)], using a 24 week
      treatment duration for both arms. Additionally, the study examined the efficacy of reduced
      treatment duration: PegIntron 1.5 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly plus ribavirin 800-1200 mg
      for 16 weeks [Arm PEG2b 1.5/R (16 weeks)].
