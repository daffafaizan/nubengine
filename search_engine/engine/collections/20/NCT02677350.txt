    
      Twenty (20) subjects will be treated with 20 million (2 x 10^7) allogeneic MSC's total
      divided into 10 injections of 2 million cells/cm of tract in 0.5 ml volume (for total volume
      of 5 ml per visit) at 4 week intervals for a maximum of 4 treatment sessions based on the
      discretion of the endoscopist at the time of injection..

      For patients with more than 6 fistula tracts, the largest of the tracts will be injected.

      The first four (4) subjects that receive their initial injections will not be treated less
      than 5 days apart. As stated in the above response, these first four (4) patients will have
      an initial safety follow up period of one month prior to proceeding with the treatment of
      further patients.

      Follow up: Clinical (CDAI, PDAI, and perianal examination +/- under anesthesia), and
      endoscopic ultrasound will be performed at the time of each treatment. MRI evaluation will be
      performed at screening, 4 weeks after the fourth treatment (week 16) and at 16 months, if
      fistula closure has not been achieved. Clinical evaluation will be performed at months 1, 3,
      6, 12. Endoscopic ultrasound and MRI will also be performed as needed for symptomatic
      patients if an abscess is suspected.

      Duration of Study participation: 17 Months (Follow-up visits will be at 4, 7, 10 and 16
      Months post treatment.

      The Allo-hMSCs will be supplied from an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source
      manufactured by the University of Miami.
