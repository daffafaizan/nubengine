      with recurrent or advanced carcinoma of the cervix. II. Determine the response rate,
      progression free interval, and duration of survival of these patients when treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin-1 IV over 1 hour and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-3 years.
