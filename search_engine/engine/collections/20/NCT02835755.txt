      I. Pilot test a mobile health (mHealth) HPV vaccine intervention for young gay and bisexual
      men to establish feasibility and acceptability.

      II. Obtain preliminary efficacy data on whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention
      increases HPV vaccine initiation compared to the control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention affects secondary outcomes compared
      to the control group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CONTROL): Patients receive standard information about HPV and HPV vaccine, such as
      the vaccine information statement (VIS), on a mobile-friendly website study portal.

      GROUP II (INTERVENTION): Patients receive the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention consisting of
      content about HPV and HPV vaccine on the study portal for 15 minutes and vaccination
      reminders sent by the portal via text or e-mail.

      All patients complete a survey on the study portal at baseline, immediately after the mHealth
      intervention or control materials, and at 3 months and 7 months thereafter for about 10-15
      minutes each.
