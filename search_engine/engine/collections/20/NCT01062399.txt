      Primary

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus (up to an established dose of 10
           mg/day) when combined with concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide in patients with
           newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the efficacy of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and
           temozolomide followed by adjuvant everolimus in combination with temozolomide, as
           measured by progression-free survival, in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the safety profile of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and
           temozolomide in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the overall survival of these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To further evaluate the safety profile of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy
           and temozolomide in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To determine if activation of the Akt/mTOR axis predicts response to everolimus. (Phase
           II)

        -  To determine if there is an association between tumor MGMT gene methylation status and
           response to everolimus. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a
      phase II, randomized study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
