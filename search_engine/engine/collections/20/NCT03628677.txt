      tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity of AB154 as monotherapy and in combination with
      zimberelimab in participants with advanced solid malignancies. In this dose escalation study,
      participants will receive AB154 administered intravenously as monotherapy or in combination
      with zimberelimab. Treatment will continue until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, or other reasons for study drug discontinuation occurs.
