      a non-helmeted sport such as soccer. Athletes participating in this study will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: 1) Device wearing during the season or 2) Non-device wearing
      during the season. This study will focus on the use and effectiveness of the device solely in
      females, as male football and hockey players have previously been investigated. All
      participants will be outfitted with an adhesive patch-like accelerometer (which will be
      placed behind the ear (Xpatch-X2 Biosystems http://www.x2biosystems.com/x2_x_patch/) which
      will measure the magnitude of every impact to the head sustained by the athlete.
      Effectiveness of the device will be determined via differences in longitudinal brain imaging
      and functional testing following competitive soccer participation. A subset of athletes who
      report a diagnosed concussion will also receive additional brain neuroanatomical and
      neurophysiological testing within a week following the diagnosed concussive event. At each of
      these time points participants will also undergo various neurocognitive assessments
