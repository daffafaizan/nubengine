      captures data on patient demographics, aPL-related clinical and laboratory characteristics,
      and medications. The inclusion criteria are: a) age between 18 and 60 years; and b)
      persistent (at least 12 weeks apart) aPL-positivity within 12 months prior to screening;
      positivity is defined as anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) IgG/M/A (> 40 GPL/MPL/APL,
      medium-to-high titer, and/or greater than the 99th percentile), anti-β2-glycoprotein-I
      (aβ2GPI) IgG/M/A (> 40 units, medium-to-high titer), positive lupus anticoagulant (LA) test
      based on International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and other current guidelines.
      Patients are followed every 12 ± 3 months with clinical data and blood collection. Blood
      drawn is done at inclusion and every year.
