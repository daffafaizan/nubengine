      of the penis upon sexual stimulation. It occurs in association with aging, chronic illnesses
      and various modifiable risk factors. Amongst the modifiable risk factors, ED shares the most
      common risk factors with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) which are smoking, hypertension and
      hyperlipidemia1. Even though it is not a part of normal aging, it is seen in 52% men in the
      age group 40 to 70 years, with a higher rate in the men more than 70 years.

      MoreNova is a Linear Shockwave (LISW) device, which incorporates a shockwave transducer
      operable to deliver shockwaves to a treatment region confined to a narrow rectangle.
      Shockwaves generation follows the electromagnetic principle.

      Linear Shockwaves (LISW), as a treatment for ED has been in evaluation in contemporary
      medicine (see section 1.4). It has been in use for the last five years.

      The present study will utilize a device called "MoreNova", in which shockwaves are focused
      onto line segments for improved organ coverage. Shockwaves produced by "MoreNova" are aimed
      at the left and right corpora cavernosa and the crura. The study is aimed at determining the
      safety and effectiveness of this new type of LISW in the treatment of ED.
