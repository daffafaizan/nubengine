      co-infections that affect HIV clinical outcomes, and remain a risk for individuals using
      PrEP. Self-testing methods address barriers to clinic-based testing by offering convenience
      and privacy and have been shown to be well accepted by MSM. Therefore, use of self-testing is
      a potential approach through which to improve HIV and STI testing rates in MSM.
      Internet-based distribution (herein: web-based) of STI self-test kits enables an individual
      to request sampling kits via a website, mail biological specimens (e.g. urethral swabs) to a
      laboratory for testing, and view test results through a web-based account. Web-based self-HIV
      oral testing enables an individual to request a test kit, collect an oral specimen, and
      receive results within 20 minutes. Despite these potential benefits and reports of
      willingness to use free self-testing, uptake has been low due to barriers such as concerns
      about accuracy of the tests, apprehension to collect specimens, low risk perception, and the
      desire for counseling. In the proposed study, investigators will pilot test an intervention
      that address these barriers by training BMSM with information about the accuracy of the HIV
      rapid oral test kit, demonstrating how to properly collect specimens for HIV and STIs
      (gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis) self-testing, and providing resources for linkage to HIV
      and STI treatment and PrEP services. Study participants will utilize a secure website to
      request test kits.
