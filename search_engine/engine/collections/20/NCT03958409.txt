      kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) to being to identify risk factors for post-kidney
      transplant mineral bone disease (PKT-MBD); and to evaluate whether treatment of abnormalities
      in these parameters will improve skeletal health as quantified by bone mineral density (BMD),
      bone turnover markers (rate of skeletal remodeling) and Osteoprobe (a direct index of bone
      quality using reference point indentation technology.

      Participants in the rigorous evaluation arm will be followed with a) Mineral metabolism:
      blood calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH) vitamin D; b) Bone turnover
      markers: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen
      (CTx), and N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP); c)Bone Mineral Density using a
      Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry which is the standard method by which bone mass is measured
      clinically.

      NOTE: The use of the Osteoprobe was discontinued on 9/5/19 due to safety concerns from the
      FDA about the device in other trials/other sites.

      The Control Cohort is essentially an historical control group who will have received standard
      of care for the 18 months ending just prior to the enrollment of our Intervention Cohort. A
      coincident Control Cohort will not be used because knowledge of the additional data to be
      collected in the Control Cohort will undoubtedly influence their care by their attending
      nephrologists and surgeons.
