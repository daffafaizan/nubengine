    
      The study will consist of a Screening period, a Check-in day, an on-site
      Randomization/Treatment day, a 2-day on-site Follow-up period (Days 2 through 3), a Follow-up
      visit (Day 7), and a Final Follow-up visit (Day 35±3). If needed and at the discretion of the
      Investigator, a subject may remain in the study facility beyond the scheduled Day 3 discharge
      to accommodate Day 7 and Day 35±3 follow-up visits. Seven days prior to enrollment, subjects
      will be administered ASA 81 mg orally once daily (QD) until the final dose on Day 1.
      Beginning in the morning on Day -2, a single dose of oral ticagrelor 180 mg will be given,
      followed by oral ticagrelor 90 mg every 12 hours for 4 additional doses through to Day 1 (2
      hours before study drug is initiated; this will be 5 total doses of ticagrelor).

      On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be randomized with 3:1 allocation ratio (active:placebo), to receive an IV dose of
      PB2452 or placebo 2 hours following the 5th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from
      the clinical site on Day 3 and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7, if already
      discharged, and on Day 35 (±3 days). A subject may remain in the study facility beyond the
      scheduled Day 3 discharge to accommodate Day 7 and Day 35±3 follow-up visits.

      If a subject is taking a moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitor, a 36 g alternative regimen of
      PB2452 will be administered consisting of 12 g infused over 10 minutes followed by a 12 g
      loading dose infused over 6 hours, then a maintenance dose of 12 g infused over the next 18
      hours immediately following completion of the loading period for a total infusion time of
      approximately 24 hours.
