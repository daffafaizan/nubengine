      participants of Japanese Descent. Cohort B consists of 12 non-Hispanic, Caucasian
      participants.

      For Japanese participants there will be three treatment periods. In Treatment Period 1, they
      will receive maribavir as a single 400 mg oral dose. In Treatment Periods 2 and 3, all
      Japanese participants will receive maribavir as a single oral dose of either 200 mg or 800
      mg, depending upon randomization assignment. For the non-Hispanic, Caucasian group there will
      be only one treatment period and they will receive maribavir as a single 400 mg oral dose.
