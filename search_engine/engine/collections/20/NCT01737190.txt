      maneuver. In the first group a recruitment maneuver will be performed in patients who are
      ventilated with PEEP level set according to the ARDS network algorithm.

      Patients will then be crossed over to a study arm where another recruitment maneuver will be
      performed while PEEP is adjusted according to esophageal pressure measurements.
