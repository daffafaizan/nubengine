      mg/day, will be effective in treating the OCD of adult patients who have not responded to
      their OCD medication. Memantine is not FDA approved for OCD, but is approved for the
      treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Memantine appears to work by regulating the activity of
      glutamate, one of the brain's specialized messenger chemicals, which may play a role in OCD.
      All patients in the study will receive memantine; no one will receive placebo.
