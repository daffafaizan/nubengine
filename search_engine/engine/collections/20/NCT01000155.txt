      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), when
           administered orally, in a pulsed fashion, once-a-day for 3 consecutive days every week,
           in inducing a 4% absolute increase or a 100% increase in fetal hemoglobin percent levels
           (HbF%) in subjects with severe sickle cell disease who have failed prior therapy.

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of vorinostat on F-cell levels.

        -  To determine the changes in y-globin, B-globin and E-globin RNA levels during treatment
           with vorinostat.

        -  To describe the dose-response characteristics of vorinostat in inducing fetal hemoglobin
           in sickle cell disease.

      Exploratory

        -  To determine the extent and duration of global histone acetylation with intermittent
           vorinostat dosing.

        -  To correlate the status of polymorphisms near the BCL11A, c-myb, and HBB gene loci, all
           of which are associated with levels of fetal hemoglobin, to assess for an association of
           polymorphism status with therapeutic response to vorinostat.

        -  To evaluate red blood cell rheology before and after treatment with vorinostat.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This was a single stage design to evaluate induction of HbF on treatment with target
      enrollment of 15 patients. A 25% success rate was considered evidence of activity in this
      patient population while 5% success rate deemed ineffective. If at least 3 patients achieved
      success, the treatment would be considered promising. With 15 eligible patients, the
      probability of observing this was 0.76 assuming a true rate of 25% and 0.04 assuming a true
      rate of 5%.
