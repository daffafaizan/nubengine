      plasma concentrations of anastrozole will be measured in 12 premenopausal women. Participants
      will be stratified in a 50:50 manner in two BMI (Body Mass Index) groups, <25 and 25 kg/m2,
      respectively. There will be a lead group of two participants in whom the serum/plasma
      concentrations will be examined after the first four weeks, to determine whether the sampling
      schedule adequately describes the serum/plasma concentration-time profiles or should be
      adjusted.
