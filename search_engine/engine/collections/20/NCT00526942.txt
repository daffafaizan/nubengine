      Typically, cognitive decline is characterized by a slow, progressive decline in abilities
      (frequently in memory, attention, inhibition and speed of processing) relative to younger
      adults, commonly called normal aging, age-associated memory impairment, age-consistent memory
      impairment, benign senescent forgetfulness, late-life forgetfulness, ageing-associated
      cognitive decline, and the preferred term, age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) As virtually
      all adults experience a reduction in their cognitive abilities with age, ARCD has generally
      been considered to be a normal, inevitable, and irreversible part of aging; and the extremely
      severe forms of pathological cognitive decline (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, AD) have dominated
      therapeutic research in this area. However, ARCD represents an important cause of quality of
      life decline in almost every older adult, as the impact of forgetfulness and mental slowing
      increasingly change the abilities of individuals to successfully manage their day-to-day
      activities. Therapeutic approaches targeting the specific problems of ARCD in normal aging
      (as opposed to the pathological problems of AD) would unto themselves represent important
      clinical advances.

      This trial investigates the effects of a computer-based visual training exercise built on the
      principles of positive brain plasticity and designed for use by healthy mature individuals.
      The program is specifically designed to improve the fidelity of sensory representations in
      early visual cortex.
