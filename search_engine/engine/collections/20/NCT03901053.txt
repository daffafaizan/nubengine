    
      In this research study, adult participants who have sustained a below-the-knee traumatic
      injury greater than two years ago and are still experiencing deficits including weakness
      and/or immobility will be assigned to one of two brace sequences (AB or BA). Participants
      will be randomized to a particular sequence, with an equal chance of getting either order.
      Participants will be evaluated under 4 conditions: no device, standard of care, and 2 carbon
      fiber custom dynamic orthoses (CDO), the Reaktiv device from FabTech Systems and the
      PhatBrace by Bio-Mechanical Composites Inc. Participants will be tested with no device and
      standard of care at baseline, after 3 months of accommodation to the Reaktiv, and 3 months of
      accommodation to the PhatBrace. A series of study measures will be performed. The physical
      performance measures will incorporate tests of agility, balance, speed and lower limb power.
      Questionnaires will be used to evaluate participant's perceived comfort and smoothness, pain,
      preference, and semi-structured interviews will be used to fully capture the perspective of
      the participant. A motion capture system will be used to evaluate walking mechanics, allowing
      comparisons between conditions. Lower limb forces and body motion will be assessed using
      computerized motion capture and force plates in the floor, as individuals walk over-ground.
      Small reflective markers placed on the participant's skin and force measuring plates in the
      floor will be used. The investigators will also complete mechanical testing of the devices
      and collect demographic and descriptive data.
