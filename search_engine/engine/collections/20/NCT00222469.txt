        -  A phase II single arm study. All patients receive bevacizumab 10mg/kg and gemcitabine
           1000mg/m2 on day 1 followed by oxaliplatin 100mg/m2 on day 2 of a 14 day cycle.

      Purpose:

        -  The purpose of this study is to find out if giving patients bevacizumab, along with the
           chemotherapy drugs oxaliplatin and gemcitabine, will improve overall survival. In
           addition, the study will find out what side effects patients may have by taking
           bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and gemcitabine together.

      Enrollment:

        -  Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled to the study between the University of
           Oklahoma and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

      Duration:

        -  The study will be conducted over approximately 2 years.
