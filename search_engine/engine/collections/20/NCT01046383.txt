      by Immunotec Inc during the last 3 years. The study revealed that the cysteine-rich whey
      protein isolate formulation IMN 1207 caused a significant reversal of weight loss (P <0.05)
      and a conspicuous increase in survival. The outcome of the first IMN 1207 study has been
      published in (Tozer RG, et al. Cysteine-Rich Protein Reverses Weight Loss in Lung Cancer
      Patients Receiving Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2008 Feb;
      10(2):395-402). PMID:18158761.

      The purpose of this IMN 1207 follow-up study is to confirm the effect of a cysteine-rich
      non-denatured whey protein isolate formulation IMN1207 (20g daily) versus casein (20 g daily)
      on the reversal of weight loss (cancer-related wasting) over a 40 week treatment period in
      non-small cell lung cancer subjects with or without conventional therapy, i.e., chemotherapy
      or radiation. In addition, it is prospectively designed to test the hypothesis that, IMN1207
      versus casein over a period of 66 weeks observation period which includes a 6 months
      follow-up period, increases the survival of these subjects. Also, the effect of IMN1207 on
      the quality of life in a defined subgroup of subjects will be determined.
