      age. Basic experimental and observational data demonstrate that aging magnifies the
      pathologic and clinical consequences of established risk factors and is the most potent
      individual risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis and for adverse outcomes following an
      ischemic event. These findings suggest that normal aging alters the vascular substrate so as
      to promote the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The age-associated changes in
      vascular structure and function include an increase in central vascular stiffness, intimal
      proliferation, and endothelial dysfunction. The major hypothesis is that the above
      alterations in vascular substrate (i.e. vascular age) are an important determinant of the age
      associated increased likelihood for the development and progression of coronary
      atherosclerotic disease.

      This protocol will non-invasively characterize vascular age and atherosclerotic burden in
      BLSA participants and individuals with successful aging, i.e. those with no or minimal
      evidence of coronary atherosclerotic disease, and those with premature, clinically evident
      coronary artery disease. It will repeat measures of vascular age and atherosclerotic burden
      three years after the first assessment. By examining the impact of vascular age on the
      initial extent and the progression of atherosclerotic burden over a two to three-year period,
      it will test the hypothesis that vascular age is an important determinant of the
      age-associated increase in atherosclerotic disease.
