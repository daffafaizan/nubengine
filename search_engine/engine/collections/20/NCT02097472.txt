      unencapsulated pneumococcal cells. S. pneumoniae whole cell antigen bulk was manufactured at
      Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from strain RM200 RX1E PdT ΔlytA and is inactivated
      with beta-propiolactone. Pneumolysin, a proven virulence factor, was genetically knocked out
      in SPWCV and replaced with pneumolysoid, a derivative carrying the toxin gene with 3 point
      mutations known to abolish both cytolytic activity and complement activation. When adsorbed
      to aluminum hydroxide (alum), SPWCV is utilized as the vaccine candidate Streptococcus
      pneumoniae whole cell vaccine with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (PATH-wSP) for clinical
      investigation. PATH-wSP has been previously tested in adults in a Phase 1 trial in the US, in
      which doses of 100 to 600 μg were given to healthy young adults in a 3-vaccination series and
      showed a favorable safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profile.

      This study was a dose escalation and age de-escalation study, and sequential cohorts of
      subjects were identified to allow safety evaluations of dosing and ages to occur
      progressively during the study. The following PATH-wSP cohorts were defined for adult and
      toddler subjects:

        -  Adult Cohort 1: 600 μg PATH-wSP or saline

        -  Adult Cohort 2: 1000 μg PATH-wSP or saline

        -  Toddler Cohort 1: 300 μg PATH-wSP and/or active control vaccines

        -  Toddler Cohort 2: 600 μg PATH-wSP and/or active control vaccines.
