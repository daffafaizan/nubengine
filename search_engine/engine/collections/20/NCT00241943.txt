      culturally-specific tools have been developed to improve outcomes in this population. We
      hypothesize that measurable improvements in HCV testing rates, hepatitis A and B vaccination
      rates, and knowledge, attitudes, and motivations toward behavior change may be elicited by
      such a curriculum.

      In this study, we will investigate the impact of a short HCV education video on active drug
      injectors at a syringe exchange program. Subjects will be enrolled in one of two cohorts: a
      usual-care cohort, which will receive the program's standard HCV counseling; vs an
      intervention cohort, which will view the education video. Subjects will undergo written
      testing for knowledge, attitudes about transmission behaviors, and motivations toward
      behavior change before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, 4 weeks after
      the intervention, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Additionally, we will measure and
      compare the rates of HCV testing and HAV/HBV vaccinations before and at the end of the 12
      week time point in both cohorts.
