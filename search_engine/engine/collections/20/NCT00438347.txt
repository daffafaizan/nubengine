      brain structure and function. Such effects are of great interest both for what may they tell
      us about the nature of cognitive and brain aging and also for their public health
      implications. This study will test the hypotheses that: 1) improvements in aerobic fitness of
      older adults will lead to improved performance on a variety of cognitive processes, and
      especially those processes that are supported by frontal regions of the brain; 2)
      improvements in cognitive processes due to enhanced aerobic fitness will be visible on fMRI
      scans, and will be similar to those of young adults; 3) improvements in aerobic fitness, over
      the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in increases in gray and white matter
      volume.

      One hundred forty sedentary older adults will be recruited for this study. Participants will
      be randomized to an aerobic exercise intervention group, or to a stretching and toning
      control group. Aerobic exercise sessions will be conducted three times a week for one year,
      beginning at a light to moderate intensity level over the first two months and progressing to
      a moderate to high level for the remainder of the year. The control group will meet on the
      same basis as the intervention group, and will participate in an organized program of
      stretching, limbering, and toning for the whole body that is specially designed for
      individuals 60 years of age and older.

      During this time, participants will exercise, keep a daily exercise log detailing distance
      walked (routes will be measured and mapped for participants), time spent in aerobic activity,
      degree of intensity (rating of perceived exertion), general level of affect during exercise,
      resting and exercise heart rates. Participants will participate in the MRI/fMRI,
      physiological (cardiorespiratory) and psychosocial testing prior to the beginning of the
      fitness training intervention, following 6 months of fitness training, and at the conclusion
      of the 1 year of fitness training.
