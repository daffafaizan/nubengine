      limitation and air trapping in never-smoking SHS-exposed individuals with preserved ratio
      impaired spirometry (PRISm) causes reduced exercise capacity . This in turn will adversely
      affect their symptoms and quality of life. Furthermore, we hypothesize that exercise
      capacity, symptoms, and quality of life will improve with the use of inhaled bronchodilators.

      We proposed to investigate the above hypotheses through the following specific aims:

      Aim 1- Determine whether airflow limitation in never-smoking SHS-exposed individuals with
      airflow limitation or air trapping is associated with reduced exercise capacity and adverse
      health and health-related quality of life (HRQL). We propose to measure (1) maximum level of
      exercise (watts) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2) in the laboratory setting, (2) level of
      physical activity during the subjects' routine daily life using an activity monitor, and (3)
      measure HRQL using survey tools. We propose to then explore associations between these
      measures and indices of air trapping at rest (RV/TLC) and progressive airflow limitation with
      exercise (end expiratory lung volume (EELV)and dynamic hyperinflation (DH)).

      Aim 2: Determine whether relief of airflow limitation using bronchodilators could improve
      exercise capacity in never-smoking SHS-exposed individuals with airflow limitation or air
      trapping in a double blind crossover placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. We propose
      to examine the effect of bronchodilators on airflow limitation and air trapping and their
      effects in turn on exercise capacity, daily level of physical activity, and HRQL to show a
      cause-and-effect relationship. In this way, we plan to explore the utility of bronchodilators
      as a treatment option for the observed reduced exercise capacity.
