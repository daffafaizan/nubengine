      in the intestine. It usually refers to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are
      idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases. While it had been known to be a common disease in the
      western world, in recent decades the incidence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease has
      rapidly increased in Korea as well. Endoscopic examination is a gold standard in order to
      determine the activity of inflammatory bowel disease, but it is hardly performed due to the
      cost and time of a test. Therefore, it is necessary to find a blood-based biomarker that
      replaces endoscopy. The objective of the study is to identify a new inflammatory marker that
      replaces endoscopy by comparing blood samples of patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      with those of general controls.
