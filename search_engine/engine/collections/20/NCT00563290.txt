      I. Determine the objective response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
      with unresectable or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or RAI stage 0-I chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia receiving dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients receiving this drug. II. Evaluate
      tumor for presence of total EphA2 and both total and active Src and FAK by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) pre-treatment with dasatinib.

      III. Evaluate tumor for presence of cyclooxygenase-2 by IHC pre-treatment with dasatinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive 100 mg dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

      ARM II (PATIENTS ENROLLED AFTER 11/18/08): Patients receive 70 mg dasatinib PO BID on days
      1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Pre-therapy tumor biopsy specimens are collected to detect total and phosphorylated Src and
      FAK, total EphA2, and cyclooxygenase-2 by immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for up to 12 weeks.
