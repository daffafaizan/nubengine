      (BPA) have been shown to affect intelligence and behavior in school-age children, as well as
      to disrupt growth and some endocrine functions. Items used in the care of infants in the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) contain phthalates and BPA. Babies admitted for long
      periods of time to the NICU, could be exposed to high levels of these potentially harmful
      plastics. In this study, the investigators are interested in documenting duration and sources
      of exposure to plasticizers during the NICU admission of infants born weighing less than 1500
      grams. The investigators will examine the association between NICU exposure to plasticizers
      and performance on a neurological screening test that predicts future behavior, growth after
      birth, and the presence of any thyroid dysfunction.

      The investigators plan to enroll 50 neonates in our study. The investigators will catalog all
      exposure to plasticizers during the infant's NICU admission and assign each baby a risk level
      of exposure. The investigators will then test each infant's performance on a neurological
      screening tool, measure growth from birth and assess whether or not each infant has thyroid
      dysfunction and correlate each outcome with exposure risk level. The investigators will also
      collect urine samples from each baby to store for possible future analysis.

      The investigators hypothesize that neonates with higher levels of exposure will demonstrate
      worse performance on the neurological screening tool, poor growth, and abnormal thyroid
      function.
