    
      This is a Phase I, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled eye drops administration
      study of rh-NGF in healthy male and female subjects.

      This study consists of a single ascending dose part (part 0 one drop single application).
      Then single ascending dose part (part A; one drop three times a day) and a multiple ascending
      dose part (part B; one drop three times a day for five days). All parts of the study will
      consist of 3 ascending dose levels.

      In order to support the dose escalation MAD phase from Covance, Basel to Covance, Leeds, an
      additional cohort (0M) will be conducted at Covance, Leeds at the same dose level as cohort
      1M to ensure a degree of consistency between the two sites, i.e. that no dose escalation
      stopping criteria were met at either site.

      In Part 0, each ascending dose cohort will include 3 subjects treated with one dose of
      rh-NGF.

      In part A, each ascending dose cohort will include 6 subjects treated with rh-NGF and 2 with
      placebo.

      In part B, each ascending dose cohort will include 9 subjects treated with rh-NGF drug and 3
      with placebo, in addition to cohort 0M, which will include 3 subjects treated with rh-NGF and
      1 with placebo
