    
      Aim 1. To adapt an existing group therapy (CBT for depression), creating a manualized
      treatment and accompanying implementation measures and tools for use with clients with
      persistent depressive symptoms and AOD disorders and to obtain preliminary assessments of the
      treatment from patient and provider perspectives.

      Aim 2. To conduct a pilot test of the revised treatment in which we (a) demonstrate that when
      the therapy is implemented with fidelity, clinically significant reductions in depressive
      symptoms and AOD use occur; (b) estimate the likely effect size; and (c) investigate the
      underlying mechanisms of change, including both cognitive-behavioral and group processes and
      their relationship to depression and AOD treatment outcomes.
