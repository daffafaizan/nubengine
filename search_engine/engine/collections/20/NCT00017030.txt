      partial and complete response, stable disease, or minor response of more than 3 months
      duration, in patients with previously treated, unresectable advanced or metastatic soft
      tissue sarcoma treated with ecteinascidin 743. II. Determine the progression-free survival,
      overall survival, and response duration in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine
      the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number of prior
      cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease (1-2 vs more than 2). Patients receive ecteinascidin
      743 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-76 patients (18-38 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 13 months.
