      surgery. Many orthopaedic procedures result in fluid build-up around the surgical site which
      results in pain and decreased healing. Glucocorticoids are drugs that block the inflammatory
      process which can decrease this pain and fluid build-up. Furthermore, glucocorticoids are
      safe if given in low doses and for a short period of time. To help address this gap, the
      study intend to give patients glucocorticoids after various upper extremity orthopedic
      procedures; total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty
      for osteoarthritis of the knee, assessing their pain and range of motion post-operatively.
      The study hypothesize that glucocorticoids will result in less inflammation around the
      surgical site, leading to pain relief, greater healing ability, and improvements in range of
      motion of the injured joint.

      The study aims to enroll 1000 subjects that are assigned randomly to one of two treatment
      arms: (1) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone (control group), IV
      dexamethasone is standard of care) or (2) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous
      dexamethasone followed with a 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper course (active group).
      Subjects will be followed up in clinic 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively that is a standard
      of care for upper extremity fractures, shoulder arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty for
      osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the knee
