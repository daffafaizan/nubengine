      and years following a total hip replacement (THR) or hip resurfacing procedure. However, many
      express dissatisfaction with their ability to perform daily activities, a reduced walking
      ability and long-term lower extremity muscle weakness. Given the general lack of knowledge
      surrounding joint motion of the lower extremities in the THR population, there is a need to
      characterize the joint mechanics of people having undergone THR, so that interventions and
      rehabilitation strategies can be designed to reduce post-operative complications and improve
      mobility.
