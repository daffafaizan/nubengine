      source of daily carbohydrates. White bread is the one for which the most rapid decline has
      occurred, probably due to a popular belief that bread provokes weight gain, but more studies
      are needed to clarify the relationship between bread consumption and ponderal status in
      Spanish population.

      A growing body of evidence supports a beneficial role for low-glycaemic index (GI) and
      glycaemic load (GL) diets in the prevention of life style-related diseases such as type-2
      diabetes. Likewise, GI s widely used in the selection of foods suitable for glycaemic
      control, since low to moderate GI diets have been proposed for the prevention of type 2
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease and age-related eye diseases. On the contrary, related to
      obesity, no associations between BMI, GI and GL have been reported in a Mediterranean
      population. Thus, investigations focuses on the implication of glycaemic response of
      different breads are of important application.

      Many factors such as manufacturing bread conditions, starch structure, bread particle size
      and inclusion of different types of ingredients like whole-grains may influence glycaemic
      response and therefore may contribute to modify GI, GL and InI of breads. Comparing different
      French breads, GI value varied between 57 for the traditional baguette and 85 for the
      wholemeal loaf, while the traditional baguette exerted a significantly lowest postprandial
      insulin response and the lowest InI. However, to our best knowledge, neither the influence of
      different types of Spanish breads on GI, GL and InI nor the effects on appetite ratings and
      on the postprandial gastrointestinal hormone responses have been investigated.
