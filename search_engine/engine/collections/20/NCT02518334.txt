      is mediated by ethanol. Subjects will have type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and be sedentary
      and obese (BMI >30). Subjects' glycemic control will be assessed by an oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) at three different time points. One OGTT will occur shortly after consumption of
      red wine, the second after consumption of vodka containing the identical amount of ethanol as
      the wine treatment, and the third OGTT will occur shortly after consumption of an equal
      volume of water. The three OGTTs will be administered in random order.
