      developing different grades and types of abnormalities, among them delayed motor development,
      co-ordination difficulties and cerebral palsy. The prevalence of serious developmental
      abnormalities increases the lower the gestational age and birth weight. The reported
      incidence of mild developmental abnormalities is 15-20 % in children with a gestational age
      <28 weeks or with a birth weight under 1000 g, 10-20 % in children with a gestational age of
      28-31 weeks or a birth weight between 1000-1500 g and only 5 % in children born at term. The
      incidence of cerebral palsy is 10-20% amongst children in the first group, 5-10% in the
      second group and only 0,1 % in children born at term.With such a high risk of developing
      motor abnormalities for infants born preterm together with limited evidence-based knowledge
      of early physiotherapy approaches that facilitate motor development, it is essential that
      more research is done in this area to ensure that physiotherapy if used, is in the right
      manner to prevent and reduce such difficulties.
