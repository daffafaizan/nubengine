      completion rate is governed in part by patient comfort, which is enhanced by adequate
      sedation. In addition, comfort following colonoscopy determines timely recovery from the
      procedure and return to usual activities.

      Colonoscopy and sedation are frequently accompanied by hypotension (systolic blood pressure
      less than 100 mm Hg), which reduces the amount of sedation able to be employed. Where
      apparent, blood pressure is restored by infusion of intravenous normal saline. We have
      observed that hypotension is relatively common and may be present at or shortly after the
      commencement of the procedure, suggesting that many patients undergoing colonoscopy have
      reduced blood volume. Therefore, prophylactic infusion of normal saline may enhance
      colonoscopy completion rate, and patient comfort during colonoscopy and during recovery from
      colonoscopy.

      We propose randomising consenting adult patients attending outpatient colonoscopy to one of
      two treatment arms:

      (i) A control arm, with standard sedation and monitoring during colonoscopy, and infusion of
      normal saline if systolic BP â‰¤ 95 mmHg for more than 3 minutes (two observation periods)
      until completion of the procedure;

      (ii) A treatment arm, with pre-hydration with an infusion of 1.0 litre of normal saline
      immediately prior to colonoscopy.

      Outcome measures include colonoscopy completion rates, hypotension during or after
      colonoscopy, and patient ratings of comfort and satisfaction.
