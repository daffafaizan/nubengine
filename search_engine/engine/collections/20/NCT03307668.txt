    
      CaReSR-1S is a sterile, ready for use round implant based on a dense matrix of native
      Collagen type I. It is indicated for the defect filling of focal, full layer and clearly
      defined knee and ankle cartilage defects of longest diameter 1.1-2.2cm. The fixation of
      CaReSR-1S is made for all sizes with fibrin glue, whereas the 11 mm implants also allow a
      press-fit anchoring due to the elasticity of the implant.

      The physical nature of the CaReSR-1S allows the in-growth of healthy chondrocytes, as well as
      progenitor cells from the surrounding healthy tissue.
