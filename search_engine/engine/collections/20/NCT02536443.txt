    
      The Contemporary Modalities In Treatment of Heart Failure Registry (COMMIT-HF) is a
      single-center observational study that is underway in the 3rd Chair and Department of
      Cardiology of Silesian Center for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland. Data collection is
      patient-based (not event-based).

      The main objective of the COMMIT-HF Registry is to clarify the overall clinical
      characteristics of systolic heart failure patients, their demographics and clinical profile,
      current management, in-hospital outcomes and long-term follow-up, with regard to the
      administered treatment.

      The study population is formed by all-comer patients hospitalized in cardiology wards and
      intensive cardiac care units with a diagnosis of systolic heart failure. For the purpose of
      this study heart failure is defined as a set of symptoms resulting from myocardial systolic
      function impairment, confirmed in resting transthoracic echocardiography with left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤35%. Patients with acute coronary syndromes are
      excluded from the analysis.

      Complete patient demographics; medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic and
      therapeutic) and in-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the attending
      physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all cause mortality and major
      adverse events.
