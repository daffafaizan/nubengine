      species (ROS) and antioxidant systems . The eye is constantly exposed to solar UV radiation
      which is the major inducer of ROS production and therefore oxidative stress has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of several eye disease, including dry eye. Xanthan gum is a
      complex exopolysaccharide utilized as a food additive. Its chemical structure shows a
      capacity to react with ROS indicating a role as an anti-oxidative molecule.

      In the present study aging patients with dry eye will be enrolled. Signs and symptoms of dry
      eye as well as levels of oxidative stress in tear will be evaluated afte 30 days of treatment
      with eye drops containing carboxymethylcellulose or xanthan gum.
