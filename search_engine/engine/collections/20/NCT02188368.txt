      and safety of pomalidomide as a replacement for lenalidomide among MM patients who have
      failed lenalidomide-containing regimens that include more than steroids within 6 months of
      their last dose of lenalidomide. Pomalidomide will replace lenalidomide in a combination
      regimen containing an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide), anthracycline (doxorubicin or
      PLD), proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib or carfilzomib) and/or a glucocorticosteroid
      (prednisone, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone). Pomalidomide will be administered on days
      1-21 of a 28-day cycle, whereas other drugs (anthracyclines, proteasome inhibitors, steroids
      or alkylating agents except melphalan) will be administered using the same schedule(s),
      dose(s) and drug combination as the last lenalidomide-containing regimen that the patient
      received and failed. This study will enroll patients resistant to a lenalidomide-containing
      combination regimen as demonstrated by PD while being treated or that has relapsed within 6
      months of the last dose of lenalidomide in their last lenalidomide-containing combination
      regimen or while on lenalidomide or lenalidomide and steroid maintenance therapy. Forty-five
      patients will be enrolled in the study.

      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3) a
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a
      follow-up period.

      Subjects eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of
      eight 28-day treatment cycles, depending on the schedule of their last
      lenalidomide-containing regimen. Subjects are to be treated to a maximum response (lowest
      level of paraprotein) plus 1 additional cycle, without exceeding a total of 8 cycles, or
      complete 8 cycles of therapy without progressing (PD).
