        2. Rationale: It has been well established that obese pregnant women are at increase risk
           of stillbirth compared to matched non obese controls. This relative risk is increased
           not only with increasing gestational age in obese women but with increasing severity of
           obesity. The increased risk of stillbirth has led some obstetricians to begin antenatal
           testing in obese women; however, there is little evidence that antenatal fetal
           surveillance improves outcomes.

        3. Study/Project Population: Pregnant women before 32 weeks of gestation with an initial
           BMI >30kg/m2

        4. Research Design: Randomized Controlled Trial

        5. Study/Project Procedures: Patients will be randomized to one of three groups: daily kick
           counts only, nonstress test, amniotic fluid index, and daily kick counts, and
           biophysical profile and daily kick counts. These patients will be randomly assigned a
           group in a 1:1:1 ratio using a random number generator available online. Patients
           assigned to the daily kick counts only group will be called weekly to ensure they are
           doing daily kick counts. If they are noncompliant, they will be removed from the study
           and will undergo nonstress tests if they meet the initial BMI criteria as is the
           standard practice at our institution.

        6. Outcomes Measured: Stillbirth, induction of labor, mode of delivery, neonatal intensive
           care unit admission, AGPARs <7 at 5 minutes of life
