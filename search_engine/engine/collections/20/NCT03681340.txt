      promote caries remineralization that is significantly greater than zero, and (2) the two
      toothpaste formulations are equally effective with respect to post-treatment remineralization
      and inhibition of demineralization.

        -  Non-inferiority will be considered established if there is no statistically significant
           difference in percentage of remineralization between the hydroxyapatite-containing
           toothpaste and the fluoridated kid's toothpaste for any one measurement method.

        -  Superiority/inferiority will be considered established if at least 20% statistically
           significant difference is observed between the hydroxyapatite-containing toothpaste and
           the fluoridated kid's toothpaste for any one measurement method
