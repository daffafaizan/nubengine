      females, accounting for about 693,900 deaths worldwide per year.

      It is commonly accepted that aspirin exerts its chemopreventive effects by inhibiting
      catalytic enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and COX-2 involved in prostaglandin synthesis.This
      hypothetic mechanism is supported by clinical data from two large cohorts that found that the
      regular use of aspirin reduced the risk of CRC with high expression of COX-2 but not with low
      or no expression of COX-2.

      Based on current knowledge, it is unclear why aspirin appears to inhibit CRC more than other
      cancers. This might be associated with the unique microenvironment comprising trillions of
      microbes in which CRC resides. Therefore, the investigator hypothesizes that there is a link
      between the chemopreventive mechanism of aspirin, gut microbiota as well as the metabolome.

      During the past decade, evidence has accumulated that microbiota in the host is highly
      sensitive to the gut microenvironment since its composition and activity can be rapidly and
      reproducibly changed by diet or nutrients. As such, an acidic drug like aspirin may be able
      to alter the gut microbiota composition. It is thus conceivable that the CRC preventive
      action of aspirin may be through the alteration of host gut microbes.
