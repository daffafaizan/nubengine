      Primary

        -  Determine the response proportion in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or
           metastatic gastric cancer treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the median and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on
      days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
