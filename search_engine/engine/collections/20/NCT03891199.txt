      from 1% to as much as 3.2%. The demand for THA is expected to increase. Post- dislocation
      solutions include closed reduction, open reduction, THA revision, and constrained cup,
      conversion to hemiarthroplasty, allograft or girdlestone resection. These solutions are often
      costly, painful and can involve substantial additional risks and complications. Acetabular
      cup placement is an important factor in the stability of the THA. Cup malpositioning has been
      associated with bearing surface ware and dislocation. For most patients, acceptable angles
      for abduction are 40° abduction (±10°) and 20° (±5°) version. However, malpositioning
      continues to occur resulting in cup angles outside acceptable ranges and leaving patients
      with an increased risk of dislocation.

      This objective of this study is to examine the acetabular cup placement of THA patients and
      compare results for patients who undergo THA with robotic-arm assistance with those who
      undergo traditional THA.
