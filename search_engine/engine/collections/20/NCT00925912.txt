      satisfaction, and other complications after closed hemorrhoidectomy comparison between local
      perianal block and spinal anesthesia.

      Research design: Randomized controlled trial Setting: Phramongkutklao Hospital Research
      methodology: A total of 64 subjects (32 males and 32 females) underwent elective
      hemorrhoidectomy were randomly allocated into two groups. Thirty-two patients were randomly
      allocated to receive spinal anesthesia (SA group) while 32 patients received local perianal
      block (LA group). Duration of analgesic effect, pain measurement with visual analogue scale
      (VAS) at 6 and 24 hours, quantity of analgesic medication administered, postoperative
      complication, and patient's satisfaction with the anesthetic technique were recorded.
