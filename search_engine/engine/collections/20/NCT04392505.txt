      before, during and after treatment with the investigational study drug durvalumab in patients
      with locally advanced non-small celled lung cancer (NSCLC). Both patients with high and low
      PD-L1 expression are allowed to participate. Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) will be
      administered after a period with standardtreatment with chemotherapy and radiationtherapy
      (chemoradiotherapy) for around 7 weeks. After maximum 5 weeks break after chemoradiotherapy,
      durvalumab will be given in the same dose to all patients for up to 12 months. The follow-up
      include a safety follow-up for up to five years, followed by a survival follow-up for up to a
      total of ten years.

      The main aim is to identify and describe biomarkers in different sample types related to
      chemoradiation followed by durvalumab treatment for stage III PD-L1 negative and positive
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients' eligible for curatively intended chemoradiation.

      The hypothesis is that clinical differences in course of disease reflect underlying
      biological characteristics.
