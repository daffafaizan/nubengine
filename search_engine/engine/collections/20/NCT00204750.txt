      University of Utah Health Sciences Center and the Salt Lake City VA Medical Center for
      dysphagia will be enrolled in the study prior to endoscopy. If a Schatzki's Ring is found at
      endoscopy, the patient will be randomized to electrosurgical incision or standard bougie
      dilation. Patients will be placed on rabeprazole for one year. Follow-up on recurrence and/or
      severity of dysphagia will be analyzed at interim time periods (1,3,6, 9 12 months).
