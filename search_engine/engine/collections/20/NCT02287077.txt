    
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a brain injury in neonates due to inadequate blood
      flow and oxygen delivery to the neonatal brain. Umbilical cord milking can potentially
      improve brain injury in neonates with HIE. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      feasibility of performing umbilical cord milking in neonates who are depressed at birth. The
      investigators hypothesized that umbilical cord milking is feasible and safe in neonates who
      are depressed at birth. The investigators also hypothesized that umbilical cord milking will
      increase stem cells in neonatal blood circulation and improve short term outcomes in neonates
      with moderate and severe HIE.
