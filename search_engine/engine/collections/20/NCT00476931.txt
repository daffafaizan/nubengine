      researcher injects SB-509 into your legs, the drug enters the muscle and nerve cells around
      the injection site and causes these cells to make a protein. This protein causes your cells
      to increase production of another protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      which may improve the structure and function of nerves. In addition, there are changes in the
      levels of 28 additional proteins in your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth
      of cells, are structures in cells, help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and
      some have unknown functions. This increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair
      the damaged nerves caused by diabetic neuropathy.
