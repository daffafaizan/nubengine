      lymph node biopsy versus sentinel lymph node biopsy for the management of breast cancer which
      showed the cN1 was conversed as ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      To verify whether, the radiotherapy without SLN can be applied, when the cN1 was conversed as
      ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      To verify whether, the additional treatment decision can be established based on only the
      biology of primary tumor without the pathologic information of axillary lymph nodes To verify
      whether, the patients' quality of life can be improved by a less invasive surgical procedure,
      when the cN1 was conversed as ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
