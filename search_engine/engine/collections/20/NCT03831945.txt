      highly potent and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal
      antibodies (bNAbs) from B cells of HIV-infected individuals. It has been shown that certain
      bNAbs can prevent acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, delay and/or prevent
      plasma viral rebound following treatment interruption in simian/human immunodeficiency virus
      (SHIV)-infected animals. Preliminary data from clinical trials indicates that bNAbs may delay
      plasma viral rebound following interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and block
      cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in vitro.

      In the above studies, suppression of plasma viremia was dependent on maintaining neutralizing
      serum levels of bNAbs via repeated intravenous (IV) infusions. A recent pre-clinical study in
      an acute SHIV-macaque model suggests a limited course of passive immunotherapy with two bNAbs
      (10-1074 and 3BNC117) given shortly after infection, can result in prolonged suppression of
      plasma viremia that is not dependent on the continuous presence of the bNAbs18. Based on CD8+
      T cell depletion studies, it appears that the prolonged suppression of plasma viremia
      observed in these animals resulted from the induction of potent antiviral CD8+ T cell
      immunity by the short course bNAb treatment. The mechanism by which bNAb therapy could induce
      such a response is unclear but could involve the early formation of unique bNAb-SHIV immune
      complexes that subsequently induce an effective and durable T cell response to the virus.

      In light of these encouraging preclinical outcomes, it is of considerable interest to
      investigate whether treatment with a single infusion of two bNAbs (VRC01 and 10-1074) which
      target different epitopes of HIV gp120 (CD4 binding site and V3 glycan, respectively), during
      transient plasma viremia can induce long-lasting anti-HIV immunity capable of controlling
      plasma viremia in the absence of ART.
