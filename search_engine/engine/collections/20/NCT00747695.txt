      medication), multi-center, Phase 1 study, consisting of 2 parts. The first part of the study
      will be non-randomized, all patients will receive the same dose. In the second part of the
      study, patients will be randomized (study medication assigned by chance) into 2 dose groups.
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (clinical
      global impressions and formulation palatability) and safety of rabrepazole after single and
      multiple daily administration at 2 dose levels in children between the ages of 1 and 11
      years, inclusive, with GERD. As this study is an exploratory assessment of the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of rabeprazole in children, no formal
      hypothesis testing is applied. Safety and tolerability, including monitoring of adverse
      events, clinical laboratory results, physical examination, vital signs and ECG measurements,
      will be evaluated throughout the study. Patients will receive rabeprazole sodium as single
      daily oral doses for 5 successive days as a bead formulation. Patients in the first part of
      the study will receive single and multiple daily every 24 hours doses of 0.14 mg/kg, using
      increments of 1 mg dose. Safety and pk data from part 1 of the study will determine the 2
      dosages to be studied in part 2 of the study.
