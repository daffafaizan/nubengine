      deficits in three domains: social interaction, communication, and stereotypic behavior.
      Prevalence has been estimated to be approximately 1/166 children and the public health impact
      is significant. ASD clearly has a genetic component; however, identification of specific
      etiologies has been complicated by the heterogeneous nature of ASD. One approach to minimize
      this problem is to define endophenotypes that can subcategorize ASD patients. Based on our
      work with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, we have investigated whether alterations in cholesterol
      homeostasis may contribute to ASD. We found in 200 ASD subjects that 23% of subjects had
      serum cholesterol levels less than or equal to 2.28th centile and 9% had levels greater than
      or equal to 97.72nd centile. Analysis of the sterol profile suggested that the
      hypocholesterolemia was due to a synthetic defect rather than decreased oral intake. Thus we
      hypothesize that ASD patients with abnormal cholesterol levels will have polymorphisms or
      mutations of either genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis or genes encoding proteins
      whose function is altered by changes in cholesterol levels. To test this hypothesis we
      propose to 1) use serum cholesterol levels to define ASD endophenotypes and 2) to perform
      genomic resequencing of all known exons in hypo- and normocholesterolemic ASD patients.
