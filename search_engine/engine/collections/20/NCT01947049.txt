      Southwest, Midwest; and East Coast) will enroll adult subjects presenting to the ED with an
      acute respiratory illness who fulfill CDC recommended criteria for receiving antiviral
      therapy. At each of the 4 sites, dedicated research coordinators will approach all adult (age
      > 18 years old) ED patients with broadly defined respiratory related complaints and screen
      for those who meet CDC recommended criteria for antiviral therapy (i.e. those at 'high-risk
      for complications' or those with 'potential influenza-related complications).

      Consenting subjects will have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected for both Xpert Flu testing
      and gold standard reverse transcription-PCR (rt-PCR) testing under a research protocol. The
      investigators will compare the test results from the rapid flu testing to that of the gold
      standard rt-PCR testing in order to assess the clinical performance characteristics of the
      new rapid test (Objective 1). The investigators will also collect demographics and medical
      historical information using a brief structured data form, which will be used in combination
      with rt-PCR test results to derive and validate a clinical decision guideline (Objective 2).

      The investigators will simultaneously randomize 2 of the 4 hospitals to the Rapid Testing
      Group (which will have systematic rapid flu testing performed with results provided to the
      clinicians), or the Control Group (which will follow standard of care practice with testing
      left to the discretion of individual clinicians). This will permit comparison of rates of ED
      antiviral administration or prescription between the two groups to assess the clinical impact
      of influenza testing (Objective 3). Finally, cost data from the ED visits and subsequent
      hospitalization will be collected from subjects in both the rapid testing group and the
      control group to inform a cost-utility analysis of rapid influenza testing compared to
      current standard of care (Objective 4).
