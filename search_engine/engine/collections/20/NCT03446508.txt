      mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To remember and find words, the brain has to search for the
      correct memory and MCI can negatively affect this search. Studies have suggested that low
      level electrical stimulation of the memory retrieval circuit can improve memory recall. The
      purpose of this study is to find the exact influence of multi-electrode or High Definition
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) by targeting a frontal and a parietal brain
      area, and their roles in memory retrieval/word finding in MCI. By modulating ongoing activity
      in 6 sessions of HD-tDCS the study investigates whether HD-tDCS may be used as a way to
      improve memory retrieval/word finding evaluated by cognitive measures and
      electroencephalography (EEG) measures before the first session and after the last session of
      HD-tDCS with a follow-up session 1-month after the stimulation procedure.
