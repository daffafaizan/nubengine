    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the outcomes of the Stress Management and
      Resiliency Training (SMART) program among Public School staff in 2 communities in Minnesota.
      Feasibility of a blended in-person and online teaching approach of the program will also be
      evaluated.

      This study builds on previous work in other working populations with high stress levels
      inherent in the specific work process.
