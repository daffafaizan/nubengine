      Primary

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 24 months after
           beginning induction therapy

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the response rate (complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)) after
           CHOEP x 6 and after Gem/Bu/Mel ASCT

        -  To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence
           of relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM)

        -  To estimate the toxicity (grade 3 and above)

        -  To estimate the rate of successful stem cell mobilization after CHOEP in responding
           patients

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients who can successfully complete the entire
           treatment regimen

        -  To estimate the time to engraftment of neutrophil and platelet engraftment after ASCT

        -  To determine whether tumor DNA can be detected in peripheral blood of patients before
           therapy

        -  To evaluate the changes and prognostic relevance in detectable tumor DNA in peripheral
           blood after induction chemotherapy (CHOEP) and after Gem/Bu/Mel ASCT
