      pressure. After opening of the gastrocolic ligament and division of any adhesions between
      stomach and pancreas a circular opening is performed at the junction of corpus and antrum of
      the stomach with a circular stapler. A tubular gastric pouch is then created along a
      calibration tube at the lesser curvature by a vertical stapling starting from the circular
      opening to the angle of Hiss.
