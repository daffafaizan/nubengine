      using NMDA receptor antagonists in subjects with ischemic stroke from showing efficacy. In
      animal models of ischemic stroke, antioxidants showed a longer neuroprotective time window
      than NMDA receptor antagonists, and also showed therapeutic potential in clinical trials in
      subjects with ischemic stroke. Sophadil showed good neuroprotective effects against NMDA and
      free-radical mediated cell death, NR2B-selectivity, moderate NMDA receptor antagonism, and
      effective cellular osmotic antioxidant activity even at nanoscale molarity. Non-clinical and
      phase I human clinical studies have shown that Sofadil is helpful in treating ischemic stroke
      subjects with better efficacy and therapeutic time windows. So we designed the clinical trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofadil injection in the treatment of acute ischemic
      stroke
