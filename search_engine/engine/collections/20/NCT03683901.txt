      post-stroke shoulder under 3 stimulation conditions. The stimulation was delivered by a
      trained occupational therapist under three conditions: 10 seconds of TENS, 10 seconds of
      t-NMES, and 10 seconds of no stimulation. Each subject was exposed to each of the three
      stimulation conditions three times in a computer-generated random sequence for each outcome
      measure with a 5-minute wash-out period between each stimulation. This protocol is repeated
      for each of the two passive movements tested, shoulder abduction and shoulder external
      rotation.
