      (ICU), but studies have shown that physicians and nurses collectively have inadequate skill
      in interpreting PAC waveforms. We have developed a Web-based application that provides
      physicians and nurses with rapid access to relevant PAC-related content for use in patient
      care situations. The application begins with a visual index that assists clinicians in the
      recognition of both normal and abnormal waveforms and provides waveform-specific links to
      concise advice on making accurate pressure measurements, troubleshooting system problems, and
      avoiding complications of catheter use. Initial evaluation will consist of a before-and-after
      trial to determine whether the application improves test performance in the areas of waveform
      recognition, accuracy of measurement, and appropriateness of action. Once the resource is in
      production, we will electronically log usage and survey users to evaluate the extent and
      effect of actual utilization.
