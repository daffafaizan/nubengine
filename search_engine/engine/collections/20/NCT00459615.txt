      of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria at doses that bracket anticipated clinical
      doses (2.4 mg/kg once daily for 3 days; or 2.4 mg/kg initially, at 12 hours on Day 0, and
      then daily on Day 1 and 2) and thereby establish the safest, highly efficacious dosing
      regimen for use in future clinical trials.
