      gastrointestinal flora and gut function. Several studies have shown promising results for the
      use of probiotics in patient with inflammatory bowel disease.

      In this trial approximately 100 patients with ulcerative colitis will receive treatment with
      probiotic or placebo for 8 to 10 months as adjuvant therapy.

      The trial is double-blind, randomised and controlled.
