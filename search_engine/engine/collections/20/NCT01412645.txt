    
      The study will be done in a collaboration between two PhD students, who focus on effects in
      adipose- and muscle- tissue, and bone tissue respectively.

      The investigators will look at changes in

        -  inflammation-markers

        -  biochemical markers of fat- and sugar-metabolism

        -  gene-expression in fat- and muscle-tissue

        -  body composition (DXA (whole body) and MR spectroscopy)

        -  biochemical markers of bone-metabolism

        -  Bone Mineral Density (DXA scans)

        -  bone structure (QCT)

        -  gene-expression and cytokines in bone marrow

      Some of the volunteers will have their insulin sensitivity measured.
