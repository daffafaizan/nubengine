      sex at birth. Total participant commitment for the entire study is approximately 1.5 years.

      This study will take place in three steps. In Step 1, participants will receive daily oral
      CAB tablets for 5 weeks. In Step 2, participants will receive a series of five intramuscular
      (IM) injections of CAB LA, administered at 8-week intervals after a 4-week loading dose
      (injections at Weeks 5, 9, 17, 25 & 33). A safety visit will follow each injection to
      ascertain safety data, including injection site reactions. In Step 3, all participants who
      have received at least one injection will be followed quarterly (every 3 months) for 48 weeks
      after their last injection. Participants will receive oral TDF/FTC for daily use for 48 weeks
      or join and open-label extension CAB study in their area, if available.

      Participants will attend about 18 study visits throughout the study. Visits may include
      physical examinations, blood collection, urine collection, vaginal swab collection, risk
      reduction and adherence counseling, and behavioral or acceptability assessments.
