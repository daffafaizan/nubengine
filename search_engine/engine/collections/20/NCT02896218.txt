      of serious gram-positive infections involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA). Vancomycin use is associated with several adverse events, including nephrotoxicity
      and ototoxicity. Its therapeutic window is narrow, so there is a need to monitor serum
      vancomycin concentration in clinical practice, especially in the critically ill patients.
      Moreover, the Chinese vancomycin TDM guideline recommended that vancomycin dosage should be
      administered and adjusted individually based on population pharmacokinetic(PPK) and Bayesian
      methods. However, there is a gap between clinical practice and the guideline. So far, few
      studies have investigated the clinical outcomes of the dosage strategy that vancomycin dosage
      is administered and adjusted individually using PPK and Bayesian methods. Pharmacists could
      provide the vancomycin individualized dosing service by joining the ICU multidisciplinary
      team. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, safety and economics
      of the vancomycin individualized dosing service provided by pharmacists.

      This is a single-center, ambispective cohort study. Patients from the retrospective and
      prospective cohort will be divided into 2 groups by exposure. The exposure is whether
      patients received pharmacists' consultation. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be included in our registry. As a non-intervention study, these information as
      below will be collected: basic demographics, diagnosis, the initial dosage regimen and
      adjusted strategy of vancomycin, combined special treatment and outcomes.
