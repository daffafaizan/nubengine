    
      From interested participants (children and parents) we will obtain:

        1. Informed consent

        2. Anthropometric measurements - height, weight, waist and hip circumference, blood
           pressure, % body fat by bioimpedance (Tanita scale).

        3. Health History Questionnaire

        4. Food Frequency Questionnaire

        5. Fasting blood sample- We will collect a total of 40 ml of blood (less than 3 ml/kg for
           the entire study). The blood samples will be used to measure triglyceride,
           LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, apoA1, apoB, C-reactive protein,
           lipoprotein subfraction analysis by ion mobility, DNA for inclusion in our DNA biobank,
           choline, TMAO and other metabolites related to heart disease risk.

      Standard Blood sampling: Using standard blood collection procedures, blood samples will be
      collected from participants after a 12-14 hour fast. The blood will be collected in tubes
      containing the following preservative solution: 3.0 gms EDTA (dipotassium), 1.7 mg P-Pack,
      0.15 gms gentamycin sulfate, 0.15 gms chloramphenicol, 5.96 mls aprotinin (Sigma A-6279), and
      0.30 gms sodium azide all of which are diluted to 20mls with doubly deionized water. Plasma
      is separated by immediate centrifugation at 4Â°C. Lipid and lipoprotein measurements are
      performed and aliquots of plasma are frozen for future analyses.
