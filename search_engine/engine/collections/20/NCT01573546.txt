      States, affecting more than 81 million American adults. It is well established that risk
      factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia not only place individuals at risk
      for CVD, but also place them at risk for neurocognitive impairment and dementia. CVD risk
      factors have been shown to be associated with a cascade of neurophysiologic and neuroanatomic
      changes, resulting in cognitive impairment and dementia. Exercise and diet have been shown to
      improve CVD risk factors and also appear particularly promising lifestyle approaches for
      preventing dementia among individuals at risk, such as those with cognitive impairment, no
      dementia (CIND). ENLIGHTEN is a randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise among patients
      with CIND.
