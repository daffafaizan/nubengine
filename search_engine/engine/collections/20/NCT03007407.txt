    
      The FC-9 study is designed as a phase II, open label, single arm study of the dual immune
      checkpoint blockade with the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab following
      hypofractionated palliative radiation in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have progressed on chemotherapy. The primary aim is to determine
      the anti-tumor efficacy of the dual immune checkpoint blockade with durvalumab plus
      tremelimumab. The secondary aims are to determine the clinical benefit rate, duration of
      response, tolerability and correlates of response. Tumor response at unirradiated target
      lesions will be measured at baseline and every 2 cycles using RECIST 1.1.

      Following three doses of hypofractionated palliative radiation (Days -2, -1, and Day 0 prior
      to Cycle 1), patients will receive the combination of tremelimumab (75 mg IV infusion) and
      durvalumab (1500 mg IV infusion) on Day 1 for 4 cycles. Beginning with Cycle 5 through Cycle
      12, patients will receive durvalumab alone (1500 mg/IV infusion) on Day 1 of each 28 day
      cycle.

      The sample size will be between 12 and 21 evaluable patients. Twelve evaluable patients will
      be treated in the first stage of the study. If there are no responses among the 12 evaluable
      patients, the study will be terminated. If the study goes on to the second stage, a total of
      21 evaluable patients will be studied.

      Submission of tumor tissue and blood samples for FC-9 correlative science studies will be a
      study requirement for all patients. Requirements will include archived tumor samples from the
      diagnostic biopsy; additional biopsies of fresh tissue from an accessible lesion prior to
      radiation therapy and after 2 cycles of study therapy; and blood sample collections.
