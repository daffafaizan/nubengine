      conventional treatment. Preliminary data have shown that it may be effective also in
      treatment of the index attack of pericarditis and the prevention of further recurrences.

      Comparisons: The study will compare the safety and efficacy of colchicine in the treatment of
      acute pericarditis and the primary prevention of recurrences. Colchicine will be used in
      addition to conventional treatment.
