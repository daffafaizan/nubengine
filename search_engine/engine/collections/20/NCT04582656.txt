      treatment, external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. However, whole-gland treatment
      induces significant morbidity and burden on quality of life. Targeted treatments of the index
      tumor are currently under investigation to decrease morbidity while proposing active
      treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a novel ablation treatment using
      microwaves, delivered transrectally or transperineally under real-time guidance with
      MRI-transrectal ultrasound image registration. The index tumor will be detected with prostate
      MRI and characterized with targeted biopsies using Organ Based Tracking (OBT) fusion with the
      TRINITY system (KOELIS, Meylan, France). The same system will be used to identify the index
      lesion and guide the targeted microwave ablation performed with the TATO3 device (Biomedical
      Srl, Florence, Italy).

      All patients will undergo biopsy at 12 months of follow-up. A biopsy session will also be
      performed at 6 months, but only for patients with imaging results suspicious for cancer
      within the ablated area on the mpMRI.
