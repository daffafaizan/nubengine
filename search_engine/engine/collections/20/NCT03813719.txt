      Quantify the anxiety and stress levels of women attending the Rapid access gynaecology clinic
      with a suspicion of cancer

      Background:

      Endometrial cancer is a tumour originating in the endometrium (womb lining); it is the most
      common gynaecological cancer in the United Kingdom (UK). In 2012, there were almost 100,000
      new cases diagnosed in Europe. Endometrial cancer classically presents with postmenopausal
      bleeding (bleeding after the menopause), or intermenstrual bleeding (bleeding in between
      periods).

      Although routine management for these women does vary, in general a screening test is
      performed, typically a pelvic (internal) ultrasound to assess the endometrium (womb lining).
      In cases where the endometrial thickness is above the threshold for investigation -an
      endometrial biopsy (sampling cells from the womb lining) is indicated. Whilst well tolerated,
      this can be quite painful.

      Once the endometrial biopsy is performed, it is sent to the histologist for further
      examination. Histological analysis may take several days and patients are either brought back
      to clinic for discussion of the results or are given a telephone appointment. The patient
      often will not know the result of the test for up to 2 weeks; thus causing a lot of
      unnecessary anxiety and distress.

      The study:

      Patients attending the Rapid Access Gynaecology Clinic will be invited to participate in the
      study by filling in a short anonymous survey.

      Additionally, patients undergoing a tissue biopsy sample will be asked to provide a pain
      score, followed by a brief interview to ascertain if they would undergo the procedure again
      if it was needed and how they tolerated the procedure. Additionally, the time taken to
      perform the procedure will be recorded.
