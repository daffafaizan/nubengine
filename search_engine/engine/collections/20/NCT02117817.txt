    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of BKM120 in combination with weekly
           nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane速) in patients with a recurrent solid tumor and in particular a
           recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.

        -  To determine the MTD and DLT of BKM120 in combination with weekly nabpaclitaxel
           (Abraxane速) thereby establishing the recommended phase II dose.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Obtain pilot data on the clinical tumor response utilizing RECIST criteria of BKM120 in
           combination with weekly nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane速) in patients with a history of
           recurrent endometrial or a recurrent ovarian cancer.

        -  To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with BKM120 and
           nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane速) and a history of recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.

        -  To explore molecular markers that my serve as potential molecular predictors of response
           including PIK3CA, mTOR, KRAS, PTEN and p53 mutations as well as amplification of ErbB2.

        -  To test the predictive value of PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in predicting response to this
           regimen in women diagnosed with a recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.
