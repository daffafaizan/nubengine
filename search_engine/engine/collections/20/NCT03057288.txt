           France (TNCD, the national digestive cancer thesaurus). Their prognosis remains bleak,
           particularly due to late diagnosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 10% for cancers of
           the esophagus and 55% at 5 years for rectal cancers (TNCD). When diagnosed at an
           advanced stage (> T2 or N +), treatment with radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy is indicated.
           The precise definition of macroscopic tumor volume in radiotherapy represents an
           important difficulty because it is based on endoscopic and imaging data obtained under
           conditions different from those used in the preparation of radiotherapy treatment. A
           better definition of the target tumor volume using radiopaque markers known as fiducial
           markers would be likely to improve the efficacy and tolerance of this treatment, or even
           to allow additional irradiation that would be targeted more precisely on the tumor.

        -  Objectives :

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of fiducial markers placement
      under EUS guidance.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate :

        -  Complications (early within 24 hours and late complications) such as pain, bleeding,
           perforation, infection, migration of the markers

        -  The length of the procedure

        -  The costs (procedure, hospitalization)

        -  The clinical efficacy, by studying the decrease of the estimated target volume, the
           decrease of the dose delivered to the healthy tissue and the improvement of positioning
           of the irradiation beams by the radiotherapy technician

        -  The presence of the markers at the end of the radiotherapy primary and secondary â€¢
           Research methodology It is a prospective multicenter study, 18 centers will participate.
           Forty patients are to include over a period of 24 months.
