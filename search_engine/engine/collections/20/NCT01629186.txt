      technique-nasopharyngeal oxygenation with nose-close and abdomen-compression (NPO-NC-AC)-in
      small infants during flexible bronchoscopy (FB).

      METHODS: Infants with body weight (BW) <5.0 kg and receiving nasal diagnostic or
      interventional FB (dFB, iFB) were enrolled. Under NPO (0.5 L/kg/min), when infant's heart
      rate (HR) <80 beats/min or oxygen saturation (SpO2) <85% for more than 10 seconds, rescue
      NC-AC was initiated. It was performed by (1) increased NPO flow to 0.5-1.0 L/kg/min; (2) NC 1
      second for inspiration; and (3) AC 1 second for expiration with simultaneously released
      nostrils. Repeat doing steps (2) and (3) at a rate of 30 cycles/min until HR, SpO2, and blood
      pressure (BP) returned to normal. Cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored and analyzed.
