    
      200 patients with LBP looking for physiotherapy treatment in 15 clinics at Maccabi Healthcare
      Service in Israel will be recruited. (100 after competion individual therapy, 100 after
      competion of group therapy). As part of the regular routine in these clinics, patients will
      be asked to fill the LFSQ, a questionnaire which deals with their back functional status,
      their level of pain and fear avoidance of physical activity before and after treatment. In
      the present study, patients will be asked to fill the LFSQ again, 6 months after treatment
      completion. In two weeks from treatment completion, patients will be interviewed on the
      telephone. The interview will focuse on their sensation of how they have been helped. It will
      include an open-ended question and 18 closed questions.

      The main study variables will include: participants' perception of functional status, level
      pain, level of fear avoidance of physical activity, patient-therapist bonding, and helpful
      therapeutic impacts (client's sense of how she or he has been helped).
