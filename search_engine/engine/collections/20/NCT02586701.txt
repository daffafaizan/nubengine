      To determine to what extent a structured multimodal prehabilitation regimen, which includes
      aerobic and resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation and psychological coping
      strategies, initiated before surgery, and continued while in hospital and after surgery,
      optimizes the recovery of functional walking capacity following colorectal resection for
      cancer.

      To understand which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to prehabilitation
      interventions and predict change in later outcome measures.
