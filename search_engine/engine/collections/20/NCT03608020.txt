      WBRT in 5 patients with MBM. Demonstrating safety of the selected MTD of BMX-001 in patients
      with MBM undergoing standard protocol WBRT will be the "go/no-go" criteria for proceeding to
      Phase 2.

      Phase 2 is a randomized open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of 64 patients with MBM, half
      receiving BMX-001 in combination with WBRT and half receiving WBRT alone.

      Subjects are treated with BMX-001 for a total of 19 days, during which time they receive
      radiation therapy. Following completion of radiation therapy, subjects will be followed for
      an additional one year.
