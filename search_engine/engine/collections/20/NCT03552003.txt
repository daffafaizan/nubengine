      diagnosed cHL starting from a prospective observational study of consecutive cases registered
      after the completion of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) Prospective data
      collection study of a consecutive series of newly diagnosed elderly cHL patients undergoing
      CGA before any therapy with the use of ADL, IADL and CIRS-G. Patients who will be considered
      not eligible to receive treatment or to be given only palliative therapy after CGA assessment
      are eligible for the study. Patients will be screened and restaged according to clinical
      practice instrumental and laboratory assessments timing and type of examinations.
