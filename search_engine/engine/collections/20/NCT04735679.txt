      fibrosis patients.

      According to our hypothesis, the lung microbiota shapes the lung environment of cystic
      fibrosis patients and modifies the effectiveness of antibiotic treatments and the course of
      the disease. The objective of our longitudinal follow-up of primary colonised patients is to
      show the presence of a link between the composition of the microbiota and the effectiveness
      of antibiotic therapy. Finally, the management of first colonisations could justify the
      characterisation of the microbiota in order to develop innovative diagnostic tests for the
      follow-up of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and possibly the identification of new
      therapeutic agents based on the microbiota.

      All patients followed at the Montpellier CF centre will be asked to participate in this
      cohort. All patients have a regular follow-up every 1 to 6 months and will be asked at each
      visit to keep their sputum sample in excess of the analyses requested for their follow-up.
