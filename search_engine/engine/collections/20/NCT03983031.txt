      immunomodulation may be helpful. Rituximab (antibodies against CD20, cluster of
      differentiation), a standard treatment for multiple sclerosis, is an anti-inflammatory drug,
      hitherto not tested for psychiatric disorders.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the psychiatric symptoms of
      treatment-resistant adult psychiatric patients, diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD), are significantly improved after treatment with rituximab. The investigator's purpose
      is to implement recent insights from "Immunopsychiatry" to find efficacious, but still
      tolerable treatment for these patients.

      This is a single-site, 20-week, open pilot, add-on treatment as usual, trial, where the
      patients will be followed for 1 year.

      Rituximab will be administered with one single dose of 1000 mg. Investigators will analyse
      inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in relation to the primary outcome, treatment response
      (defined as clinically relevant reduction in the validated measure Y-BOCS). Other outcomes
      are "much" or "very much improved" on Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I)
      and change in Personal and Social Performance Scale measuring overall disability.
