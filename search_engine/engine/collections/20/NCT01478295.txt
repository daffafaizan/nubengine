    
      Aim: to compare the effectiveness of a standardized care plan (SCP) compared to the usual
      nursing intervention to improve the quality of life for primary caregivers over 65 years old
      measured through points change with the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scale.

      Secondary objectives:

      Evaluate the influence of prognostic variables on quality of life of caregiver. Describe the
      level of caregiver burden. Describe the socio-demographic profile of the dependent person and
      caregiver.

      Method:

      Design: cluster randomized trial. Setting: study in Health Centers Primary Care of Area of
      Madrid Health Service. Subjects: unit of randomization: primary healthcare centres. Analysis
      unit: caregivers over 65 years old.

      Intervention: The SCP in the treatment group and the usual intervention in the control group.

      Sample size adjusted for design effect= 218 (109 in each arm). Main response variable:
      perceived quality of life (EQ-5D). Secondary response variables: nursing diagnosis, Zarit
      Caregiver Burden Interview, objective overload level.

      Prognostic variables:Dependent person-related: dependence level (Barthel, Lawton-Brody),
      cognitive dysfunction (Pfeiffer).

      Caregiver-related: depression scale (Yesavage), anxiety level (Goldberg), family function
      (family Apgar). Sociodemographic variables.

      Data Analysis: Analysis of main effectiveness by intention to treat, comparing the difference
      in units on the EQ-5D scale before and post- intervention in both groups at 0, 6, 12 and 18
      months. The estimation adjusted, using logistic regression with aleatory effects, those data
      that can act as confounding factors or change the effect.
