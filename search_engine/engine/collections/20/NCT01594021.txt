    
      This is a randomized, prospective study which will include a total of 200 patients who are
      scheduled to undergo elective surgery. The research participants will be randomly assigned to

        -  a control group that will receive a low preemptive volume loading (50 mL of gelatin),

        -  a protocol group that will receive a high preemptive volume loading (500 mL of gelatin).

      Volume loading is preceded by the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac output before and
      after a passive leg elevation test and followed by a standardized anesthetic protocol.
