    
      Patients with clinical stage T3-4N1/N2-3 (UICC 7th edition)are divided into two groups
      according to informed consent:intensity-modulated radiation therapy（IMRT）group and
      conventional fractionation radiotherapy(CRT)group. Then the patients in IMRT group/CRT group
      are randomly assigned to receive nedaplatin+docetaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus
      nedaplatin alone in concurrent chemoradiotherapy or cisplatin+docetaxel in neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy plus cisplatin alone in concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Evaluate the overall
      survival, the distant metastases free survival, and disease free survival of the patients
      treated with these regimens.Furthermore,analyze the cost-effectiveness of the regimens.
