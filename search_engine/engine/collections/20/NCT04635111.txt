    
      This FDA post-marketing requirement study will evaluate the long-term risk of hepatic failure
      with TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and the mechanism of liver injury based upon liver biopsy
      information among patients who received or are receiving TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) for
      symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated with severe morbidity or
      functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with surgery, and who experience
      hepatotoxicity. A liver biopsy will be collected from enrolled patients for central
      laboratory analysis of macrophage and immune cell profiles to investigate possible mechanisms
      of the hepatotoxicity. Additionally, 4 blood samples will be collected to evaluate liver
      function, other relevant safety tests, peripheral immune cells, and for pharmacogenomic
      testing. Enrolled patients will be followed at least yearly for 10 years to assess long-term
      risk of hepatic failure.
