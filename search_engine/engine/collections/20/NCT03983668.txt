    
      This is a single center, open-label, combined Phase I/II clinical study of intratumoral
      administration of CMP-001 and intravenous administration of pembrolizumab in selected
      participants with lymphoma. The key study objective is to find a CMP-001 dose that in
      combination with pembrolizumab has optimal clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity.
      Dose-finding will be performed with an adaptive clinical trial design. Secondary study
      objectives include characterization of safety, pharmacodynamics, and assessment of
      anti-lymphoma activity.
