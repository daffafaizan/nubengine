      hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU), including cardiac surgical patients. Moreover,
      25(OH)D levels continue to decrease from baseline throughout the hospital stay and resolves
      by 6 months. Vitamin D levels < 20 ng/ml is associated with higher mortality, infection rates
      and prolonged length of ICU saty.

      The discovery of vitamin D receptors (VDR) expressed on cardiac muscle and vasculature,
      released a strong hypothesis suggesting that vitamin D regulates RAAS activity and cardiac
      remodeling.

      The beneficial effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular system, immune function and wound
      healing could be of particular interest in critical care, and patients undergoing valve
      replacement surgery will benefit the most.
