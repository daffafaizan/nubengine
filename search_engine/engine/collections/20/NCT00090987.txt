      Primary

        -  Determine clinical response in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma treated with
           imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, as determined by
           immunohistochemistry, in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine cytokine profiles before and after treatment with this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug and antiretrovirals in these
           patients.

        -  Determine mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues for up to 1 year in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
