      provide diet and exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Many women with breast cancer do
      not follow these guidelines, and also elect to delay concerted efforts toward following them
      until active treatment is complete. However, adoption of these recommended lifestyle
      behaviors soon after diagnosis may prevent adverse changes in body composition and breast
      cancer biomarkers and may even improve the efficacy of treatment resulting in improved breast
      cancer prognosis. Further, by increasing our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the
      association between lifestyle behaviors and breast cancer survival, this study will improve
      our knowledge of how changes in diet and physical activity influence breast cancer outcomes.
      Lastly, guidelines for breast cancer survivors also overlap with those for diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, the latter being a common cause of breast cancer
      mortality.

      The proposed study will examine, in 172 women newly diagnosed with Stage I-III breast cancer
      who are not practicing the dietary and lifestyle guidelines, and who are scheduled to receive
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, the effect of a 1-year dietary and physical activity
      guidelines intervention vs. usual care on the following breast cancer outcomes measured
      before beginning chemotherapy (Time 0), post chemotherapy (Time 1), at one-year
      post-diagnosis (Time 2), and at two years post-diagnosis (Time 3): adherence to treatment,
      and changes in biomarkers, body composition, and quality of life.
