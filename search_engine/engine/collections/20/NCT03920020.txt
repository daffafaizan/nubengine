      proprioception and muscle architecture in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 69 patients will
      be included in this study. Patients will be divided into three groups; concentric exercise
      group (n:23), eccentric exercise group (n:23) and control group (n:23). A conventional
      physiotherapy program and a standard therapeutic exercise program will be applied to all
      subjects. In addition to these exercise and physiotherapy programme, concentric and eccentric
      exercise groups will perform the exercises related to their groups. All three groups will
      participate in this program for a total of 18 sessions 3 times a week for 6 weeks. All groups
      will be subject to re-evaluation after 6 weeks.
