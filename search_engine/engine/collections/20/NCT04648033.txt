      Gy in 33 fractions, once daily, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday), with cisplatin (80 mg/m2 IV on
      days 1 and 22 of CRT) and vinorelbine (15 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 22 and 29 of CRT). Whilst
      awaiting CRT to start, patients will receive two weeks (+/- 7 days) of oral atovaquone to
      ensure steady state is reached (after seven days). Patients will be allocated one of four
      dose levels: 450 mg, 600 mg, 675 mg or 750 mg (all doses PO BD). Atovaquone dose will be
      assigned as per the TiTE-CRM statistical model. The first two trial participants will receive
      450 mg BD. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subsequent patients will be assigned
      doses up to and including 750 mg BD.

      Hypoxia biomarker data will be collected at baseline (start of atovaquone run-in) and
      following two weeks (+/- 7 days) of atovaquone treatment. Atovaquone will then be continued
      without break for the duration of CRT, with the CRT schedule remaining constant for all
      patients at both centres. Assessment for Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be from the
      first scheduled dose of atovaquone until three months after completion of CRT. The CT scan
      performed at the three-month follow up visit will be reviewed to collect tumour response
      data.
