      The Short-Axis (SA) approach attempts to view the vessel in cross-section while venous access
      is obtained. The strength of the SA approach is that the vein is centered under the
      transducer and that the midpoint of the transducer becomes a reference point for the
      insertion of the needle, and that at the same time is possible to visualize SC artery and the
      pleural line. SA approach is easy to learn by novice sonologists.

      The Long-Axis (LA) approach employs a technique that views the length of the vessel during
      cannulation.For this reason, with LA approach is possible to visualize the needle advance
      during the entire procedure from the soft tissues until the lumen of the vein, but SC artery
      and pleural line are not visualized in the same scan. For LA approach, practice is required
      to keep the needle precisely within the image and care must be taken to avoid the probe
      inadvertently moving away from the target structure.
