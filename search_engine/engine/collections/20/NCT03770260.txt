      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MLN4924
      (pevonedistat) in combination with MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate [ixazomib]) in relapsed and/or
      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients after more than one previous line of treatment.
      (Dose-escalation phase) II. Describe the safety profile and tolerability of the combination
      of MLN9708 (ixazomib) and MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in the proteasome inhibitor (PI)-sensitive
      and PI-refractory populations. (Dose-expansion phase) III. Determine the anti-tumor activity
      and overall response rates (ORR) in patients with RRMM with the use of MLN9708 (ixazomib) and
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination. (Dose-expansion phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Attain pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with
      MLN9708 (ixazomib) for the purpose of understanding concentration-effect relationships of
      both agents. (Dose-escalation phase)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To correlate and predict disease response using the following tests: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase
      (quinone) 1 (NQO1) and cystine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) (nuclear factor
      [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2 [NRF2] target genes): evaluated on whole blood as markers of
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pevonedistat.

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, and 15, and
      pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 2-3
      months for up to 2 years.
