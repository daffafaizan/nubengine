      elevated U Pr/Cr ratio. However, no supporting reference was found in the article and no
      control group with random urine collection for comparison to clean catch specimen U Pr/Cr was
      included in their study. The original studies that validated spot Pr/Cr urine as a predictor
      of 24 -hour total urine protein used random non-clean catch random urines . They had an r
      value of .93-.99 in estimating total protein excreted in 24 hours. At our institution we use
      Siemens-base test to determine U Pr/Cr. In the product insert the company states that no
      special patient preparation is necessary.

      Thus, this study will determine the incidence of elevated U Pr/Cr in normal term pregnant
      women. In addition we will determine if a "clean catch" urine has an effect on the U Pr/Cr.
