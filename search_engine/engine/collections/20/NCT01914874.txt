    
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of an
      enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for SAD (MIND-SAD) that incorporates the following
      components: training in classical mindfulness, including concentration and insight
      (vipassana) meditation; training in self-compassion; and mindful exposure. An exploratory aim
      of the study is to evaluate the effects of the mindfulness intervention on biological markers
      of stress reactivity, including salivary cortisoland salivary alpha-amylase. The study is a
      two-arm, parallel design, prospective study comparing 12 weekly sessions of MIND-SAD
      delivered in a group format versus a wait-list control (WLC).
