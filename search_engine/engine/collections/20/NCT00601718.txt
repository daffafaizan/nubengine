      I. To determine maximally tolerated dose of vorinostat that can be combined with RICE
      chemotherapy in patients with relapsed lymphoid malignancies.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of the above regimen. III. To gain a preliminary
      assessment of the efficacy of the above regimen. IV. To determine the ability to proceed to
      peripheral blood stem cell collection following the above regimens (the impact of above
      regimen on stem cell reserve).

      V. To describe vorinostat concentration attained at or near the MTD. VI. To evaluate the
      change of histone acetylation patterns and pro-apoptotic proteins of primary target (tumor)
      and non-target peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cells following high-dose HDAC
      inhibition.

      VII. To describe the gene expression profile changes of tumor and non-tumor cells following
      high-dose HDAC inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5, ifosfamide IV
      continuously over 24 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 4, and etoposide IV over 1
      hour on days 3-5. Patients who are CD20+ also receive rituximab IV once on day 3, 4, or 5.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
