      with PC. High levels of IL-6 and presence of a systemic inflammatory response in PC patients
      have been reported to correlate with worse survival. Preclinical PC models have clearly shown
      that anti-IL-6-receptor antibody tocilizumab in combination with chemotherapy reduced tumor
      growth, number of distant metastases and the local recurrence rate. Thus, blockade of
      IL-6-regulated signaling pathways represents a promising approach in combination with
      chemotherapy. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) alone or in combination with hypoalbuminaemia
      (Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score - mGPS) are induced by IL-6 and could feasibly represent
      surrogate markers for IL-6 bioactivity to stratify patients likely to gain benefit through
      targeting IL-6.
