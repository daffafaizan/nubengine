      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN: Satraplatin is an oral, investigational anticancer drug that is a member
      of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based drugs have been clinically
      proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer therapies. Unlike the currently
      marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given orally.
