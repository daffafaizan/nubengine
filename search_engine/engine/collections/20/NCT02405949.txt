      laparoscopic gastric bypass): 50 pacients who were diabetic before surgery: 15 cases with
      less than 40% of the excess weight loss (EWL) and 35 cases with more than 75% EWL, matched
      with 50 non diabetic controles: 15 patients with less than 40%EWL and 35 with more than
      75%EWL after one year. All individuals were analyzed with a genetic score from Nutri inCode.
      The predictive ability was analyzed by discrimination (area under the ROC curve), sensitivity
      and specificity and a score was calculated.
