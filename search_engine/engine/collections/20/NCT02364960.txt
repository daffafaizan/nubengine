      to continue the use of IORT for a select population of women, and to follow outcomes with
      regards to local and regional control, toxicity and morbidity. Patients selected for breast
      conserving surgery, who are considered to have a low risk of local recurrence, are eligible
      for this registry trial once their informed consent is obtained. This single arm cohort study
      allows entry of patients who have been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and whose
      clinical stage is suitable for treating conservatively (small tumor and no gross nodal
      involvement). Tumors should not be more than 3.5 cm in size.
