    
      Sciatica is an established term for pain radiating from the lower back or buttock into the
      leg, commonly caused by a disc herniation. Given their analgesic and anti-inflammatory
      mechanisms of action, NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have been, and are still
      being regarded as standard therapy for sciatica.

      However, very few randomised controlled trials of NSAIDs have been undertaken in sciatica,
      and no study has showed clinically meaningful effects as compared to placebo.

      Since NSAIDs involve the risk of serious gastrointestinal, vascular and renal side effects
      there is a strong need to clarify their potential beneficial effects in sciatica.
