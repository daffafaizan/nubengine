      peri-implantitis following the LARST protocol, will be invited to return for three follow-up
      visits. During the follow-up visits, clinical measurements, x-rays, and pictures of the
      inside of their mouth will be taken to evaluate the success of their peri-implantitis
      treatment. If needed, additional laser treatment of the dental implant may also be provided
      according to the same randomization of subjects in the original study. No placebo laser
      application will be provided.
