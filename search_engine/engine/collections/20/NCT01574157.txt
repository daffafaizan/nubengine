      end-stage renal disease in many people. It is important to identify treatment strategies that
      will help prevent the progression of CKD to overt kidney failure. The purpose of this study
      is to see if sodium bicarbonate reduces urinary markers of kidney damage in Veterans with
      diabetic CKD and normal serum bicarbonate levels.
