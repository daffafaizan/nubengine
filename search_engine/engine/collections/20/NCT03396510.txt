      hospitalizations for symptom management. The study doctors want to know if daily electronic
      monitoring of the symptoms, such as pain, nausea, constipation, and diarrhea may improve care
      while participants are hospitalized.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate a new way to deliver oncology care where patients'
      symptoms are systematically monitored during their hospital admission. The investigators are
      studying whether patients whose clinicians receive their patients' detailed symptom reports
      each day have improved symptom management compared to those whose clinicians do not receive
      their patients' detailed symptom reports each day.

      The study will use questionnaires to measure the participant symptoms and involves
      participating in a study for as long as the participants are admitted to the hospital. The
      information the investigators collect will help them determine if electronic symptom
      monitoring improves the care of patients with cancer
