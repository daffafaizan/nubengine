      Human experimental models are valuable in early phase development of new anti-migraine drugs
      but useful models have not yet been developed. The investigators' group has shown that
      Isosorbide-5-mononitrate (5-ISMN), a long lasting NO-donor, induce headache/migraine in both
      healthy volunteers and in patients with migraine without aura (MO). To validate this model,
      the headache must respond to specific migraine treatment with sumatriptan.

      Hypothesis: 5-ISMN induces a migraine-like headache in both healthy subjects and in
      MO-patients and induced headache responds to a specific anti migraine drug; sumatriptan.

      Aim: Developing a pragmatic and valid model for the testing of new anti-migraine drugs
