    
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of MiraLAX versus placebo
      in women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery receiving routine docusate sodium. Subjects
      will be screened for eligibility during their preoperative visits and once enrolled, they
      will be randomized to receive MiraLAX or placebo starting on postoperative day (POD) 1 and
      continuing through POD 5. Subjects will be instructed to stop taking this medication if they
      experience any diarrhea. Subjects in both arms will be instructed to take milk of magnesia as
      a rescue laxative if they do not experience a BM by the morning of POD 6. All subjects will
      be provided a 30 day supply of docusate sodium and be instructed to begin this medication on
      POD 1.
