      guidance. Szabo technique, which used a second angioplasty guide wire to anchor the stent by
      passing the proximal end of the anchor wire through the last cell of the stent, demonstrated
      accurate placement of the stents in ostial locations. In bifurcation lesions, 2-stent
      strategy positioning with Szabo technique was not investigated. Modified T-stenting with
      Szabo technique may improve prognosis of bifurcation lesions through reducing stents overlap.
      There is no clinical trial focuses on the effect and outcome of Szabo technique for coronary
      artery bifurcation lesions in contrast with conventional strategy.

      In this study, the authors choose the closest 2-stent strategy, T-stenting, as control. We
      hope to determine whether a planned Szabo 2-stent technique is superior to T-stenting for
      patients with bifurcation lesions.

      Patients with bifurcation lesions will be randomly assigned to receive Szabo 2-stent
      technique or T-stenting strategy. Clinical outcomes and imaging assessment will be used to
      estimate their effects.
