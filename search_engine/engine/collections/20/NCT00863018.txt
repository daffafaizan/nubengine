      microscopic examination is performed for the patients who underwent glaucoma surgery;
      trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implant surgery prospectively. Specular microscopy
      using non-contact type specular microscope (Noncon Robo SP-8000, Konan Medical Inc., Tokyo,
      Japan) was performed by one experienced examiner before surgery and 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months after surgery. All examinations were done at the center, superior, superonasal, and
      superotemporal area of the cornea, while the patient maintain fixation at the target in the
      equipment. The follow-up was stopped if serious complication requiring surgical treatment was
      developed or additional intraocular pressure lowering surgery is needed, and the data before
      the second surgery were collected.
