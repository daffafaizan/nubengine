      effectively prompt parents to ask their pediatricians about their children's weight status.
      Exam rooms within clinics will be randomized to either have the poster or not and parents
      will complete questionnaires assessing weight perception, whether they discussed their
      child's weight with their physician, and basic demographics. Participants who are in exam
      rooms with a poster will also answer questions specifically about the poster.
