    
      Patients with GPA and active ENT disease in at least two ENT domains, as defined after
      endoscopic visualization of the upper airway and audiometric evaluation by a single
      otolaryngologist using a validated GPA ENT disease activity score, will be eligible for
      inclusion. ENT disease may be new, grumbling or relapsing.

      All patients entering the trial will receive standard induction therapy with rituximab
      (375mg/m2 per week x 4). At week 16, patients will be randomized to receive maintenance
      rituximab (1000mg) every 4 months or placebo infusions. The primary outcome will be assessed
      at week 52. Patients will be treated with a standardized prednisone taper according to
      whether they had severe or limited disease at study entry, prednisone taper will be completed
      at week 16.

      The investigators plan to enroll 28 patients who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to
      rituximab or placebo. The investigators estimate accrual of these subjects will take 18
      months from study initiation. Once enrolled, subjects are followed for 52 weeks until the
      primary endpoint is assessed.
