      cesarean section, in obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30kg/m2 at time of delivery) women,
      can decrease the cesarean operative time compared to using silk tape to retract the
      panniculus. Operative time is defined as the time from when the patient lies on the operating
      room table (at completion of the epidural/spinal anesthesia) until fascial closure.
