      activity can be effective in producing weight losses of 4% to 9% of initial bodyweight. If
      maintained, this level of weight loss can reduce hypertension, high blood glucose, and
      elevated lipids. However, weight losses often plateau after 6 months, and weight regain
      begins after 12 months. Accordingly, there is interest in interventions, such as Web-based
      reinforcement and brief counseling to maintain weight loss over time and in the relative
      cost-effectiveness of program delivery modes.

      Most obesity treatment programs focus on outcomes for individuals without assessing
      population-based cost savings. This study suggests that a broader perspective can help to
      identify the benefit of weight management in adult populations. Accordingly, this study
      assessed the cost-effectiveness of a weight management program in a population of adults
      served by a large health care system-the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), the agency that
      manages the TRICARE health care benefits for active-duty service members, retired service
      members, their families, National Guard/Reserve members, and their families. The annual
      direct medical costs of overweight/obesity for beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Prime are
      estimated to exceed $1.1 billion. This study investigated the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of methods to deliver a cognitive-behavioral weight loss intervention.
