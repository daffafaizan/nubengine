      Disorder, Asperger's disorder and so called Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise
      Specified. Children with PDD show delays in speech and language and reduced social
      interaction. Some children with PDD also have behavior problems, including defiance of rules,
      aggression, and tantrums. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new Parent Training
      program designed to decrease these behavior problems and improve daily living skills.

      Following confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either Parent Training or a Psychoeducational Program. The Parent Training program involves
      specific suggestions about how to deal with behavior problems. The Psychoeducational program
      covers specific issues related to autism and parenting, including an co-occurring medical
      conditions and treatment options.

      Parents will attend up to 13 one-on-one sessions with a trained therapist over a 24-week
      period. Participation in the study also involves 2 home visits and 6 monthly assessment
      visits. The purpose of the assessment visits is to evaluate the child's response to
      treatment. Evaluations will also be conducted at 3 and 6 months after completion of the
      study.
