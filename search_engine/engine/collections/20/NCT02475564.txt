      in about 60% of adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. Some researchers
      have investigated the antiproliferative effect of resveratrol in endometriosis using animal
      models and humans. The reduction in the size and activity of the endometriotic implants has
      been observed with the use of resveratrol. The reduction of pain in patients with
      endometriosis is an important aspect of the quality of life. The use of a medication with few
      side effects and the lack of clinical quality trials justify this study, which aims to verify
      whether the use of 40 mg of resveratrol per day associated with monophasic contraceptive pill
      reduces pelvic pain at the end of 2 months of treatment, compared to the use of the pill with
      placebo. This study will be randomized, prospective, double blind with two arms of 22
      patients; the CONSORT parameters will be followed. The degree of pain by visual analog scale,
      prolactin levels (ng / mL) and the carcinoembryonic antigen levels (CA125) (IU / L) will be
      measured at the begging and at the end of trial. These parameters will be the outcomes.
