    
      The symptom scores for determining eligibility will be established during the 2-week Run-in
      Period using eDiary and the eligible patients will be randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to
      one of two treatment cohorts at the baseline visit.

      In Cohort 1 (n=24), patients will receive inhaled 40 mg PA101 three times daily and inhaled
      placebo three times daily via eFlow for 6 weeks each in a double-blind, 2-period crossover
      fashion with a 4-week washout period between the treatment periods.

      In Cohort 2 (n=12), patients will receive inhaled 40 mg PA101 three times daily via eFlow and
      oral cromolyn sodium 200 mg four times daily for 6 weeks each in an open label, 2-period
      crossover fashion with a 4-week washout period between the treatment periods.

      Patients will be allowed to use the same daily doses of pre-randomization H1 and H2
      antihistamines as well as the same daily doses of any other allowed medications during each
      treatment period.

      Visits during each treatment period will occur at the baseline Visit, and at the end of Weeks
      1, 2, 4, and 6.

      Blood and urine samples will be collected to test for various biomarkers. In a subset of
      patients, additional clinical assessments of the skin will be performed and blood samples
      will be collected for pharmacokinetic assessments. Clinical safety assessments will be
      performed in all patients at the start and end of each treatment period.
