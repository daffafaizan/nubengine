      with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). The overall aim of the present study is to
      investigate the implementability of an overground locomotor training program using a powered
      exoskeleton in persons with a subacute iSCI at the Institut de réadaptation en déficience
      physique de Québec, with and without functional electrical stimulation (FES). Over the 2-year
      period of the project, a logic model will be co-developed with stakeholders to support
      clinicians and administrators in the management of the locomotor training program. Using
      qualitative and quantitative research methods, we will evaluate the feasibility and perceived
      barriers/facilitators to the implementation in clinical practice of the training program.
      Finally, a crossover design with individuals receiving the intervention either combined with
      FES or not, will allow quantifying of the benefits of combining FES in addition to robotic
      gait training on functional walking capacity in persons with a subacute iSCI.
