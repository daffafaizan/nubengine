    
      Diabetes mellitus is the most significant disorder associated with varied oral manifestation
      ranging from xerostomia (subjective sensation od dry mouth) to serious bacterial and fungal
      infections due to alterations in flow rate of saliva.

      Systemic agents increase rate of stimulated salivary flow but often have unfavourable side
      effects such as profuse sweating, rhinitis, dyspepsia.

      Use of TENS in stimulation of saliva has been studied in the past which showed moderate
      promising results. However, it never became a part of the mainstream therapy of
      hyposalivation.

      It has been postulated that transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) could directly
      stimulate the auriculotemporal nerve, which supplies the parotid gland, whereas it remains
      unclear whether there is also an indirect action (via afferent pathways) onto the salivary
      reflex arch.

      Starting a prevention program as early as possible considering the most practical, cost
      effective and efficient treatments with the best risk-benefit ratio will help to diminish dry
      mouth symptoms and sequelae (intraoral and extraoral complications).
