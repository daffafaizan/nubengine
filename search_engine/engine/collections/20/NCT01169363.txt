      Primary

        -  To validate a pre-specified proteomic classifier to predict the likelihood of complete
           response (CR) to cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy in older patients with non-M3
           acute myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To identify signaling nodes associated with risk of relapse among these patients who
           achieve a CR to induction chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are analyzed to validate the
      association of a pre-specified proteomic signature with clinical response via flow cytometry.
