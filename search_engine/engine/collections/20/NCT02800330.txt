      24 hours to the hospital for pharmacokinetic blood sampling on day 21, 49 and 77 (Â± 1-2
      days). Patients will be randomized into 2 sequence groups (respectively sequences phase A-B-C
      or phase C-B-A). The patient will use regorafenib alone (phase A) or with esomeprazole for
      five days (phases B and C). To (completely) rule out a pH-dependent DDI between regorafenib
      and esomeprazole, during phase B of the study regorafenib is given concomitantly for five
      days, while during phase C regorafenib is given 3 hours after esomeprazole intake for five
      days (when the intragastric pH is maximally elevated by esomeprazole).
