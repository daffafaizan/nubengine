      arrhythmias will be submitted to mapping of both voltage and tissue impedance. Likewise, the
      accuracy of the two maps identifying the extent and transmurality of the infarction will be
      assesssed by gadolinium imaging. The impedance system is already constructed and certified
      for clinical research use.
