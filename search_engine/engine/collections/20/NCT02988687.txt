      capacity, endothelial function, inflammatory biomarkers, bone mineral density, lipoprotein
      metabolism, and self-reported quality of Life (QOL) in patients suffering from adult growth
      hormone deficiency (AGHD). One of the causes for AGHD is traumatic brain injury (TBI), a
      condition that affects approximately 20% of Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),
      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation New Dawn (OND). Because OIF/OEF/OND Veterans are
      a new population, there is a paucity of data regarding the effects of rhGH in these patients.
      The investigators propose to perform a pilot observational study of Veterans with confirmed
      adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) due to TBI who have been prescribed recombinant human
      growth hormone (rhGH) replacement in order to determine changes in metabolic parameters and
      QOL induced by rhGH.

      Our hypothesis is that GH replacement will improve QOL and metabolic parameters (glucose,
      insulin resistance, lipids, inflammatory markers, and body composition) in patients with
      confirmed AGHD due to TBI.The primary aim for this proposal is to determine the effects of
      rhGH treatment given daily for 6 months to Veterans with TBI and AGHD on QoL measured by the
      Quality of Life Assessment for GHD in Adults questionnaire (QoL-AGHDA, primary outcome).
      Secondary specific aims for this proposal are to gather high quality pilot data of the
      effects of 6 months of rhGH replacement in Veterans with TBI and AGHD.
