    
      Impaired hyperoxic chemoreflex sensitivity (CHRS) is assessed in patients with stage 3 CKD
      [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2], in patients with stage 4 CKD [GFR
      15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2], as well as in patients without any evidence of CKD. CHRS is measured
      by determination of the venous partial pressure of oxygen and the heart rate before and after
      deactivation of the chemoreceptors by inhalation of pure oxygen. The difference in the R-R
      intervals before and after inhalation divided by the difference in the oxygen pressures is
      calculated as the CHRS. A CHRS below 3.0 ms/mmHg is defined as pathological. It should be
      shown that using a simple clinical bedside test we provide the first evidence for impaired
      hyperoxic chemoreflex sensitivity in stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease. We thereby may lay
      the basis for future intervention studies assessing chemosensor function in these patients.
