      more than 30 years ago as a fasciocutaneous flap for microsurgical transfer. It was soon
      after established as a safe and reliable flap for transfer of fascia and cutaneous tissue.
      Currently, it is used to repair any defect in which a relatively thin island of skin is
      needed with a fascial strength layer . While the flap itself is very reliable, it leaves a
      donor site that can be very unsightly and has multiple known complications including loss of
      pronation, pain, paresthesias, cold intolerance, and skin graft necrosis. The donor site is
      typically covered with a split thickness skin graft (hereafter referred to as STSG). In an
      effort to minimize these complications, several groups have described a technique of placing
      IntegraÂ© dermal substitute (hereafter referred to as Integra) underneath the STSG to provide
      a thicker support and decrease overall morbidity associated with the defect. These studies
      have shown success in decreasing overall morbidity including increasing range of motion and
      improving aesthetic quality of the donor site. However, the largest study to date has
      included only 29 subjects. Furthermore, these studies do not provide a comparative cohort of
      subjects repaired with a classic STSG to show effectiveness of this technique when compared
      to a classic repair. Our goal is to perform a prospective study comparing subjects repaired
      with a classic STSG and those repaired with one step Integra and STSG applied at the same
      time. These subjects will be evaluated for overall donor site aesthetic quality and
      functional outcome as described below.
