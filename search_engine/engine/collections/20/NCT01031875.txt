      Primary

        -  To evaluate the activity of daily oral doses of pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy in
           patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy in a
           population of chemotherapy pretreated patients.

        -  To assess progression-free survival of these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To evaluate the ability of whole-body 18FDG-PET to image metastases and monitor tumor
           response and to determine the rate of concordance with CT imaging and RECIST response
           criteria.

        -  To evaluate the relationship existing between tumor response measured by 18FDG-PET and
           progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo whole-body 18FDG-PET at baseline and periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years.
