    
      BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin
      C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid
      dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a cell membrane phospholipid (clinical formulation
      BXQ-350). Given via intravenous IV, data indicate that the agent exhibits the propensity to
      enter the body and brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and induce cell death. DIPG and DMG
      present a treatment dilemma due to resistance to standard therapy (radiotherapy) and
      aggressive clinical course. The use of BXQ-350 provides a novel approach to the treatment of
      cancer through interaction with the cancer cell membrane. This drug appears to be well
      tolerated in previous clinical trials, and in combination with the standard of care radiation
      therapy, may help improve overall survival in these patients.

      The study is divided into 2 parts:

      Part 1: Dose Escalation and Safety - Sequential cohorts of patients 1-30 years of age with
      newly diagnosed DIPG or DMG will be treated with escalating doses of BXQ-350 until the MTD is
      established, or in the absence of a Maximum Administered Dose, the highest planned dose level
      is reached.

      Part 2: BXQ-350 Tumor and Plasma Concentrations - Patients undergoing neurosurgical biopsy
      prior to receiving radiation therapy will be enrolled and receive BXQ-350 at the MTD
      determined in Part 1, or at the highest planned dose level, and radiation therapy. Excised
      tumor tissue will be evaluated for SapC levels and pharmacodynamic effects.
