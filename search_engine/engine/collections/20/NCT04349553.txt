    
      This is a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      single-centre study involving 45 healthy participants. The aim is to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of Entervax, a combination vaccine against enteric fever comprising Typhi ZH9
      (hereafter ZH9) plus an engineered derivative that will provide an immune response to the key
      antigens (LPS 0:2 and H:a flagella) from S. Paratyphi A (hereafter ZH9PA). ZH9PA has not
      previously been tested in humans therefore the first two cohorts comprise a dose escalation
      of ZH9PA and the final cohort comprises a single dose level of the combination of ZH9PA and
      ZH9.
