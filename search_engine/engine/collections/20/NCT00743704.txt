      airway inflammation with sputum neutrophilia and elevated concentrations of inflammatory
      mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum supernatants. In this study, ozone at a
      concentration of 250 ppb will be inhaled for three hours in an ozone challenge chamber.

      In a recent study, ozone challenge has been discussed as a model for pulmonary diseases
      dominated by neutrophilic inflammation such as COPD, providing the possibility to test new
      anti-inflammatory substances in early stages of clinical development.
