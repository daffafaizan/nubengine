    
      To the study will be recruited women who have completed 40 weeks of pregnancy and have not
      yet given birth, with proper evaluation of mother and fetus.

      Women who are fit to participate and had given their consent, will be computerized randomized
      to one of three groups.

      Research groups:

        1. Group who receives acupuncture treatment in order to accelerate the development of
           birth.

        2. Group who receives sham treatment - non acupuncture treatment, but a similar treatment,
           so that the patient is unable to know whether she is receiving a real acupuncture
           treatment, or the similar one, which has no effect on the patient.

        3. Group who does not receive any treatment and will be reviewed a week later, unless a
           spontaneous birth will be developed. (Procedure accepted today) The study will be
           carried out between week 40 and week 41. During the week acupuncture treatment, sham
           treatment or conservative follow-up will be carried out, depending on the study group
           differentiation.

      All women who will be randomized to the treatment groups, will fill a preliminary
      questionnaire for acupuncture treatment.

      The course of treatment: During the week of study the women in the treatments groups will
      receive treatment every 48-72 hours, a maximum of three treatments.

      Measures will be taken on the following week or two when the women will come to give birth.
