      postoperative pain and opioid consumption in total knee arthro-plasty patients.

      Fifty patients undergoing unilateral TKA will be randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions,
      total of 80 minutes of real (n=25) or sham tDCS (n=25). Stimulation will be given on 4
      consecutive postoperative days, group 1 will receive real stimulation with the active
      electrode over the leg representation of the motor strip (cortical motor area of the leg) and
      the reference electrode over the arm, group 2 will receive Sham tDCS.

      Pain level will be evaluated according to visual analogue scale (VAS) and LANSS pain scale
      before (baseline) after 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th sessions.
