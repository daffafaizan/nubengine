      Candida bloodstream isolates are non-albicans Candida species requiring the use of treatments
      active against them.

      Because of the high risk associated with candida infection in premature babies and
      fluconazole prophylaxis is now recommended in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) with a
      high incidence in fungal infections. As candida infection is difficult to prove and requires
      an urgent treatment, in particular to avoid central nervous system (CNS) infection, treatment
      is often started in high risk patients when the infection is only suspected, i.e. on clinical
      arguments without waiting for positive cultures (10% of cases).

      Fluconazole has not been approved for use in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. In
      contrast, the efficacy of echinocandins for the treatment of invasive candidiasis has been
      suggested by pre-clinical and clinical studies.

      Related to Micafungin, the available data suggest that only dosages that are greater than
      what currently recommended in infants (2 to 4 mg/kg/day) may ensure adequate coverage of the
      CNS, given that ability of low dosages of micafungin to penetrate the cerebrospinal
      compartment and to diffuse in the cerebrospinal fluid is deemed suboptimal.

      The doses that will be administered are higher that currently used in order to optimize
      efficacy, and the concept of a loading dose that will be used for both drugs in this project,
      is present in antifungal treatment strategies for adults, but it has never been applied to
      infants and preterm neonates.
