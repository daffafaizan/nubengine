    
      A randomized prospective study of the use of single dose of the long acting GnRH antagonist
      Degarelix for ovarian stimulation cycle in oocyte donors: Ovarian stimulation started on
      cycle Day2 with gonadotropins 175-300 IU and either GnRH antagonist single dose Degarelix or
      multidose GnRH antagonist Ganirelix initiated on Day6 of the stimulation cycle. Agonist
      triggering was used in both groups for oocyte maturation. Blastocyst formation rate and Live
      Birth Rates were estimated for both groups.
