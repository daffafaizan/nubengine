      to send all patients copies of the letters sent to their general practitioners following
      outpatient consultations. The current Secretary of State for Health has further extended this
      proposal and suggested that patients should have a specific letter to themselves after a
      hospital consultation.

      The aim of this study is to send patients both a copy of the letter sent to their GPs and a
      specific letter to themselves and to assess the usefulness and comprehensibility of each.
      This study will assess the two styles of letter in Cardiology and Respiratory Outpatient
      Clinics staffed by 7 consultants and will involve a group of 15-20 patients from each of the
      clinics, total number approximately 150 patients.

      All patients attending the clinics will be given a sheet outlining the study before their
      consultations. If they are interested in the study, patients will be given a Patient
      Information Sheet and asked consent to take part. The length of each of the two dictated
      letters will be recorded. To avoid costs to the NHS, the direct to patient letters will be
      typed at the study investigators' cost. Two copies of each letter, a short explanatory letter
      and a questionnaire will be sent to the patient and the patient will be asked to circle
      points in each of the letters which are unclear and return them to the department. At the end
      of the study the general practitioners will be contacted and asked their views about the two
      letters.
