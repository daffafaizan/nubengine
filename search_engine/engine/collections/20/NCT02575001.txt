      has been noted. These observations could also be connected to an increased prevalence of
      stressful experiences and a lowered stress tolerance in some children.

      The way a person responds to stress is determined by the interplay of genetic and
      environmental factors. Environmental experiences at specific times of development have been
      shown to shape individual's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) stress response.
      It is known, that early development of central nervous system is critically dependent on
      child's interaction with the environment (experience dependent maturation), especially to the
      attachment to caregivers (most often the mother). Appropriate caregiving is connected to
      lower basal cortisol levels in children and a more stable HPA axis response after the
      exposure to stress. Any circumstances that disturbed the formation of the attachment to the
      primary caregiver (e.g. complications at delivery, psychosocial stressors affecting the
      mother or mother's postpartum depression) resulted in higher HPA axis responsiveness to
      stress in the affected children.

      Changes in individual genes have also been shown to influence a person's susceptibility to
      stress and risk for the development of stress-induced psychopathology.
