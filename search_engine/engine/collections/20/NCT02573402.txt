      which respond to TTNS will be identified as seen on urodynamic studies (USD). Then,
      responders will be invited to participate in a randomized control trial of a 2-week protocol
      of TTNS to test for safety and efficacy during inpatient rehabilitation to evaluate bladder
      changes based upon pre- and post- urodynamic testing, as well as 2-month follow-up.
