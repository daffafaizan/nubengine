    
      The general flow of the study will be conducted as follows:

        1. Research coordinator will call or approach patients who are scheduled for a surgical
           procedure that is planning for a peripheral nerve block either for the primary
           anesthetic or for postoperative pain control to be placed in the preoperative bay in the
           ambulatory surgical center.

        2. Research coordinator will discuss the purpose of our study and explain the study in
           detail for the patient. If a patient agrees to participate, then we will have the
           patient sign the informed consent for the study. If patient is on the phone and decides
           to participate, the patient will sign the informed consent upon arriving to Penn
           Medicine University City (PMUC).

        3. Once the patient signs the informed consent for the peripheral nerve block by anesthesia
           team. The patient randomized will be revealed to either music or IV midazolam. The
           pre-procedure anxiety score will then be obtained using the STAI-6 validated tool.

        4. The golden moment will be conducted between the patient, provider, and nursing staff.
           Once this golden moment is completed, the anxiolytic intervention will start (music or
           IV midazolam)*

        5. The preoperative nerve block will be conducted by the regional anesthesia block team.

        6. Once the nerve block is complete, we will obtain the post-procedure anxiety score using
           the STAI-6 validated tool.

        7. Once the post-procedure anxiety score has been obtained, we will also obtain the patient
           satisfaction score, the provider satisfaction score, and the evaluation of any
           difficulties in communication between the provider and patient. After these questions
           have been obtained, the study is complete.
