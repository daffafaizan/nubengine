      endoscopic images of bile duct and permits various diagnostic or therapeutic intraductal
      interventions. Usually assisting accessories such as balloon catheter is demanded for an
      endoscope to advance into the bile duct. Possible diagnostic applications of DPOC include
      evaluation of indeterminate bile duct strictures, precise mapping and delineation of
      intraductal tumor spread before resection, differentiation of benign versus malignant
      intraductal masses, evaluation of ductal ischemia after liver transplant and confirmation of
      bile duct clearance after endoscopic stone removal. And therapeutic applications of DPOC
      include intraductal lithotripsy, intraductal tumor ablation therapy by argon plasma
      coagulation, photodynamic therapy or radiofrequency ablation, direct stone or migrated stent
      removal, selective guidewire access, and biliary drainage. The investigators evaluated the
      success rate by useful accessories and various diagnostic and therapeutic intraductal
      procedures under DPOC.
