      First endpoint:

      To assess the effect of high n-3 PUFA (Omega 3) egg, as compared to regular- high n-6 PUFA
      (Omega 6) Israeli egg, on glycemic levels after night fasting and post prandial of 2 egg
      breakfast test meal.

      Secondary endpoint:

      To compare the effect of high n-3 PUFA fortified egg versus high n-6 PUFA (Regular) egg on
      measures associated with CVD risks including: CRP, LDL oxidation, MDA, post prandial Flow
      mediated dilatation (FMD), liver enzymes, and blood lipids and lipoproteins, and further
      blood chemistry measures.

      Third endpoint:

      To assess the influence of n-3 Egg on erythrocytes fatty acid profile.

      Study design: Prospective, Crossover, Compared Study Study population: 20 Healthy subjects

      Study Methods:

      Subjects will complete two study stages. In first stage study participants will get 3 weeks
      regimen including 2 Regular, Israeli (high n-6 Pufa) eggs/day.

      In second stage after 3 weeks washout without eggs, study participants will get 3 weeks
      regimen with 2 high n-3Pufa eggs/day.
