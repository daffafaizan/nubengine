      minocycline-resistant bacteria after long-term use of minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg in
      subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis. This will be assessed through
      monitoring the total number and proportion of minocycline-resistant bacteria and the identity
      of minocycline-resistant species within a panel of 40 representative periodontal species in
      saliva and subgingival plaque.
