             -  premenopausal female patients with a pregnancy possibility

             -  patients with diabetes

             -  indication for surgical AAA repair

             -  life expectancy <2 years

             -  contraindications for metformin, i.e. severely reduced kidney function (eGFR <30
                ml/min), liver dysfunction, pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, malnutrition and
                decompensated heart failure STUDY PERIODS

             -  1-2 year recruitment

             -  1 year treatment

             -  12 month follow-up INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG

      Metformin:

      initial dose: 500 mg 1-0-1 target dose: 1000 mg 1-0-1 COMPARATIVE DRUG /CONTROL CONDITION
      Placebo Initial and target dose: tablets 1-0-1 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION Allowed (standard of
      care) EFFICACY ENDPOINTS AAA growth (in maximum diameter) over 1 year TOLERABILITY / SAFETY
      surgery when AAA>5.5 cm for men, > 5 cm for women

      Metformin Therapy for AAA Department of Surgery, Division of Vascular Surgery Medical
      University of Vienna, Austria

      ENDPOINTS

      adverse drug reactions liver insufficiency sustained reduction of kidney function with
      glomeral filtration rate <30 mg/dl (upon temporary renal insufficiency, infections,
      exsiccosis, diarrhea and lactic acidosis, metformin treatment will only be paused)

      PHARMACOKINETIC / PHARMACODYNAMIC ENDPOINTS

        -  glucose

        -  insulin

        -  Interleukin-6

        -  markers of neutrophil activation (MPO, elastase, NGAL)

      QUALITY OF LIFE / PHARMACOECONOMIC ENDPOINTS gastrointestinal discomfort (as assessed in the
      initial drop-out phase for patient exclusion)

      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY Primary Endpoint AAA growth at 12 months in mm

      Null and alternative hypotheses:

      H0: Metformin does not reduce AAA growth

      H1: Metformin reduces AAA growth from mean 1.7 to 0.4 mm per year Type-I and -II errors:

      Significance: 5% Power: 80% 1.7±3.3 mm (mean±SD) without Metformin and 0.4±2.3 mm (mean±SD)
      with Metformin treatment Sample size calculation 77 per group plus 16 patients drop out Total
      N= 170 Statistical methodology Main analysis set: per protocol Primary endpoint: analysis of
      covariance adjusted for baseline AAA diameter Pharmacokinetic endpoints: analysis of
      covariance adjusted for baseline value. Parametric assumptions will be graphically checked
      with histograms.

      In case of non-normal distributions analysis of covariance will be performed after a
      logarithmic or rank transformation.

      Safety endpoints will be described by cumulative incidence curves
