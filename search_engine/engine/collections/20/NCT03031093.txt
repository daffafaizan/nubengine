    
      This study has the objective to clarify the factors that directly influence the effectiveness
      of inhaled drug deposition in obese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and then formulate specific strategies to control the evolution of this disease. The
      suggested strategy in order to implement the aerosol therapy is the use of High Flow Nasal
      Cannula (HFNC) during these patientÂ´s inhalation therapy.

      It will consist in a cross-over clinical trial. The population will be composed by volunteers
      of both genders, aged between 45-70 years old. Four distinct groups will be formed: obese
      participants without copd; obese participants with copd; non obese participants without copd;
      non-obese participants with copd.
