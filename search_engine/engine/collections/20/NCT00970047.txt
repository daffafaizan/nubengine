    
      This is an observational study whereby samples will be tested to determine the presence or
      absence of fetal Y chromosome genes to test for the fetal sex of the baby. The blood draw
      will occur between 6 to 16 weeks of gestation. The fetal gender will be requested at or soon
      after delivery if fetal sex was not previously obtained by CVS or amniocentesis genetic
      analysis.
