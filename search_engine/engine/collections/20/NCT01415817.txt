      with our staff endoscopist as our study population. The investigators measured adenoma
      detection rates for a baseline period then randomly assigned half of the endoscopists to
      undergo EQUIP training. The investigators then examined baseline and post-training study
      adenoma detection rates (ADR's) for all endoscopist (trained and un-trained) to evaluate the
      impact of training.
