      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) after
      failure to anthracycline-based regimen (pazopanib vs placebo, 4.6 vs 1.6 months, HR=0.31, 95%
      CI 0.24-0.40; P < .0001). Regarding sunitinib (continuous daily dose of 37.5mg), after a
      median duration of 10 months, median OS and PFS were 19 months and 17 months, respectively in
      a small retrospective study (ASPS, N=9). With regard to cediranib, 6-month PFS was over 60%.
      In addition, randomized phase II trial of sunitinib vs cediranib with cross-over at disease
      progression was recently initiated (NCT01391962). However, the efficacy of pazopanib is
      unknown in metastatic ASPS.
