      metaphase II stage upon their retrieval. Following some incidents, in our experience as well
      as others', where women injected hCG too early but oocytes were still retrieved with high
      proportion of maturity, we decided to delay OPU intentionally in women who had low percentage
      oocyte maturity in previous cycles.
