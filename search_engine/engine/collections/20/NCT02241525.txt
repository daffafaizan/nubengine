      enhancement and CNR will be described using mean values and standard deviations for
      continuous variables, and frequencies and percent for categorical variables. Difference
      between the two patient groups will be compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests and
      chi-square statistics for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. All statistical
      tests will be performed at a significance level of 0.05.
