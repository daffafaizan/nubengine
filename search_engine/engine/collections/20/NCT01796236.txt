      implants are related to adverse skin reactions around the abutment. The reduction of the skin
      also adds complexity to the surgical procedure that is otherwise a routine type of skin
      incision. A less invasive surgical technique avoiding reducing the thickness of the skin
      would render a simpler and shorter procedure and would be aesthetically appealing to the
      patients, as permanent hair removal in the area around the abutment would not be required.
      Faster healing and less numbness (sensory loss/ paraesthesia) at the implant site may also be
      expected if the soft tissue thickness is left intact.

      The Cochlea Baha BA300 Abutment together with a surgical procedure that includes soft tissue
      reduction was CE marked in April 2010. The test abutment, Cochlear Baha BA400, together with
      a surgical procedure that does not require soft tissue reduction was CE marked in June 2012.

      The rationale behind this investigation was to make a 'head-to-head' comparison between the
      BA300 and BA400 Abutment and the associated surgical techniques in order to collect
      information regarding complications (inflammation/infection, numbness and pain), aesthetic
      outcome and utilisation of direct medical cost associated with surgery.
