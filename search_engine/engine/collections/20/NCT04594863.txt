      cachexia, it may be associated with SIRT-6 expression. This study will collect and test the
      peripheral blood sample of patients, use it as an important indicator of the degree of
      cachexia, and provide references for clinical drug intervention, prognosis and dietary
      intervention for cachexia patients. If possible, fat sample of the patients will be collected
      during surgery, and the adipose progenitor cells will be cultured to find the key target
      proteins by detecting differences in protein expression, changes in protein modification
      levels, and protein interactions.
