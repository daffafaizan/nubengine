      associated with significant morbidity and premature death. Allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation (BMT) is the only potential cure for severe hemoglobinopathies. Typical
      regimens have used high doses of chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy to ablate recipient
      hematopoiesis and to prevent graft rejection. The widespread use of this treatment has been
      limited by toxicity, risk of end-organ damage, and donor availability. This study will use a
      nonmyeloablative regimen of fludarabine and busulfan to attempt to generate consistent
      engraftment with donor hematopoietic stem cells in patients with severe hemoglobinopathy.

      G-CSF mobilization of the donor's peripheral blood white blood cells will precede donor
      apheresis. A nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen of fludarabine and busulfan will be
      administered to patients prior to allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell infusions. FK506 and
      prednisone will be administered for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients
      will be evaluated for engraftment, donor: host hematopoietic chimerism, toxicity, and
      hemoglobinopathy.
