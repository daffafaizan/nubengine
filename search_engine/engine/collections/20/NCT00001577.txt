    
      Patients with extremity melanoma (Stage IIIA, IIIAB or Stage IV disease who have bulky
      symptomatic tumor located in the extremity) or patients with unresectable extremity sarcoma
      will undergo a double isolated limb perfusion with melphalan alone separated by approximately
      4 to 6 weeks. The initial perfusion will be done with a melphalan dose of 6 mg/L limb volume
      and the interval perfusion with a dose of 9 mg/L limb volume. For patients with extremity
      sarcoma the tumor will be excised if feasible using a limb sparing resection between 6-12
      weeks after the second perfusion. Technical feasibility of the double perfusion schedule will
      be determined. Overall response, duration of response, patterns of recurrence, and survival
      will be followed.
