      (EUSOS study). Postoperative pulmonary complications are a major factor, which increase
      patient morbidity and mortality (PERISCOPE study). This study is designed to evaluate the
      effects of management of neuromuscular blockade on postoperative pulmonary complications in a
      general unrestricted anaesthetized population across Europe. The investigation will be a
      continuation of the European EUSOS and PERISCOPE studies. Based on a well-recognised body of
      surrogate data, it is hypothesized that incorrect approaches to the use, monitoring, and
      reversal of muscle relaxants will increase the incidence of in-hospital postoperative
      pulmonary complications and prolong hospital stay.

      The investigators will not modify a participating centre's customary management of patients.
      Patients with postoperative pulmonary complications will be identified by postoperative
      assessment and consulting medical records for events that fulfil the definition of
      postoperative pulmonary complications.
