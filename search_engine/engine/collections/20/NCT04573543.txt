      with systemic changes in immune response. Semaphorins were recently recognized as one of the
      key regulators of immune responses; while some suppress immune cells activation,
      proliferation, and production of inflammatory cytokines, others stimulate immune responses.
      We have previously shown that semaphorins are associated with pathogenesis of viral hepatitis
      and progression of fibrosis. However, their role in NAFLD is unknown. The hypothesis of this
      project is that semaphorins are regulators of inflammation in patients with NAFLD. This study
      is designed as a prospective, non-interventional study. The main aims are: (1) to analyze
      serum concentration of semaphorins in patients with NAFLD; (2) to analyze tissue expression
      of semaphorins in patients with NAFLD; (3) to analyze semaphorin gene polymorphisms
      associated with NAFLD. Semaphorins could be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker as
      well as targets for immune modulation.
