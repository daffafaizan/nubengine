      prevalence is increasing. However, their outcomes are less than optimal.

      An effective and inexpensive solution to minimizing surgical complications and expediting
      recovery following lumbar spine surgery could be supplementation using high doses of vitamin
      C, also known as ascorbic acid. Vit C can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and
      improve immune system and body's own chemicals to fight pain.

      The researchers want to examine if Vit C is effective in decreasing pain and pain medications
      and improving function. Gaining a better understanding of effects of Vit C on patient
      recovery may lead to improved outcomes.
