    
      A prospective, pilot implementation evaluation of patient-centered differentiated care
      service. The core components of the multifaceted implementation strategy include: 1)
      3-monthly refills, 2) direct-to-pharmacy refill visits, 3) HIV self-testing (HIVST) while
      waiting for refills, 4) Rapid risk assessment for ongoing risk, adherence, side effect, and
      acute HIV symptoms. Clinics will implement either: 1) current PrEP patient flow without any
      change or 2) a pilot differentiated pharmacy-based follow up PrEP care pathway. Clinics will
      implement only one delivery model thus eliminating risk for confusion in the clinic about
      delivery models and permitting a full-scale test of the system, since the efficiency in PrEP
      delivery is in part at the system level, above and beyond the individual client encounter.
      For this pilot project designed to primarily test delivery efficiency, feasibility and
      acceptability of direct-to-pharmacy care pathway at systems level using existing public
      health infrastructure, pilot and control clinics will be of comparable size selected to
      reflect the implementation nature of the design.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To evaluate whether a differentiated care model improves the efficiency of PrEP
      delivery while resulting in equivalent or better: 1) patient waiting time, 2) early PrEP
      continuation, and 3) adherence.

      Aim 2: Conduct mixed-methods study to understand patient and provider perception, experiences
      , feasibility and acceptability of a differentiated PrEP delivery model.

      Aim 3: Assess the efficiency, cost and cost-effectiveness of a facility-based differentiated
      PrEP care.
