      a tool for assessing the elasticity of the soft tissues in buttocks and measuring the
      elasticity of these tissues with and without bearing weight on a healthy population to set
      standards of normal values.

      The far purpose of the research is to use ultrasound device for predicting the development of
      pressure ulcers.

      Population and Methods: In this study, Up to 15 healthy people will participate. Each
      participant will pass ultrasound scans of the buttocks, lying down and sitting on a chair
      designed for the purpose of research and this after signing an informed consent form.

      The process:

        1. The participant lies on his stomach on a bed to determine the location of the muscle
           that will be marked by a marker.By ultrasound, the investigator measures the thickness
           of fat and muscle tissues between the Ischial Tuberosity (ITs) and the skin.

        2. The participant sits without bearing weight on a chair built for this study, the seat is
           constructed from five straps. Non-weight bearing test is when the straps are far from
           the test area, the transducer is placed on the marked place, thickness and elasticity of
           muscle tissue and fat will be measured.

        3. The participant sits with bearing weight on the chair. weight bearing test is when the
           straps are close to the test area , the transducer is placed on the marked place,
           thickness and elasticity of muscle tissue and fat will be measured.

      After measuring the elasticity of the soft tissues,the data will be analyzed in order to
      define ranges of differences between elasticity with and without weight bearing.
