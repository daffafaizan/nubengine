      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of atezolizumab in combination with immunogenic
      chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin) with rituximab (R-GEMOX-ATEZO) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including
      determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      R-GEMOX-ATEZO.

      II. Evaluate on-treatment changes in density of and proximity between immune cell subsets in
      the tumor microenvironment after immunogenic chemotherapy alone and R-GEMOX-ATEZO by
      multispectral immunofluorescence, including density of CD8+ cells and cytotoxic lymphocyte
      (CTL):regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate genomic (e.g. gene expression
      profiles, whole exome sequencing) characteristics of patients with rel/ref transformed DLBCL
      treated with R-GEMOX-ATEZO.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), gemcitabine IV, and
      oxaliplatin IV every 2 weeks. Starting cycle 2, patients also receive atezolizumab IV over
      30-60 minutes every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 14 days of cycle 1 and every 28 days for
      up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive rituximab IV and atezolizumab over 30-60 minutes IV on
      day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 1 year.
