      preoperatively. Anterior Chamber Depth & lens thickness will be measured by Optical Biometry
      (lenstar 900) as well as measurement of the angle & lens vault using the Ultrasound
      Biomicrosopy (UBM) before and 1 month after cataract surgery. IOP will be measured pre- &
      postoperatively on day 7 and 30. Possible Risk (s): Risks of surgery(hemorrhage,
      endophthalmitis), Risks for investigations: minimal risk of infection To minimize the risk of
      infection: adherence to pre-& intraoperative infection-control measures, postoperative UBM is
      to be done at 1 month.
