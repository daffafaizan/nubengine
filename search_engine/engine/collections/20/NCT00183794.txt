    
      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine the response rate, time to progression and survival (secondary) of the
      combination of docetaxel and gemcitabine administered on a weekly basis to patients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer

      Secondary Objective:

        1. To determine the toxicity of this combination regimen in patients with
           platinum-resistant ovarian cancer

        2. To evaluate the toxicity and safety profile of a short course (one dose) of
           premedication with steroids to patients receiving weekly gemcitabine and docetaxel

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and docetaxel IV
      over 60 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or
      patient's withdrawal.
