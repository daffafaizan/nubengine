      children. Children will be recruited from families attending community agencies (e.g. Ontario
      Early Years Centres) in Hamilton. Interested parents will receive information flyers with the
      study team's contact information and instructions to contact the study team if they are
      interested in participating in the study. Interested parents will be screened for eligibility
      of their child. Information packages will be emailed or mailed to eligible families and will
      be followed-up with over the telephone in one week to obtain informed verbal consent.
      Baseline appointments will be booked for all eligible children. Informed written consent will
      be obtained at the baseline appointment before testing begins. Children will be randomized
      1:1 to either the experimental or wait-list control group. Randomization will be completed
      using a computer algorithm. All children will be assessed pre- and post-program as well as at
      follow-up, 5 weeks after the completion of the program. Children in the wait-list control
      group will be assessed one additional time at baseline. The program will run for one hour per
      week for 10 consecutive weeks. Parents will be asked to complete a checklist each week
      indicating the number of times they practiced the activities at home. A sample size of 36
      children is considered sufficient to provide 80% power to detect a medium effect size, with
      an alpha of 0.05. Eighteen children will be randomized to the experimental group and 18
      children will be randomized to the wait-list control group.
