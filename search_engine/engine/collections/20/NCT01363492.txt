      are no changes to the drug product formulation, manufacturing site, manufacturing process, or
      container closure.

      An agalsidase alfa bioreactor manufacturing process (agalAF1) utilizing animal component-free
      media replaced the previous roller bottle (RB) process.

      This study will evaluate the safety of Replagal AF, manufactured using the new bioreactor
      process at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg infused IV over 40 minutes, every other week (EOW) in children
      with Fabry disease who are 7 years to less than 18 years of age and who are naive to ERT.
