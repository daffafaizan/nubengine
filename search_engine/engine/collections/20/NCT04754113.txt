      participant's chest at the fifth or sixth intercostal space and connected it to an EIT
      monitor (PulmoVista 500; Dräger Medical GmbH, Lübeck, Germany).

      Baseline data were collected during supine position (timepoint SP1), including demographic
      and anthropometric data, a baseline arterial blood gas measurement, and ventilation
      parameters including type of supplemental oxygen, respiratory rate, fractional concentration
      of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2). The participants received instructions of end expiratory
      occlusion lasting at least 10 seconds and, 1 seconds after the start, a bolus of 10 mL of 5%
      NaCl solution was injected via the central venous catheter. Subsequently, each participant
      was helped into the prone position and data collection，end expiratory occlusion and 5% NaCl
      solution injection were preformed again after approximately 30 min (timepoint PP1). The
      participant was then encouraged to maintain the prone position for at least 3 h before being
      helped back into the supine position. Clinical data collection, end expiratory occlusion and
      injection of a bolus of 10 mL of 5% NaCl solution were repeated again 1 h after resupination
      (timepoint SP2).
