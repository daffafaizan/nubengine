    
      The primary study objective is the Detection of RAS mutational (rat sarcoma viral oncogene
      homolog) "switch" in circulating DNA by IntplexÂ® test in mCRC (metastatic colorectal cancer)
      patients treated with antibody anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), cetuximab or
      panitumumab in first line.

      The treatment and these modalities will be decided by the investigator.

      The study is based on blood sampling, the frequency of which is described below, rhythm of
      plasma samples:

      Inclusion after determination of wild status RAS tissues.

      First sampling of 2 EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tubes, then at each tumour
      evaluation during treatment with anti EGFR (epidermal growth facor receptor), every 4 cures.
      At the end of treatment or after more than 36 treatment cures, a final sample will be taken.

      No results of the samples will be communicated to the investigator, the sponsor will
      centralize these results for the final analysis of the study.
