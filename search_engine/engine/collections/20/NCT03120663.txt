      curve (AUC), clearance (Cl), distribution volume (Vd) and half life (T1/2)) for the
      antibiotics of interest (amoxicillin(-(clavulanic acid), flucloxacillin,
      piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem and clindamycin) for this adult non critically ill surgery
      population.

      Besides, the investigators want to document pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target
      attainment of frequently used ABs in this population and to identify risk factors, for
      example augmented renal clearance (ARC), for not attaining predefined PK/PD targets.
