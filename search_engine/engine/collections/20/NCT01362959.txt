      worldwide. There are about 1.2 billion smokers in the world, half of whom will die from
      diseases caused by smoking. Smoking causes 5 million deaths per year, and if present trends
      continue, 10 million smokers per year are projected to die by 2025.

      Furthermore, abstinence from the highly addictive tobacco products can lead to withdrawal
      symptoms. Although these symptoms are non-life threatening in healthy and hospitalized adults
      they are not well described in the mechanically ventilated active smoking patient.

      Retrospective studies found a higher, lower or equal mortality in critically ill patients
      receiving nicotine replacement therapy compared to patients receiving no nicotine
      replacement.

      Because of these conflicting results and the absence of a randomized controlled trial
      studying the efficacy and safety of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy in the
      critically ill smoking patient a clinical study will be conducted.
