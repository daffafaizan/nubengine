    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the maximum tolerated dose of head and neck stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) in a high risk participant population ineligible for standard chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess profiles of SBRT toxicity and examine participant (including co-morbidities), tumor
      and treatment related factors that are associated with SBRT related toxicity.

      II. Identify any dose volume parameters that are associated with SBRT related toxicity.

      III. Explore potential dose response relationships between higher SBRT dosing and
      radiographic response.

      IV. Assess impact of SBRT on participants' quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants undergo SBRT in 5 fractions at least 40 hours apart over 10-18 days.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 0.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months.
