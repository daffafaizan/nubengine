      of all cancer deaths. Within the Fred Hutchinson Center's western Washington State 13-county
      catchment area, there are enormous disparities in adult cigarette smoking rates. Our recently
      completed WebQuit website RCT for smoking cessation had low engagement and no personalization
      to users' needs. Fortunately, a potentially game-changing solution to the problems of
      engagement and lack of personalization provide a new direction for my research. Advances in
      machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are making it possible to
      create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital
      coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through
      conversations. We have developed a CA for cigarette smoking cessation. In a pilot randomized
      trial (N = 415), we will compare the experimental messaging program with the standard of care
      national government smoking cessation messaging program, and then we will compare immediate
      versus delayed access to the the experimental messaging program. Twelve-week usability,
      receptivity, and preliminary cessation results will provide critical and timely pilot data.
