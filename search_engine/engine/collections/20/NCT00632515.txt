      about your awareness of screening tests for colorectal cancer, and your attitudes toward
      colorectal cancer screening. You also will also be asked about your family's past use of
      these screening tests, and how you discuss colorectal cancer risk and screening with your
      family and health care providers. Some demographic information also will be collected (such
      as your age or marital status). The questionnaire will take between 30 and 45 minutes to
      complete.

      Your answers to the questions and your personal information will be kept strictly
      confidential. Your questionnaire answers will be identified with a code number, rather than a
      name, so that you cannot be identified.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 325 colorectal cancer patients and their close
      relatives may take part in the study. All will be enrolled MD Anderson.
