      leukemia (CML), for patients who are not candidate for an allogenic bone marrow
      transplantation. However, in advanced phase CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), development of resistance to imatinib has become the
      central issue concerning the use of imatinib as a monotherapeutic agent. The response rate
      (complete hematological remission) at the dose of 600 mg/d in poor prognosis lymphoid blast
      phase CML and Ph+ ALL was about 20% and median time to disease progression was only 2.2
      months. In VITRO studies have addressed the question of combined therapy with imatinib. A
      synergistic or additive activity has been demonstrated with vincristine and dexamethasone,
      two major drugs for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). On going clinical
      studies are also testing Gleevec™ in association with daunorubicin and cytarabine (standard
      dose) in CML in myeloid blast phase (CST571AFR01) or with MITHOXANTROME and cytarabine
      (intermediate dose) as a consolidation regiment in Ph+ ALL in first CR (CSTI571AFR03). The
      safety of the combined therapy was excellent in the two studies. Therefore, we propose to
      initiate a study to assess the efficacy and the safety of Gleevec™ combined with vincristine
      and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive
      acute lymphoblastic leukemias
