      people taking antiviral drugs daily to try to help prevent HIV infection. Studies with men
      who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women showed that people who took PrEP were less
      likely to become infected with HIV than those who did not take it.

      The main purpose of this PrEP Demonstration Project is to make PrEP accessible to people in
      the transgender community. As part of this project, we will study whether transgender women
      and men are interested in taking PrEP, and, if so, for how long and how frequently they take
      the medication and how these relate to demographics (such as race, age, and education). We
      will also assess reasons for stopping PrEP and measure sexual behaviors of participants in
      the demonstration project.
