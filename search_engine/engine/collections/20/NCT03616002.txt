      30-minute Hookah smoking session in a controlled laboratory environment to: (1) Determine the
      acute effects of Hookah smoking on large-vessel endothelial vasodilator function measured by
      brachial artery flow mediated dilation; (2) Determine the acute effects of Hookah smoking on
      micro-vessel endothelial function as measured by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial
      tonometry; (3) Determine the acute effects of Hookah smoking on pulse wave velocity and
      aortic pressure waveform measured by pulse tonometry.
