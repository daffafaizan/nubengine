      needs to be improved. According to some studies, a part of trauma patients' concomitant
      injuries weren't diagnosed in the emergency room (ER) but were diagnosed later in the
      clinics. In addition to difficult diagnostics the treatment of these patients demands close
      co- operation between many specialities.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between TBIs and facial fractures. The
      real amount of facial fractures in patients with severe TBI and the clinical significance of
      these fractures are evaluated. Also the number of patients with facial fractures and a
      concomitant TBI is evaluated. The aim is to find out the amount of patients with missed
      diagnoses. Other aims of are to determine the effect of the type or location of a facial
      fracture on the in- cidence and severity of TBI. With the help of the results it would be
      possible to improve the comprehensive diagnostics and early treatment of patients with a
      facial fracture or a TBI.

      The retrospective and prospective data on patients with TBI and/or facial fracture are
      collect- ed at Turku University Hospital. The comparison of the two groups will give
      information on the amount of patients with missed diagnosis of TBI or facial fracture. The
      results can be utilised in planning strategy for comprehensive diagnostics and treatment of
      the patients. In the research group the investigators have specialists in the fields of oral
      and maxillofacial surgery, neurol- ogy and otorhinolaryngology.
