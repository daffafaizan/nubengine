      In this observational study the investigators aim to evaluate whether optical spectroscopy
      can correctly diagnose malignant tissue in the existing clinical workflow of percutaneous
      interventions in lung, liver, and breast.

      Secondary Objective:

      During the measurement procedure, possible improvements of the measurement hardware will be
      recorded. Analysis of this documentation will provide information for possible alterations of
      hardware design for improved clinical applicability in the future. Special attention will be
      paid to observe how the procedure fits in the standard workflow of the radiologist.
