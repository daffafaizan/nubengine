    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types
           6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine in HIV-infected men.

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for types 6, 11, 16 and 18
           in subjects who are antibody-negative at baseline.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ count after the vaccination series.

        -  To describe the associations of CD4+ count, nadir CD4+ count, and age on antibody
           response.

        -  To evaluate the levels and persistence of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 antibody titers after
           the vaccination series among subjects according to serostatus at baseline.

        -  To evaluate the oral levels of serum IgA before and after the vaccination series.

      Tertiary

        -  To evaluate prevalent and incident HPV infections in the anal canal.

        -  To evaluate cytological and histological abnormalities in the anal canal.

        -  To evaluate prevalent and incident HPV infections in the oral cavity.

        -  To compare oral and anal compartmental shedding of HPV before and after vaccination.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine
      intramuscularly on day 0 and weeks 8 and 24.

      After completion of protocol therapy, patients are followed at 7, 12, and 18 months.
