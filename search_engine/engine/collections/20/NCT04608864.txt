    
      Varicocele repair in the era of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been a point of
      dispute. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Practice Committee recommended
      has considered ART as a primary treatment for female factor, regardless of the presence of
      varicocele and abnormal semen parameters.

      A systematic review of 7 studies involving 1,241 men with a clinical varicocele and abnormal
      semen parameters showed improved livebirth and pregnancy rates after varicocelectomy in
      infertile men undergoing IVF/ICSI. Studies included in this systematic review were
      retrospective nature with a considerable heterogeneity. Evidence to support varicocelectomy
      for men with abnormal semen analysis undergoing IVF/ICSI has therefore remained inconclusive.
