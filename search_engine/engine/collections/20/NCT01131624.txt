    
      This is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, 2-arm study to assess the efficacy and safety
      of FCM compared to oral iron in pregnant women with IDA.

      During the screening period (Days -10 to 0 before randomisation), subjects will be selected
      based on eligibility criteria. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria will undergo baseline assessments at baseline (Day 0) prior to the
      first dose of study medication.

      Subjects will be randomised to receive either intravenous (IV) iron (FCM, 1,000-1,500 mg) or
      oral iron (ferrous sulphate, 100 mg iron twice a day; total dose 200 mg/day).

      The treatment period will begin with the infusion of FCM or the intake of oral iron on Day 0.

      All subjects will return for assessment of efficacy and safety at Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and at
      delivery (or whichever comes first).
