        -  Evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of alterations of specific chromosomes
           and chromosomal regions including 7, 9p, 10p, 10q, 13q, 17p, 17q, 19q, 22q, X, and Y,
           using PCR analysis of microsatellite repeats and FISH.

        -  Evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of DNA ploidy by flow cytometric
           analysis; compare with ploidy determination by FISH.

        -  Assess the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of various markers of cellular
           proliferation and cellular function including flow cytometric determination of %S-phase,
           %G2M, and immunohistochemical evaluation of PCNA, Ki-67, and p53.
