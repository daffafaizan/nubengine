      factors. The thymus is one of the main organs involved in the development of the fetal immune
      system. The aim of this study was to explore the association between fetal thymus volume on
      ultrasound and preeclampsia by adding the 3-dimensional measurement of thymus volume to the
      routine fetal ultrasound scan at 11-14 week of gestation.
