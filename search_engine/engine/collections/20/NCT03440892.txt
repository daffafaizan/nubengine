      antirheumatic treatments to suppress levels of survivin in sera. Rheumatoid arthritis
      patients scheduled to start new pharmacological treatment will be followed for a period of 6
      months. No intervention or influence on choice of treatment will be performed, the decision
      of new/other medication is entirely made by the patient and their rheumatologist. The study
      entails addition of survivin analyse (1 vial of sera) before and after start of new
      treatment. Data concerning survivin levels, disease activity and other clinical parameters
      before and after start of new treatment will also be analysed. The patients will leave sera
      for survivin analyse at baseline and 3 and 6 months after start of new treatment.
