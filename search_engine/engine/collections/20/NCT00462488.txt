      Vicinium in patients with urothelial carcinoma in situ of the bladder. Bacillus
      Calmette-Gu√©rin treatment had previously failed in all patients. A total of 46 patients were
      treated with Vicinium with half being administered 30mg/dose once per week for 6 weeks
      (cohort 1) and the other half (cohort 2) the same dose but administered once per week for 12
      consecutive weeks. Disease assessments consisting of urine cytology, cystoscopy and, if
      indicated, biopsy were performed at 3 month intervals. Patients that were disease-free at the
      assessment time point were allowed to continue treatment in the maintenance phase which
      consisted of three weekly doses, followed by 9 weeks of no treatment. As long as the patient
      remained disease-free, treatment continued for a total of one year.
