      male participants. This study will consist of a screening phase (between 21 and 2 days prior
      to the first dose administration of JNJ-42165279), a 2-period (Period 1: Day 1 to Day 3 and
      Period 2: Day 4 to Day 10) open-label treatment phase, and a follow-up phase (within 7 to 14
      days after the last dose of JNJ-42165279). A single 30-mg dose of JNJ-42165279 will be
      administered on Day 1 of Period 1. During Period 2, the administration of oral itraconazole
      200 mg once a day will start on Day 4. A second single oral 30-mg dose of JNJ-42165279 will
      be administered on Day 8 together with the dose of 200 mg itraconazole. Sixteen healthy
      participants will be enrolled in this study. Safety assessments will include assessment of
      adverse events, supine vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing
      and physical examinations. The maximum study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 7 weeks.
