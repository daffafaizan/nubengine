    
      All patients will be followed up for disease progression, regardless of whether they have
      discontinued treatment, unless they have withdrawn consent.

      Efficacy will be determined based on tumor assessments performed by each investigator
      according to RECIST 1.1. Safety will be monitored based on the frequency and severity of
      adverse events (AEs), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade version 4.0.

      Tumor assessments will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) or X ray if necessary every 12 weeks for all patients until documented evidence of
      objective disease progression.

      Reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities will be done by the investigator in accordance
      with CFDA regulations.
