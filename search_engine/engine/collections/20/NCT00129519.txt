      Biopsy-confirmed BCC lesions (1 per subject) were excised by curettage, with no
      electrodessication. Approximately 1 week later, treatment with imiquimod 5% cream was
      initiated. Imiquimod was applied to the target BCC once daily, 5 times per week (5x/week) for
      up to 6 weeks. Rest periods were allowed as needed. Subjects reported to the study center at
      treatment weeks 1, 2, and 6, and posttreatment at weeks 12, 26, and 52. At treatment week 6
      and all posttreatment visits, the investigator clinically assessed the target site for tumor
      clearance and cosmetic outcome. A template made at initiation and created from clear plastic
      overlay aided in locating the target tumor site. If the investigator identified a lesion that
      had occurred or recurred at the target site, the subject was discontinued from the study and
      counted as a recurrence/persistence (R/P).
