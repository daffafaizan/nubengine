    
      This is a 3-year (2.75-years of enrollment), Phase III, two-arm, randomized, multi-center,
      superiority treatment study to compare infliximab to a second intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who
      fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion.

        1. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that infliximab will be superior to a second
           intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent
           fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion
           (resistant KD). Cessation of fever (<38°C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation
           of study treatment infusion will be the primary outcome measure.

        2. Specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in more
           rapid resolution of inflammation compared to second IVIG as measured by the change in
           white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and high-sensitivity
           C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration between baseline and 24 hours and 2 weeks
           following study treatment.

        3. Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in a
           reduction from baseline in coronary artery Zworst score of ≥ 0.05 standard deviation
           units as compared to second IVIG at 2 weeks following study treatment measured by
           echocardiography.
