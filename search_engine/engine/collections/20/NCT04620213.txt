    
      A randomized, parallel arm, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in at least 168
      randomized subjects (160 completed), evaluating the safety and efficacy of Nyxol in subjects
      with pharmacologically-induced mydriasis.

      Following the successful completion of screening, each subject will be stratified by eye
      color and then simultaneously be randomized to mydriatic agent (unmasked) and treatment
      (masked).

      Treatment randomization will be 1:1, Nyxol or placebo (vehicle).

      Stratification by iris color will be 1:1, light or dark irides.

      The mydriatic agent randomization will be 3:1:1 (2.5% phenylephrine, 1% tropicamide, and
      Paremyd). That is, approximately 60% of the randomized subjects will receive one drop of 2.5%
      phenylephrine 1 hour before treatment (96 completed subjects), approximately 20% will receive
      one drop of 1% tropicamide 1 hour before treatment (32 completed subjects), and approximately
      20% will receive Paremyd 1 hour before treatment (32 completed subjects).

      At the treatment visit, subjects who have been randomized and stratified by iris color (1:1
      [light/dark]) will receive one of three approved mydriatic agents approximately 1 hour prior
      to receiving study treatment. Measurements will be measured before (-1 hour /baseline) and 60
      minutes after (maximum/0 minutes) the mydriatic agent instillation in each eye (i.e. right
      before the study treatment is administered), and at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 2
      hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours after treatment dosing. Measurements will include pupil
      diameter (PD), distance and near visual acuity (VA), accommodation, and redness in each eye.

      At the Follow-Up Visit, which is 1 day after Visit 1, measurements will again be recorded 24
      hours after treatment dosing.
