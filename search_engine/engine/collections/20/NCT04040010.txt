    
      Postmenopausal women (without any bone condition), osteopenia and osteoporosis patients
      (female and male) will be invited to join the study. Participants enrolling the project will
      be first measured on the following parameters: 1) general characteristics (age, sex, medical
      history); 2) bone mass parameters through Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); 3) bone
      formation and resorption markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, N-telopeptides and urine
      deoxypyridinoline). After measuring the aforementioned parameters, consenting participants
      will be randomized into the following groups: Group 1: postmenopausal women taking colostrum
      supplementation; Group 2: postmenopausal women taking placebo; Group 3: osteopenia patients
      taking colostrum supplementation; Group 4: osteopenia patients taking placebo; Group 5:
      osteoporosis patients taking colostrum supplementation; Group 6: osteoporosis patients taking
      placebo. Power calculations (90% power, 0.05%) were performed in order to calculate the
      sample size needed in each group (considering stratification according to group, a minimum of
      7 participants in each group are needed). Following 5 months intervention, participants will
      be re-assessed on the following parameters: 1) general characteristics (age, sex, medical
      history); 2) bone mass parameters through Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); 3) bone
      formation and resorption markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, N-telopeptides and urine
      deoxypyridinoline).
