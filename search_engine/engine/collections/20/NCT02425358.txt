      the injured tissue can promote regional myocardial perfusion and improved cardiac function,
      several clinical trials have shown that intracoronary bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMC)
      transplantation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients several days after myocardial
      reperfusion is safe and may enhance the improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF). The timing of BMC administration, baseline LVEF, dosage of BMC and other factors has
      been linked to improvement in LVEF after BMC transplantation. In our previous work, we gave
      BMCs within 24 hours after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and found that
      it was safe and effective . In addition, there are another report about longer time from
      symptom onset to BMC infusion (2-4 weeks), which also appeared effective . The timing of
      intracoronary stem cell administration may have a critical effect on cell engraftment and may
      be responsible for the various biological and functional responses to therapy. However, few
      studies have directly addressed the optimal timing of cell injections. Therefore, in this
      prospective randomized study, BMCs were given at different times (within 24 hours, 3 to 7
      days, or 7 to 30 days after reperfusion) to investigate whether the timing of therapy affects
      the therapeutic response of AMI patients.
