      acute phase proteins, is positively associated with adiposity. Recent studies indicate that
      chronic low-grade inflammation in non-diabetic individuals may cause decline in insulin
      sensitivity and increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It has been proposed that
      reduction of low-grade inflammation may reduce the risk of development of type 2 diabetes. In
      agreement with this hypothesis, the class of anti-inflammatory drugs called salicylates (such
      as aspirin) that influence a specific anti-inflammatory pathway have been found to decrease
      plasma glucose levels and increase insulin sensitivity in rodents as well as people with type
      2 diabetes.

      In the present study, we propose testing whether administration of the anti-inflammatory drug
      Salsalate improves insulin sensitivity in obese non-diabetic individuals and whether this
      improvement is related with a decrease in serum markers of inflammation. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to two treatment groups: placebo or Salsalate (3g/d). An oral glucose
      tolerance test and a combined euglycemic/hyperglycemic clamp to assess insulin sensitivity
      and insulin secretion will be performed before and after seven days of treatment. Results of
      this study may help to identify novel strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk
      groups.
