      a novel Neurofeedback electroencephalography (EEG) Virtual Reality (VR) system aimed at
      reducing chronic pain. The NEVR device consists of a dry electrode EEG headset combined with
      a VR Head-Mounted Display (VR-HMD) device and neurofeedback software. This approach relies on
      retraining the brain's networks to reduce the perception of pain and does not involve
      pharmaceutical drugs. Patients with chronic lower back pain will be recruited by UCSD at its
      Altman Clinical & Translational Research Institute. Patients that meet the recruitment
      criteria will be asked to conduct 20 1-hour long sessions of EEG-based Neurofeedback in VR
      over the course of a couple of months. Pain assessment and device usability questionnaires
      will be conducted prior to and after the first and last sessions, and at intermediate time
      points. This will be a single arm clinical trial aimed at demonstrating the safety and
      viability of the NEVR device, with the primary outcome measure being the ability of patients
      to conduct all 20 sessions safely and comfortably. Secondary outcome measures include
      assessment of changes in pain perception, and of changes in EEG activity patterns.
