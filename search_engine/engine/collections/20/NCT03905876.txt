      and limited knowledge of any new treatment, the inclusion of patients in this EP faces
      ethical barriers and communication barriers. This is all the more true as EPs are generally
      aimed at patients with advanced cancer. Also, faced with these different issues, volunteer
      patients usually have ambivalent motives. Catt and his collaborators have shown that the
      primary motivations for agreeing to integrate an early phase are the medical benefits, then
      the best option available, the maintenance of hope and only then, the aid to research.

      And more, at the beginning of a EP trial, most patients simultaneously experience multiple
      complex symptoms related to their cancer or treatment. These symptoms and their functional
      consequences generate psychological distress and reduce their quality of life related to
      health. Measuring psychological distress and quality of life before entering a clinical trial
      is therefore essential for the analysis of psychopathological processes.

      Since emotional regulation involves many aspects, it seems scientifically relevant to choose
      central scales, which cover broad psychopathological functions, to capture the psychological
      distress of patients. This battery of scales should include an assessment of levels of
      anxiety, depression and anger (as markers of irritability) but also pre-morbid psychological
      predispositions. Indeed, some variables such as resilience and optimism are known to
      influence the level of psychopathological symptomatology and the experience of cancer.
      Finally, qualitative interviews would better capture the experience of patients with advanced
      cancer when they are confronted with an end of treatment in EP.
