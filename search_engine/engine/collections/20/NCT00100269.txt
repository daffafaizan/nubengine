      will include screening for lipid peroxidation of sperm using the LPO-586 assay, HOST test and
      for sperm DNA fragmentation using the Tunel technique. Those men found to have free radical
      related damage will be enrolled in a randomized control trial in which they will receive
      either the Menevit anti-oxidant or placebo (in a 2:1 randomization ratio respectively). The
      Menevit anti-oxidant is a capsule containing several different anti-oxidants, taken orally
      once per day. The placebo is identical in appearance and taste. After 3 months of
      Menevit/placebo the female partners of these men will undergo an IVF oocyte retrieval
      operation and embryo transfer. Pregnancy rates and embryo quality will be compared between
      groups. Changes in semen characteristics (count, motility, morphology, membrane integrity)
      and lipid peroxidation (LPO-586) plus sperm DNA fragmentation (Tunel assay) will be assessed
      at trial entry, 6 weeks and 3 months. Comparisons between the patients embryo quality in the
      IVF cycle immediately before and during the Menevit trial will also be compared when possible
