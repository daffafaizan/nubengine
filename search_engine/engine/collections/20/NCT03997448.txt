      with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal
      junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma who have received at least two lines of prior therapy.
      Treatment will be administered in 21-day cycles. Pembrolizumab will be administered
      intravenously (IV) at a dose of 200 mg on day 1 of each cycle. Abemaciclib will be taken
      orally twice a day on each day of the cycle, 150 mg per dose. Treatment will continue until
      disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicities.
