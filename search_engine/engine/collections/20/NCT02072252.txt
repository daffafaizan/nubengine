    
      The aim of this study is to conduct a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) for a 10-week,
      culturally tailored mobile phone intervention that uses principles of cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety and depression among young men who are sexually attracted to
      other males.

      The primary purpose of the RCT is to collect feedback about the intervention from the
      participants. This feedback, along with usage data on which features are used more or less
      often by the participants, and how the features are used, will be evaluated to make
      improvements to the intervention. The investigators will also assess clinical outcomes (such
      as anxiety and depressive symptoms). Outcomes will be monitored pre-, mid-, and
      post-treatment, as well as twice over a 10 week follow-up period.
