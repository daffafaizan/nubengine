      and 64 years old. The drug dependence has been described by many authors as a dysfunction of
      the brain reward system. Considering the effects of the cholinergic system on the drug reward
      and self-administration mechanisms, acetylcholine (Ach) may play an important role on cocaine
      dependence process. Then the present study aims to evaluate biperiden efficacy (a cholinergic
      antagonist) in attenuate compulsion, one o the main symptoms of the drug dependence. To
      accomplish this purpose 60 cocaine or crack male users between 18 and 50 years old will be
      study. This is a double-blind controlled and randomized placebo study. All the patients will
      be treated with brief intervention therapy (BIT), and half of them will receive biperiden
      (6mg/day) while the other half will receive placebo. The treatment efficacy will be evaluated
      through the comparison between the values obtained on the following measures before and after
      the treatment: Craving scale of Minnesota and Cocaine/crack consumption questionnaire, and
      the presence of the cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine) on urine.
