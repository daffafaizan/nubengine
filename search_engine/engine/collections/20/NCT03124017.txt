      inconsistent. The present study aims to improve the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis by
      implementing a computer-based alert system combined with a Geneva Risk Score calculation tool
      in the electronic patient chart and order entry system. Consecutive acutely ill medical
      patients without indication for therapeutic anticoagulation or ongoing therapeutic
      anticoagulant treatment admitted to the medical wards of the University Hospital Bern,
      Switzerland, will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the alert group in which an alert and the
      Geneva Risk Score calculation tool will be issued in the electronic patient chart or to the
      control group in which no alert will be issued. The primary endpoint is the rate of
      appropriate thromboprophylaxis during hospital stay.
