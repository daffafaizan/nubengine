      process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent,
      metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma. The cell transfer therapy used in this study
      involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by
      infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
