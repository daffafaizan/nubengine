      patient's perception of pain as measured by the 10 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The aim
      of the study is to compare the safety & efficacy of lidocaine versus ketorolac for acute pain
      secondary to renal colic in the Emergency Department (ED). The primary endpoint is patient's
      perception of pain as described by the use of numeric rating scale (NRS) at 15 minutes after
      initial study interventions. The secondary endpoints are incidence of adverse events during
      the study period, patient perception of pain as described by the use of NRS at 0, 5, 15, 30,
      45, 60, 75, 90 minutes after initial administration of study interventions, frequency and
      mean dose of rescue analgesic therapy needed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 minutes,
      incidence of adverse events such as but would not be limited to: dizziness, perioral
      numbness, nausea, vomiting, arrhythmia [examples could be but are not limited to: atrial
      fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation), hypotension (â‰¤90/60 mmHg),
      flushing, headache, tremors, ear pain, injection site reactions, disorientation, respiratory
      depression (respiratory rate less than 12bpm), oxygen saturation less than 90%)], the number
      of bedside ultrasounds for diagnosis conducted, the number of CT scans for diagnosis
      conducted, result of radiologic imaging (Ultrasound / Computerized Tomography), time to
      patient discharge from the initiation of study medication/placebo, patient satisfaction of
      pain control based on a Likert Scale, the number of patients who consumed an adjuvant pain
      medication for analgesia.
