      Research on this topic is needed as over 3 million cataract surgeries are performed in the
      United States each year. The number of surgeries performed is growing as baby boomers age.
      Reimbursements continue to decline, necessitating ever improving operating and surgical
      efficiencies in the operating room setting for physicians and small business owners to remain
      financially viable. New governmental regulations dictate that physician payments will be
      related to patient satisfaction and outcomes which may be better provided by newer and better
      surgical technologies.

      The Lumera operating microscope and Callisto software system provide several features that
      may enhance operating room flow including HD video screen and co-observant microscopes that
      can be independently adjusted to help operating room staff anticipate the needs of the
      surgeon. Enhanced retroillumination would be expected to translate into fewer complications
      and more confidence during surgery which could lead to less operating time, phaco energy used
      and improved visual outcomes. The toric alignment assistance device may lead to more accurate
      toric placement and improved visual outcomes after surgery.

      Target audience would include all cataract surgeons both high and lower volume.

      There is currently a dearth of published literature on this technology and its benefits in
      routine cataract surgery. There are no registered similar trials on Clinicaltrials.gov
