      a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system for glucose monitoring and control at the
      beginning of the run-in and for the whole duration of the study. Each eligible subject will
      then be randomly allocated to a sequence of the 2 treatments, i.e. multiple daily injections
      of ADO09 and insulin aspart during 2 dosing periods. At Day 1 a mixed meal test (MMT) will be
      conducted at breakfast and subjects will remain at the clinical site until day 3. At Day 3
      subjects will leave the clinical site and continue the treatment with IMP for the next 3
      weeks. On Day 23 subjects will come back for a MMT on Day 24.

      This study is constituted of 2 parts. In the first part (Part A), only subjects with daily
      prandial insulin dose ≤ 40 U/day will be enrolled.

      Following the completion of the part A, an extension part (Part B) will be conducted to
      particularly assess the safety and tolerability of higher daily doses of ADO09 in patients
      with insulin requirements ≥ 40 U/day.

      The clinical conduct and procedures will not change for the Extension Part of the study.
