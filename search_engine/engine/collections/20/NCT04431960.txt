      in adult women. Overall goal of this project is to evaluate the effects of blackcurrant (BC)
      supplementation on changes in gut microbiome and bone mass in adult women. For this purpose,
      the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with BC
      supplementation for 6 months in peri- and early postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years.

      The primary endpoint will be lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD); secondary endpoints
      will be gut microbial Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. To delineate the underlying
      mechanisms of the action, changes in biomarkers for bone metabolism, bone-related immune and
      endocrine systemic biomarkers by BC supplementation will be measured in plasma and peripheral
      blood derived mononuclear cells.

      The specific objectives of the study are to investigate the effects of BC extract on: 1) bone
      mass and bone remodeling markers; 2) changes in the gut microbiota abundance and composition,
      immune and endocrine biomarkers and their relationships with changes in bone mass.

      The proposed study will provide novel insight into whether and how BC consumption reduces the
      risk of postmenopausal bone loss in adult women and will improve understanding of the
      clinical roles of gut microbiome in postmenopausal bone loss. Findings from this study will
      help increase awareness of the bone health promoting effect of BC and motivate increased
      production of BC and other berry products in response to the increasing consumer demand.
