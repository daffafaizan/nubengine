    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination of pemetrexed disodium and
           docetaxel when administered on a day 1 and day 15 dosing schedule.

      Secondary

        -  To specifically characterize the toxicity profile for the combination of biweekly
           pemetrexed disodium and docetaxel.

        -  To investigate the antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors as measured
           by RECIST criteria for patients with measurable disease or tumor markers for patients
           with non-measurable disease.

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of the combination of pemetrexed disodium and
           docetaxel on a biweekly dosing schedule.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and docetaxel IV on days 1 and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
