        -  Pilot test the implementation of guideline-based survivorship care planning in a rural
           setting using patient navigation plus telehealth among underserved rural cancer
           survivors. Investigators will collect feasibility data on patient recruitment rates and
           the ability to measure clinical effectiveness outcomes using the electronic health
           record and patient reports (survivor adherence to recommended disease surveillance,
           health assessment and cancer prevention/early detection practices).

        -  Identify the facilitators and barriers to future larger scale implementation of
           guideline-based survivorship care planning in rural settings to optimize the
           implementation strategies. Through a mixed methods approach, investigators will address
           implementation research questions focused on "real world" implementation of the
           guideline-based intervention in rural areas, including barriers/facilitators and
           translation to other rural settings. This will allow us to optimize the implementation
           strategies that will be further evaluated in the future large-scale implementation trial
