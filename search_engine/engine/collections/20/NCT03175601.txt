      stressors, impacts on health, functional independence, quality of life and survival; its
      early detection at the prefrailty stage offers the opportunity for preventive intervention.
      Sarcopenia, a hallmark of frailty, may occur in association with obesity and worsen
      functional deterioration. Obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance and is a
      risk factor for both cardiometabolic diseases and cognitive impairment. Adipose tissue exerts
      autocrine and paracrine functions leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and increased
      oxidative stress that, in turn, decrease muscle density and precipitate muscle strength loss.
      Sleep disturbances and sarcopenia might be causally related through dysregulation of glucose
      metabolism and disruption of the secretory pattern of hormones involved in muscle metabolism.

      Main objective:

      To establish among young-elderly obese subjects the prevalence of prefrailty as defined by
      presence of â‰¥1 of reduced muscle mass, fatigue, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity
      (Fried's criteria)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess prevalence and severity of sarcopenia as defined by reduced muscle mass
           coupled with decreased muscle strength and /or reduced functional capacity

        -  To establish the cardiometabolic risk profile and its correlation with vitamin D

        -  To determine type and extent of sleep abnormalities by validated questionnaires and
           their association with prefrailty

        -  To assess the extent of sympathetic imbalance, arrhythmia burden and olfactory
           impairment

        -  To determine patterns of biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines,
           adipokines, myokines, tissue damage and remodeling and correlation with prefrailty and
           insulin resistance.

      Study design:

      Eligible subjects will attend the clinic in the morning in the fasting state to undergo

        -  blood samples collection for routine and specific biochemistry;

        -  anthropometric measurements: height, weight, body mass index, waist and hip
           circumference;

        -  assement of sarcopenia: muscle strength, gait speed, muscle mass by biomimpedentiometric
           assessment (BIA) and air displacement pletismography (BODPOD);

        -  glucose metabolism biomarker as tissue accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts
           (AGE);

        -  sympathetic activation;

        -  interview for medical history and comorbidity registration;

        -  screening for cognitive impairment;

        -  sleep pattern analysis through questionnaires;

        -  olfactory assessment.

      A wearable system (Win@home, CE0434) for 24 h recording of rhythm, circadian heart rate,
      respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, posture and physical activity will be applied to each
      subject for the subsequent 24 hours
