    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare RRC to ORC in terms of the difference in European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core (QLQC)30 quality of life
      instrument assessed at baseline to day 30 after radical cystectomy (RC).

      II. To compare RRC to ORC in terms of the 90-day high-grade complication rate (where high
      grade is defined as Clavien-Dindo grade 3-5).

      III. To compare the peri-operative cost of the RC procedure, as defined as from the day of
      hospital admission to the day of hospital discharge.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the differences between RRC and ORC in terms of the following quality of life
      outcomes: Narcotic requirements prior to RC, during hospital stay and on days 7, 14, 30, 6
      weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months; Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score prior to RC and on
      days 7, 14, 30, 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months; the EORTC-QLQ-30 prior to RC and at 3, 6,
      9, and 12 months; the bladder cancer index (BCI) at 30 days and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; the
      Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) prior to RC and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; the World
      Health Organization (WHO) Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire prior to RC and at 30 days and
      3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      II. To estimate the differences between RRC and ORC in terms of the following surgical and
      complication outcomes: all complications occurring intraoperatively, during postoperative
      hospitalization and during the 90 days post cystectomy assessed at 7, 14, and 30 days; at 6
      weeks and at 3 months-graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification; all
      complications, all grade 3+ complications, and all grade 4+ complications; time to oral
      intake; estimated blood loss during surgery, number of transfusions on the day of surgery;
      drop in hematocrit at 24 hours; lymph node yield; and positive surgical margin.

      III. To estimate the differences between RRC and ORC in terms of the following cost-related
      outcomes: operation room time; number of disposables used; pharmacy costs; length of hospital
      stay; admission to intensive care unit (ICU) prior to discharge & length of stay in ICU;
      number of hospital readmissions within 30 and 90 days (3 months); necessary tests/procedures
      to treat complications during hospitalization and within 30 and 90 days.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo RRC at day 0.

      ARM II: Patients undergo ORC at day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days, 30 days, 6 weeks,
      and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
