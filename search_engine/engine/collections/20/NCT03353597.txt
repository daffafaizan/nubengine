      studies, have the potential to reverse many, systemic age-related changes in the human body
      as well as age related chronic diseases. This is a non-randomized, uncontrolled phase I/II
      study to study the effects of monthly transfusions of young healthy male donor plasma on
      biological age as assessed by DNA methylation levels, and changes in cognitive, renal, and
      pulmonary function, muscle strength, telomere length, testosterone, estrogen, DHEAS, IGF-1,
      high resolution C-Reactive protein, and expression of p16INK4a in peripheral blood T
      lymphocytes and skin biopsies. To determine the safety and tolerability of monthly, 2-unit
      transfusions of young (<25 years of age) healthy male donor plasma for 6 months in patients
      older then 40 years of age.
