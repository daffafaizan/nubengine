      behaviors, low self-esteem, and contributes to anxiety and depression in adolescence. Despite
      evidence that body dissatisfaction can emerge during the elementary school years, the
      majority of body confidence programs are for girls over the age of 15. There is very little
      to no research on interventions for elementary school children. The Body Project is an
      empirically supported body confidence prevention program for high school girls with over 100
      articles to support its efficacy, effectiveness and theoretical model; it is the only body
      confidence program for youth to acquire the Blueprints Certification. Together with two 4th
      and 5th grade teachers, the investigators have adapted the Body Project curriculum for youth
      between the ages of 9 to 11 years old (i.e., 4th and 5th graders). The curriculum is called
      Amazing Me and will be implemented in classrooms by teachers. The curriculum was developed
      meeting several competencies for national health and wellness standards for elementary
      students. The aim of the current study is to conduct a national randomized control trial of
      the curriculum 100 classrooms with 4th and 5th graders.

      The primary aim of the current study is to deliver the Amazing Me intervention and assess its
      efficacy. It is hypothesized that compared to controls, children that undergo the body
      confidence curriculum will report higher body satisfaction and body esteem scores, overall
      greater self-esteem, and will report less engagement in appearance comparisons.
