        1. To understand how women with CKD perceive their pregnancy risk.

        2. To examine the associations between biopsychosocial factors (demographics, psychosocial
           factors, renal and pregnancy history) and women with CKD's perception of risk in
           pregnancy.

        3. To examine the relationship between pregnancy-related intention and perception of
           pregnancy risk in women with CKD.

        4. To gain an in-depth understanding of the biopsychosocial factors which influence risk
           perception and pregnancy-related behaviour, in women with CKD who perceive high and low
           risk perceptions.

      To achieve these objectives this study is divided into two phases:

      Phase 1: Quantitative assessment of risk perception and biopsychosocial factors in women with
      CKD Phase 2: Qualitative exploration of risk perception in women with CKD with high and low
      risk perception scores
