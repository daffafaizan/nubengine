      Biased Coin Design up and down method. In this method, the volume of local anesthetic
      (ropivacaine) administered to each patient will depends on the response of the previous
      patient. In the event of block failure, the next subject will receive an additional 2 mL of
      volume compared with the previous patient. In the event of block success, the next patient
      will receive either the same volume as the last patient or a 2 mL reduction in volume (per
      the biased coin design with a probability of the same volume being 0.9 and lower volume being
      0.1). The first patient in the study will receive 30 mL and depending on the block success,
      the volume of the next block will be increased or decreased. The biased coin design is well
      described and established in other minimum volume studies.

      All patients will have the block in the block room with standard monitoring (non-invasive
      blood pressure, pulse-oximetry, electrocardiogram) and mild sedation with midazolam and
      fentanyl. All blocks will be performed by staff anesthesiologists with a subspecialty in
      regional anesthesia and who work routinely in the block room or by a resident or fellow who
      is directly supervised by one of these staff anesthesiologist.

      There will be two follow up telephone call to all patients enrolled in this study 24 hours
      post block insertion and one at 7 days to discuss length of block duration, any postoperative
      nausea/vomiting, any ongoing numbness or tingling, and overall satisfaction with the block.
      The participants will be informed of this phone call as part of the consent process and their
      telephone number will be confirmed.
