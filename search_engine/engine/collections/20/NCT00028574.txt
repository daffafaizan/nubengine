        -  Determine the effectiveness of gabapentin in managing hot flashes in men with prostate
           cancer.

        -  Determine the response of patients to this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to the number of hot flashes per day (2-3 vs 4-9 vs 10 or more) and
      duration of hot flash symptoms (less than 9 months vs 9 months or more). Patients are
      randomized to one of four treatment arms.

      All patients are observed for 7 days prior to drug administration in order to collect
      baseline hot flash information.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral gabapentin once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral gabapentin once daily on days 1-7 and twice daily on days
           8-28.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral gabapentin once daily on days 1-7, twice daily on days
           8-14, and three times daily on days 15-28.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo on one of three schedules corresponding to arms
           I-III.

      Patients in all arms may continue therapy with gabapentin for an additional 8 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 28, and at the end of the additional 8 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (55 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1 year.
