      tolerance, wind-up, and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) as measured by Quantitative Sensory
      Testing (QST) between subjects with a radicular pain condition. The investigators are
      comparing those who respond and those who do not respond to standard therapy (ESI) before and
      after the treatment.
