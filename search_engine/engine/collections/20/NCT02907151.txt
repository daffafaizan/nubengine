      knowledge gained by the patient on anticoagulant treatment at the exit of cardiology
      consultation.

      The assumption is that this questionnaire would help educate patients about their
      shortcomings and educate cardiologists lack of knowledge of his patient.

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  Target specific areas in which patients have the greatest lack of information

        -  Assess the impact of educational level on information

        -  Assess the impact of age on information

        -  Evaluate the satisfaction of the information delivered

        -  Assess patient anxiety vis-Ã -vis their treatment

        -  Evaluate the failure rate of the questionnaire to know the number of patients refusing
           to participate in the study
