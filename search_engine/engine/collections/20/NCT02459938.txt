      mg and 1 mg to glucagon by injection at doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg by means of a 4 way
      crossover open label design. Eligible subjects giving informed consent will be randomised to
      a treatment sequence of each of the four treatments in one week intervals. At each treatment
      visit, subjects will undergo an insulin induction procedure designed to safely induce
      hypoglycemia, and then have a treatment applied, either by injection or by patch, and then
      monitored for return to normoglycemia.
