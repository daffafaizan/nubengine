    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of intravesical administration of recombinant fowlpox virus encoding
      three different costimulatory molecules (B7.1, ICAM-1,LFA-3) called TRICOM (-rF-TRICOM)
      (recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine) and/or recombinant fowlpox encoding sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) (rF-GM-CSF) (recombinant fowlpox GM-CSF vaccine adjuvant) in the treatment of
      patients with carcinoma of the bladder scheduled for cystectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the kinetics of viral infection and gene function as well as host response to
      intravesical recombinant fowlpox virus in the treatment of bladder cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are alternately assigned to Arms A and B.
      Once Arms A and B have finished accrual, patients are assigned to Arm C.

      ARM A (closed to accrual 10/2004): Patients receive recombinant fowlpox GM-CSF vaccine
      adjuvant intravesically over 2 hours for 4 weekly doses (on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) with the
      last dose given 4-6 days prior to cystectomy.

      ARM B (closed to accrual 10/2004): Patients receive recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine
      intravesically over 2 hours for 4 weekly doses (on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) with the last dose
      given 4-6 days prior to cystectomy.

      ARM C: Patients receive recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine combined with recombinant fowlpox
      GM-CSF vaccine adjuvant intravesically over 2 hours for 4 weekly doses (on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22) with the last dose given 4-6 days prior to cystectomy.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. All patients undergo cystectomy 4-6 days following the last intravesical
      instillation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
