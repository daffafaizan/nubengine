      Levator Prosthesis (MLP), is an external device that makes use of a newer class of permanent
      magnets (made of alloys of neodymium (Nd), iron (Fe) and boron (B)) to restore eyelid
      movement. The Kinesiotape Frontalis Sling (KTFS), involves the use of tape to help facilitate
      levator muscle contraction to open the eyelid. Video recordings of spontaneous and volitional
      blinks will be used to evaluate the effects of each device on eyelid reanimation.

      The clinical trial will employ a crossover design in which participants will try each device
      at home in counterbalanced order with a washout period between. In each period of the
      crossover, participants will receive training (during study visits at Massachusetts Eye and
      Ear) in how to apply the device and will then try the device at home for one week with daily
      follow up by video calls. At the end of the one-week period of home use there will be a study
      visit at Massachusetts Eye and Ear when the device will be returned and additional video
      recordings of eye blinks will be made.

      At the end of the crossover period, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire
      comparing the two devices and to select their preferred device. If considered clinically
      appropriate, participants may be invited to continue using the preferred device for an
      additional two months with weekly follow ups to provide information about longer-term use of
      the intervention. Participants who are still using one of the devices at the end of the two
      months will be returned to clinical care and receive a study follow up (telephone call) after
      another 6 and 12 months.
