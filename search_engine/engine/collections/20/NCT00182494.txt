    
      Rationale:

        -  From large international RCT studies, Type 2 Diabetes can be prevented / delayed for
           overweight, pre-diabetic individuals by making basic lifestyle changes (regular moderate
           exercise, healthy eating habits) and using metformin or other insulin resistance
           inhibitor.

        -  Individuals with schizophrenia are in particular need of preventative intervention and
           conventional approaches do not match their needs.

        -  Research has not examined how to facilitate lifestyle changes in the lives of
           individuals with schizophrenia.

      We need toâ€¦

        -  Develop and evaluate innovative diabetes prevention strategies tailored to meet the
           needs of individuals with schizophrenia.

        -  Research how to make it work for pre-diabetic individuals being treated for
           schizophrenia.

      The effectiveness of the novel intervention will be tested using a prospective, randomized,
      controlled clinical trial. A multi-factorial design enables a 2 x 2 analysis of the
      independent effects of three interventions - a tailored lifestyle modification program,
      metformin, and the standard conventional intervention. There is no anticipated interaction
      effect between metformin and lifestyle interventions. Clients currently treated for
      schizophrenia at a community outpatient clinic will be screened for diabetes, and those who
      fulfill the inclusion criteria, and give written consent, following a three week run-in
      period, will be randomized to one of four groups to receive either: the experimental
      intervention with placebo, the experimental intervention with metformin or the conventional
      intervention with placebo or conventional intervention with metformin.
