    
      This is an observational study involving a retrospective and prospective collection of
      clinical and molecular data. Patients will follow their regular diagnostic and clinical
      practice. Thus, no additional procedure/blood withdrawal will be performed.

      The study will be conducted as follows:

        1. Retrospective phase: clinical and molecular data of AML patients with FLT3+ mutations
           detected at diagnosis or at any refractory/relapse state will be collected.

        2. Prospective phase: clinical and molecular data of each new FLT3+ AML patient identified
           in participating centers at diagnosis or at any refractory/relapse state will be
           collected prospectively. Every effort will be done to include all consecutive patients,
           in order to avoid selection bias.

      For patients with a mutation found at the time of disease relapse, any effort will be done to
      collect all the clinical and molecular information since the time of diagnosis.

      The Primary objective of this study is to analyze how FLT3 mutational status evolve during
      the management of the disease looking at the percentage of patients with no FLT3 mutations at
      diagnosis who relapse with a new FLT3 mutation detected, and the percentage of FLT3 positive
      AML patients that after having obtained a Complete Remission relapse with FLT3 negative.

      The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the association between different FLT3
      mutations and the clinical, molecular and biological information.
