    
      Prospective, randomized, double-blind, explorative single center clinical trial in patients
      subjected to the treatment of an un-ruptured intracranial aneurysm, either by surgical
      clipping or endovascular coiling. Goal of the study is to determine whether remote ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC) prior to aneurysm treatment alters various biomarkers associated with
      ischemic central neuronal tissue damage. The trial takes place at Innsbruck University
      Hospital of Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.

      Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomly allocated either to pre-interventional
      ischemic preconditioning (Group A = intervention group) or sham preconditioning (Group B =
      control group). RIPC is performed by inflating a blood pressure cuff around one upper
      extremity three times for five minutes with five minutes interval with the patient under
      general anesthesia prior to the start of the procedure.

      Patients, all staff involved in diagnosis and treatment and all study members are blinded to
      the patients' group affiliation. The anesthesiologist and two staff members who perform
      preconditioning are not blinded.

      Primary outcome is a difference of Â± 2SD in the concentration-time curve of a panel of
      biochemical parameters indicative of cerebral ischemia (S100B, NSE, GFAP, MMP9, MBP,
      microparticles) in the first five days after the intervention. Secondary outcome parameters
      are changes in the post-interventional MRI and neuropsychological and clinical outcome at six
      and 12 months.

      CONSORT and TIDieR guidelines will be followed. The trail will be registered in a public
      database. The trail protocol will be published in an open-access journal.
