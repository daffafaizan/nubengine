      treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. In order to stratify plasma DNA samples based on the
      presence of low (i.e. z-score ≤5; corresponds to <10% ctDNA) versus high (z-score >5;
      corresponds to ≥10% ctDNA) genomic complexity in ctDNA the investigators employed the
      modified Fast Aneuploidy Screening Test-Sequencing System (mFAST-SeqS), which provides a
      plasma based marker of aneuploidy (z-score). Altogether 106 plasma samples with a low z-score
      will be evaluated only with the AVENIO ctDNA Expanded Kit, which is capable of detecting
      mutations with VAFs as low as 0.1% . From the 83 plasma samples with increased z-score will
      be sequenced with high coverage (70x) so that both mutations and nucleosome positions can be
      extracted from the obtained sequences. With the other 32 high z-score samples plasma-Seq will
      be conducted to establish genome-wide copy number profiles and 31 prostate cancer genes will
      be enriched to screen for mutations in these genes.

      At present, there is no evidence what parameters should be used to decide which treatment
      options are best for metastatic prostate cancer patients. The suggested innovative
      technologies, i.e. nucleosome position mapping and gene expression analyses will provide
      systematic maps of nucleosome positions. The sequencing of plasma samples with 70x will
      provide in addition a comprehensive view on the mutation spectrum in metastatic prostate
      cancer. By inclusion of primary tumor analyses, an unprecedented view on prostate cancer
      genome Evolution will be obtained. Overall, the comprehensive data set (copy number changes,
      mutations, gene expression) will allow pathway analyses with unprecedented resolution.
