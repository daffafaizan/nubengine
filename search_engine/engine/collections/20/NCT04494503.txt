    
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib/II study of safety, PK, PD and efficacy of
      APG-2575 as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or ibrutinib in
      relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL patients.

      This study consists of two parts: The first part is the APG-2575 single agent cohort
      expansion. The cohort expansion will be conducted at three dose levels of 400 mg, 600 mg, and
      800 mg. And up to 15 patients are planned to be enrolled at each dose level.

      The second part contains two arms: APG-2575 combined with rituximab (Arm A) and APG-2575
      combined with ibrutinib (Arm B). Both the two arms consist of two stages: dose escalation
      stage (first stage) and dose expansion stage (second stage). The first stage is the study of
      APG-2575 dose escalation combined with rituximab/ibrutinib. APG-2575 dose escalates according
      to the standard 3+3 design, the initial dose is 200mg, the dose of APG-2575 will be increased
      in subsequent levels, to 400mg, 600mg, 800mg respectively. The second stage is the MTD/RP2D
      expansion stage. Once the respective MTD/RP2D of arms A and B is determined, up to 15
      subjects in each MTD/RP2D dose level would be enrolled.

      APG-2575 will be administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle.

      Rituximab, on cycle 1 day 8(C1D8): 375mg/m2; on cycles 2-6 day l(C2-6D1): 500mg/m2, a total
      of six infusions.

      Ibrutinib 420 mg will be orally administered daily beginning from cycle 1 day 8 and
      continuously thereafter, every 4 weeks as a cycle.
