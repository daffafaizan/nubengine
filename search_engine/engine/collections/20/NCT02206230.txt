      70 years of age with good performance status (ECOG 0 - 2), will be well tolerated and yield
      survival non-inferior to conventional fractioned RT, allowing significant abbreviation of the
      length of the radiation course required for these patients with limited survival. The
      importance of hypofractionation is, therefore, not in improving survival, but rather to
      shorten RT duration to improve patient comfort and convenience. This approach is pertinent
      given the limited life expectancy of glioblastoma and has been used in patients with
      prolonged survival including breast and prostate cancers.
