      actinic keratosis (AK). Many strategies have been studied to improve the production of
      protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), to improve efficacy of PDT. Pre-treatment of the skin with
      fractional laser resurfacing is a novel alternative technique to improve the efficacy of PDT
      for AK. The investigators' previous studies showed that ablative fractional laser primed PDT
      (AFL-PDT) offered higher efficacy than conventional MAL-PDT in the treatment of AK. But,
      reduced response rates are also observed in thicker skin lesions, which may be due to
      insufficient PpIX accumulation within the target tissue.

      Cellular differentiation leads to increased synthesis of PpIX from MAL and consecutively,
      differentiation therapy enhances photosensitization effect. Topical calcipotriol is a
      well-known pro-differentiation hormone and was demonstrated to influence the effect of PDT on
      keratinocytes.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of topical vitamin D in AFL-PDT for AK
      treatment. Consequently, the investigator compared efficacy, recurrence rate, cosmetic
      outcome and safety between VitD - AFL-PDT and conventional AFL-PDT.
