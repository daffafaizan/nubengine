      program on health outcomes and quality of life of adolescents with chronic pain using a
      waitlist randomized controlled trial. In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in
      the experimental group will receive a manualized peer mentorship program that will provide
      modeling and reinforcement by trained young adults aged 16-25 years who have learned to
      function successfully with their pain. Mentoring sessions consist of 10 sessions of 30-45
      minute Skype calls over 8 weeks. Feasibility of the program will be measured in addition to
      quality of life, physical and emotional symptoms, pain coping, self-efficacy, social support,
      and self-management skills.
