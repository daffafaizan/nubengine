      an age of 60 years up to 20% are suffering from PAD in Western societies. Both, percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and surgical repair (bypass graft, thrombectomy) are well
      established procedures to improve peripheral arterial perfusion. However, long-term results
      remain disappointing: Low patency-rates are associated with clinical deterioration. Moreover,
      clinical outcome is often limited by early major cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial
      infarction, stroke).

      Therefore, medical therapy plays a major role in the management of PAD patients:
      Antihypertensive medication, statins as well as an adequate diabetes therapy are important
      cornerstones in the therapeutical management of PAD. Prior studies have shown that regular
      supervised exercise training can improve patientsÂ´walking impairment.

      We hypothesize that regular supervised exercise training significantly improves Quality of
      Life and decreases the occurence of future major cardiovascular adverse events. We further
      aim to investigate the effect of exercise training on peripheral microcirculation and
      endothelial progenitor cells.
