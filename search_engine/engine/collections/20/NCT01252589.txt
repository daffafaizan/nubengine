      Quality of Life Group (QLG). This process will follow three main phases.

      Phase 1 of will deal with the review of the literature, identification of an item list and
      interviews with experts in the treatment of CML and CML patients (undergoing all possible
      treatments).

      In Phase II the identified issues from Phase I will be worded and translated into possible
      items for the provisional questionnaire using existing EORTC questionnaires and the EORTC QLG
      Item Bank.

      In the Phase III the provisional CML questionnaire will be pre-tested by to a larger sample
      of CML patients (not the same patients involved in previous phases) and individual structured
      interviews will be conducted as well. These latter will identify questions that might be
      irrelevant or whether there will be additional issues not previously included.

      Overall up to 480 patients will be enrolled in this study (up to 180 in phase I and up to 300
      in phase III).
