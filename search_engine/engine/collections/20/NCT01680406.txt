      to chloroquine and then sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, artemether- lumefantrine (Coartem or AL)
      was adopted as first line therapy in Ethiopia in 2004. According to the current national
      malaria diagnosis and treatment guidelines updated in 2012, first-line treatment for
      uncomplicated P. falciparum infection is AL. First-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax (Pv)
      is chloroquine (CQ) alone in malarious areas and with primaquine in non-malarious areas at
      health center and hospital level. WHO recommends treatment of Pv with CQ or an
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in combination with primaquine. For all clinical
      infection without laboratory confirmation, AL is the first-line treatment since AL is
      effective against both Pf and Pv. Thus, in Ethiopia, where treatment for malaria without
      laboratory confirmation occurs frequently, Pv is often treated with AL as the standard of
      care. Similarly, the recommended drug for mixed infection with Pf and Pv is AL. Now with
      wide-spread use of AL and CQ and with evidence that malaria laboratory testing is occurring
      in about half of those suspected with clinical evidence of malaria infection, the
      investigators propose to conduct an antimalarial efficacy study to monitor the effectiveness
      of these therapies in Ethiopia and to determine how efficacious these drugs remain for Pv. In
      addition, with high rates of relapse with P. vivax infection, the efficacy and safety of
      co-administering primaquine will be assessed. This information will inform future policy
      changes with respect to appropriate antimalarial strategies.
