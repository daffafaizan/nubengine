      demonstrated to play a role in lipoprotein metabolism in 2003 when several gain-of-function
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PCSK9 were shown to associate with autosomal
      dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH). Soon after, loss-of-function nonsense and missense SNPs
      in PCSK9 were shown to associate with hypocholesterolemia. Much is still not known about
      PCSK9's mechanism of action, its substrate(s), its regulation, and factors affecting its
      function, but we do know that PCSK9 decreases LDL clearance through degradation of LDL
      receptors. We examined plasma PCSK9 and serum lipids in182 normolipidemic subjects (98 men,
      84 women) and found with Spearman analysis a significant correlation between plasma PCSK9 and
      total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and TC/HDL-C in men but not in women, suggesting a gender
      difference in PCSK9 regulation and/or function.

      Following on our unexpected but novel and exciting observation, we hypothesize: that serum
      levels of testosterone and estradiol would be significantly correlated with plasma PCSK9
      levels, that testosterone and 17-B estradiol replacement therapies in men and women
      respectively would result in changes in the levels of plasma PCSK9, that testosterone and
      estradiol modify the effect of PCSK9 on serum lipids in different ways, explaining at least
      in part, the gender dichotomy in PCSK9 function, and that a significant percentage of the
      effect of hormone replacement therapy on lipids is mediated through PCSK9 function.

      Cohort #1 will be 60 hypogonadal men and cohort #2 will be 60 postmenopausal (hypoestrogenic)
      women before and after testosterone and estrogen replacement therapy respectively. They will
      undergo measurements of plasma PCSK9, serum testosterone in men or estradiol in women and TC,
      triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C before and 3 months after starting on replacement therapy.
      These panel studies will allow us to evaluate whether (a) hormone replacement therapy has an
      effect on PCSK9, and (b) whether resulting changes in PCSK9 are then associated with lipid
      response.
