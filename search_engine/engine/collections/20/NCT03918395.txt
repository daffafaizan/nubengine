      mass, muscle strength and muscle cross sectional area following a period of resistance
      exercise training. In addition to protein, supplements high in polyphenols such as berry and
      pomegranate extract are believed to be an effective method of reducing soreness and
      facilitating recovery following a single bout of resistance exercise.

      However, whilst polyphenols are shown to facilitate recovery from a single session of
      resistance exercise, their effect on adaptations to repeated bouts of resistance exercise are
      unknown. Asking this question will allow a detailed investigation of the mechanisms by which
      protein-polyphenol ingestion may affect adaptations to resistance exercise training when
      compared to a non protein or polyphenol containing placebo, which is an important yet
      underexplored area
