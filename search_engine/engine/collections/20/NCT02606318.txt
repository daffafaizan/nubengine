      blocked randomization (block size 4) to either the experimental group (occupational therapy
      that included assessment and adjustment of the challenge-skill balance of the activities) or
      to the control group (occupational therapy as normally conducted at the day care center).
      Randomization was stratified by sex and EuroQol visual analogue scale, resulting in four
      layers. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life after 10 sessions of
      occupational therapy. Clients were assessed before the intervention (pre-test) and after the
      10th session (post-test). Significant differences were observed in the EuroQol-5 Dimension
      (EQ-5D) score and in the Medical Outcome Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) scores
      for general health, physical functioning , and vitality.
