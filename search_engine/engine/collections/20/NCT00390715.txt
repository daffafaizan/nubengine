      ethical committees for his application. It gathers the basic ideas of the present treatment
      of the AML, with optional induction according to preference of each center with daunorubicin
      or Idarubicin (x3) associated to AraC (x7). The patients who reach CR consolidate with an
      identical cycle to the used one in the induction. Later (if pte has identical donor HLA, and
      as much it as their doctors has preference by this option) receive allogenic transplant. The
      other patients who reach CR receive two intensifications, one that AraC to intermediate dose
      contains and another one with autologous transplant, previous preparation with Busulf√°n,
      Etoposide and AraC. Later all antileucemic treatment is suspended until possible relapse.
      This scheme of treatment is accompanied by a valuation of the quality of the CR with
      traditional morphology, Immunocytometry and molecular genetic study and of a pursuit of
      residual minimum disease (EMR) using the same techniques.
