      Each part contains 2 beds. The PICU had a traditional sparsely decorated interior. In
      cooperation with architects and the county building authorities one of the parts were
      redecorated to an interior like an ordinary Norwegian home. All patients admitted the the
      PICU were semi-randomized to either traditional or "Norwegian home" interior decorations.
      Symptoms, behaviour, and treatment were evaluated at admittance, day 3 and discharge from the
      PICU
