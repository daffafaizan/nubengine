      incidence in adolescence. Previous studies have shown that family-oriented interventions are
      effective in the treatment of Conduct Disorder. However, most therapies focus rather on
      symptom management and less on etiological causes without inclusion of the family in the
      therapeutic process. Previous research has linked specific symptoms of Conduct Disorder with
      deficits in mentalization ability. Mentalization is the ability to perceive one's own and
      other's behavior as the product of affective and cognitive mental states. Low or missing
      mentalization abilities are regarded as a risk factor for the development and chronification
      of Conduct Disorder.

      Aims: The study aims to investigate the feasibility of a newly manualized psychotherapy
      "Mentalization-Based Training for Adolescents with Conduct Disorder (MBT-CD)" that strives to
      decrease symptoms associated with Conduct Disorder by increasing mentalization in adolescents
      and their families.

      Methods: The study is feasibility and piolot trial, carried out in Heidelberg (Germany), and
      Mainz (Germany). Adolescents aged between 11-18, who meet the DSM-5 criteria for Conduct
      Disorder will receive MBT-CD. Times of measurement: t0 (Screening), T1 (Baseline, at the
      beginning of therapy), T2 (3 months after the beginning of therapy), T3 (at the end of
      therapy, after 6 months), T4 (follow-up, after 9 months).
