      stereotactic body radiation therapy regimen combined with gemcitabine. In the present study,
      5 daily fractions of 6 Gray will be given over two weeks. Stereotactic body radiation therapy
      will be given with the Cyberknife system. This treatment technique allows to give a higher
      dose to the tumor as compared to conventional external beam radiation while lowering the dose
      to the normal tissues around. This treatment system is also capable of following the motion
      that the pancreas assumes during respiration as well as during treatment. This enables us to
      reduce the margin of security and further reduce dose to surrounding normal tissue.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate acute and chronic toxicity of this regimen
      of stereotactic radiation therapy followed by gemcitabine. Quality of life, local control and
      overall survival will also be evaluated.
