      dental practice. All included patients were followed-up with special emphasis on the partial
      restoration(s), every time they visited the dental practice for regular dental check-ups
      between 2015 and 2017. To assess these restorations a light photograph with a digital camera
      (Nikon (D7100, 60mm lens), Nikon, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and an x-ray were taken from
      the partial posterior crowns and evaluated according to the modified United States Public
      Health Service (USPHS) criteria.
