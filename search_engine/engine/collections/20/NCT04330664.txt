      pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of MRTX849 in combination with TNO155 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors with a KRAS G12C mutation. MRTX849 is an orally available small
      molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C and TNO155 is a selective, orally bioavailable allosteric
      inhibitor of wild-type SHP2.
