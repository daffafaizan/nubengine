      Immediate Release (IR) and Extended Release (ER) forms of tapentadol (CG5503) to support the
      conversion from IR to ER, and ER to IR use. Dose equivalence will be examined in patients
      diagnosed with moderate-to-severe, chronic Low Back Pain (LBP) requiring drug treatment for
      at least 3 months, and who are dissatisfied with current therapy. The study consists of 5
      periods: a screening period during which patients are evaluated for study eligibility; a
      21-day open-label period to find the best, stable dose of tapentadol (CG5503) IR for each
      patient individually; a 14-day double-blind period when patients are randomly chosen either
      to continue for 14 days on the stable IR dose from the open-label period or switch to the ER
      form; a second, 14-day period during which patients switch to whichever form of tapentadol
      (CG5503) they did not take during the first 14-day period (the total daily dose [TDD] remains
      approximately equivalent for the IR and ER forms throughout both double-blind periods); and a
      follow-up period. During the study, pain levels will be recorded and overall safety measures
      taken. The expectation (thought) is that approximately equivalent doses of both forms of
      tapentadol (CG5503) provide equivalent effectiveness and safety and that the two forms can be
      directly converted by dividing the total daily dose by the number of times the drug is taken
      each day. During the 21-day open-label period, 50, 75 or 100mg of the IR form is given orally
      every 4 or 6 hours, starting with 50mg every 6 hours. Then, the dose, the frequency of giving
      the drug, or both may be increased, to a maximum TDD of 500mg, or decreased in 50 mg
      increments, with minimum TDD of 200 mg, until the optimal stable dose for a patient is found.
      During the 2 double-blind periods, a TDD approximately equivalent to the stable open-label
      dose is given orally in IR (or ER) form or placebo.
