      extremity amputee may need to use cognitive resources to focus on walking, monitor and
      control the prosthetic movements. The need to use cognitive resources may be higher in those
      with more proximal level amputation, such as above-knee level. The role of cognition and
      concentration is revealed by a cognitive task performed with posture and gait control using
      the dual task method. The dual task paradigm provides information about the automation of the
      default processes that underpin good performance disclosure. This approach involves
      performing two tasks at the same time. Dual task is divided into primary task and secondary
      task. The performance of the primary task while performing a single task is recorded. If
      there is a drop in performance when the secondary task is added, this indicates that the
      primary task needs high attention.

      In proximal amputations, with the lost of movement system structures, functional impairment
      increases. Amputation from the proximal level affects daily life activities and walking
      ability more. Above-knee amputees reported more functional difficulties in ambulatory
      ambulation than transtibial amputee.

      The aim of this study is to compare the time-distance characteristics of walking with single
      task, cognitive dual task, motor dual task in transtibial, transfemoral amputee and healthy
      people.
