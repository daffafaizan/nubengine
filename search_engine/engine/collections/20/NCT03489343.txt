    
      This study will evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) of Sym023, a recombinant, fully human, anti-T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain
      containing-3 (anti-TIM-3) monoclonal antibody (mAb). The goal is to establish the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of sequential escalating doses of
      Sym023 when administered once every 2 weeks (Q2W) by intravenous (IV) infusion to patient
      cohorts with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or
      lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard therapy is
      available. If an MTD is not identified, a maximum administered dose (MAD) will be determined.
      Sym023 will be given to patients in escalating dose cohorts; each patient will be given one
      fixed dose level.
