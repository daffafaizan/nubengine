      bariatric surgery in Assuta Hospitals (Assuta is a nationwide privet hospitals network),
      during the years 2013-2016.

      Patients underwent one of three procedures:

        -  laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG),

        -  laparoscopic gastrectomy by-pass (LGBP)

        -  laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) Demographic data of patients was collected
           (age, gender. BMI, habits, smoking, alcohol consumption etc.), as well as medical
           history, background diseases, family medical history, previous surgeries and procedures,
           chronic treatments, use of medications etc., We have also collected surgeons and
           hospital data - in which hospital was the surgery done? Surgery technique, surgeon's
           experience, capacity of surgeon - how many bariatric surgeries are done by the surgeon
           per months? Statistical analyses was done using chi square and Fisher's exact test for
           analyzing specific single variables. When analyzing the possible connection between BMI
           and bleeding, BMI values were split into three categories 30<BMI<35, 35<BMI<40 and
           BMI>40. The use of single variable analyses enabled us to focus on a relatively small
           number of variables in the multivariable analyses. Variables that were statistically
           significant (p<0.05) were used as independent variables in logistic regression tests.
