      of people who have been impacted by cancer, including patients, survivors and caregivers; 2)
      inform the research community, healthcare providers, patient advocates and policy makers
      around gaps in care and the psychosocial challenges of people affected by cancer; 3) use the
      findings to develop and disseminate tailored (data-guided) programs and services that will
      address the emotional and social needs and ultimately improve the long-term quality of life
      of people affected by cancer; 4) link registrants to cancer related resources and programs
      via an online, modifiable platform; and 5) provide collaborating sites (e.g.,
      hospitals/health networks/CSC affiliates) with aggregated reports on quality and needs of
      members or customers to enhance or improve quality of care.

      Findings from the Registry are disseminated online at
