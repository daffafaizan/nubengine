      diabetes patients free from secondary liver disease due to excessive alcohol usage, viral
      hepatitis, alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease or steatogenic or hepatotoxic drug
      use.

      The investigators will screen for NAFLD and fibrosis using multiple non-invasive techniques
      including

        -  ultrasound

        -  controlled attenuation parameter

        -  fatty liver index

        -  human steatosis index

        -  transient elastography

        -  FIB-4

        -  NAFLD fibrosis score

        -  NASH algorithm based on multiple parameters

      Subjects will be screened for microvascular and microvascular complications with:

        -  ECG

        -  microfilament examination

        -  24hour urine collection for microalbuminuria

        -  serum kidney test (creatinine, eGFR)

        -  fundoscopy

        -  peripheral arterial pulsation palpation

      The investigators will subsequently thoroughly characterize various metabolic and
      anthropometric parameters and document any microvascular or macrovascular complications.

      The patients will be annually rescreened for both NAFLD-related as cardiovascular variables.
      Therefore this study will assess the correlation between NAFLD, cardiovascular risk, and type
      1 diabetes in a prospective manner.
