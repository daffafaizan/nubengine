      healthcare systems and is especially prevalent in Veterans. In 2008, the VHA released the
      Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook (Handbook 1160.01) in an effort to expand services
      for Veterans with depression, including those in primary care and CBOC settings.

      The VA remains a national leader in mental health services, but the provision of
      psychotherapy within VA is limited, especially for rural Veterans and those cared for in
      CBOCs. The VA has invested significant resources to improve access to high-quality mental
      health care, including a rapid expansion into CBOCs. Currently, there is a need to work with
      clinicians and stakeholders to address practice barriers related to mental health practices
      in CBOCs. A recent survey of 4,200 mental health providers in VA found that, although robust
      expansion and improved quality of mental health care services has occurred, access to proven
      effective psychotherapies in CBOCs remains a focused area for improvement. The study will
      examine whether existing VA CBOC mental health clinicians, with training and support, can
      effectively administer a structured brief cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) intervention
      for Veterans with clinically elevated symptoms of depression.
