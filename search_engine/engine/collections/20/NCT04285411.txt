      pulse oximetry system. The study was conducted in accordance to Code of Federal Regulations
      (CFR) for Non-Significant Risk (NSR) investigational studies, following International
      Standards Organization (ISO) 14155:2011 as appropriate and the pulse oximetry guidelines of
      ISO 80601-2-61:2017 applicable sections, and Pulse Oximeters - Premarket Notifications
      Submissions [510(k)s] Guidance For Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (issued:
      March 4, 2013).

      The purpose of this study was to validate the SpO2 accuracy of the VitalDetect™ pulse
      oximetry system during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 as compared to
      arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry. It was expected that the Accuracy Root Mean
      Square (ARMS) performance of the oximetry system would meet the required specification of
      ARMS of 3.0% or less.

      A secondary goal was to evaluate the pulse rate performance simultaneously collected over the
      SpO2 range covered. The Pulse Rate Accuracy Root Mean Square (Arms) performance of the
      VitalDetect™ pulse oximetry system, were expected to meet a specification of 3 bpm.
