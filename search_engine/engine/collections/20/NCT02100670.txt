    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, repeat-dose, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group trial in participants with ankle sprain. Eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (1% diclofenac plus 3% menthol gel, 1%
      diclofenac plus 0.09% menthol gel, 3% menthol gel or placebo gel with 0.09% menthol).
      Treatment will be self-administered by participants four times daily on an out-patient basis.
      Participants will rate pain intensity score (NRS) at rest and on movement, pain relief score
      (PRS) and cooling and soothing sensations. After leaving the clinic, participants will
      continue to complete scheduled pain intensity and pain relief assessments and answer
      questions about cooling sensation by answering questions in a paper diary card. The
      investigator (or designee) will measure the ankle swelling via the 'figure-of-eight' method
      on treatment Days 1 (at Baseline), 3, 7 and 10.

      Participants will continue treatment until they are pain free or for up to 10 days, whichever
      occurs first. At the end of the treatment, participants will be assessed for function of the
      injured joint by the investigator. In addition, the participants will evaluate treatment
      satisfaction, sensory features of the gel and provide a global assessment of the treatment by
      using a questionnaire.
