    
      Patients diagnosed with AD who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be treated
      with a single dose of LGT delivered intravenously (IV) and intrathecally (IT).

      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as "Day 0." Safety and efficacy
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.

      Study objectives

      Primary: Safety and Tolerability

      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by IV and IT administration.

      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy

        1. Investigate LGT's ability to deliver hTERT to human cells and lengthen telomeres.

        2. Investigate the effects of lengthening telomeres on AD.

        3. Investigate other benefits provided by lengthening telomeres.
