      replacement are being increasingly offered at clinics across the country. These treatments
      contain both autologous cells that are often referred to as "stem cells" or "MSCs" and
      extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Cell therapies containing ECM are thought to have the following
      advantages over treatments prepared using enzymatic digestion: (1) preservation of the
      stromal vascular niche, which allows time-release of the regenerative factors; (2) release of
      bioactive molecules by exosomes, which have been demonstrated to be significantly greater in
      mechanically processed fat than enzymatically processed fat; and (3) maintenance of the
      structural and morphologic unit, which is thought to increase cell efficacy by making the
      cells more resilient to the harsh conditions in the recipient environment. Case reports
      investigating the use of autologous fat treatments show promise, but a number of questions
      remain unanswered. Agents injected into the joint tend to be quickly cleared from the body
      and ECM itself has the potential to produce inflammatory signals and induce osteoarthritis.

      This study will use a Hyaluronic acid (HA) as an active control, which is the standard of
      care for pain associated with osteoarthritis. The use of HA as an active control for
      autologous cell-based therapies is well established and is the best option given the need to
      aspirate fat tissue from patients who will be receiving the study treatment.
