      molar were assigned to either SSRI users or SSRI non-users groups. SSRIs users were 45 women
      who take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment from a psychiatric clinic to the clinic of
      the endodontic department of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. SSRIs non-users were 45
      women who did not take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment to the same dental clinic. The
      protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the university (no. 394867).
      Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. The level of anxiety of the
      patients was determined by using the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. The patients registered
      their baseline pain severity using a Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (HP-VAS). Two standard
      IANBs (1.8-mL cartridges) of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Darupakhsh, Tehran,
      Iran) were administered to each patient. Fifteen minutes after injection, the teeth were
      isolated. Access cavity preparation was started. The patients was instructed by the same
      operator to mark his or her pain experienced during the access cavity preparation.
