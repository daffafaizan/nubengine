      macrovascular complications. Therefore, understanding the impact of glycemic fluctuations on
      diabetic macroangiopathy could be helpful for discovering a strategy of prevention and
      treatment of macroangiopathy in diabetes. However, previous studies on the glycemic
      fluctuation in T2DM patients with CI were cross-sectional studies, there has been no
      prospective intervention study confirming the effects of glucose fluctuation targeted
      management on the prognosis of T2DM patients following CI. Based on previous fingdings,
      investigators will assess the effects of glucose fluctuation targeted intervention on
      metabolic index, neurologic function, and quality of life in T2DM patients and CI.
