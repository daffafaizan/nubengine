      do not present consistent screening recommendations for this group. However, all guidelines
      stress the need for screening decision making with a provider. This study evaluated the
      effectiveness of a brochure designed for the female partners of AA men, designed to help
      promote such discussion on the part of their mates. We also explored the effect of the
      partner's monitoring style (i.e., the extent to which the partner typically attends to health
      threats) on promoting discussion.

      Methods: Female partners of AA men (N=231) were randomized to receive either a Pca screening
      CDC brochure for AA men, combined with a "partner" brochure containing strategies to promote
      men's initiation of a provider visit to discuss screening, or the CDC brochure only, and
      completed pre- and post-intervention surveys online.

      Conclusions: High monitoring partners may be effective in influencing their AA mates to
      initiate provider discussion, particularly when tailored messaging is provided.
