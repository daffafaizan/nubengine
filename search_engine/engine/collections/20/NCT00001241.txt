    
      This protocol describes the use of histamine H2-receptor antagonists to control gastric acid
      hypersecretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It details which patients will be
      considered for treatment with these agents, the pretreatment procedures and the procedures to
      be followed in establishing the proper intravenous dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist.
      It also details the procedure to be used to establish a safe and effective oral long-term
      maintenance dose of either cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, or famotidine. By following
      these procedures it will be possible to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous histamine
      H2 therapy if it is determined this is important for antisecretory control during periods
      when patients cannot take oral gastric antisecretory agents. It will also be possible to
      evaluate the effectiveness of histamine H2-receptor in patients with Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome after successful gastrinoma resection who continue to have mild gastric
      hypersecretion.
