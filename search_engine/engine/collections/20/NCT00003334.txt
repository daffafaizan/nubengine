      liposome and paclitaxel in patients with endometrial cancer, tubal cancers, and sarcomas and
      carcinosarcomas (mixed mesodermal tumors) of gynecologic origin. II. Define the safety
      profile of the combination of doxorubicin HCl liposome and paclitaxel in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into two groups. Group 1 consists of patients with untreated
      endometrial and tubal cancers and Group 2 consists of patients with sarcomas and
      carcinosarcomas (mixed mesodermal tumors) of gynecologic origin subdivided into no or prior
      therapy. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome intravenously on day 1 of each treatment
      course. Paclitaxel is administered intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of each course.
      Courses are repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxic
      effects or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every
      6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
