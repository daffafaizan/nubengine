    
      This study was an open-trial study. Sixty subjects participated in it. The study was
      explained to the subjects and they voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their eligibility
      to participate in the study was checked, and they were randomized either into the simple
      microfracture group or the modified microfracture group using collagen based on a
      randomization table. They were asked to follow the guidelines of the investigators during the
      study and to visit the hospital five times, including for screening. At each visit, the
      subjects underwent an examination with doctors and MRI to evaluate the efficacy of the
      procedure. (*If the subject began the first visit on the screening date, the total number of
      his or her visits was four.)
