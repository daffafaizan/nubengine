      stimulation (TENS) have been applied solo or combined with exercise for management of neck
      pain (NP), however, the efficacy of these combinations are unclear. In this study, our
      objective were to determine if TENS or IFC increase the effectiveness of neck stabilization
      exercises on pain, disability, mood, and quality of life for chronic NP. 81 patients with
      chronic NP were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups; Group
      I: neck stabilization exercise, Group II: TENS+ neck stabilization exercise and Group III:
      IFC+ neck stabilization exercise. Patients' pain levels (visual analogue scale (VAS)),
      quality of life (short form- 36), mood (Beck depression inventory (BDI)), levels of
      disability (Neck Pain and Disability Index) and the need for analgesics were evaluated prior
      to treatment, at 6th and 12th week follow-up. All participants had group exercise accompanied
      by a physiotherapist for 3 weeks and an additional 3 weeks of home exercise program.
