      sclerosis (MS).

      Ofatumumab is a human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which depletes B-cells, a component
      of the immune system. This study investigates if ofatumumab treated patients can have an
      immune response that may be protective after receiving the influenza vaccine.

      There will be a one week screening period to assess eligibility for the trial. All eligible
      participants will receive an influenza vaccine during the Screening Period prior to the
      Investigational Period. This study will enroll 66 participants with relapsing multiple
      sclerosis into three cohorts in multiple centers. Up to 44 of the participants will begin
      treatment with ofatumumab or will already be receiving commercial ofatumumab. The remaining
      22 participants will remain on their Injectable Disease Modifying Therapy (iDMT). There will
      be 4 weekly visits during the Investigational Period which will last 4 weeks. There will also
      be an optional, 6 month Extension Period for Cohorts 1 and 2, who received ofatumumab, to
      further evaluate immune response. Cohort 3 will not enter the Extension Period.
