      the treatment of HIV-associated lipoatrophy. Subjects will receive blinded study treatment
      for 48 weeks. This study will examine the effect of rosiglitazone on limb fat and
      mitochondrial indices in HIV-1-infected subjects receiving stable antiretroviral therapy that
      does not contain d4T or AZT. The study also will assess the safety and tolerability of
      rosiglitazone in this population, and its effect on carotid IMT, prevalence of metabolic
      syndrome, lipid parameters and glucose metabolism.
