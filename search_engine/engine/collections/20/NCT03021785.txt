    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of multiple intravitreal injection TK001 in patients
      with AMD. It consists of core study (12 weeks) and extension study (40 weeks). In the core
      study, patients will receive their assigned dose in a 50-Î¼L solution administered as an
      intravitreal injection every 4 weeks. In the extension study, they will be evaluated every 4
      weeks and administrated PRN (pro re nata) with their assigned dose. The safety,
      pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of TK001 will be evaluated in the
      core study, and will also be assessed in the extension study except pharmacokinetics.
