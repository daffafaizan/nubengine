      maintain clinical remission. During clinical remission patient can be free of symptoms for
      long periods of time. Inflammatory bowel disease patients have been shown to have adherence
      rates around 40-60%. Non-adherence in patients in clinical remission is high with rates
      around 60%. Non adherence in patients in clinical remission can have significant impact
      because it can lead to higher rates of clinical flares and increased health care cost.

      This will be a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate if patients randomized
      to an iPphone application vs. control can increase the adherence of their maintenance
      medication. The trial will last three months and we hope to enroll 99 patients.

      The primary outcome will be adherence measured by the medication possession ratio. The
      secondary objective will be to evaluate if a validated adherence questionnaire can predict
      adherence in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

      Having an intervention that can increase adherence can provide better care for patients. Also
      having a validated survey tool can accurately identify non-adherence in inflammatory bowel
      disease patient would be a valuable tool for patient care.
