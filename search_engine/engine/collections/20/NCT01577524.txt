      literature. These investigations focus on the efficacy of using peri-operative antibiotics,
      Povidone Iodine skin preparations, the effects of shaving around the surgical sit, and the
      use of intra-operative diluted Povidone Iodine wound irrigation in preventing post-operative
      infections.

      Povidone-iodine is a complex of polyvinyl pyrrolidine and tri-iodine ions widely used as an
      antiseptic agent. It has bactericidal activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens,
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The safety of its use
      intra-operatively has been evaluated in animal studies and also supported through Randomized
      Controlled Trials in spinal surgery and in other surgical subspecialties.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the intra-operative use of diluted
      Povidone Iodine solution in reducing post-operative infections when used for irrigating
      surgical incisions during spinal surgery compared with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation
      Solution (i.e. normal saline solution).

      The primary outcome measure will be seen as a reduction in the number of post-operative
      infections. As a result and although not directly measured, it is suspected that a reduction
      in post-operative infections may result in quicker healing with fewer complications and pain.
