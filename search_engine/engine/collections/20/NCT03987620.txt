      into the study and will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either oral ibrexafungerp or
      ibrexafungerp matching placebo, as follows:

        -  Oral ibrexafungerp 300-mg dose BID (bis in die) for 1 day

        -  Oral ibrexafungerp matching placebo BID for 1 day

      This is a randomized, double-blind study.

      Approximately 366 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of
      the two study treatment groups. Subjects will be followed for assessments of efficacy and
      safety for approximately one month after study drug administration. The design of this study
      is identical to VANISH 303 Study: NCT03734991
