      immediate effects of lumbar SMT on kinetic and kinematic symmetry of asymptomatic athletes,
      through of the use of three commonly used functional tests: Static posture, Free Squat, and
      Countermovement Jump (CMJ) are often used as indicators of athlete's performance. These
      quantitative data is important to assess training effectiveness and prevention/
      rehabilitation programs outcomes. To our knowledge this is the first study on literature that
      measured the immediate effects of SMT on kinetic and kinematic symmetry.
