      dyad's (person with dementia and their family care partner) health, safety, mortality, and
      likelihood of nursing home placement. READyR II tests a dynamic tailoring phase of an
      intervention program that was previously developed to remotely assess dementia-related care
      needs using digital data on behavioral patterns (from sensors and wearables) in the home.
      READyR II follows participants who have completed READyR for a total of six months in order
      to detect anomalies in activity patterns that may indicate new and unforeseen care needs.

      People who voluntarily decide to participate in this follow-up intervention study will be
      asked to continue participating with the in-home monitoring sensor platform, complete weekly
      questionnaires, and receive regular follow-up telephone calls from the study team.
