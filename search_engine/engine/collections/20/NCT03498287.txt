      improvements in patient-reported symptom severity. It is also hypothesized that the effects
      from active study device treatment will be significantly greater than effects from sham
      treatment. In both cases, it is hypothesized that improvements will be sustained
      post-treatment.

      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-arm trial
      consisting of an eight-week treatment period (active study device or sham), followed by one
      required follow-up four weeks later (at week 12).

      There are two study groups: the active device group receiving the active study device and the
      sham group receiving a non-active sham device. Subjects will be informed that they have a
      50:50 chance of receiving treatment or a sham. They will also be informed that if they
      receive sham device, they will be offered the active device 4 weeks into the post-treatment
      period. However, all subjects will not know what treatment they are on until the conclusion
      of the trial.
