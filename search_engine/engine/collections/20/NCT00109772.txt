    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult subjects with Complex
      Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Type 1.

      One hundred eighty (180) subjects diagnosed with unilateral CRPS Type 1 will be enrolled and
      randomized to receive orally either 10 mg/day of lenalidomide or placebo (90 subjects per
      treatment arm). For each subject, the study consists of three phases: Pre-randomization Phase
      (2 weeks), Treatment Phase (12 weeks) and Extension Phase where subjects have the opportunity
      to receive lenalidomide treatment as long as a benefit is derived from the drug. Subjects who
      complete all 12 weeks of the treatment phase may be eligible to receive lenalidomide in the
      extension phase. Subject may continue in the extension phase as long as a benefit is derived
      from the drug.
