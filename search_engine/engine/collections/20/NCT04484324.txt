      mechanical factors such as range of motion and flexibility, while ignoring the neural
      adversative mechanical tension that may be created during stretching exercises. According to
      the literature , stretching induced neural tension may adversely affect the central nervous
      system and nerve root function due to the absence of the perineurium, which is the primary
      load carrying structure. Thus, safe or unsafe limits of nerve elongation are not well
      established, despite several basic scientific and clinical studies.. Consequently, in the
      present study, the current study aimed to answer the question: Is it theoretically possible,
      that increased longitudinal strain and stress on the spinal cord and nerve root from
      continuous stretching exercises may subtly impair the neural function? Our hypothesis is that
      a duration threshold exists where, once reached, adverse neural function will be apparent
      resulting in a reduction of either or both latency and amplitudes of evoked potentials.
