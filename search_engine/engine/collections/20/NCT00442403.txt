      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance leaves few alternative for the control of malaria,
      particularly in Africa. For some strains of P. falciparum and P. berghei, the resistance to
      CQ and AQ is linked to an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and GSH-related enzyme
      activity, such as glucose 6-phosphate deshydrogenase (G6PD). The pro-hormone
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate can be used to potentiate the antimalarial action of CQ on
      drug resistant P. falciparum strains, by inhibiting parasite G6PD activity. This hormone has
      a second advantage: it is metabolised in human into a series of potent immunomodulatory
      steroids which may be in the causal pathway that allowed the induction of protective immune
      responses against several infections, included malaria. This first study evaluated the
      tolerance and efficacy of a standard CQ regimen supplemented with dehydroepiandrosterone
      sulphate for the treatment of drug resistant uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
