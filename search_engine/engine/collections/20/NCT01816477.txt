      pain control: the On-Q system versus epidural. All subjects had additional pain management as
      per standardized protocol including subject controlled intravenous analgesia with morphine
      equivalent narcotics for a maximum of 48 hours at which time the subject was transitioned to
      oral pain medications. Subjects using less than 5 mg of Morphine in the first 24 hours after
      surgery were transitioned to oral pain medications at 24 hours. After transition to oral
      analgesia, subjects with continued pain assessment greater than 5 were administered
      intravenous morphine equivalents by nursing staff until pain assessments were less than 5.

      ON-Q catheters could have been maintained for up to 6 days. Discharge of subjects with
      catheters in place was planned. The catheter was removed in the out-patient clinic if the
      subject was discharged before the 6th day. Subjects with epidural had their epidural
      discontinued at 72 hours.

      Data was recorded for each subject by site personnel while the subjects remained
      hospitalized, but were recorded in a journal by subjects after discharge up to postoperative
      day 7.
