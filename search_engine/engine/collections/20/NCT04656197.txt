      studies revealed that the ocular microbiome plays an important role in maintaining ocular
      surface homeostasis and health. Commensals colonizing the ocular surface seem to support the
      local innate immune system. As the ocular microbiome coordinates several functions together
      with ocular mucosal and immune epithelial cells, alteration of the microbiome can lead to
      changes in the integrity of the ocular surface. This can lead to the development of ocular
      surface related diseases such as dry eye. Inflammation seems to be a key component of dry eye
      disease in terms of being a propagator as well as a consequence. In contrast to earlier
      approaches of identifying the microbiome by cultivating with only limited results, it is now
      possible to provide more details regarding all microbiota residing on the ocular surface due
      to modern sequencing techniques. Thus, the overall aim of this study is the identification of
      the role of the ocular microbiome in dry eye disease.
