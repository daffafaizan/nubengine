      preoperative mortality remains higher than expected. The aim of the goal-directed
      heamodynamic therapy (GDT) is to improve the altered cardiovascular function and to reach the
      desired intraoperative values of oxygen supply (DO2) and cardiac index (CI). Standard
      haemodynamic measurements, such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central
      venous pressure (CVP) remain relatively unchanged despite reduced blood flow. However, GTD is
      able to detect early hypo perfusion abnormalities. The aim of goal-directed heamodynamic
      therapy, based on the titration of fluids and vasoactive drugs to physiological flow-related
      end points is to reduce perioperative complications, perioperative morbidity and mortality.
      We hypothesise, that following this treatment regimen results in reduced postoperative
      complications (primary endpoint) and reduced length of hospital stay (secondary endpoint).
