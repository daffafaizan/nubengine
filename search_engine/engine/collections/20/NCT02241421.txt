      studies. BÃ¤cked et al. showed that germ free mice had 40% less body fat compared to
      conventionally raised mice. Transplantation of a cecum-derived microbial community of
      conventional mice into germ free mice, resulted in a significant increase of body weight and
      insulin resistance within 2 weeks. Application of metagenomic techniques in leptin-deficient
      ob/ob mice showed a different proportion of bacteria belonging when compared to lean,
      wild-type or heterozygous mice, with a greater representation of Firmicutes and fewer
      Bacteroidetes. This obese gut microbiome showed an enrichment in genes involved in energy
      extraction from food, less energy left over in the faeces and higher contents of the
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) propionate, acetate and butyrate in the cecum.

      Furthermore, microbiota composition may alter gut permeability, and may play a role in the
      development of metabolic endotoxemia (inflammation) and related impairments in glucose
      metabolism. In addition, the gut microbiota may determine AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
      levels in muscle and liver, thereby affecting fatty acid oxidation (substrate metabolism) and
      fat storage. However, underlying mechanisms are not completely understood.

      Therefore, researchers within the Top Institute Food and Nutrition (TIFN) have designed a
      multidisciplinary project ('Microbiota, energy balance and metabolism'), to fill the unmet
      gap between gut microbiota and human energy metabolism. The current protocol is designed to
      clarify the role of the gut microbiota in host energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity,
      with the main focus on underlying mechanisms.
