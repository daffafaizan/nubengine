    
      Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is known as insulin resistance and progressive beta cell
      dysfunction.

      Combination therapy with biguanides, glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) agonists or dipeptidyl
      peptidase-4 inhibitor(DPP4I) and thiazolidinediones(TZD) seems reasonable theoretically, for
      their effects on different pathophysiologic defects.

      Current treatment guidelines recommend a stepwise approach starting with lifestyle
      modification or lifestyle modification + metformin monotherapy, with recent focusing on
      patient individualization.

      In Korea, Korean Diabetes Association also recommends stepwise approach and at the same time,
      emphasizes on the initial aggressive treatment including oral combination or insulin therapy
      according to HbA1c level to achieve target goal <6.5%.

      Guide to the efficacy, timing, options of combination therapy is not clearly defined due to
      lack of sufficient evidences yet.

      There is no clear report to demonstrate the clinical benefit of initial TZD and DPP4I
      combination therapy in the Korean.

      Thus it is reasonable to study the effect of combination therapy in the patients with
      sub-optimal glucose control with metformin therapy only, comparing various combination
      options metformin with DPP4I only, TZD only, or both.

      The hypothesis of this study is that combination therapy of alogliptin and pioglitazone added
      on the metformin has superior effect on HbA1c reduction than metformin and either alogliptin
      or pioglitazone in 6 month treatment.
