      is efficacious and safe, particularly in combination with MMF, and seems to be associated
      with lower mortality and graft loss rates than classic cyclosporin protocols. Nevertheless,
      the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in monotherapy, double or triple therapy with MMF, as
      well as the induction therapy with the new anti-IL2 receptor antibodies have not been
      adequately used in controlled trials in the elderly renal transplant patient. There is only
      scarce information on age-associated immune responsiveness and only a few aged-adapted
      immunosuppressive regimens have been described.
