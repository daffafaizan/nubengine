      for about 30 days. This study is aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of D-PLEX in
      prevention of post abdominal surgery incisional infection.

      Eligible and willing subjects will be randomly divided, in a single-blinded manor into 2
      study arms D-PLEX with SOC or SOC alone. D-PLEX will be applied during the surgery at the
      final stage of incision closure. All patients will be followed up for additional 5 visits
      over 2 months, for safety and incisional wound assessment. This will include blood tests for
      hematology, chemistry and PK (for some only) as well as physicians assessment of the
      incisional wound.
