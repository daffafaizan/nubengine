      stones larger than two centimeters. Unfortunately, because of the large stone burden, up to
      70% of these patients are left with residual stone fragments after their initial PCNL.
      Additionally, an estimated 20% to 60% of such patients ultimately require further
      interventions due to residual stone fragments. The need for a subsequent procedure is
      determined by postoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is routinely
      performed on the first postoperative day at this institution. The decision to proceed with a
      second procedure is based on findings from this postoperative CT scan.

      Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is a novel portable imaging technique that can allow cross-sectional
      imaging to be obtained intraoperatively, rather than post-operatively. Incorporating this
      modality would allow the surgeon to determine whether the procedure should be continued, in
      the event of residual fragments, or if it can be safely concluded. This would obviate the
      need for dedicated postoperative CT scans and, more importantly, reduce the need for
      subsequent procedures and consequently decrease the patient's length of stay.
