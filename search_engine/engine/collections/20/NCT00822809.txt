      was administered as 6 hour i.p. infusion showed that most reported AEs were cytokine
      release-related symptoms such as fever, nausea, and vomiting (based on the pharmacodynamic
      mode of action of catumaxomab) and abdominal pain. In order to make the catumaxomab treatment
      more convenient for the patient and the hospital praxis the current trial was designed to
      determine whether tolerability of the 3 hour infusion of catumaxomab with and without
      premedication of prednisolone. Prednisolone was chosen as additional premedication with the
      objective to reduce cytokine release related symptoms which might change with the switch from
      6 to 3 h infusion time.
