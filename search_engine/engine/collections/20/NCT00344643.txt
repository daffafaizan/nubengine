      versus 6-night extended wear and 30-night extended wear of novel hyper-oxygen permeable
      contact lenses on bacterial binding to corneal cells and central epithelial thickness. Usual
      and customary care will be given in the form of eyeglasses and contact lenses. To compare
      long-term Daily wear vs. immediate Overnight wear (Extended wear) of a new hyper-oxygen
      permeable silicone hydrogel contact lens on binding of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa to exfoliated
      human surface corneal cells collected from the eyes of human patients and on central corneal
      thickness, as follows: 1) a hyper Dk/t lens for 12 months of daily wear, 2) a hyper Dk/t lens
      for 12 months of de novo 6 night extended wear, and 3) a hyper Dk/t lens for 12 months of de
      novo 30 night extended wear.
