      in Chinese PLA General Hospital. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the
      adequate hydration group guided by Vigileo and control group. For the adequate hydration
      group guided by Vigileo, Vigileo equipment is used to perform hemodynamic monitoring through
      the femoral or radial arteries to obtain relevant hemodynamic parameters (CO, SV, SVV), and
      the fluid-rehydration velocity of normal saline is adjusted according to the flow parameters
      of blood flow. The specific scheme is: if the patient is mechanically ventilated, the
      following scheme is adopted: if SVV≤10%, then adjust the rehydration speed to 1 ml/kg/h; if
      10%<SVV<15%, then adjust the rehydration speed to 2 ml/kg/h; if SVV≥15%, then adjust the
      rehydration speed to 5 ml/kg/h. The hydration lasts 24 hours after operation, and the
      rehydration speed is changed according to the SVV. If the patient does not use mechanical
      ventilation, the following scheme is adopted: 250ml normal saline is administered within 10
      minutes after direct PCI, and the rehydration volume changes to 125ml in patients with
      mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure. If the increment of SV≥15%, then adjust the
      rehydration speed to 5 ml/kg/h; if 10%≤the increment of SV<15%, then adjust the rehydration
      speed to 2 ml/kg/h; if the increment of SV<10%, then adjust the rehydration speed to 1
      ml/kg/h. Reassessed every 1 hour until SV is stable，and the hydration also lasts 24 hours
      after operation. For the control group, the routine hydration regimen is adopted,
      perioperative saline ≤500 ml hydration. The changes of renal function (serum creatinine,
      serum cystatin), symptoms and signs of cardiac insufficiency during perioperative period and
      cardiac objective indexes (left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic
      diameter, brain natriuretic peptide) are observed. The incidence of postoperative acute
      pulmonary edema is recorded, and the major cardiovascular events and hemodialysis events are
      followed up for 6 months. By comparing the perioperative indexes of heart and kidney function
      between the intervention group and the control group, the preventive effect of adequate
      hydration guided by Vigileo on contrast induced nephropathy after direct PCI was clarified.
