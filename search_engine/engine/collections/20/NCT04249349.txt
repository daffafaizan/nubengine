      assistance during gait on stroke's survivors with hemiparesis.

      The device is composed by a passive orthosis structure which allows one degree of freedom
      (DOF) among the sagittal plane and it includes two servomotors attached to the user's foot
      through velcro strips.

      Gait pattern through an optoelectronic motion capture system will be analyzed. Additionally,
      ergonomic and comfort aspects will be measured by an adapted spanish version of Quebec User
      Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST)
