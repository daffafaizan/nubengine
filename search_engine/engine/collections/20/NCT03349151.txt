      anaesthesia will be included in our trial. Patients will be randomized to a soft food diet
      (honey, skimmed cheese, soup, mashed potatoe, pudding, grissini) served on postoperative 2nd
      hour or whenever they wanted to eat on return to the ward. Thirty minutes after they eat
      their meal, nausea, vomiting, ileus and distention will be questioned. Participants will be
      provided with the visual analogue scale (VAS), which will be presented with a statement
      explaining what was intended to measure. Patient satisfaction before discharge from hospital
      will be recorded by the patient by using a 100-mm VAS (0= minimum satisfaction, 100= maximum
      satisfaction). Time to first flatus passage and defecation will be recorded after the
      caesarean section.
