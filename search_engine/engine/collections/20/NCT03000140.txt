      interindividual variability after exercise training, being yet unknown what mode of exercise
      (e.g. endurance, strength, concurrent, or high intensity interval training) produce more/less
      non-responder (NR) prevalence (i.e., percentage of subjects who experienced a
      non-change/worsened response after training in some outcome).
