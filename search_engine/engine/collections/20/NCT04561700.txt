    
      In this parallel-group randomized controlled trial, ELBW infants (birthweight < 1000 grams)
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either weekly reporting on objective measurements
      of sucking activity during oral feeding (intervention group) or usual care without
      information on sucking activity (control group).
