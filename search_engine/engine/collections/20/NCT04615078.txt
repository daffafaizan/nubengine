    
      A prospective randomized study with two arms.

      The primary endpoint is the level of nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation, defined as the
      average PtCO2 in nocturnal capnography performed at 6th month.

      Patients with hypercapnic chronic respiratory failure requiring home NIV (n=100).

      Multi-center study conducted in France involving approximately 20 sites

      Product under study: Chronic Care Connect Pneumology telemonitoring solution, combining:

        -  a technical solution for the transmission and analysis of ventilator data, with the
           generation of alerts by a CE-marked algorithm;

        -  an organizational solution relying on a nurse call center.

      Study design:

        -  First visit: eligibility criteria confirmation; randomization to 2 groups:

             -  the "Telemonitoring" group will participate in the ETAPES experimentation, with
                remote monitoring of their ventilator data with generation of alerts to the nurse
                call center, medical action if requested, and therapeutic education.

             -  the "Standard of Care" group will receive standard medical follow-up, with
                transmission of their ventilator data without generation of alerts.

        -  Second visit (6th month): arterial blood gases, nocturnal capnography. Collection of
           medical events having occurred in the past 6 months.

        -  Third visit (12th month): for COPD patients only - Collection of medical events having
           occurred in the past 6 months.

        -  At the end of the study, the investigators will complete a qualitative questionnaire on
           their telemonitoring practice.
