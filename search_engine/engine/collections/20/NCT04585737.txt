    
      Randomized, open-label, active-controlled study of virologically suppressed participants
      living with HIV

      Participants who provide written informed consent and meet all the eligibility criteria will
      be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following 2 treatment groups:

      Treatment Group 1 (n=148): FDC of DTG/3TC (50mg/300mg) administered orally, once daily (QD),
      without regard to food.

      Treatment Group 2 (n=74): Stay on baseline regimen consisting of FDC of B/F/TAF (50mg/200mg/
      25mg) (taken as prescribed) without regard to food.

      Randomization will be stratified by gender and race at entry given that this study aims to
      enroll at least 30% of participants who are female and African American.

      All participants will be responsible for using their insurance plan to obtain coverage for
      DTG/3TC and or B/F/TAF, in addition to any labs required by the study. This expectation is
      clearly outlined in the informed consent. The study team will work with participants to
      minimize their co-pays for study medications and labs through the use of manufacturer and
      other external assistance programs.

      Study duration will be 48 weeks.

      Number of participants planned: Approximately 222 participants

      Target Population: HIV-1 infected adult participants who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1
      RNA<50 copies/mL) on FDC of B/F/TAF (50mg/200mg/ 25mg) â‰¥ 3 months prior to screening
