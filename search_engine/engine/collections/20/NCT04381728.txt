      and/or cervix leading to partial or complete obliteration of the cavity". IUAs are the major
      long-term complication of intrauterine procedures and are associated with pelvic pain,
      menstrual disorders, obstetrical complications and infertility.

      Womed Leafâ„¢ is a sterile, degradable polymer film specifically design for intrauterine use.
      It is inserter in the uterus like an intrauterine device. Once released it will self-deploy
      into the uterine cavity to form a mechanical barrier keeping uterus walls separated during
      healing, for several days, thus preventing the formation or recurrence of intrauterine
      adhesions. It is degraded and discharged naturally through the cervix and vagina in less than
      30 days.

      The PREG1 clinical investigation is a prospective multicenter, single arm study, designed to
      evaluate Womed Leaf safety under clinical conditions, in women scheduled for a hysteroscopic
      myomectomy as well as its efficacy in preventing IUA at second look hysteroscopy.
