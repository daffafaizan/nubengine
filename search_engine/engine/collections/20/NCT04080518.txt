      for T2DM, which lower blood glucose levels by increasing renal sodium (Na+) and glucose
      excretion. However, their applications seem to go beyond glycemic control. Recent studies
      have shown that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly improves cardiovascular
      outcome, with unprecedented reductions in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure
      hospitalizations. The underlying mechanism of this surprising effect is unclear.

      Our hypothesis is that increased Na+ and glucose excretion induced by SGLT-2 inhibitors
      predisposes to water loss, to which the body responds by increasing urea production in an
      effort to prevent dehydration. Urea is accumulated in the renal medulla, where it provides
      the alternative osmotic driving force for water reabsorption. However, hepatic urea
      production is an energy-intense process, for which amino acids from skeletal muscle are the
      ideal fuel because they provide both the nitrogen and the energy needed for urea generation.
      Alanine is transported from muscle to the liver, where it serves as a substrate for new
      pyruvate generation, which can then be used for the urea cycle, glucose production or ketone
      body generation. In the same time, as increasing amounts of alanine are shuttled to the
      liver, muscle will deplete its glucose reservoirs and reprioritize fuel utilization in favour
      of fatty acids.
