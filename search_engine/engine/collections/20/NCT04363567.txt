      varying degrees of chronic kidney disease compared with healthy controls assessed by

        1. salt-blood test

        2. release of endothelial glycocalyx proteins.

      and to see how this correlates to

        1. blood pressure (peripheral and central)

        2. pulse wave velocity

        3. albuminuria

        4. coagulation system

        5. vasoactive hormones (PRC, p-Ang-II, p-Aldo, p-ANP, p-BNP, p-AVP)
