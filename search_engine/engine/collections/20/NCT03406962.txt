    
      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MGTA-456 in patients
      with IMD after receiving myeloablative conditioning and HSCT. MGTA-456 is an expanded CD34+
      cell therapy product candidate given to induce rapid and sustained hematopoietic engraftment.
      In patients with selected IMDs, transplant is expected to replace defective or missing
      protein and preserve neurodevelopment. Since MGTA-456 offers increased numbers of HSCs over
      standard umbilical cord blood, it is expected to reduce the risks of prolonged neutropenia
      and thrombocytopenia and graft failure, and potentially transplant-related mortality (TRM).
      Patients with Hurler syndrome (also referred to as mucopolysaccharidosis-1H (MPS-1H)),
      cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or globoid cell
      leukodystrophy (GLD) (also referred to as Krabbe disease) are eligible for this study.
