    
      This study assess the association between digital functional measures from physical
      monitoring devices (devices like a watch tracking steps, a heart rate monitor) and
      patient-reported standard oncological assessments. The study will also test the feasibility
      of obtaining the measures in clinic and at home from the monitoring devices in participants
      with cancer. Participants will be asked to spend 1 hour in clinic performing simple tasks
      such as walking and standing with 7 digital devices recording movement data. The participants
      will also be asked to fill out survey data regarding their health. At-home data will be
      collected for 14 days. During this time participants will wear a watch to collect movement
      and step data, and a lumbar belt to collect movement data.

      Primary Objective:

      1. Assess the association of 5 main digital physical functional measures (mean steps per day,
      mean sedentary activity time, light activity time, moderate activity time, and vigorous
      activity time (in minutes) per day) recorded at home with patient-reported standard
      oncological assessment (e.g. KPS)
