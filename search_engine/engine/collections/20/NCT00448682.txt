      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with unresectable stage IV gastric
           adenocarcinoma treated with floxuridine, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel
           as first-line treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in managing patients with unresectable stage
           IV gastric adenocarcinoma who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic
           disease.

        -  Determine disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel IV over
      30 minutes, floxuridine IV over 24 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 1,
      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
