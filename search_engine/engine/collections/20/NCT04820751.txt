      pathophysiology of certain clinical-biological characteristics of COVID-19, linked to an
      excess of serotonin. We hypothesize that the antagonism of the action of serotonin could
      improve the clinical course of patients most severely affected by COVID-19.

      One such antagonist of serotonin with a long track record of safety and tolerability is
      cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine acts as an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT=serotonin)
      receptor subtype 2 as well as histamine-1 receptor. Many of the potent effects of serotonin
      on lung vascular tone, respiratory rate, and systemic vascular beds are mediated by 5-HT
      receptor subtype 2.

      Investigators will randomize approximately 200 participants, aged 18 and older, who have
      tested positive for COVID-19 and who will be hospitalized at Santa Cabrini Hospital in
      Montreal, Quebec, Canada, presenting a severe form of covid-pneumonia-19 requiring
      supplemental oxygen.

      Study eligibility of all participants will be assessed first. Once a participant is confirmed
      eligible and consented, they will participate in the study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (1: 1) to either take cyproheptadine 8 mg by mouth
      three times a day for 5 days and receive standard care or receive standard care alone.

      The dose will be adjusted according to the glomerular filtration rate.

      On D1, D3, D5, D7 and D10 since randomization, participant's vital signs (including SpO2,
      respiratory rate, FiO2 or oxygen flow, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature), blood
      creatinine, bilirubin, CRP, LDH, Dimers and platelets the count will be evaluated. Any
      adverse event will be assessed daily and documented.
