    
      Approximately 40 subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) with REM Sleep Behavior Disorder
      (RBD) and Depressive Symptoms, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with Depressive Symptoms,
      Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) with Cognitive Fluctuations, and Parkinson's Disease Dementia
      (PDD) with Cognitive Fluctuations will be enrolled in a 2 period, 2-way crossover design
      following study eligibility confirmation during the screening period. The number of subjects
      enrolled in each cohort may change as emerging data are reviewed from this and other studies.

      During each treatment period, subjects will receive daily doses of CST-103 co-administered
      with CST-107 or matching placebo for 14 days. Each treatment period will be separated by a
      washout period of 14 days (+5-day window).

      All subjects will complete clinical and pharmacodynamic assessments during each treatment
      period and PK blood samples will be collected prior to, during and after study medication
      administration.
