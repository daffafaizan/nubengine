      world. In Pakistan, approximately 18% to 60% of women experienced depressive symptoms at some
      point during their pregnancy. Early intervention for the management of mental illness in
      pregnancy is imperative as the effects of perinatal mental ill-health is not only limited to
      mothers but also can negatively impact child health outcomes. In a public health context,
      positive psychological interventions should be promoted as it reduces the burden of
      treatment, and enhance cost effective approaches in resource poor countries such as Pakistan.

      As in Pakistan, no program has been planned and tested to enhance the positive psychological
      wellbeing among pregnant women that is based on individual strengths, that can be learnt,
      sustained and low cost as well. Hence, this study aims to facilitate pregnant women in
      practicing constructive coping and proactive skills which will help them to focus more on the
      positive approach of life rather than looking for the negative situations that is carried out
      in their daily lives.

      The study will carried out in two phases:

      Phase I: The objective of phase one is study is to develop "SM-ART" intervention [Safe
      Motherhood ART: Accessible Resilience Training]

      Phase II: The objective of phase two is to test the effectiveness of "SM-ART" intervention
      [Safe Motherhood ART: Accessible Resilience Training] to improve resilience, marital harmony
      and decrease depression and pregnancy related anxiety in a sample of pregnant women
