      that has not spread beyond the chest area. Radiotherapy is used as a curative treatment but
      unfortunately for most patients the cancer can return. Radiotherapy kills cells by damaging
      their DNA. Cells have the ability to repair that damage, especially the cells of normal
      tissue. If DNA repair can be prevented radiotherapy should be more effective causing the
      cancer cells to die.

      The study will use new drugs that affect how cells repair DNA damage, called DNA damage
      response inhibitors (DDRi). These will be given together with radiotherapy to hopefully
      improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy. The study will try to find out the most effective
      and safe dose of this combination treatment. There will be a clinical trial where patients
      due to have radiotherapy, with the hope of successful treatment that could lead to cure from
      their cancer or extension of life, will be offered entry onto the study. All patients will
      receive their radiotherapy, with 3 out of every 4 people also receiving a single DDRi drug
      alongside this. Both patients and study doctors will know prior to the start of the actual
      treatment whether a DDRi will be given, and if so which one; no placebos will be used. The
      patients will be followed closely to check for side effects and to assess how their cancer is
      responding to treatment. Blood samples will be taken to monitor treatment progress and to try
      to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from this type of combined treatment.
