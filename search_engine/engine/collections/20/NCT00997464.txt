      testing process, from initial contact through to receiving their genetic testing results. A
      questionnaire will be used to measure variables at both baseline and after proceeding through
      the testing process. A small cohort of men will be invited to be interviewed to gather some
      in depth qualitative data about the issues that have arisen during the study process.
