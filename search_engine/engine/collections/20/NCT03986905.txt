      vial prefilled with DPI-386 Nasal Gel or placebo nasal gel, and (b) a nasal gel pump attached
      to the vial during the manufacturing process. Each 0.12 gram of the gel contains 0.2 mg of
      scopolamine HBr as the active ingredient along with the excipients sodium citrate, citric
      acid, sodium metabisulfite, glycerin, benzalkonium chloride, polyvinyl alcohol and purified
      water. The DPI 386 Nasal Gel is formulated to contain 0.2 mg scopolamine HBr per 0.12 g dose,
      with each dose therefore described as "0.2 mg / 0.12 g". The placebo nasal gel product is the
      same but does not contain scopolamine HBr. Each vial of DPI 386 Nasal Gel or placebo nasal
      gel is a multi-dose product, sufficient for three days of dosing (two doses per day). Each
      pumping action is designed to deliver a single 0.12 g dose. Each vial/delivery device must be
      primed by the subject prior to first dose delivery for that vial. Each time a new bottle is
      used, it needs to be initially primed with 5 actuations. The 6th actuation is the first dose
      and subsequent actuations are doses 2-6 of that bottle. No re-priming is needed at all.
      Subjects will be trained in priming by research staff, and all priming will be performed
      under supervision by the research staff. All subjects will self-administer the nasal gel
      twice daily over the three day treatment period, with no more than two doses every 24 hours,
      unless a third dose is deemed necessary by the PI or qualified designee, and the two daily
      doses separated by a minimum of six hours Â± 15 minutes
