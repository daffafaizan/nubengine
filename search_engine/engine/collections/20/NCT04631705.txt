    
      The phase 1 component of this trial consists of a single-inhalation open-label
      dose-escalation phase (Groups 1A-1C and Groups 2A-2C). Subsequently, the highest tolerated
      dose tested will be administered to an expansion cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals
      (Group 2D). In this randomized and blinded group, participants will receive DZIF-10c or
      placebo both by inhalation and intravenous infusion.
