      follow-up of patients with HMV in order to improve their compliance and evaluate its
      cost-effectiveness. Telemedicine will be provided by an integrated platform composed by a
      website and a smartphone application for achieve a real feedback between patients and
      clinicians.

      Design: Prospective randomized clinical study that will include 184 patients with HMV. The
      study will be divided in two phases, the first one consisting on the website and App system
      development and the second one consisting on a clinical trial where the two follow-up systems
      (standard care vs MyVENT group) will be compared.

      Randomization: Patients will be randomised into two groups, HMV treatment management with
      standard care vs. telemedicine follow up.

      Intervention:

      Group 1:MyVENT group: patients will be followed up by tele-monitoring support. MyVENT System
      will be updated with data extracted from the ventilation equipment. This information and the
      results of the complementary tests will be sent to the clinician.

      Moreover, with MyVENT APP patients will receive information about their treatment and advices
      to improve therapy if needed.

      Group 2: Standard care. In this group all the visits will be performed at hospital following
      daily clinical practice.
