      risk of developing duodenal adenomas. In 30% to 92% of FAP patients duodenal adenomas are
      detected, with a lifetime risk approaching 100%. Of these duodenal adenomas, only a small
      proportion develops into duodenal cancer, with a prevalence of approximately 5-10% in FAP
      patients.

      Endoscopic surveillance is nowadays the standard of care to prevent FAP patients from
      developing duodenal cancer. The severity of duodenal polyposis is assessed using the
      Spigelman classification system. This classification is based on the number, size, histology,
      and grade of dysplasia of the duodenal adenomas, resulting in a score varying from 0-IV,
      guiding surveillance intervals and treatment.

      Concerns are rising on the accuracy of the Spigelman score as predictor for duodenal cancer,
      especially for ampullary cancer. Over the past years, multiple studies demonstrated
      limitations of this staging system including the fact that this classification does not
      adequately predict duodenal/ampullary cancer and does not guide endoscopic or surgical
      interventions. A clear endoscopic intervention protocol is needed, not only to prevent the
      development of cancer but also to prevent the need for duodenal surgery, since these surgical
      procedures are associated with high complication and mortality rates.

      With this study, the investigators aim to evaluate a personalized surveillance and
      intervention protocol for the duodenum and stomach with the goal to prevent the development
      of advanced neoplasia (AN) by endoscopically removing lesions before they progress to AN.
