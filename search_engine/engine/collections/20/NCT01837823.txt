      changes in plaque morphology from atherosclerotic lesions after high-dose statin therapy by
      utilizing NIRS, IVUS and optical coherency tomography (OCT) imaging modalities in the
      coronary arteries. We propose to image non-culprit coronary lesions using these modalities in
      patients with two or three diseased coronary vessels deemed to warrant intervention on
      clinical grounds. Thus, at the time of enrolment patients will undergo Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention (PCI) of a non-study culprit lesion, and triple-modality imaging of the
      potential non-culprit ('YELLOW') lesion. If there is high baseline lipid content in the
      non-culprit YELLOW lesion (max 4mm LCBI > 150), patients will be formally entered into this
      study. Following this, all enrolled subjects will receive high-dose lipid lowering therapy
      (rosuvastatin 40mg daily). The non-culprit YELLOW lesion will undergo staged intervention
      8-12 weeks following study enrolment and baseline imaging. At this time the YELLOW lesion
      will be reimaged to determine whether high-dose statin therapy caused a reduction in lipid
      content as assessed by NIRS, and other altered plaque morphology as assessed by OCT and IVUS.
      In addition, both at baseline and at the time of final non-culprit YELLOW lesion PCI, blood
      samples will be drawn during baseline and follow-up procedure to characterize reverse
      cholesterol transport by ability of patient HDL to accept cholesterol from cholesterol-laden
      (mouse J774) macrophage (cholesterol efflux) and the effect of patient HDL and apolipoprotein
      A1 on macrophage gene expression and migration.
