      effective treatment for newly diagnosed CP-CML patients when compared with standard imatinib.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion, stratified by Sokal risk score at diagnosis
      (low, intermediate, high), to receive once daily oral administration of either ponatinib or
      imatinib. Efficacy measures include molecular, cytogenetic, and hematologic response rates at
      various timepoints; time to, duration of, and durability of responses; and survival
      follow-up. Safety measures include clinical laboratory testing, adverse event monitoring,
      vital signs, physical exams, ECGs, and ECHOs. Other measures include two patient-reported
      health outcomes questionnaires (FACT-Leu and EQ-5D-5L), determination of mutation status,
      and, for ponatinib only, measurement of steady-state plasma concentration. Accrual is
      expected to take approximately 2 years, and patients will be followed for survival for up to
      8 years after the last patient's first dose; therefore, patient participation may last up to
      10 years.
