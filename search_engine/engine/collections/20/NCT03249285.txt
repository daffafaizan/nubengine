    
      At screening visit each patient will be genotyped for SNPs in preliminary genetic profiles
      with a custom SNP array.

      The therapy scheme includes 2-4-week run-in period after which eligible patients will be
      treated according to their genetic profile with Peri 4 mg or HCTZ 12.5 mg. Titration to Peri
      8 mg or HCTZ 25 mg could be possible after one month treatment.

      Patients without any genetic profile will be randomly assigned to HCTZ or Peri treatment as
      control groups.

      The treatment period will last 8 weeks, while the study about 10-12 weeks

      Four cases may occur:

        -  patient with HCTZ profile, HCTZ treatment;

        -  patient with Peri profile, Peri treatment;

        -  patient without HCTZ nor Peri profile, randomization for HCTZ or Peri;

        -  patient with both profiles, treatment according to the profile with the higher number of
           positive contributors.

      Eligible patients will be treated according to their genetic profile with Peri 4 mg or HCTZ
      12.5 mg/die.

      Titration to Peri 8 mg or HCTZ 25 mg could be possible after 4 weeks treatment. The treatment
      period will last 8 weeks, while the study about 10-12 weeks
