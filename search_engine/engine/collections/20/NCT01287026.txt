      into specific heart cavities. Heart catheterization usually uses X-ray guidance, which
      involves radiation exposure and which fails to visualize soft tissue.

      We have developed real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide heart catheterization
      with tissue visualization but without X-ray radiation. In the first phase of this protocol we
      showed that comprehensive right-sided heart catheterization is feasible in adult patients,
      using commercially available MRI-compatible ( passive ) catheters.

      In the second phase of the protocol, we began performing systematic right-sided heart
      catheterization without X-ray whenever possible. We will assess the hearts response to
      hemodynamic provocation during MRI catheterization tailored to the patient s problem. We will
      use this protocol to further refine the technique

      If successful, this will enable future testing of devices for adult and pediatric MRI-guided
      catheterization, such as special active wire guides, which may lead to new non-surgical
      treatments of cardiovascular disease.
