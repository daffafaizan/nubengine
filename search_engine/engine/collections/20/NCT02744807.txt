      presence of plasma cells. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of CE in
      recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). One of the most common uterine abnormalities for RPL is
      Intrauterine adhesion (IUA).Intrauterine adhesion, also known as Asherman's syndrome, is the
      partial or complete occlusion of the uterine cavity as a result of endometrium damage. Most
      intrauterine adhesions patients manifest amenorrhea, reduced menstrual pattern, infertility,
      and intrauterine growth restriction, which seriously affect their reproductive health.It is
      well established that the formation of IUA likely involves hypoxia, reduced
      neovascularization, and altered expression of adhesion-associated cytokines, but the exact
      mechanisms are not well understood. Although excessive curettage is considered the primary
      cause, intrauterine adhesion is known to be associated with diverse non-traumatic factors,
      such as postabortal sepsis, puerperal sepsis and infections. It is therefore possible to
      hypothesize that Intrauterine adhesion may be related to chronic endometritis. To the best of
      researchers knowledge,there have been no reports investigating this relationship. The aim of
      this study was to clarify the hypothesis by evaluating the prevalence of chronic endometritis
      (CE) in women with severe intrauterine adhesions and compare recurrence of adhesion in women
      with and without chronic endometritis (CE).
