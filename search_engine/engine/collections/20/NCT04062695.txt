    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study
      to investigate the efficacy of Tofacitinib in reducing inflammation in the sacroiliac joints
      and in the spine on MRI in patients with active axial PsA.

      Eligible patients (n=80) will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Tofacitinib 5mg orally
      twice daily or placebo for a 12-week period. After week 12, all patients will receive
      Tofacitinib 5mg orally twice daily for another 12 weeks. The study duration will include a
      6-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period and a safety follow-up period of 4 weeks.
      Patients will be closely monitored throughout the study on a total of 11 visits. Safety data
      will be collected in the form of adverse events, vital parameters, physical examinations, and
      laboratory parameters throughout the study.

      The baseline MRI of the whole spine and sacroiliac (SI) joints will be performed within the
      6-week screening period to confirm the presence of active inflammation (bone marrow edema)
      compatible with Spondyloarthritis (will be assessed by a central reader), at week 12 to
      evaluate the primary study endpoint, and at week 24 to evaluate the secondary endpoint.

      The primary study endpoint will be an improvement of the total Berlin MRI score for
      sacroiliac joints and spine at week 12 as compared to baseline.
