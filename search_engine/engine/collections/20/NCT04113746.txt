    
      Of the 400 obese and non-obese adult asthmatics in New York City and Denver during the
      18-month observational phase of this study, the study team will randomize 80 participants (40
      in NYC and 40 in Denver) into a 4-week group session pilot study focused on beliefs and
      behaviors associated with asthma and obesity self-management behaviors (SMB). Eligibility
      will be determined based on Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score and body mass index
      (BMI) at their 12-month visit. Participants will be randomized into an intervention or an
      active control arm after completing their 18-month visit. Participants will be consented into
      the pilot study during or after their 18-month visit. Participants will be put into groups of
      7-10 for the pilot. Once formed, groups will have four 1-hour weekly visits. A person will be
      allowed to make up one missed session. The make-up session will be conducted on the phone or
      in-person depending on scheduling availability of both participant and care coach.
      Participants will be given accelerometers at sessions 1 and 4 that they will be asked to wear
      for seven days and return along with an activity diary. A follow-up survey will be
      administered about 30 days after the last pilot session in order to reassess the patient's
      asthma, obesity, exercise and medication beliefs and their adherence to asthma SMB. At the
      time of the follow-up survey, participants will also be given accelerometers that they will
      be asked to wear for seven days and return along with an activity diary.
