    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability (including the rate of diarrhea) of adjuvant
           therapy comprising docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab (Herceptin®), and lapatinib
           ditosylate in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate LVEF in patients receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1, trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and oral
      lapatinib ditosylate on days 1-21 (TCHL). Treatment with TCHL repeats every 3 weeks for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral lapatinib ditosylate on days 1-21 (days
      1-7 of course 12 only) (LT). Treatment with LT repeats every 3 weeks for 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity..

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for up to 8 years.
