      Coronary abnormality is the most serious complication preventable with intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration. Various treatment regimens of IVIG have been
      reported.The optimal administrative doses of IVIG deserves more observations.We will conduct
      a multicenter, randomized, prospective trial to determine the effect of different doses of
      IVIG (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once) for Kawasaki disease. The KD children will be
      randomly assigned to three groups and were given different IVIG regimen (1g/kg once, 1g/kg
      twice, 2g/kg once)as initial treatment. Patient age, gender, white blood cell count,
      hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), red blood cell
      specific volume (HCT) , serum albumin, the fever days,and the cost of hospital stay will be
      analyzed among the three groups. The primary outcome is the duration of fever subsided and
      the incidence of coronary artery lesions .
