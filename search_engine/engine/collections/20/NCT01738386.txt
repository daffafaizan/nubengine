      conceptualization of disease, and coping strategies of persons with frontotemporal dementia
      (FTD). FTD is the second most prevalent cause of early-onset dementia after Alzheimer
      disease, and has a significant genetic origin. Currently, there are no published studies
      describing the personal experience or coping styles of individuals with FTD. To accomplish
      the study s objectives, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 20 to 30 dyads of
      patients with FTD and their spouse/partner caregivers. The caregivers will be interviewed
      about the experience of the person with FTD. Both sets of interviews will be audiotaped,
      transcribed and subjected to thematic content analysis. Themes emerging in both members of
      each dyad will be compared and contrasted in order to understand the subjective experience of
      the disease. Insight into the personal illness experiences of individuals with FTD will
      inform future clinical intervention studies.
