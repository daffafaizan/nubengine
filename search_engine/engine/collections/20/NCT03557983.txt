      the skin during cancer treatment as well as a result of other exposure to radiation. The skin
      is one of radiosensitive organ systems in human body because it is a continuously renewing
      organ containing rapidly proliferating and maturing cells. Ionizing radiation promotes
      reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS/ROS) production due to radiolysis of water and
      direct ionization of target molecules, which result in oxidative damage and skin injuries. It
      is considered that ~95 % of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy will develop some
      form of radiodermatitis, including erythema, dry desquamation, and moist desquamation.
      Radiation-induced skin injury negatively affects the process of radiotherapy and the quality
      of patients' life. Despite substantial improvements in radiation technology,
      radiation-induced skin toxicity is still a concerning problem. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether topical application of fenofibrate is safe and effective for
      radiation-induced skin injury.
