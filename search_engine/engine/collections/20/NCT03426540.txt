      for management of early prolific diabetic retinopathy, but its safety and efficacy still
      require study. Therefore, the aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal
      conbercept after vitrectomy for the management of early proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy.The patients were randomly assigned (25 eyes each group) to either treatment
      group and control after they provided informed consent. The treatment group received
      intravitreal conbercept (10 mg/mL, 0.5 mg) immediately after surgery, while the control group
      did not.

      At the time of study enrollment, physical examinations, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      intraocular pressure and central retinal thickness will be measured and fundoscopy be
      performed.

      The patients are going to be followed up for at least 6 months via BCVA measurement,
      fundoscopy, OCT, physical examinations and postoperative complications
