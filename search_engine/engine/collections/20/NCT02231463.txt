      catheter the diameter of the subclavian vein is measured by ultrasound under 6 different
      conditions. The conditions are

        1. neutral positioning, PEEP 0 cm H2O,

        2. neutral positioning, PEEP 5cm H2O,

        3. neutral positioning, PEEP 10cm H2O,

        4. Trendelenburg positioning -20°, PEEP 0 cmH2O,

        5. Trendelenburg positioning -20°, PEEP 5 cmH2O,

        6. Trendelenburg positioning -20°, PEEP 10 cmH2O After these measurements a central venous
           catheter is used to measure the central venous pressure.
