    
      The Type 2 Diabetes Exemplar Programme has been designed as a collaborative effort through
      partners from the Discover-NOW Health Data Research Hub in North West London (NWL). The
      remote care service is being used in primary care to demonstrate how data and technology can
      improve health outcomes for people living with T2DM. The service has been designed via a
      cross-industry collaboration between North West London Clinical Commissioning Groups (NWL
      CCGs), AstraZeneca, Imperial College Health Partners and Huma. The service will be offered
      for patients at high risk of developing complications from T2DM (such as heart attack and
      stroke) and will combine video group consultations, remote monitoring via a smartphone app,
      and educational content such as lifestyle and diet advice.

      This service seeks to strengthen population health management by providing better-tailored
      services and proactive interventions, particularly among population groups more at risk of
      the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Mortality risk from COVID-19 is approximately 25% higher in
      patients with T2DM and shielding has resulted in reduced primary care appointments for
      patients with T2DM. This has created an immediate need for primary care to adapt to provide
      care remotely to people with T2DM. Digital-first remote pathways could make care more
      accessible while finding time and cost efficiencies. By combining video group consultations
      and remote monitoring, we can inform the patient-clinician conversation making remote care in
      group settings safer, efficient and more personalised.
