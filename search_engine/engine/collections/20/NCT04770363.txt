      rehabilitative techniques of physical therapy and occupational therapy practice depending
      peripheral methods for gaining motor functions. There is a great need to develop methods in
      order to improve the outcome of physical or medical rehabilitation and enhance long-term
      functional outcome. Many researches' work over the past several years have inspected the use
      of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to promote the advantageous effect of
      neurological rehabilitation.

      The aim of This study Is to compare between the effect of unihemispheric and bihemispheric
      tDCS on the motor outcome, and spasticity in sub-acute ischemic stroke patients.

      Thirty sub-acute ischemic stroke patients participated in the study, randomly assigned to one
      of three groups-tDCS bihemispheric or unihemispheric or sham group. Those patients had stroke
      in the last 3 months at maximum with NIH stroke score less than 25. ActivaDose tDCS (USA),
      the only FDA cleared device available for tDCS used in the clinical study to deliver
      noninvasive brain stimulation, consisted of 20 minutes of 2 mA in each session for twelve
      sessions three sessions per week. All participants received physiotherapy and rehabilitation
      therapy was tailored to meet all patients' deficits, and lasted a total of 45 minutes per
      day, 3 days per week for four weeks.
