    
      All patients will undergo general anesthesia for their primary procedure, i.e. inguinal
      hernia repair. Once under general anesthesia, the abdomen will be prepped and draped in the
      usual sterile surgical fashion. The edge of the umbilical hernia defect will be palpated and
      in case there are any contents of the hernia present, they will be pushed into the abdominal
      cavity. Adequate relaxation, again, will be assured. A 24 gauge needle will be used to inject
      1cc of Deflux ("Study Product") into each quadrant at the junction between the preperitoneal
      space and the inner palpable rim of the fascial defect. The surgeon's index finger stays in
      the center of the hernia defect, protecting the hernia sac contents from re-herniating.
      Closure of the umbilical defect will be confirmed by palpation immediately after injection. A
      sterile wound dressing will be applied and the primary surgical procedure will be performed
      afterwards.

      Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints:

      The endpoint of this study is closure of the umbilical hernia.

      Data Collection Methods, Assessments, and Schedule (what assessments performed, how often): A
      data collection file is started at the time of enrollment in the study. Data collection
      includes patient age, gender, and weight at the time of operation, inner diameter of the
      umbilical hernia defect at the time of operation, description of the immediate postoperative
      results and follow-up exams at two weeks, one month, and six months.
