      the procedure will be performed. Age-, gender- and race-matched healthy subjects will be
      recruited from general population, and the procedure will be performed at the procedure room
      of the AIRC. Patients at Parkland will be screened and selected by Dr. Jeffrey Browning and
      Dr. Rodney Infante. After ingestion of 25 mg/kg [U-13C3]glycerol plus 25 mg/kg unlabeled
      glycerol in water (total glycerol dose, 50 mg/kg), blood will be drawn at +60 and +120 min.

      Healthy subjects will make two visits to the AIRC for screening and study procedures. The
      screening visit will take an hour and the study visit will take 3 hours. Volunteers will be
      made comfortable in the procedure room of the Research Center. All the study procedures at
      both Parkland and AIRC will be under the direction of the principal investigator, Dr. Jeffrey
      Browning.
