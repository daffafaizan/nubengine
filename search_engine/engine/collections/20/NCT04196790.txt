      predictive tools for VTE in cancer patients is lacking.

      In patients with metastatic broncho-pulmonarycancer, biochemical characteristics might help
      to identify patients at high risk for VTE, particularly in adenocarcinoma.

      The aim of this study is to derive a predictive score combining clinical and biochemical
      variable that predict VTE in metastatic broncho-pulmonary cancer.
