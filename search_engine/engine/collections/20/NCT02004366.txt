    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether in-hospital glycemic control, as measured by mean daily
      glucose concentration and frequency of hypoglycemic events, is different between treatment
      with linagliptin (TradjentaÂ®) plus correction doses with a rapid-acting insulin analog before
      meals and a basal bolus regimen with glargine once daily and rapid-acting insulin analog
      before meals in general surgery patients with T2D.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of an A1C based discharge algorithm in
      controlling BG after discharge in patients with T2D. Patients who participate in the
      in-hospital arm (Aim 1) will be invited to enroll in this open label prospective outpatient
      study. The total duration of the study is 3 months.
