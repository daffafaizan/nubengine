      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of repeat treatment with an intramuscular dose of
      Mentor Purified Toxin in the reduction of glabellar rhytides (frown lines). Approximately 700
      subjects will be enrolled at approximately 12 clinical sites in the U.S.A.

      Effectiveness will be determined by the degree of frown line reduction, during maximum forced
      frown and at rest (neutral expression):

        -  as assessed live by the study doctor,

        -  as assessed live by the subject, and;

        -  as assessed by an independent reviewer based on subject photographs

      Frown lines are graded on level of severity based on this scale:

      Severity

        -  Minimal (0)

        -  Mild (1)

        -  Moderate (2)

        -  Severe (3)

      There are two parts to this study. In the first part, all study participants will receive
      treatment with an intramuscular injection of 30 Units of Mentor Purified Toxin on two
      separate occasions (Cycles 1 and 2) no more than 6 months apart. In the second part of the
      study (Cycle 3), subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular
      injections of 30 Units of Mentor Purified Toxin or placebo (preservative-free saline) and
      subjects will be followed for 1 month (3:1, PurTox : placebo).

      Each subject will receive five intramuscular injections for a total of 0.5 mL of study drug
      in the glabellar area, during each treatment visit. Participation takes place over a maximum
      of 14 months, including Part 1 (Cycle 1 and 2) and Part 2 (Cycle 3). The number of clinic
      visits will vary from person to person depending upon the subject's response to the study
      drug, but will range from approximately 9 to 19 clinic visits. There will also be up to 4
      telephone follow-up contacts.
