      side effects associated with prilocaine for spinal anesthesia in ambulatory settings.

      Data will be obtained from an internal database where are prospectively recorded clinical
      data from spinal anesthesia consecutively performed with prilocaine at our institution for
      ambulatory surgery from 2011 to 2019. Variables recorded in the database and analyzed will
      include demographic data, type of surgery, presence of surgical, anesthesiological or general
      complications, need for unplanned admission and percentage of completed database records.
