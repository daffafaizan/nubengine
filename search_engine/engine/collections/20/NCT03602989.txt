    
      This prospective, multi-center clinical study is designed to validate the performance of an
      AI enabled software - Shenzhen SiBright AIDRScreening - in detecting referable diabetic
      retinopathy (RDR, defined as more than mild NPDR) among study subjects primarily by
      evaluating its sensitivity and specificity.

      The subjects enrolled in this trial are patients with T1DM and T2DM. For those who qualify,
      color fundus images of each eyes are taken and then independently graded for RDR by both the
      device under test and a centralized reading center, which, for the purpose of this trial, is
      the Image Reading Center at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University (ZIRC). The
      grading from ZIRC serves as the gold standard to compare the device performance against.

      The trial plans to enroll 1000 subjects. With a 95% confidence interval, the sensitivity is
      expected to be at least 85% whereas the specificity at 90% or above.

      Fundus image quality assessment is performed according to the National DR Screening Imaging
      and Grading Guideline jointly published by Chinese Ophthalmological Society and Chinese
      Medical Doctor Association in 2017.

      The diagnosis of RDR is based on the National DR Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline
      published by Chinese Ophthalmological Society in 2014.

      A brief overview of the clinical protocol is as follows:

        1. Candidate screening phase: recruiting qualified trial subjects;

        2. Clinical phase: imaging and grading by AI and ZIRC;

        3. Statistical analysis phase: comparing two outputs;

        4. Closing phase: final report and archiving
