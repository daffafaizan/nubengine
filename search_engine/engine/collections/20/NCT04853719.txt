      the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin compared with aspirin reduces the risk of major
      adverse limb events, but it is not known whether this combination can also improve symptoms
      in patients with intermittent claudication. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of the combination on intermittent claudication distance.

      Study design: Eighty-eight patients with intermittent claudication will be randomized to
      receive rivaroxaban 2,5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily or aspirin 100 mg once
      daily for 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in claudication distance from baseline
      to 24 hours as measured by 6 minutes walking test and treadmill test. The main safety outcome
      is the incidence of major bleeding according to ISTH criteria.

      Summary: The COMPASS CLAUDICATION trial will provide high-quality evidence regarding the
      effect of the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin on claudication distance in patients
      with peripheral arterial disease.
