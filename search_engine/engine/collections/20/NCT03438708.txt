      facilitation of partial nephrectomy where partial nephrectomy was not thought to be
      safe/possible in the setting of imperative indication for complex renal masses in renal cell
      cancer.

      Secondary objectives: To determine the safety, tumor diameter (per RECIST v1.1) volume
      change, surgical morbidity and renal functional outcomes following neoadjuvant axitinib for
      RCC.

      Anatomical/morphometric:

        1. tumor diameter/volume change,

        2. conversion of hilar to non-hilar tumors,

        3. reduction in RENAL morphometric score.

      Functional Considerations:

        1. Requirement of acute dialysis

        2. Change in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

        3. Whether or not GFR crosses 30 threshold, or decline by GFR to >50% of baseline.

      Safety indices:

        1. Incidence of Clavien >3 complications

        2. Avoidance of need for multiple blood transfusions
