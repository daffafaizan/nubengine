      been cited as a potential buffer between inequitable neighborhood conditions and poor health.
      However, there is limited evidence how to increase exposure to green space and how much
      exposure is needed to produce benefit. Place-based and person-based interventions offer
      contrasting approaches to improving the impact of the environment on health. The environment
      influences people as they traverse the spaces between home, work, and recreation, in ways
      that can be healthy or harmful. Place-based approaches directly change the environment to
      encourage healthy behaviors, and potentially have broad population impact. Alternatively,
      person-based approaches directly target individuals' behavior and may be more feasible. To
      our knowledge, no studies combine both approaches into a single intervention, which may be
      more effective over either alone.

      The broad objectives of this proposal are to pilot test two intervention strategies to
      increase green space use- place-based and person-based, as well as evaluate the dose-response
      relationship between green space use and health. Our place-based intervention, Nature Nooks,
      builds on our prior greening treatment by adding new features to encourage use - a path and
      benches to invite people into the space and instillation on large corner lots to maximize
      visibility. The investigators develop our person-based intervention, Nature Coach, as a novel
      adoption of an analogous, established patient navigator concept in healthcare.
