           adults.

        -  CT is the current standard imaging test for the diagnosis of appendicitis.

        -  In recent years, the awareness of carcinogenic risk associated with CT radiation has
           increased.

        -  According to a recent single-institutional randomized controlled trial, LD CT (employing
           a quarter of standard radiation dose) was found to be noninferior to SD CT with respect
           to NARs in adolescents and young adults with suspected appendicitis.

        -  However, LD CT is not yet widely accepted.

        -  To establish LD CT as the first-line imaging test, a multi-institutional study is needed
           to confirm the generalizability of the prior single-institutional study.
