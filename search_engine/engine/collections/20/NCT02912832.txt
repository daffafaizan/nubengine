      detection of pulmonary TB in comparison to LED microscopy and culture as a gold standard. The
      study will involve recruitment of 300 TB suspects per site with a high workload and
      experienced technicians. Participants will be recruited under the FIND TB Reference Materials
      project and leftover sputum samples used for the assessment of the TBDx.
