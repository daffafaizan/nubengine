      enough motile spermatozoa can be inseminated. In these cases IUI are usually performed (4 to
      6 attempts) and IVF only in case of IUI failure. Indeed if the pregnancy rate per attempt is
      higher with IVF, IUI can be performed more frequently (6 times a year vs. 2 for IVF) so that
      the pregnancy rates after one year of treatment are close. When female age is over 37 years,
      some ART centers prefer to perform directly IVF, since chances of pregnancy decreases with
      time. However there is no argument in the literature in favor as well as in disfavor for such
      an attitude. Indeed the delivery rates after one year treatment with IUI or IVF are not known
      in this population. Therefore we propose a multicentric randomized controlled trial comparing
      IUI and IVF in women over 37 with unexplained infertility. Couples will be randomly allocated
      to IUI or IVF during one year. In case of absence of pregnancy after 4 IUI, couples will be
      treated by IVF. ART attempts will be performed according to usual procedures of each center.
      The follow-up will be ended either at the end of the first year of treatment if no pregnancy
      is obtained or at the time of delivery if a pregnancy is obtained. All data of attempts
      (demographics data, type and doses of treatment, adverse effects, outcome, number and health
      state of newborns....) will be recorded.
