      to as post-traumatic headaches (PTH). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent in the
      Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) population and consequently
      there has been a rise in PTH in the clinical setting at VA hospitals. Botulinum toxin type A
      (BoNT-A) has been shown to be effective in treating chronic migraine and chronic daily
      headache. It is therefore reasonable to predict that BoNT-A may also be effective in treating
      PTH. This study proposes that PTH and its associated symptoms may respond positively to
      BoNT-A treatment due to its similar pathophysiology and clinical resemblance to other
      headache disorders including tension type headache, typical migraine with or without aura,
      and chronic daily headache.

      Study Design: Veterans with mild, moderate or severe brain injury with a headache developing
      within 7 days after head trauma and persisting greater than 3 months were recruited from the
      Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. The study is a prospective,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.
