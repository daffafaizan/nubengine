    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of preoperative short-course chemoradiotherapy
      (CXRT) in patients with potentially resectable gastric adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the rate of pathologic complete response (pathCR) in patients treated with
      preoperative short-course CXRT.

      II. To assess the rate of perioperative complications after gastrectomy in patients treated
      with preoperative short-course CXRT.

      III. To assess overall survival from the date of diagnosis in subjects treated with short
      course CXRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive CXRT consisting of radiation therapy 5 days a week (Monday through Friday)
      for 2 weeks (10 treatments) and standard of care chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or fluorouracil intravenously (IV) continuous Monday to Friday
      of each radiation week. About 2 weeks later, patients receive standard of care chemotherapy
      for up to 2 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo standard of care surgery 3-8 weeks post-chemotherapy completion.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
