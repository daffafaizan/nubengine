      recommendations at the time of writing this protocol. After this cessation of OPV2,
      stockpiles of mOPV2 will be maintained for potential use if necessary in response to a future
      outbreak. However, there is a risk of cVDPV2 from Sabin 2 in settings of low population
      immunity. Research is ongoing to develop vaccines that are genetically more stable than the
      currently available Sabin 2-containing OPVs. To generate data on immunogenicity, safety, and
      genetic stability on the Sabin 2 vaccine (mOPV2) and as a future comparator for new polio
      vaccine research after the global switch from tOPV to bOPV, this study with mOPV2 is
      performed to evaluate safety, immunogenicity (humoral and intestinal) and genetic stability
      endpoints of mOPV2 in children aged 1 to 5 years for better understanding of the stockpile
      use of this vaccine, and any potential new polio vaccine with a type 2 component in the
      future.
