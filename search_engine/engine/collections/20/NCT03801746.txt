      probenecid, and rifampin as perpetrators with vadadustat (victim) in healthy male and female
      subjects. Part 1 consists of 2 arms (cyclosporine and probenecid) and Part 2 consists of 1
      arm (rifampin). Twenty (20) unique subjects will be enrolled into each study arm. The PK and
      safety/tolerability data from Part 1 Arm 1 (cyclosporine) will determine if Part 2 (rifampin)
      will proceed. Subjects will be on study for up to 72 days, including a 28-day screening
      period, 6-10 day clinic period, and a 30-day follow-up period post last dose. Blood and/or
      urine samples for PK analysis will be collected at pre-defined timepoints throughout the
      study.
