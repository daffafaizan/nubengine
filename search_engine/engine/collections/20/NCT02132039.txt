      compare the efficacy of a home-based structured exercise programme (12-step sitting Tai Chi)
      for both carers and care recipients with a standard non-exercise social contact control in
      the treatment of depression among caregivers of persons with dementia. The study hypotheses
      include:

        1. The structured home-based exercise programme will reduce caregiver depression. (Primary
           outcome)

        2. The home-based exercise will improve caregivers' cognitive performance, quality of life
           and balance ability at the end of the study. (Secondary outcome)

        3. The home-based exercise will improve the cognitive performance, quality of life and
           balance ability of persons with dementia at the end of the study. (Secondary outcome)

        4. We also hypothesise that BDNF gene modulates mood changes in response to exercise
           intervention. (Secondary outcome)
