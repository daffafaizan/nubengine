      anesthesia practice, with a definitive superiority as compared to general anesthesia, since,
      by their use, serious complications involving the airway can be avoided.Spinal anesthesia has
      become the favorable technique for both elective and emergency cesarean section due to a
      quick and predictable onset of action, however, it can be frequently complicated by
      hypotension, with incidence exceeding 80% occasionally.

      The aim of the current randomized controlled double-blinded trial was to compare the effect
      of a fixed-rate norepinephrine infusion versus a fixed-rate phenylephrine infusion versus
      placebo in parturients subjected to elective cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural
      anesthesia. All parturients will also receive colloid co-hydration.
