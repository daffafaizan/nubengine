    
      This is an open-label, dose escalation trial, and all subjects will receive oral AV-412
      administered three times weekly or once weekly for 4 weeks (1 cycle) to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of AV-412. Treatment duration will be a minimum of 2 consecutive dosing cycles
      (8 weeks), if tolerated.

        -  Upon completion of the 2 cycles, subjects with documented stable disease or an objective
           response may continue to receive therapy at the same dose and schedule previously
           utilized, as long as tolerability is acceptable, for up to 1 year. Treatment beyond 1
           year from the time of enrollment will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis between the
           sponsor and investigator.

        -  Subjects experiencing unacceptable toxicities or with documented disease progression
           will be discontinued from further participation in the study Accrual to next cohort will
           occur only after acceptable tolerance has been demonstrated throughout Cycle 1, and only
           after consultation with medical monitor.
