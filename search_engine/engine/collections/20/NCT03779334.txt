      efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in infants aged from
      birth to 6 weeks who have been genetically diagnosed with SMA but are not yet presenting with
      symptoms. There will be a screening, treatment, open-label extension (OLE) and a follow-up.
      All participants will receive risdiplam orally once daily for 2 years followed by an OLE
      phase of at least 3 years and a follow-up, for a total treatment duration of at least 5 years
      for each participant enrolled.
