      particularly in a young population. Current invasive treatment strategies are varied and
      include endovascular procedures, neurosurgery, and radiotherapy. All of these treatments are
      administered on the assumption that they can be achieved at acceptably minor complication
      rates, decrease the risk of subsequent hemorrhage, and lead to better long-term outcomes.

      Recent data from the literature comparing initial presentation and outcome for patients with
      ruptured and unruptured BAVMs have raised the possibility that such elective invasive
      treatment for unruptured BAVMs may yield worse outcomes than managing patients
      symptomatically with therapy. Unfortunately, no controlled clinical trials have yet been
      undertaken for management of unruptured BAVMs to address these concerns. Therefore, the goal
      of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if the long-term outcomes of patients who
      receive medical management for symptoms (e.g., headache, seizures) associated with an
      unruptured BAVM are superior to those who receive medical management and invasive therapy to
      eradicate the BAVM.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either symptomatic medical management alone
      or such management with invasive therapies (any combination of surgery, endovascular
      embolization, or radiotherapy). Functional assessment will be carried out at the time of
      randomization, pre-intervention and 48-hour post-intervention, and for all participants at 1
      month, and at 6 month intervals throughout the follow up period which will be a minimum of 5
      years.
