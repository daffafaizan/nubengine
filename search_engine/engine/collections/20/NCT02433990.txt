      made survival to adulthood an expectation. Today there are more than 1 million adult
      survivors of congenital heart disease, but increasing age brings additional concerns for this
      patient population. Although the literature remains scarce, existing evidence suggests that
      inactivity, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and acquired cardiovascular disease may be at least as
      prevalent in patients with congenital heart disease, if not more so, than in an age-matched
      general population. Acquired cardiovascular disease is likely to impact substantially on
      long-term survival and quality of life in these patients with palliated and already fragile
      hearts. This research study is to determine the risk factors for acquired heart disease, in
      adults with congenital heart disease. This knowledge is important to develop and target ways
      to prevent or delay the onset of acquired heart disease in adults with congenital heart
      disease.
