      with RCVS (see inclusion criteria) will be enrolled. Neuroimaging (CT, Magnetic Resonance
      (MR), or 4 vessel angiogram) will be obtained along with a baseline transcranial doppler
      ultrasound (TCD). They will subsequently be randomized to receive nimodipine (every 4 hours)
      or extended release verapamil (twice daily). Mean cerebral blood flow velocities will be
      followed for reduction or normalization on daily TCD and medication dosing adjusted
      appropriately. Patients will be followed 90 days post-discharge at which time they will
      undergo repeat neuroimaging to confirm resolution of vascular abnormalities and repeat
      evaluation. To determine effectiveness, the investigators will evaluate both short-term
      (surrogate) in-hospital outcomes and long-term outcomes. Reduction of TCD velocities and
      headache severity will serve as our short-term surrogate outcomes; however, need for
      additional medications, blood pressure, new/recurrent stroke/Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH)
      will also be evaluated along with modified Rankin score (mRS) on discharge, length of stay,
      and discharge disposition. At 90 days, the investigators will also assess headache control
      along with mRS.. Adverse events and their relation to the treatment arms will be assessed,
      and adherence to the medications will be evaluated.
