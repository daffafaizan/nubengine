      significant health disparities, including disproportionate burden of diabetes and untreated
      mental illness. The research team's preliminary research has identified diabetes and
      depression as the highest priority needs in the study community of Washington Heights-Inwood
      (WAHI), which is an urban, low-income neighborhood in New York City with 71% Hispanic
      residents, predominantly immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Many high-quality health
      information resources already exist on the internet but they are not reaching many segments
      of the population, including parts of the WAHI community. The novel concept the investigators
      propose here is an information resource localized to a community.
