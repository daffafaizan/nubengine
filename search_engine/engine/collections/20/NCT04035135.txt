      mg/kg of ANX005, a dose shown to be safe and well-tolerated as monotherapy and that provides
      a meaningful level of exposure to be tested in combination with IVIg. Dosing of IVIg will be
      administered as is the current standard of care (0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days) and ANX005 will be
      administered concurrently, beginning on Day 1 or 2 of the treatment period. Subjects will be
      followed for 6 months after treatment for observation and evaluation.
