    
      1. Assessment of Efficacy

             1. Knee MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging):

                  -  Assessment of cartilage volume, thickness in target knee

                  -  GAG(glycosaminoglycan) concentration of target knee

                  -  Assessment of Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) of target
                     knee

             2. Knee radiography:

                  -  Assessment of changes in minimal medial JSW(Joint Space Width) of target knee.

             3. Knee pain(VAS)

                  -  Assessment changes of pain in target knee.

             4. K-WOMAC(Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index for Korean)

                  -  Assessment score change for pain(5 questions), stiffness(2 questions) and
                     physical function(17 questions).

                  -  The questionnaire is self-administered by the patients.

             5. Used frequency of rescue medicine.

             6. Biochemical cartilage and bone markers

                  -  Blood and urine sample will be collected all through the morning after a night
                     fasting period since 10 pm the previous day to avoid the variations.

        2. Assessment of Safety

             1. Adverse event

             2. Laboratory assessment

             3. Vital sign

             4. 12-lead ECG

             5. Physical examination

        3. Enrollment: 76
