    
      Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA) is a rare autosomal recessive chorioretinal
      degeneration characterized by myopia, cataract, varying degrees of night blindness, and
      progressive constriction of visual fields associated with chorioretinal atrophy resulting in
      blindness. The objectives of this protocol are threefold:

        1. Document the natural history of gyrate atrophy.

        2. Relate the clinical course to the gene defect to explore the genetic heterogeneity
           inherent in this disease.

        3. Assess the clinical course and laboratory findings of the effects of an
           arginine-deficient diet. The study population is patients with elevated plasma ornithine
           and absence of ornithine-delta-aminotransferase activity. This is a natural history
           study, with a nested intervention study, non-randomized, with the outcome parameters
           being psychophysical, electrophysiological and ophthalmoscopic examination.
