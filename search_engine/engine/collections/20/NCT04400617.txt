        1. To test the feasibility of using polysomnography to identify the severity of sleep
           disorders in assisted living residents.

           The implementation of objective measures of sleep in assisted living residents is
           practical and provides accurate information on sleep architecture parameters.

        2. To investigate the association between functional capacity and physical activity and
           sleep quality in assisted living residents using functional tests and actigraphy,
           respectively.

           There is a positive association between functional capacity and sleep quality and
           physical activity will improve sleep quality in the efficiency and duration domains.

        3. To investigate the association between sleep quality, measured through actigraphy, and
           cognitive performance, specifically in the memory domain, in assisted living residents.

           There is a positive association between sleep quality, especially sleep efficiency, and
           cognitive performance.

        4. To compare the sleep quality (measured with polysomnography, actigraphy, and
           questionnaire) in assisted living residents with older individuals of the same age and
           cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA score > 26) who live
           independently.

      Sleep quality will be lower in assisted living residents in comparison with older individuals
      who live independently and the use of various methods to assess sleep quality will provide a
      better estimation of the differences in sleep quality between these populations.
