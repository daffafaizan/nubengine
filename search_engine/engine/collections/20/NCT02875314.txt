    
      Due to the inferior response and event-free survival data of Regimens D and D2 on "Head Start
      III" for all children with supratentorial embryonal tumors, in comparison with the published
      data from "Head Start II" with Regimen A2 for metastatic patients, all such patients will
      receive the "Head Start II" Induction Regimen A2, on "Head Start 4", for either three or five
      cycles, depending upon whether or not they achieve complete remission by the end of Induction
      cycle #3. They will then undergo randomization to either single cycle or three tandem cycles
      of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy with AuHPCR.

      Because of the unsatisfactory event-free survival for young children with
      non-desmoplastic/extensive nodular medulloblastoma (predominantly non-Shh and non-Wnt
      medulloblastoma subgroups) on Regimens D and D2 of "Head Start III", all these patients will
      receive the "Head Start II" Induction Regimen A2 on ""Head Start 4"", for either three or
      five cycles, depending upon whether or not they achieve complete remission by the end of
      Induction cycle #3. They will then undergo randomization to either single cycle or three
      tandem cycles of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy with AuHPCR.

      Because of the excellent event-free and overall survival for young children with good risk
      medullo-blastoma (Shh or Wnt subgroups) treated with up-front "Head Start" chemotherapy
      strategies, such patients will undergo risk-tailored reduction of duration of Induction
      therapy from five cycles to three cycles of the "Head Start II" Induction Regimen A2 on "Head
      Start 4" for patients achieving a complete response to 3 cycles, followed, provided they are
      also without evidence of residual tumor following recovery from Induction cycle #3. They will
      NOT then undergo randomization, but will follow with a single cycle of Consolidation
      marrow-ablative chemotherapy as in "Head Start" studies.
