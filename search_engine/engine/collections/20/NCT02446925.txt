      primary and secondary hepatic malignancies that relies on tumor hypervascularity for
      concentration of radioactive microspheres. The SurefireÂ® Infusion System (SIS) (Westminster,
      CO) was developed to reduce non-target embolization which can result in morbid complications,
      especially those involving radioembolic or drug eluting microspheres. Prior to its
      introduction, radioembolization and other trans-arterial therapies have been performed with
      standard end-hole catheters. In addition to providing protection against non-target
      embolization, studies have demonstrated improved penetration of embolic material (tantalum
      microspheres and Tc-99M labeled MAA) with the use of the SIS when compared to conventional
      end-hole catheters. To date, no study has demonstrated improved distribution and penetration
      of yttrium-90 glass microspheres with the use of the Surefire catheter versus a standard
      end-hole catheter. Y-90 distribution can be evaluated with the use of immediate post-delivery
      PET/CT imaging as it creates its own pair production and can be imaged in the immediate post
      delivery period. PET/CT will demonstrate distribution and the dose to tumors can be
      calculated. The investigators propose a pilot study comparing yttrium-90 tumor distribution
      and concentration in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the use of the SIS
      versus a standard end-hole catheter.
