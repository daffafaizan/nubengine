      safe and effective in the treatment of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The
      second purpose of this study is to see how children's bodies react to the combination of
      study drug and methotrexate. Patients will receive either infliximab at 3 mg/kg for 44 weeks
      or, placebo for 14 weeks followed by infliximab at 6 mg/kg for 30 weeks. Patients who
      complete the original study are eligible for additional treatment with 3 to 6 mg/kg of
      infliximab every 8 weeks for up to three years. Safety evaluations will be performed at
      specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs
      (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse
      events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive either infliximab at
      3 mg/kg for 44 weeks or, placebo for 14 weeks followed by infliximab at 6 mg/kg for 30 weeks.
      Patients who complete the original study are eligible for additional treatment with 3 to 6
