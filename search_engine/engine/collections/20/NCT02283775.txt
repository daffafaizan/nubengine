      up to 21 days. The treatment period may continue until disease progression, unacceptable
      adverse reaction, or other reason for discontinuation. After study treatment discontinuation
      an end of treatment (EOT) visit will be done at approximately 30 days after last study
      treatment component administration to assess safety. If the last ADA sample is positive or
      inconclusive, additional ADA will be sampled 3 months later. No further ADA will be sampled,
      even if this 3-month sample is positive. Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other
      than progression of disease will be followed every month until progression or initiation of
      subsequent therapy, for a maximum of one year, whichever comes first.
