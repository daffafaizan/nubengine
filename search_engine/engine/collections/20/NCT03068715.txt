      treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for 40
      min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      effective in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of
      the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session, 5 days per week, for 4-8
      weeks). Recently, researchers have pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce
      treatment times with some preliminary successes. This study aims to further modify the
      parameters to create a more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in
      neuroimaging biomarkers.
