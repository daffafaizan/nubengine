    
      Randomised clinical trial comparing 2 parallel arms of educational intervention with the
      hypothesis of the superiority of a 2-year maintenance of a structured, theoretically-based,
      educational follow-up. All subjects of both arms will beneficiate from an initial structured
      educational program (< 3-months). Subjects, educators, and investigators will be unaware of
      the group allocation during this initial round. Then the intervention arm will undergo a 2
      years self management educational follow-up program. Randomisation will be stratified on 2
      factors : centres (5 strata) and anti diabetic treatment (2 strata: insulin-treated or not).
      All group sessions (3-10 subjects, 2 hr-long, one assessment group session and 6 facultative
      additional specific sessions for each round [initial in both arms or follow-up in the
      intervention arm], as needed and planned during the first) will be held at the community
      level, as closer as possible to the subjects' residence. Educators are specifically trained
      and the educational sessions are structured and coordinated in the framing and organisational
      supervision of the health management network "ReuCARE" in Reunion island. Subjects of both
      arms will continue quarterly to attend at the outpatient clinic of the centre. This trial is
      associated to a qualitative ethno-sociological study on a sample of 30-40 subjects, with
      in-depth interviews and ethnographic observation of group sessions, with the specific aim of
      describing the learning processes, coping, health and functional literacy, social and
      contextual issues.
