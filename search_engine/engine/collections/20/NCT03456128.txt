      decline. CAPABLE uses a novel inter-professional team involving an occupational therapist,
      nurse, and handyman to improve ADLs in older adults post-hospitalization.

      In a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) demonstration project, CAPABLE
      demonstrated a 45% reduction of ADL difficulties in older adults from baseline to five
      months.The significance of this improvement could make the difference between aging at home
      independently and relocating to institutional care. While these results are encouraging,
      CAPABLE needs evaluation in real world health delivery contexts with more ethnic
      diversity.The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of CAPABLE in older adults
      in an active community health care program.

      Interventions: CAPABLE Intervention: Participants in the treatment group will receive up to
      10 in-home sessions (≤6 visits with an occupational therapist and ≤4 visits from a nurse)-and
      up to $1500 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment
      participant will receive each intervention component (education, assessment, and
      identification of functional goals, specific strategies tailored to goals and based on
      protocols). Usual Care Group: Participants in the usual care group will not receive visit
      from study clinicians and will continue to receive their usual VNSNY CHOICE benefits and
      healthcare. After baseline, all study participants will be reassessed at 20 weeks and
      possibly a third interview at 52 weeks. Assessments will be completed by a research assistant
      masked to treatment condition.
