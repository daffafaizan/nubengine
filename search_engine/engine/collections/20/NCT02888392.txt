    
      The study is a randomised, single-blinded, cross-over design. Both target study populations
      (those with functional constipation, and the matched healthy control group) will complete the
      16-week trial. Each study group will be randomly selected to either begin the first
      intervention period on the kiwifruit treatment or the psyllium treatment, and following the
      washout period will then receive the opposite treatment. Researchers and analysts will be
      blind as to as to the order of treatment individuals will receive. A dedicated treatment
      administrator will be assigned to provide the treatments to participants and liaise with them
      during the intervention phases.

      All participants will be free living and required to maintain their normal dietary and
      lifestyle habits for the duration of the trial.

      The primary outcome measure will be quantification of CSBM (complete spontaneous bowel
      movement). Secondary outcome measures will include additional stool frequency measures and
      other questionnaires.
