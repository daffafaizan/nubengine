      important target for dietary interventions. Studies on human microbiota are mainly based on
      the analysis of fecal samples. The microbiota in the small intestine is at least equally
      relevant for health as in the large intestine, but the regional composition differs largely.
      Small intestinal sampling requires invasive procedures. Recently, an electronic medical
      device, the IntelliCap速 system, was developed for the site-specific delivery of drugs in the
      gastrointestinal tract and patient monitoring. This capsule has been adapted to be used to
      aspirate liquid from its environment. The IntelliCap速 system may offer a minimally-invasive
      tool for sampling of small intestinal fluid in humans for microbiota analysis.

      Objective: To evaluate the IntelliCap速 system as a tool to study changes in small intestinal
      microbiota composition in humans in vivo and its safety and tolerability.

      Study design: A randomized cross-over controlled feeding trial in humans will be performed in
      10 healthy male volunteers (age 18-30 yr). Two diets are used: a three-day high-protein
      versus a high-carbohydrate diet, each preceded by a washout diet. These diets target
      microbiota with fundamentally different fermentation requirements. The IntelliCap速 capsule is
      administered after both intervention periods to collect a fluid sample from the distal small
      bowel. In parallel, fecal samples are collected. Microbiota composition is analyzed by
      sequencing using Illumina technology followed by dedicated bioinformatic analysis. Blood
      samples will be collected and stored to measure metabolic parameters and markers of satiety
      that can potentially be correlated to the microbiota data.
