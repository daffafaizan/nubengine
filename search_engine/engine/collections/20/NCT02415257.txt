      surgery, even if no vestibular function can be found in pre-surgical assessment. According to
      retrospective data about 33% of patients scheduled for surgery do not have any measurable
      vestibular function. Even the occurrence of spontaneous nystagmus has been recorded in
      patients with no or very little function prior to surgery (Parietti-Winkler et al. 2008
      JNNP). This indicates that despite new methods of measuring vestibular function, remaining
      vestibular function can be present and patients might benefit from pre-treatment of
      gentamicin (Tjernstr√∂m et al. 2009 JNNP)
