      population, and results in a variety of visual deficits. Recent work suggests that there is
      limited neural plasticity in the visual system of adults with amblyopia. This study is aimed
      at understanding and increasing this plasticity. In this study, the investigators aim to
      understand how the amblyopic brain learns and how this process is affected by a drug called
      donepezil, which is sometimes given as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The investigators
      hope that this study will help to identify the chemical components that help the brain to
      learn, as well as the mechanism of amblyopia. The investigators also plan to test the normal
      periphery, as control.

      In this study, donepezil will be administered while amblyopic subjects (or normally sighted
      subjects tested in the periphery) are trained on a low-contrast single-letter recognition
      task, or an uncrowd task (recognizing a letter closely embedded within two other letters).
      Subjects will be asked to identify the target letter (the low-contrast single letter, or the
      letter embedded within other letters). Training will take place for 10 consecutive days. Pre-
      and post-tests will be conducted immediately before and after training, and will consist of
      the measurements of visual acuity, crowding extent and contrast threshold for recognizing
      single letters.
