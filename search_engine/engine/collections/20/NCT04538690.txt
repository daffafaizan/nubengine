      intervention, were referred to the physiotherapy clinic for treatment; will be evaluated in
      terms of balance, pain and joint range of motion and then included in the exercise program.
      20 adults without pain will be evaluated as the control group and the results will be
      compared within and between groups. Exercises will be applied 3 days a week for 4 weeks,
      45-55 minutes by a physiotherapist within the framework of shoulder rehabilitation. In
      addition, balance exercises will not be given. Balance measurements will be made by the
