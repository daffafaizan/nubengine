      being used in several institutions for help managing diabetes in these patients. In this
      study, this model was adjusted by introducing literary texts and using narrative skills. A
      randomized trial was designed to determine whether group dynamic strategies using narrative
      and reading produce the same positive outcomes as a conventional group approach. A total of
      49 patients with type 2 Diabetes were randomized to two different Group Care dynamics, one
      "control group", with a classical structured educational approach and another, "intervention
      group", with close reading and creative writing. Evaluation included anthropometrical
      measures, A1c and questionnaires for psychological evaluation.
