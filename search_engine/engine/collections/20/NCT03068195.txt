      patients older than 50 years.They are usually asymptomatic and benign, asymptomatic and
      discovered incidentally. However, over time, these simple cysts can enlarge, become
      symptomatic and develop complications, requiring intervention.They can be managed by a
      variety of surgical and percutaneous methods, including percutaneous aspiration (with or
      without injection of a sclerosing agent), endoscopic marsupialization or excision, open
      surgery and laparoscopic cyst excision.Percutaneous aspiration and sclerotherapy have been
      described as safe and effective methods of managing symptomatic simple renal cysts without
      the cost and morbidity associated with conventional surgery and laparoscopy.However,
      laparoscopic decortications and simple aspiration is associated with a high recurrence rate
      because the cyst wall epithelium is responsible for active liquid production.

      Purpose:To determine whether microwave ablation is more effective in the treatment of simple
      renal cysts than conventional laparoscopic decortication.

      Method:
