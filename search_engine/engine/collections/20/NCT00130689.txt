      Primary - To assess the response rate of single-agent cetuximab in patients with advanced
      esophageal or gastric cancer who have failed 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimens given in the
      metastatic setting.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  To assess the safety of cetuximab.

      Exploratory

      - To assess whether levels of EGFR expression and/or EGFR mutation status correlates with
      response and toxicity of cetuximab.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This study used a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of cetuximab based on overall
      response (OR) defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The null and
      alternative OR rate were 5% and 15%. If one or more patients enrolled in the stage one cohort
      (n=20 patients) achieved PR or better than accrual would proceed to stage two (n=16
      patients). There was 36% probability of stopping the trial at stage one if the true OR rate
      was 5%. The probability that the regimen would be considered promising if the true OR rate
      was 5% was 10% and 80% if the true OR rate was 15%.
