      breast cancer surgery, which commonly results from the inability of the surgeon to rapidly
      and reliably evaluate resection margin status intra-operatively.

      This study therefore seeks to address this problem by aiming to develop a method for near
      real time, in vivo intra-operative tissue classification that may be used by breast surgeons
      as an intelligent knife (or "iKnife") to better guide oncological margin control. The method
      known as Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) technology uses mass
      spectrometric and chemometric analysis of the tissue specific ionic content of the surgical
      diathermy smoke plume for the rapid identification of dissected breast tissues.

      There are no additional treatment interventions as part of REI-EXCISE. The main study
      procedures are breast conserving surgery using the REIMS iKnife for mass spectral analysis of
      each surgical margin and correlation between the results of a software recognition algorithm
      that capitalised on the spectral data (i.e. iKnife margin = positive / negative) with
      conventional histopathological assessment. False positive iKnife data will be further
      interrogated with digital droplet polymerase chain reaction and imprint cytology assessment.
