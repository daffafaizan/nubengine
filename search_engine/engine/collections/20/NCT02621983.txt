      approximately 87,000 Veterans. Previous studies have reported improved short-term memory with
      AE, but there in a lack of information on cognitive effects of AE in SCZ. The investigators
      want to determine if twelve weeks of AE training improves cognitive function in Veterans with
      SCZ.
