      multi-center study to evaluate the safety tolerability and efficacy of OT-101 (Atropine
      0.01%) Ophthalmic Solution in treating the progression of myopia in pediatric subjects that
      will enroll approximately 678 pediatric subjects with myopia in total. Subjects will be
      stratified by age and refractive error.

      This study consists of 11 visits over the course of approximately 4 years and can be broken
      down in the 3 stages: Screening (Days -14 to -1), Stage 1 (Day 1 to Year 3), and Stage 2
      (Year 3 to Year 4). In stage 1, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to OT-101
      Ophthalmic Solution: Placebo. Subjects will be dosed with one drop of study treatment per eye
      once daily at bedtime for 3 years. In stage 2, subjects will be re-randomization 1:1 will
      occur at Visit 9 (Month 36). At re-randomization, subjects who had been assigned to OT-101
      Ophthalmic Solution will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on OT-101 Ophthalmic
      Solution or switch to placebo. Subjects who had been assigned to placebo will continue with
      placebo.
