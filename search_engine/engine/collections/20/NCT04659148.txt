    
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer
      (CRC). Despite improved targeted screening and timely prophylactic resection, up to 15% of
      all IBD-related mortality can be attributed to CRC.

      Previous reports suggest that IBD patients present with CRC at an earlier age and with more
      advanced disease than those with sporadic CRC. The literature is limited, however, with
      respect to colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC), which has unique considerations such as
      surgical approach and the use of neoadjuvant therapy. Although total proctocolectomy is
      generally the procedure of choice for those with CARC, recent reports reported acceptable
      oncological outcomes after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and ileorectal anastomosis
      (IRA).

      The impact of the type of surgical procedure on the oncologic outcome in patients with CARC
      is not well defined.

      The aim of this study is to investigate short-term surgical outcomes (postoperative
      complications at 30 days after surgery) and long-term oncological outcomes (disease-free
      survival) of CARC patients undergoing different surgical approaches.
