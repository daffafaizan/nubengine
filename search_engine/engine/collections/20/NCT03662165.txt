      testing kits increases the number of truck drivers and female sex workers who come to the
      North Star Alliance clinics for HIV testing (Demand creation). The investigators first
      selected a sample of eligible truck drivers from the electronic health record system of the
      North Star Alliance who, based on those records, were not accessing HIV testing regularly,
      sent passive text messages alerting them that The North Star Alliance was planning to use
      their deidentified electronic health data for program evaluation purposes and gave them the
      option to opt out of being included. The investigators then randomized those who did not
      opt-out on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of two messages, (1) the standard (SOC) message sent
      to all clients who have not tested for HIV in the past 3 months reminding them of the
      availability of HIV testing at North Star clinics sent one time (2) the SOC message sent
      three times, a week apart (Enhanced SOC) or (2) a text message announcing the availability of
      HIV self-testing kits fat all North Star clinics in Kenya sent three times, a week apart. The
      investigators compared the number of truck drivers from our sample who came to the clinic for
      HIV testing over a 2 month period following the first text message in the three study arms.
      After completing the study among truck drivers, we followed the same procedures for a sample
      of female sex workers registered in the electronic health record system who were not
      accessing HIV testing regularly.
