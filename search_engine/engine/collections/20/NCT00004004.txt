        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral procarbazine when administered to patients
           with recurrent glioma receiving or not receiving anticonvulsants metabolized by the P450
           hepatic enzyme complex.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of oral procarbazine, including any effects of hepatic
           enzyme inducing drugs, in these patients.

        -  Assess the response rate to procarbazine in these patients.

        -  Evaluate this regimen in terms of overall survival and duration of disease free survival
           in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Phase I of this study is a dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according
      to concurrent use of anticonvulsant drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (yes vs no drugs or
      modest-induction drugs).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral procarbazine once daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats
           every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of oral procarbazine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

        -  Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, patients receive procarbazine as in Phase I.

      Patients are followed every 2 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
