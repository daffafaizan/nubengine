      undergoing hemodialysis suggests the requirement for a medication that can be added to the
      standard therapy with in order to help maturation and suitability of newly created AVF.
      Numerous research papers published over the past 25 years indicate that heparin might have a
      positive impact on main factors involved in the early failure of native AVF to mature.

      In total 56 eligible patients will be enrolled after giving informed consent. Screening will
      take place in the preceding 6 weeks before scheduled AVF creation. Only patients receiving a
      Brescia - Cimino (radio - cephalic) fistula or a distal ulnar artery to basilica vein,
      proximal radial artery to transposed basilica vein, brachial artery to transposed basilica
      vein and brachial artery to cephalic vein will later be randomized. Patients will be randomly
      assigned in equal proportions (each group 28 patients) to receive either topically applied
      heparin (Heparin 2,400 IU /ml Cutaneous Spray) or placebo using a computer-generated
      randomization. Participants and members of the study team will be blinded to treatment
      assignment. Patients will be instructed how to use and administer study medication for the
      consecutive 24 weeks following randomization.

      Assessment of the primary endpoint (suitability of newly constructed primary arteriovenous
      fistulas) is done at 7th week (± 1 week) after first study drug administration. The
      suitability and unassisted patency and local safety and tolerability by physician and patient
      of the AVF will also be determined at 12 weeks (± 1 week) and 24 weeks (± 1 week) after first
      study drug administration. Administration of study medication will be stopped at week 24
      after randomization.
