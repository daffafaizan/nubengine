      hypersensitivity and a chronic inflammation of the airway. It is known that LCPUVAs could
      reduce the production of inflammatory mediators. In addition, LCPUVAs can improve pulmonary
      function, with a concurrent reduction in bronchodilator use in patients with asthma. Subjects
      suffering from episodic asthma and house dust mite (HDM) allergy usually have a normal lung
      function testing at rest and show a decrease in lung function when they are exposed to HDM.
      Bronchial allergen provocation models are well established in asthma research and allow the
      evaluation of anti-allergic and anti-asthmatic agents in relatively small sample sizes. In a
      previous study the investigators could show, that LCPUVAs could reduce exhaled NO after
      repeated BAP with HDM.

      In this study the investigators will investigate the protective effect of LCPUVAs in a
      repeated BAP model. Clinical symptoms (nasal and bronchial), exhaled NO, decrease in lung
      function the early asthmatic reaction (EAR), the late asthmatic reaction (LAR) and blood
      parameters (Triglyceride and Cholesterin and mircro RNAs) will be measured before and after
      LCPUVA supplementation.
