      of Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19-associated hospitalization. In addition, VE of
      1 dose and at least one dose will be determined. Other outcomes in addition to
      hospitalization to be assessed include COVID-19-associated ED admissions, ICU admissions,
      outpatient visits and death. To assess VE, we propose a large retrospective database study
      using two parallel study designs: a test-negative case-control design and a retrospective
      cohort design. The test-negative design (TND) will assess VE against COVID-19 hospitalization
      (primary endpoint) and emergency department (ED) admission. The retrospective cohort analysis
      will assess VE against COVID-19 hospitalization (primary), ICU admission, death, ED
      admission, and outpatient disease (with no subsequent hospitalization within 14 days). We
      will further conduct exploratory analyses of VE estimates by strain type.
