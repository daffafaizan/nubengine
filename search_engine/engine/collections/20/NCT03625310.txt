      sodium fluoride. It has been reported in studies that Duraphat is effective in
      remineralization.

      Clinpro ™ White Varnish, another topical varnish in this study,was reported to be effective
      for caries prevention in pre-school children.

      One of the varnishes we evaluate in the study, Embrace™ Varnish, contains 5% sodium fluoride
      with xylitol-coated calcium and phosphate. According to the manufacturer, the xylitol coating
      prevents the calcium and phosphate salts from reacting until they come in contact with
      saliva. Saliva dissolves the xylitol and releases the calcium and phosphate ions, which react
      with the fluoride ions in saliva to form protective fluorapatite on the teeth19 MI Varnish,
      in the fourth group containing 5% sodium fluoride with casein phosphopeptide amorphous
      calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) had a high release of calcium and fluoride ions.
