    
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic, progressive, and often fatal disease
      characterized by severe constriction of the blood vessels in the lungs. Over the past decade,
      significant strides have been made in the medical management and understanding of PAH.
      However, much remains to be learned about the clinical course of both idiopathic PAH and
      associated PAH, including clinical presentation, pace of progression, key parameters to
      monitor, impact of treatment, and prognosticators of outcome. As the unique body of knowledge
      generated by the REVEAL Registry grows, it is hoped that new understandings, insights, and
      treatments will emerge that will improve the lives of patients with PAH.

      The REVEAL Registry will provide investigators with descriptive data regarding the clinical
      course and treatment outcomes in patients with WHO Group I PAH. Data derived from the study
      may offer important tools for assessing current management practices of treating
      investigators, as well as changes over time. Additionally, the relationship of patient- and
      disease-specific parameters to patient outcomes may be able to be assessed through analysis
      of data from this study.

      The specific objectives of the REVEAL Registryâ„¢ are to:

        -  Characterize the demographics and clinical course of PAH patients

        -  Evaluate and compare patient outcomes

        -  Identify clinical predictors of short-term and long-term clinical outcomes

        -  Assess the relationship between PAH medications and patient outcomes

        -  Report temporal trends in treatments and outcomes for newly diagnosed patients

        -  Collect timely and relevant data for the evolving research needs of the PAH community
