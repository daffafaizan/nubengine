      syndrome (IBS)patients and to identify potential microbial factors related to diet efficacy.
      Pain symptoms, stooling characteristics, breath hydrogen, stool microbiome will be collected
      and/or documented in IBS patients at baseline and during one week of an low FODMAPs
      intervention.
