      used. Its function is to prevent alveolar collapse and to maintain oxygenation. However, it
      has recently been found that PEEP may contribute to diaphragm weakness, which is an important
      problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study showed that mechanical ventilation with
      PEEP resulted in a caudal displacement of the diaphragm, since PEEP increases the
      end-expiratory volume. Furthermore, their study in rats showed that this displacement
      resulted in a reduced fiber length and sarcomere length on the short term.

      After rats were ventilated with PEEP for 18 hours, it was found that adaptation of the
      diaphragm occurred; i.e. the number of sarcomeres were decreased. It is hypothesized that
      this adaptation may also occur in mechanically ventilated patients. This could lead to
      problems in weaning a patient off the ventilator, as PEEP is abruptly removed during a
      spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). This leads to a reduction in end-expiratory volume which
      would mean that the newly-adapted diaphragm fibers are being stretched. These stretched
      muscle fibers are not working at their optimal length of the force-length relation, thereby
      contributing to diaphragm weakness.
