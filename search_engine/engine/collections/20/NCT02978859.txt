      than 50 subtypes exist. Approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with sarcoma annually in
      the United States.

      Liposarcoma is one of the more common types of soft tissue sarcoma. The primary treatment for
      liposarcoma is surgery when possible. When liposarcoma is not amenable to surgery, various
      systemic treatments, including chemotherapy, are used. However, the effectiveness of existing
      treatments for liposarcoma is limited.

      Sitravatinib is an oral, targeted drug which inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptor
      tyrosine kinases are proteins on the surface of the liposarcoma cell which play a role in
      cancer growth. In laboratory work, Sitravatinib effectively suppressed the growth of
      liposarcoma models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Sitravatinib in patients with liposarcoma which cannot be removed by surgery.
