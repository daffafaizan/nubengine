    
      In this phase II trial, patients with a recurrence / progression of glioblastoma (first or
      second progression) either not being eligible for tumour resection or having macroscopic
      residual tumour after resection of the recurrence can be included (tumor size must 1-4 cm in
      T1-weighted MRI). They must be candidates for a re-irradiation and will then be randomized in
      a 1:2 ratio to re-irradiation alone or re-irradiation + 400mg APG101 as a weekly intravenous
      infusion.

      Radiotherapy (RT) is considered standard of care and not a study procedure. As prior
      therapies, a first radiotherapy (maximal dose of 60 Gy; at least 8 months since the end of
      preirradiation), a prior surgery (at least for histology) and at least one
      Temozolomide-containing chemotherapy are mandatory; patients with prior treatment with
      bevacizumab, iodine seeds and/or brachytherapy are not eligible. The patients' steroid dose
      must be stable or decreasing upon inclusion.

      The number of patients to be included in this study is up to 83 (depending on the statistical
      2-step SIMON design).

      Primary objective: 6 months rate of progression free survival (PFS6). Subjects can
      participate in this study as long as a clinical benefit is considered by the treating
      physician.

      MRI tumour imaging will be carried out every 6 weeks.
