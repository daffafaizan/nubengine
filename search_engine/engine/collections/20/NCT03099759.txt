      investigators knowledge there are currently no protocols for Vitamin D supplementation in the
      Orthopedic community for patients recovering from fractures. The investigators study will
      monitor 3 different groups of volunteers taking various Vitamin D regimens and how
      participants blood serum 25(OH)D3 levels are effected throughout a 3 month period. The 3
      groups will include: 1) 100,000 units D2 once on day one, 2) 100,000 units D2 taken once a
      week x 12 weeks, 3) 50,000 units D2 x 10 days, then 2000 units D3 taken daily for the
      remainder of the study period. There will be 15-20 volunteers randomly assigned to each of
      the 3 groups. The investigators will have each volunteer from the 3 groups have blood drawn a
      total of 4 times throughout the course of this study: prior to the study, week 2, week 6, and
      week 12. From these results the investigators will determine which protocol most effectively
      raises and maintains vitamin D levels in the volunteers through this 3 month period. The
      investigators will also use this data to determine which protocol is not only most cost
      efficient but also easiest to follow by individuals. The investigators are hoping that this
      study may help finally develop a universal orthopedic protocol for vitamin D supplementation
      in patients recovering from fractures.
