      Ventilation in patients in the postoperative cardiac surgery results in greater ventilation,
      greater aeration, and improved gas exchange when compared to the oxygen therapy group.

      The use of noninvasive ventilation in the postoperative cardiac surgery has been widely used
      in clinical practice, but the evidence of the benefits of this technique in this population
      in relation to some criteria have not yet been elucidated in the scientific literature, such
      as the effect of NIV in ventilation and pulmonary ventilation, and how long does this effect
      last.
