    
      The purpose of this research study is for the study's sponsor, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
      ("Enzon"), to learn more about its drug pegaspargase. Pegaspargase is the drug's scientific
      or generic name. Because it is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it
      also has a brand name - ONCASPAR®. It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of a type of
      leukemia (cancer of white blood cells). However, pegaspargase is not approved by the FDA for
      treatment of the cancer in this study. This study will research the side effects of
      pegaspargase when it is used with another FDA-approved cancer treatment (chemotherapy) drug
      called gemcitabine HCl; its brand name is GEMZAR®. It is approved for the treatment of
      patients with cancer of the pancreas and of patients with breast cancer. However, gemcitabine
      is not approved by the FDA for treatment of any other types of cancer.

      In addition, the combination of pegaspargase and gemcitabine for solid tumors and lymphoma in
      this study is investigational. This type of study treatment is called a "combination
      treatment" or a "combination study." The information (research data) from this study will be
      used by Enzon to plan other "combination" research studies with pegaspargase plus gemcitabine
      for the treatment of certain cancers.
