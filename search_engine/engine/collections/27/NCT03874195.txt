      Both arms will receive a tablet computer (iPad or Galaxy Tab based on preference) connected
      to the internet with disposable headphones to use for up to 30 minutes. Subjects in the
      Active Control arm will receive a list of three nationally-recognized websites to receive
      information on palliative care - www.palliativedoctors.org; getpalliativecare.org; and
      Wikipedia "Palliative Care" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care). Intervention Arm
      subjects will receive access to PCforMe.

      PCforMe is an online, web-based, interactive tool to prepare patients for a clinical
      palliative care encounter. PCforMe is accessible through www.pcforme.org. It does not collect
      any patient information, including identifiers (e.g. name, email address, disease, location)
      or health information (e.g. disease, symptom severity or location). The system uses a
      combination of animated videos and user-answered questions to generate a "Palliative Care
      Passport", which is a summary of information entered into the system. Research staff will
      print out the Passport for patients and hand it to them prior to the appointment.

      Queries for users include standard-of-care questions asked by palliative care clinicians,
      including areas that patients want to more learn about. No diagnoses, medication advice, or
      clinical assessments are made or given.
