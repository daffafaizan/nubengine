    
      Primary Phase I Objectives

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of rivoceranib in
           combination with paclitaxel.

      Primary Phase II Objectives

        -  To determine clinical activity of the combination of rivoceranib and paclitaxel

      Secondary Phase I Objectives

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivoceranib and paclitaxel when given in
           combination.

        -  To assess the efficacy of rivoceranib in combination with paclitaxel.

      Secondary Phase II Objectives

        -  To assess the efficacy of rivoceranib in combination with paclitaxel.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of rivoceranib in combination with paclitaxel.

        -  To assess the PK of rivoceranib and paclitaxel when given in combination.

      Exploratory Phase I/II Objectives

        -  To evaluate tumor expression of proteins related to paclitaxel resistance at prior to
           first-line chemotherapy and at prior to this study.

        -  To evaluate the correlation between response to treatment and tumor expression of
           proteins related to paclitaxel resistance.
