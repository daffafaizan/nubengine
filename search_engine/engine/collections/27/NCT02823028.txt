      biochemically verify abstinence out to 6-months follow-up and will test the personalized
      benefit for women of a women-only versus co-ed Tweet2Quit group. In a 3-arm design, the
      investigators will compare: 1) usual care, 2) Tweet2Quit-coed, and 3) Tweet2Quit-Women only.

      Each Tweet2Quit group will include buddy pairs based on similarity in demographics. Also
      automated pattern detection will identify dips in tweeting and trigger automated alerts and
      engagement strategies.

      The primary aims tests Hypothesis 1: Relative to usual care (n=240), Tweet2Quit-coed groups
      (n=480) will achieve significantly greater bioconfirmed sustained abstinence out to 6-months
      follow-up for each gender, and Hypothesis 2: Women in Tweet2Quit will achieve significantly
      greater bioconfirmed 6-months abstinence in woman-only groups (n=240) vs. coed groups (n=240
      women).

      Our secondary aims are to test the same hypotheses based on 3-month (end of treatment)
      sustained abstinence and 7-day point prevalence at 1, 3, and 6 months with biochemical
      verification at 3 and 6 months. Exploratory aims will study the Tweet2Quit groups' social
      network structures with a focus on the identification of buddy pairs and social brokers and
      test if these relationships are stronger for women in women-only groups versus women in coed
      groups of Tweet2Quit.

      *Prior to the start of the RCT, the investigators will run one coed pilot group (N=20). Total
      size of the study (including the pilot group) will be N=980.
