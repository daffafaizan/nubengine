      extra-pleural intercostal local anesthesia for the treatment of post thoracotomy pain in
      adult patients. Study patients will be randomized between the thoracic epidural and
      continuous extrapleural catheter groups[Figure 1]. Because thoracic epidural anesthesia is
      the gold standard but continuous extrapleural intercostal local anesthesia is potentially
      easier and less prone to complications, the study will be structured as an "equivalence
      study". The null hypothesis (Ho) is that continuous intercostal nerve blockade is worse than
      epidural for post-thoracotomy pain management. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is
      then that continuous intercostal nerve blockade is equal to or better than epidural for
      post-thoracotomy pain management.
