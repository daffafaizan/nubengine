      postpartum-onset depressions. The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful
      screening of patients and healthy volunteers for participation in research protocols that
      examine the role of gonadal steroids in postpartum-onset depressions (PPD) and for the
      collection of natural history data. Women in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which
      may include: a psychiatric interview; a diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical
      history; a physical exam; blood and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request for medical
      records. The data collected may also be linked with data from other PPD protocols (e.g., DNA,
      psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc.) for the purposes of better understanding the
      diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of women with PPD. Upon conclusion of the
      screening process, subjects will either be offered participation in a research protocol and
      will sign the appropriate informed consent, or will be considered not appropriate for
      participation in research and will be referred back into the community. The second purpose of
      this protocol is to permit the identification of pregnant women who are at risk for
      developing postpartum depression (PPD), and who are followed longitudinally through the
      postpartum in an effort to confirm the association of depression onset with change in
      reproductive endocrine function. This protocol, then, serves as a screening and evaluation
      protocol to recruit subjects who are characterized with standard measures in this protocol
      and then offered participation in related studies.
