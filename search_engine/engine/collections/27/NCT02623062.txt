      clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe and frequent GERD symptoms. After signing
      a written informed consent, patients will undergo a screening period of up to 7 days.

      randomised to receive either Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets (20ml four
      times daily) or matching placebo sachets (20ml four times daily),for a 7- day treatment
      period. At the beginning and end of the treatment period, patients will be required to
      complete the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ).

      In addition, at the end of the 7 (-1 day to +2 days) day treatment period, patients will be
      required to complete the Overall Treatment Evaluation.
