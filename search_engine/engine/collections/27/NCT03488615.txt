    
      From the database of URQUAL software available at the Emergencies of Angers Hospital and the
      "list of diagnostics for clinical research", inclusion (over a period arbitrarily defined
      from October 1, 2015 to November 1, 2015) of patients aged 75 and over with a diagnosis of
      fall or a related reason when they are admitted to the Emergencies Room.

      During the initial consultation in the Emergency Department, documentary analysis with all
      the signs of seriousness of the falls stated in the report, as defined by HAS 2009:

        -  consequences of the fall (moderate to severe physical trauma, inability to rise from the
           ground and its consequences, post-fall syndrome)

        -  pathologies responsible for the fall

        -  repetitive nature of the fall (recent increase in the frequency of falls, association of
           more than 3 risk factors for falls, gait disorders)

        -  situations at risk of severe falls (proven osteoporosis, use of anticoagulant drugs,
           social and family isolation) Search for an anterior passage of the patient in the
           geriatric pathway.

      Collection of the patient's care pathway following this passage to the ER:

        -  request for consultation or specialized geriatric care

        -  return home / hospitalization / Subacute care and rehabilitation

      Data collected one year after the emergency department visit, based on the information
      available in the URQUAL and CROSSWAY databases accessible at Angers Hospital, are:

        -  search for passage in the geriatric pathway following the emergency consultation
           (external geriatric consultation, intervention of the mobile geriatric team,
           hospitalization in Geriatrics)

        -  readmission to the Emergency Department of Angers University Hospital for fall

        -  death Telephone call to the general practitioner one year after the initial admission,
           in order to search for a recurrence of fall.

      This call-back makes it possible to collect data from patients readmitted for a fall in
      another center (clinic, hospital, etc.) or who have fallen again at home without admission to
      an emergency service with the aim of limiting the information and monitoring biases.
