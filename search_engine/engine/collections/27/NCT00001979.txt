      limited to, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis,
      and nephritis associated with other systemic or connective tissue disorders, will be
      evaluated at the Clinical Center. Patients who have immunologically-mediated diseases with
      potential for kidney disease will be evaluated as well. Studies will include characterization
      of the clinical and laboratory features of these disorders, studies of natural history and
      complications, evaluation of responses to standard treatment, and determination of the
      patients' eligibility to enter other experimental diagnostic or therapeutic protocols.
      Patients may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological research
      studies.
