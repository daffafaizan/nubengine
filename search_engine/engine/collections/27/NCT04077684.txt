      randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the four arms (placebo or IL-2 at 0.2 MIU,
      0.5 MIU or 1 MIU) in the study. IL-2 (0.2 MIU, 0.5 MIU or 1 MIU) or placebo was administered
      subcutaneously every other day for the first 12 weeks , and then was adjusted to once a week
      for the second 12 weeks. Follow-up visits occurred on weeks 4, 8,12,16,20 and 24. The end
      points were safety and clinical and immunologic response.
