      treatment that is considered by the American Academy of Neurology to be the first-line
      intervention for tics. Immediately prior to each CBIT session, participants will undergo TMS
      targeting the SMA. The specific type of TMS procedure will be randomly assigned between
      subjects and be either: 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS), continuous theta burst stimulation
      (cTBS), or sham stimulation.
