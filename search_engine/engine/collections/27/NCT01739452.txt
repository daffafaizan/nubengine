      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and occurrence of anemia that began treatment with
      erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) / support transfusional before December 31, 2011. In
      all cases, data obtained will be prior to the date of the start of the study to ensure its
      retrospective nature, thus reflecting the routine use of erythropoietic agents in clinical
      and non-interference in the doctor's clinical practice.
