      treatment protocol HLH2004, which was developed for pediatric HLH patients. The HLH2004
      protocol, which is a potent and successful treatment for HLH, has shown some limitations in
      the treatment of adult HLH. First, the dose of etoposide is somewhat high for adult patients
      to tolerate. Second, the high incidence of opportunistic infection such as fungal, bacterial,
      and viral has threatened the patients. Third, more aggressive and intensive approach to adopt
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation will be needed earlier in adult patients. Based
      on these rationales, we developed a modified protocol based on HLH2004 to pit the treatment
      of adult HLH patients.
