      will be randomized to three groups: Fascia Iliaca Block (FIB), Femoral Block (FB) with
      stimulating catheter or FB without stimulating catheter. A catheter will be placed according
      to each technique, before the surgery. A bolus of local anesthetic will be given pre-surgery
      and at the end of the operation, in all groups. A continuous infusion will be started for 48
      hours. All patients receive a standard analgesia cocktail and rescue medication.

      Pain and level of activity, as well as side effects, will be evaluated.
