      patients benefit from this surgery. Traditionally the frequently used surgical approach is
      parapatellar approach. However, recently the subvastus and midvastus approach has gained a
      world-wide population. These two methods had less damage to the quadriceps tendon and
      theoretically should have better post-operative muscle power recovery, less lateral
      retinaculum release because of better patellar tracking. The only differences between these
      two approaches are that the midvastus approach will split the vastus medialis muscle and
      denervation may occur. In this study we will use HSS or KSS functional score and Cybex
      dynamometer to evaluate the functional recovery, and use Merchant's view radiography to
      evaluate the result of patellar tracking. The follow-up period will not be limited and we
      will use mixed-model statistic's random effect to gain the natural history of muscle power
      recovery, which will become the base of other study. We can also compare the difference of
      results between PS type and CR type and different surgical approach. The natural history of
      the knee score will also be obtained.
