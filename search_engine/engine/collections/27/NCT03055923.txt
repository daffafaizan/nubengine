      oxidative stress from the airway epithelium. Levels have been shown to be raised in asthma
      and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) both in stable and exacerbating states.

      Previously it has been difficult to measure this volatile compound away from a laboratory
      based setting. However a new device has been developed to measure Hydrogen peroxide levels in
      exhaled breath by the patients side.

      This Pilot study will test this new device in a clinical setting. It will assess whether the
      device can monitor levels consistently and reliably and whether it can distinguish disease
      from healthy individuals.
