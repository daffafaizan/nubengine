      ophthalmologists in preparation for a pilot study in patients eye diseases.

      The easy accessibility of the tear fluid and the lack of invasiveness of the study make it
      promising and sensible to determine the concentration of various tear film metabolites.
      Because attention has so far focused primarily on the quantitative and qualitative analysis
      of tear film proteins, many metabolites have so far only been shown to be contained in tears.

      However, before the suitability of the measured values as a predictive parameter of the
      ocular surface for pathologies can be examined and assessed, it is necessary to determine the
      scattering variables in a sample of healthy volunteers. Thus, reference areas are to be
      defined for later investigations in order to enable reliable case number planning thereafter.

      Repeated determinations at different times and on different days make it possible in
      particular to detect a time-dependent relationship in view of the dynamic variability of the
      tear film. The functional significance of certain metabolites can not yet be assessed in the
      establishment phase. However, the data may provide important information for the
      interpretation of a later, planned feasibility study with diseased patients or the influence
      of applied eye drops.
