      diastolic relaxation and contractility with electrophysiological abnormalities.

      .Cirrhotic patients with cardiac abnormality have higher mortality rates compared to patients
      without cardiac affection.

      The suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms of cardiac affection in cirrhotic patients are;
      alterations in the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway and, myocardial fibrosis formation,
      sympathetic nervous system activation and changes in ion channels.

      .As a component of cardiac involvement in cirrhotic patients fragmented QRS complex and
      prolongation of the corrected QT interval has been documented in most of the cases with liver
      cirrhosis (LC) and its prevalence increases with the severity of the disease.

      .Fragmented QRS (fQRS) is a convenient marker of myocardial scar evaluated by 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. fQRS is defined as additional spikes within the QRS
      complex. In patients with CAD, fQRS was associated with myocardial scar detected by single
      photon emission tomography and was a predictor of cardiac events. fQRS was also a predictor
      of mortality and arrhythmic events in patients with reduced left ventricular function. The
      usefulness of fQRS for detecting myocardial scar and for identifying high-risk patients has
      been expanded to various cardiac diseases, such as cardiac cirrhosis, arrhythmogenic right
      ventricular cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome. fQRS can be caused by zigzag conduction
      around the scarred myocardium, resulting in multiple spikes within the QRS complex .
