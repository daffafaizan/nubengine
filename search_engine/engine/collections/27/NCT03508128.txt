      which can cause oversensing, pacing inhibition and device reset. There is limited data on
      surgical EMI in Medtronic Micra leadless pacemakers. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      for surgical EMI in subjects with leadless pacemakers.

      Subjects with Micra leadless pacemakers requiring surgery will have procedure records
      reviewed for type of procedure and use of electrosurgery. Next postoperative device
      interrogation will be reviewed for evidence of EMI. EMI will be evaluated by review of
      sensing integrity counter, heart rate histograms and device reset.
