      well as the effects of therapy on lymphocyte replication should lead to a better
      understanding of the mechanisms behind the immunodeficiency induced by HIV. To examine this
      directly, up to 100 HIV-infected patients will receive up to 5 days of continuous infusions
      with [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose, a nonradioactive, stable isotope of glucose that is safe to
      administer. The deuterium is incorporated into DNA via metabolism of glucose to ribose and
      incorporation into nucleotides. The rate of incorporation can be measured in subpopulations
      of cells to determine the rate of replication of those cells. Fifty HIV-uninfected persons
      will also be enrolled in the protocol to allow a determination of lymphocyte kinetics in
      individuals with normally functioning immune systems or immune systems that may have been
      affected by other diseases. All participants in this study will be reimbursed for the
      inconvenience and discomfort associated with study participation.
