      which is harmful to human tissue and organs. Reactive oxygen species are released abruptly
      during some surgical procedures, and they are the major causes of ischemia-reperfusion
      injuries.Isoprostanes have been demonstrated to be a reliable biomarker for the evaluation of
      oxidative stress in vivo. Therefore, accurately monitoring and avoiding the occurrence of
      oxidative stress during surgery is an important clinical issue.

      Isoprostanes are a series of prostaglandin-like compounds produced by non-enzymatic
      peroxidation of arachidonic acid.The aims of this study are(1)to develop an accurate liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the detection of urinary isoprostane
      isomers in samples collected from patients receiving a cardiac surgery (2)to investigate the
      change of isoprostanes after cardiopulmonary bypass (3)to investigate the effect of different
      anesthetics on isoprostanes during surgery.
