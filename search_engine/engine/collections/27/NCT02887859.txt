      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HAV in patients with PAD undergoing femoro-popliteal
      bypass surgery. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the HAV in these patients and to determine the patency of the Humacyte HAV at
      12 months post-implantation. The secondary objectives of this study are to further assess
      safety in terms of PRA response, and to determine the rates of HAV interventions required to
      keep the HAV patent. There is no formal hypothesis testing planned; the study involves only a
      single, open-label treatment group.
