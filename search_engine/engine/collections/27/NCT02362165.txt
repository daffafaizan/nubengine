      myeloma patients. Bortezomib,doxorubicin,and dexamethasone (PAD) is commonly used in clinical
      practice. Recent studies have found that cyclophosphamide, bortezomib,and dexamethasone
      (CyBorD)seems better than PAD in efficacy. However, there is no randomized phase 3 trial
      comparing these two regimens in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.
      Moreover, studies have found that subcutaneous injection of bortezomib can decrease the
      incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy induced by bortezomib, however, most center use
      twice-weekly administration of bortezomib. According to our experience, once-weekly
      subcutaneous injection of bortezomib can further decrease the incidence rate of peripheral
      neuropathy without compromising the efficacy. Thus, in this phase 3 trial, the investigators
      will compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens using once-weekly subcutaneous
      injection of bortezomib.
