      STUDY DESIGN

      Description of the Study Phase II study to evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of
      pulsed paclitaxel with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy, and adjuvant gemcitabine and
      carboplatin in stage IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

      Rationale for Study Design The proposed doses of gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
      thoracic radiation therapy have been previously studied and deemed safe. The design of this
      study is not to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of these agents, but to study the
      toxicity and overall survival from this combination.
