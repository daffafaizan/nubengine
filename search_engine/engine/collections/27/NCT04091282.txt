      intrapartum antibiotics on the composition of the breast milk, and the infant oral and
      intestinal microbiota and antibiotic exposure in the first year of life on the composition of
      the infant intestinal microbiota (including the development and persistence of antibiotic
      resistance) and (ii) the association of this disruption with adverse health outcomes. (iii)
      The investigators will also determine the association between the maternal intestinal
      microbiota, the breast milk microbiota and the infant oral and intestinal microbiota.
