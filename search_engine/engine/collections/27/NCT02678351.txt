        1. To evaluate 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI for detection of regional nodal and distant metastases
           in patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo
           prostatectomy with lymph node dissection.

        2. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI
           for the detection of regional nodal metastases compared to pathology at radical
           prostatectomy on a per patient basis using nodal regional correlation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI
      for the detection of extra pelvic nodal metastases; visceral metastases; and osseous
      metastases compared to biopsy and imaging follow up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously (IV). Patients then undergo PET/MRI after 45 minutes
      of administration of radiopharmaceutical injection.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours.
