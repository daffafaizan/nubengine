      Clornadinone and Ethinyl estradiol of 2 tablet formulations with Clormadinone 2 mg and
      Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of
      rate and extent of absorption:

        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andrómaco S.A.

        -  Reference Product: Evafem 20 [Trademark], product of Grünenthal. The 90% confidence
           intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus Reference Product)
           for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma concentration-time curve
           from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours (AUC0-72), and maximum
           plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Clormadinone and Ethinyl estradiol will be
           determined.

      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic
      (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 16 blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours after the
      administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to provide additional
      blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose. The washout period between the two study periods
      will be at least 14 days. The samples from each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods
      of high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to
      quantify total Clormadinone and Ethinyl estradiol in plasma.

      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by
      collecting adverse events.
