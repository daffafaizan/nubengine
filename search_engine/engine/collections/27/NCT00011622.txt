      have the monitor placed and then taken off three days later. A blood sample will be collected
      at each visit. Meals and snacks will be provided for each day of the study, specially
      packaged, to supply an equivalent amount of calories for each subject. These will meet the
      nutritional requirements for both the mother and the fetus. Women will do separate
      fingerstick blood sugar measurements using a capillary glucometer four times a day, to ensure
      the accuracy of the sensor's readings.
