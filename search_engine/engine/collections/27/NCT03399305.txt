      to identify all adult patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min who were treated with
      apixaban or warfarin, for at least 1 month, between 3/1/2013 and 3/1/2017. The investigators
      will then review electronic charts in Carecast and Epic to gather data about bleeding and
      thrombotic events.Primary outcome: clinically significant bleeding, per Control of
      Anticoagulation Subcommittee criteria: 1) fatal bleed; 2) symptomatic bleed at anatomically
      critical sites such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, or pericardial hemorrhage;
      3)symptomatic noncritical bleeds resulting in transfusion of 2 units or more of red blood
      cells or drop in hemoglobin of at least 2.0 g/dl.4 Secondary outcomes: venous
      thromboembolism, cerebrovascular accident, intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding related to HD
