    
      The phase 1 portion of this trial is a dose escalation study; the phase 2 portion is a
      single-stage, single arm prospective clinical trial. All patients will receive continuous
      doses of vemurafenib twice a day and BKM120 once a day.

      In the phase 1 portion of the study, there will be a 7 day lead-in period to allow for single
      dose pharmacokinetic analysis of BKM120 alone. Cycle 1 (28 days) is the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) period. During phase 1, vemurafenib and BKM120 doses will be escalated using a
      standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme with the goal of identifying the recommended phase 2
      dose.

      In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will receive continuous doses of vemurafenib
      and BKM120 starting on day 1 of the first cycle. In the phase 2 portion of the study,
      patients will receive vemurafenib and BKM120 at the recommended phase 2 dose.
