      by the pressure of brassiere straps, breast pain, and maceration and dermatoses in the
      inframammary region. From a psychological point of view, excessively large breasts can be
      troublesome focus of embarrassment for the teenager as well as the woman in her senior years.
      Unilateral hypertrophy with asymmetry heightens embarrassment. Thus, patients seek to reduce
      the size of their breasts.

      In the human female, variant receptors were detected in epithelial cells in normal breast
      tissue, benign breast lesions, breast carcinoma tissue, and breast cancer cell lines2-11. The
      cause of the difference in breast development status is still unclear. Abnormalities at the
      tissue receptor level may be important in the pathophysiology of macromastia. This study
      aimed to make clear the difference in variant receptor levels between breast hypertrophy
      patients and macromastia ones by examining the receptor levels in breast tissue. Then, we
      could explore the possible etiology of mammary hypertrophy and macromastia.
