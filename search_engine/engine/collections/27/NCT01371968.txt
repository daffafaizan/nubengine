      such as laryngospasm. Thus it is advisable to remove the LMA when the patient is breathing
      spontaneously and when the airway reflexes are still depressed. A number of techniques have
      been used to prevent this adverse emergence phenomenon, such as removing the tube while the
      patient is in deep plane of anaesthesia or administration of local anaesthetic and
      intravenous opioids

      The administration of intravenous opioids before emergence may be useful for preventing
      cough, agitation and hemodynamic response. Alfentanyl is proven to suppress cough and
      agitation during the endotracheal tube emergence. However, its use in suppressing cough in
      LMA patient has not been evaluated.
