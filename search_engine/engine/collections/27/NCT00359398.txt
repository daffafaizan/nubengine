      Patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy or requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB) often develop a coagulopathy at the end of surgery. We propose sequestering plasma and
      platelets from these patients prior to CPB and thus prior to the dilution and platelet damage
      that occurs with CPB. We hypothesise that if these plasma and platelets are stored properly
      during CPB, and administered at the end of the operation, they will reduce any coagulopathy
      and the associated bleeding.

      Study population:

      Patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy, mitral valve repair, double valve operations,
      aortic surgery, or combined valve and coronary artery surgery.

      Exclusion criteria will include those with anaemia, thrombocytopenia, unstable angina,
      anti-platelet therapy within the previous seven days, known or symptomatic cerebrovascular
      disease, known disorders of haemostasis, aprotinin sensitivity and pregnancy.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomised by a closed envelope technique to receive platelet/plasma
      sequestration or not. Patients randomised to undergo sequestration will have 14 mL/Kg blood
      taken. The blood will be separated into red cells and platelets/plasma. Anaemia would be
      prevented by returning the processed red blood cells to the patient. We will store platelets
      at 20-24Â°C/room temperature on a platelet rocker according to guidelines from the National
      Blood Service.

      Assessment of coagulation:

      Patients' coagulation status will be evaluated before and after surgery. Four methods will be
      employed to comprehensively assess the coagulation system: platelet counts and conventional
      clotting studies; heparin levels; thromboelastography; and platelet function analyser.
