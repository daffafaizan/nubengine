      not yet approved by the FDA. The FAS system will be used in this study to monitor glucose
      levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) performed in Dr.Orzeck practice. The FAS
      measures glucose levels in skin tissue of the forearm or the abdomen at a depth of less than
      1 mm by inserting a small needle-like device. During the 4-hour GTT, the needle-like FAS is
      left in the skin tissue. The FAS performance has indicated in prior experiments that it is
      more stable than competitive commercial glucose-sensing devices. Due to its unique design,
      its glucose response is more accurate, and less affected by certain drugs (such as pain
      medicine).
