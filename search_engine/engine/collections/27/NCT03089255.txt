    
      All patients admitted to the Emergency Departments for a nonsurgical isolated lower limb
      trauma necessitating rigid or semi-rigid immobilization, will be assessed for possible
      participation.

      After the physicians had obtained the no-opposition of the patient, they will fill a
      questionnaire. This questionnaire includes the treatment chosen by the physician, the type of
      trauma, the type of immobilization chosen, and the patient's thromboembolic risk factors in
      order to calculate the TIP and L-TRIP (cast) scores retrospectively.

      Phone follow-up will occur within 3 months to gather clinical event data (any signs of VTE,
      any bleeding events).
