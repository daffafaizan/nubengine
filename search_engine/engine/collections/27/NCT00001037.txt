      immunogenic in healthy adults. Since the MN strain of HIV-1 is representative of a larger
      proportion of HIV-1 isolates in the United States than is the IIIB strain, evaluation of a
      gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain is important.

      Volunteers are randomized to receive 200 mcg MN rgp160 or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6 or at
      months 0, 2, and 8. For each immunization schedule, ten volunteers receive vaccine and two
      volunteers receive placebo. Per amendment, volunteers receive a fourth immunization of 800 or
      200 mcg (or placebo) at 9 or 11 months after the third injection (i.e., at month 17) and are
      followed for 6 months afterward.
