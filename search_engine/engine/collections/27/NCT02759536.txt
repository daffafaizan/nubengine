    
      This is a single BNCT-facility, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I to II
      clinical trial to determine the value of IHNI in the performance of BNCT. Before patients are
      recruited in this study, they must have been confirmed as malignant melanoma by biopsy and
      pathological analysis. Then they will receive a boron bio-distribution test, only patients
      whose boron concentration in tumor tissue is >1.5 times that in the blood will be enrolled.
      Before patients being irradiated in IHNI, they will be infused Boronophenylalanine
      (BPA)-fructose solution intravenously at a dose of 350mg/kg over 90 minutes, and then blood
      will be withdrawn from the patient at different time points to measure boron concentration.
      The start point and duration of irradiation will be determined based on the boron
      concentration in blood and the boron bio-distribution curve.

      IHNI locates in Fangshan District, Beijing, China. The recruitment of patients, and their
      evaluation and medical care before and after BNCT will be done in the Third Xiangya Hospital,
      Changsha, China.

      All patients will be evaluated for response by biopsy and pathological analysis, Positron
      Emission Computed Tomography (PET-CT), Computed Tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI).
