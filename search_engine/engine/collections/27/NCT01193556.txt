    
      Tonsillectomy is performed in response to cases of repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis
      or adenoiditis, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, snoring, or peritonsillar
      abscess.

      The PEAK PlasmaBlade uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy and a highly-insulated handpiece
      design to enable precision cutting and coagulation at the point of application. The
      PlasmaBlade has received FDA clearance for use in plastic, general, orthopedic, and ear,
      nose, and throat (ENT) surgery, and has demonstrated a significantly reduced thermal injury
      profile in incised tissue compared to traditional electrosurgical devices. It is hypothesized
      that this benefit may improve the post-operative outcome of patients undergoing
      tonsillectomy.

      Two study sites were granted approval for this prospective randomized study. Potential
      subjects were screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study protocol and
      were required to provide informed consent for themselves (adults) or for their child prior to
      enrollment. Following enrollment, subjects were prospectively randomized to the SOC or
      PlasmaBlade (PB or PEAK) study groups and scheduled for tonsillectomy or tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy (TnA).
