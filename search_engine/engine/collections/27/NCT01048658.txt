      general anesthesia regimens for second trimester abortion procedures and assess anesthesia
      providers' use and beliefs regarding possible risks associated with newer inhalational agents
      such as sevoflurane in this setting. Participants' anesthesia will either be intravenous (IV)
      propofol, IV midazolam, IV fentanyl and nitrous oxide or this same regimen combined with
      sevoflurane during maintenance of anesthesia. Procedural outcomes, specifically those related
      to bleeding complications, including need to intervene for excess blood loss, will be
      recorded and analyzed to establish if such a relationship between use of sevoflurane and
      excess blood loss exists.
