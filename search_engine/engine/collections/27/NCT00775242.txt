      climacteric symptoms, however up to this date no formulation is completely satisfactory. Our
      company has developed a new technology for the preparation of controlled release bioerodible
      non-polymeric microspheres, these microspheres are capable of delivering doses of estradiol
      (E) and progesterone (P) at levels appropriate for the Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) in
      order to relieve the climacteric symptoms. Non clinical and clinical studies have been
      conducted aimed at assessing the pharmacokinetics of these microspheres, at several doses of
      progesterone and estradiol. Results show that sustained plasma profiles for both steroids
      within the therapeutic range for several days are attained. On this basis, a new efficacy and
      safety study is going to be conducted with the purpose of assessing and defining the most
      appropriate doses of estradiol and progesterone for the HRT of the climacteric symptoms.

      Three different doses of progesterone and estradiol (0.5 mg of E + 15 mg of P vs 1 mg of E +
      20 mg of P vs 1 mg of E + 30 mg of P) will be compared in terms of their efficacy and safety
      to treat the climacteric symptoms in healthy postmenopausal women.
