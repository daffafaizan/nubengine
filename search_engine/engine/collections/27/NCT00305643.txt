        -  Determine the efficacy of celecoxib in reducing the incidence and severity of hand/foot
           syndrome caused by capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer or colorectal
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to metastatic disease (breast vs colorectal), ECOG performance
      status (0 or 1 vs 2), prior chemotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

        -  Regimen A (concurrent radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5-6
           weeks and receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 days a week. Following completion of
           radiotherapy, patients may continue oral capecitabine as in regimen B.

        -  Regimen B (no radiotherapy): Patients receive oral capecitabine once daily on days 1-14.
           Courses repeat every 21 days.

      Patients are also randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-21. In both arms, treatment
           repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 342 patients will be accrued for this study.
