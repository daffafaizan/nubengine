    
      In this Phase 1b study, the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety profile of
      MK-2248 in HCV-infected participants will be evaluated as follows: Part I will assess
      sequentially ascending MK-2248 doses from 200 mg to ≤800 mg over 4 panels (A, B, C, and D).
      Part II will assess sequentially ascending MK-2248 doses from 200 mg to ≤800 mg over 4 panels
      (E, F, G, and H). Part III will assess sequentially ascending MK-2248 doses ranging up to
      ≤800 mg in 2 panels (I and J). The potential relationship between plasma MK-2248 levels and
      VL reduction will be determined.
