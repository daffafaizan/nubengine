      Primary

        -  Assess the response rate (complete response/remission, unconfirmed complete response,
           partial response/remission) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma
           treated with 3 courses of rituximab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and vinorelbine
           ditartrate.

      Secondary

        -  Assess progression-free survival, failure-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Characterize the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of adequate stem cell collection (â‰¥ 2 million CD34+ cells) in
           patients eligible for stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to eligibility for stem
      cell transplantation (SCT).

        -  Group 1 (eligible for SCT): Patients receive rituximab IV, vinorelbine ditartrate IV
           over 6-10 minutes, and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and
           pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 3
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
           complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) undergo SCT.

        -  Group 2 (ineligible for SCT): Patients receive rituximab, vinorelbine ditartrate,
           gemcitabine hydrochloride, and pegfilgrastim as in group 1. Patients with CR, PR, or
           stable disease after 3 courses continue to receive therapy in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for at least 2 years.
