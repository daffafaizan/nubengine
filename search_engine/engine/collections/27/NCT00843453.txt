      anemia, and had not been taking vitamin B12 supplements. At baseline, serum vitamin B12 and
      methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations of 34 subjects from the PPI group were compared with
      those of the non-PPI group. The PPI group (n=13) was treated with cyanocobalamin nasal spray
      for eight weeks, and post-treatment vitamin B12 and MMA concentrations were compared with
      baseline concentrations.
