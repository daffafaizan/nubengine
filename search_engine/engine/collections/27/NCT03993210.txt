      radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's organs and structures. This research is
      being done to test new MRI methods called Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) and Q-space
      Trajectory Imaging (QTI) in gynecological abnormalities. The purpose of this research study
      is to evaluate if these new MRI methods can give additional information in characterizing
      gynecological tumors compared with conventional MRI

      In this research study, the investigators are:

        -  Investigating the use of MR imaging in gynecological tumors on imaging quality and
           comparison of tumor or fibroid structures and normal anatomy

        -  Investigating whether new MRI methods could help in characterizing the tumor and give
           information about the expected outcome
