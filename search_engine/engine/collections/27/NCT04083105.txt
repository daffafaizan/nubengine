      for reducing the pain of intranasal midazolam when given for subjects already planned for
      moderate sedation for completion of dental procedures in the pediatric dental clinic.
      Moderate dental sedation is useful because it helps relieve anxiety and make the dental
      procedure less memorable and more comfortable for the patient. Sedation appointments
      typically go smoothly when the patient is calm rather than when the patient is upset. Giving
      midazolam through the nose can be painful and the dental provider risks upsetting a patient
      and causing the sedation appointment to fail. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test
      whether nitrous oxide administration is effective in reducing the pain from intranasal
      midazolam administration. The effectiveness will be measured by the primary outcome of heart
      rate pre- and post- midazolam administration for the two randomly assigned study arms. The
      first study arm will be given 30% nitrous/70% oxygen and the second study arm will be given
      70% nitrous/30% oxygen prior to the midazolam administration. The secondary outcome will
      compare subject, dental provider, and the parent/guardian answers to questions regarding the
      subject's experience pre- and post- midazolam administration. The investigators hypothesize
      lower changes in heart rate and less pain reported following midazolam administration in
      subjects given 70% nitrous oxide.
