      have blood drawn and urine collected for use in the validation and refinement of new methods
      for rapid high-throughput radiation biodosimetry. These blood and urine samples will be
      collected before, and at defined times after TBI. Blood sampling will occur in the same
      manner that it does during routine patient care during HSCT.
