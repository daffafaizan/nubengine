      patients: 16-25% of hospital admissions among United States end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
      patients are related to vascular access complications, and the associated cost is estimated
      to be over one billion dollars per year.

      The most frequent cause of AV access-graft failure is thrombosis that occurs as a result of
      stenosis at or near the venous anastomosis. Over 50% of existing vascular access-grafts in
      the US are 6 mm PTFE tubes and their thrombosis rate is much higher than that of native
      Arteriovenous Fistulas (AVF).

      Several studies have shown that early detection and repair of stenosis can prevent access
      thrombosis, reducing the morbidity and costs that follow thrombosis. The cost of duplex
      ultrasound for access monitoring is prohibitive. Blood flow, measured by indicator-dilution
      methods, seems to be a reliable indicator of impending access failure, but recent randomized
      controlled studies intended to examine this were equivocal.

      This study, funded by the NIH (2R44 DK067775), is to determine if a new instrument to monitor
      access blood-flow can reduce graft failure and associated costs. In a pilot study using the
      new Doppler ultrasound instrument for weekly monitoring, conducted by the Renal Research
      Institute and funded by the NIH, the method predicted impending graft failure with 80%
      sensitivity and a false-alarm rate of less than .5/year. It measures access blood flow in
      less than three minutes, and uses almost no consumables.

      This study is designed to test if monitoring with the new instrument improves health and
      reduces cost for hemodialysis patients with access-grafts.
