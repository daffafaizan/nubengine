      consume citrus fruits and foods potentially containing similar ingredients. Therefore it is
      necessary to ask volunteers to refrain from these foods by giving them dietary restrictions.
      Extensive literature research showed that some foods (such as grain legumes and brie cheese)
      may contain the same compound, but in much smaller amounts.

      Days 1-3 will be on open diet but with dietary restrictions (no alcohol, cheese, fruits,
      ethnic foods such as Chinese and Indian food, grain legumes such as beans, lentils, peas and
      peanuts, and all kinds of sprouts (such as cress or alfalfa)). On day 2 a glass of orange
      juice (200ml) will be consumed in addition to the open diet. Urine collection will continue
      and stop on day 4 at 10 am.

      During the study to minimise variation in biomarker excretion due to other beverages the
      participants beverage intake will be restricted to water and coffee.

      All urine samples will then be analysed using high resolution NMR spectroscopy and mass
      spectrometry. Mathematical data analyses as well as the visual examinations of the NMR
      spectra will also be carried out to validate the presence of citrus fruit biomarkers.
