      resistance mechanism to endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen. We plan to target the mTOR
      pathway with mTORC1/2 inhibitor TAK-228 to overcome tamoxifen resistance in early-stage
      ER-positive breast cancer. An open label phase II clinical trial will be conducted to
      determine the efficacy, toxicity, and safety of TAK-228 plus tamoxifen in patients with newly
      diagnosed ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. TAK-228 (30 mg weekly) plus tamoxifen (20
      mg daily) will be administered for 16 weeks. Patients will undergo tumor biopsy before
      starting the study treatment and after 6 weeks of study treatment. Blood samples for
      pharmacokinetics analysis will be obtained 1 hour before and after TAK-228 dosing on days 1
      and 15 of the study.
