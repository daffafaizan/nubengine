      clinically uncertain result. A clinically uncertain result is a result that has some level of
      objective uncertainty frequently viewed by clinicians in regard to a patient s diagnosis. A
      clinically uncertain result can be a result that is negative, with no reportable variants, or
      that includes one or more variants deemed uncertain with regard to the cause of a patient s
      illness. Clinically uncertain results present challenges to both providers and patients in
      the forms of disclosing and processing uncertain health information. This exploratory study
      aims to seek insight into the psychological and behavioral impact of receiving clinically
      uncertain results from exome sequencing. Semi-structured phone interviews will be conducted
      with approximately 30-40 adult patients with undiagnosed conditions who have received
      clinically uncertain result from exome sequencing. The interviews will focus on the
      experience of receiving the clinically uncertain result, with emphasis on appraisal of
      uncertainty, coping, and other affective and behavioral responses. Interviews will be
      transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Understanding how patients with undiagnosed
      conditions respond to clinically uncertain results from exome sequencing may inform providers
      practices around informed consent for exome sequencing and the disclosure of clinically
      uncertain results through a greater consideration of patient concerns and challenges with
      adaptation. This study may also identify implications for interventions to reduce negative
      effects of receiving uncertain genomic information.
