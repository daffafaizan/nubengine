      butylphthalide. Studies in the past several decades have demonstrated that it could alleviate
      the learning and memory deficits induced by cerebral ischemia in rats. The phase II study
      enrolled 281 patients showed greater effects than placebo on ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus.
      Butylphthalide soft capsule were uncommon and primarily consisted of mild gastrointestinal
      symptoms. In the present phase III study the investigators will re-assess the efficacy and
      the safety of Butylphthalide soft capsule for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular
      dementia in 700 subjects.
