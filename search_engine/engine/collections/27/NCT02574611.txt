      intestinal peristaltic activity, most likely as a result of down regulation of
      parasympathetic neural pathways. Furthermore, the investigators have effectively shown that
      measures involved in increase parasympathetic stimulation results in efficient bowel
      evacuation and improved bowel care. Such measures include the administration of neostigmine
      (NEO), which increases peristaltic contractions in the colon, resulting in predictable bowel
      evacuations. Given the cardiopulmonary side-effects of NEO, an ant-cholinergic known as
      Glycopyrrolate (GLY) is usually co-administered with NEO to reverse these side effects.
      However, the investigators knowledge regarding the effects of SCI on colonic motility is
      still primitive, mainly due to pervious technological disadvantages. New High Resolution
      Colonic Manometry systems (Medical Measurement Systems Dover, NH) simultaneously capture high
      amplitude pressure contractions (HAPCs) across the ascending, transverse, descending, and
      recto-sigmoid colon. Such capabilities allow for a much clearer display of pressure events
      compared to previous line tracing manometric systems and the direction of contractions are
      much easier to discern as well. To date, this technology has been an effective tool in
      diagnosing bowel disorders and complications, such as constipation in able-bodied individuals
      (AB). However, such studies have not been conducted in a SCI population. This technology also
      has the potential to capture the effects of NEO+GLY on improving colonic function.
