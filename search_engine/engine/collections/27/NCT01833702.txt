      their pain levels, as well as adherence to recording these levels daily. The study will track
      patients' assessment of their pain, actions taken, and outcomes related to pain management
      and provider involvement. This study will attempt to collect information about differences in
      the use of two traditional pain assessment modes (verbal scale and paper) versus the use of a
      pain assessment tool on a mobile device in the form of a smartphone, tablet, or iPad with an
      Android or iOS operating system. The study will seek to enroll 100 sickle cell or thalassemia
      patients who are age 12 or older who have access to a smartphone or tablet with Internet
      access daily. Patients enrolled in this study will be ask to use a mobile device such as a
      smartphone or a tablet with Android or iOS operating system to record daily pain level and
      related information once daily or more frequently for a period of forty-two days. A 1:1
      randomization assignment will be made to have patients receive automated "canned" provider
      feedback or not.
