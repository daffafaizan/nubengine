      Infections (SSI), with an outstanding variability of reported incidence, ranging from 3% up
      to 30% depending on the series. Although general risk factors for infection have been
      identified, there is still a need to identify specific risk factors for colorectal surgery
      patients, to try to reduce these numbers. The technique and materials used for wound closure
      have been considered as interesting variables for study.

      Main question of our study: is subcuticular (reabsorbable, continuous) suture better than
      skin staples for reducing wound SSIs in colorectal surgery? The study is sponsored by the
      Surgical Infection Society Europe, and was awarded the SIS-E Fellowship for young
      investigators (2013)
