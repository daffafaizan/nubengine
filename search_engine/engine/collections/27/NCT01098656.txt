        -  To determine if observation versus lenalidomide maintenance therapy after debulking with
           gemcitabine hydrochloride or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride with or
           without radiotherapy prolongs progression-free survival of patients with advanced stage
           IIIB or IV T-cell cutaneous lymphoma or mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome not previously
           treated with other intravenous chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution,
      response to debulking treatment (complete response vs partial response), and disease (mycosis
      fungoides [MF] vs erythrodermic MF/Sézary syndrome). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of prior debulking therapy, patients undergo
           observation for 560 days.

        -  Arm II: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of prior debulking therapy, patients
           receive oral lenalidomide once a day on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
           20 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks
      thereafter.
