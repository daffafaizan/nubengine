      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the toxic effects of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients. IV. Determine the potential of either a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic-mediated
      drug interaction in patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the objective response
      rate and stabilization rate in patients treated with this regimen at the MTD. VI. Determine
      the acute and long-term toxic effects of this regimen at the MTD in these patients. VII.
      Determine the time to tumor progression and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 50
      vs 50 and over), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1-2), and prior therapy with carmustine or
      lomustine (yes vs no). Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral
      temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease may receive 6 additional courses of temozolomide. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of carboplatin and temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study. A
      total of 16-58 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.
