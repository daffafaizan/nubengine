      mechanism by which potent anti-inflammatory treatment may reduce cardiovascular risk in
      Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) patients.

      Fifty patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) will be randomized to receive either Golimumab
      or Placebo for 12 months. Patients randomized to Placebo with worsening disease activity
      (failure to achieve Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS20)) at week
      24 will be permitted to escape to open-label Golimumab. Clinical assessment, intima-media
      thickness, vascular stiffness and endothelial progenitor cells will be performed at baseline,
      6 and 12 months.
