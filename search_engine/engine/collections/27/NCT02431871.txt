      infancy. However there are few reports of long term effects of successfully treated DDH.
      Incidence of DDH in neonatal period is approximately 1-10/1000 depending on screening
      protocols used, the age of the infant during screening and which ultrasonographic findings
      are considered normal and which DDH. The prevalence of hip dysplasia in adult population is
      grossly 4 % when using Wibergs Centre-Edge (CE) ≤ 20° as definition of dysplasia. It is still
      unclear, what is the relation between adult acetabular dysplasia and developmental dysplasia
      in children. Hip dysplasia overall is a major contributing factor in hip osteoarthrosis and
      total hip replacement in young adults.

      The aim of this study is to assess long term effects of developmental dysplasia of the hip to
      overall health and quality of life later in life. We compare hip radiographs, hip symptoms,
      clinical examination, head asymmetry, dental examination and intraoral scans of 170 children
      and young adults treated for DDH in their early childhood with age and sex matched controls.
