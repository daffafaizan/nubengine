      Center in Germany. 35 subjects including 5 roll-in subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will participate in the study. This study requires the use of investigational
      products from two independent manufacturers: Imricor and Philips. Imricor has developed the
      ablation catheter with related accessory cables and electrophysiology (EP)
      recorder/stimulator system. Philips has developed an image guidance and mapping system that
      is compatible with the Imricor products.

      The Vision-MR Ablation Catheter will be used in conjunction with the following
      investigational products: Advantage-MR EP Recorder/Stimulator, Vision-MR Ablation Cable Set,
      Vision-MR Diagnostic Cable, the interventional MRI Suite (iSuite) image guidance and mapping
      system, and a dStream Interface (dSIF-FE). With the exception of iSuite and dSIF-FE, which
      are manufactured by Philips, Imricor will provide all investigational devices used in the
      study.

      Each procedure will require two single-use Vision-MR Ablation Catheters and one each of the
      two single-use accessory catheter cables.

      Ablation for the treatment of arrhythmia is an inherently complex procedure. Use of the
      investigational products listed above under MR guidance is an emerging approach to performing
      the interventional electrophysiology procedure.

      The study population will consist of adult patients requiring ablation for type I atrial
      flutter.

      Study subjects will require a follow-up visit or telephone call at seven days post procedure.
      Accordingly, the expected total study duration is approximately 9 months with study start
      planned for March 2016.
