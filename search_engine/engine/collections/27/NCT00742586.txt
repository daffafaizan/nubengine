      this study: multiple systems atrophy (MSA), pure autonomic failure (PAF) or Parkinson's Plus.
      The study consists of drawing 15 ml of whole blood for RNA. The blood is drawn in special
      collection tubes to stabilize the RNA material in the blood. The samples will be frozen and
      shipped to WMU for analysis.

      The patients will also be asked to provide the current list of their medications, their age
      and the age when they were first diagnosed with their neurologic or autonomic disorder. This
      information will be de-identified and sent to the investigators at WMU as a limited data set.
