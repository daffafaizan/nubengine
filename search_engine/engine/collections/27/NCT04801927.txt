      elderly individuals who cannot stand up. It has also been validated in individuals with
      stroke and consists of 11 items. Each item is graded from 0 to 4. The highest score that can
      be obtained is 44. Low test scores indicate impaired sitting balance.

      The necessary permissions were obtained from the authors for the Balance of Sitting Scale,
      whose validity and reliability features will be tested, and the questionnaire was finalized
      by completing the translation process into Turkish. The basis of the use of special
      instruments such as scales is to prove their usability in the sample group to which the
      instrument will be applied. The first step for this is the translation from the original
      language to another language.

      During the translation process into Turkish, two experts who have good command of English
      translated the questionnaire from English to Turkish. These translations were translated back
      into Turkish by two native speakers and distant medical subjects. In addition, these
      translations were re-examined by the researchers and turned into a single form. This form,
      which was sent to five experts in the field, was checked for content and its suitability for
      Turkish was evaluated. With the opinion of experts, the scale took its final form.

      The study will include individuals over the age of 18 who applied to Kastamonu Training and
      Research Hospital and diagnosed with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
