      I. To demonstrate that our light dosimetry system is safe and effective in guiding
      intraoperative photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium (Photofrin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. To examine the
      relationship between immune biomarkers and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes and receive
      intraoperative photodynamic therapy (IO-PDT) via a light dosimetry system 24-48 hours later.

      After conclusion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, within 4 weeks
      from surgery and PDT and every 6 months for 2 years.
