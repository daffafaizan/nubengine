      I. To assess the antitumour activity of RO4929097 in recurrent and/or metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer through co-primary endpoints of overall response rate (ORR) using
      RECIST and 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumour activity of RO4929097 through secondary endpoints including:
      duration of radiologic response, progression-free and overall survival rates within the
      protocol defined follow-up period.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of single agent RO4929097 in breast cancer.

      III. To explore expression of Notch biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer and potential
      interaction with RO4929097 response and toxicity.

      IV. To evaluate the downstream effects of RO4929097 in advanced triple negative breast
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO)
      once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
