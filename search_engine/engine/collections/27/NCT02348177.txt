    
      This is a multicentre, open label, non-randomized, prospective, noninferiority study to
      compare the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir administered with superboosting (LPV/r 1:1) and
      concurrent RIF treatment or with standard boosting (LPV/r 4:1) without concurrent RIF
      treatment, and to assess the safety, tolerance, and virological effect of superboosting in
      HIV-TB co-infected infants and children weighing >3 kg and â‰¤15 kg.

      LPV/r will be administered as the liquid 80/20 mg/mL formulation (4:1 standard boosting
      ratio). During anti-TB treatment, additional RTV liquid formulation will be provided to
      deliver a 1:1 superboosting ratio of LPV to RTV. Actual doses for antiretrovirals and anti-TB
      drugs will be based on the South African (SA) weight band dosing recommendations and provided
      as per the site standard of care.
