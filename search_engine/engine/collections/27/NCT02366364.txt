      in animal models of affective disorders including major depressive disorder. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral (PO) ascending doses
      of NRX-1074 as evidenced by the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), changes in
      serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, changes in physical examination findings,
      psychotomimetic findings and subject-reported symptoms.
