    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain whether patients with completely resected high-risk primary GIST who undergo
      adjuvant treatment with STI571 have prolonged survival compared to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 2 and 5-year prevalence of recurrence in patients treated with adjuvant
      STI571 following complete resection of high-risk primary GIST.

      II. To obtain from patients with GIST: tumor tissue (before therapy with STI571 and at the
      time of recurrence), blood specimens (before therapy with STI571), and serum specimens
      (before therapy with STI571, after completing therapy with STI571, and at the time of
      recurrence) for scientific correlative analyses.

      III. To assess the toxicity of oral STI571 therapy when used in the adjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily beginning within 84 days of surgical resection.
      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.
