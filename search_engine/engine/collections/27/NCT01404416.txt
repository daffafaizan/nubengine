      of Prenatal Vitamin/Mineral Supplements on Perinatal Mortality (NCT00133744)". We followed up
      all livebirths born to women of the trial to measure their height, weight, and hemoglobin and
      to implement a questionaire survey (including developmental milestones, disease history,
      breast feeding, passive smoking, et al). We selected 1200 <30 months infants to assess their
      IQ with Bayley scale, emotional and behavioral problem with CBCL scale, and language
      development status with LDS scale. We also selected 1500 >30 months children to measure their
      emotional and behavioral problem with CBCL scale. The exposure groups include intrauterine
      nutritional exposure and cesarean delivery exposure as well as CDMR. The outcomes of interest
      include death, body mass index, overweight/ obesity, stunting/ wasting/ thinness, anemia,
      developmental milestones, IQ, emotional and behavioral disorder, language developmental
      status, and disease history. Other interesting exposure includes breast feeding, passive
      smoking, et al. We hypothesize that intrauterine nutritional exposure has an impact on
      offspring's physical, mental, and language development. We also hypothesize that cesarean
      delivery including CDMR has an impact on offspring's these outcomes.
