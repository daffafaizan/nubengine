      cervical dilatation ≥ 4 cm and 50% effacement randomly assigned to one of two equal groups;
      Group L received intrathecal levobupivacaine 0.25% in 2 mL and Group LD received intrathecal
      levobupivacaine 0.25% combined with dexamethasone 4 mg in 2 mL. At first request of
      analgesia, a combination of 0.25% levobupivacaine with 100 μg fentanyl in 10 ml via the
      epidural catheter. Further analgesia was provided with 7 ml 0.25% levobupivacaine hourly. The
      primary outcome measure was the duration of spinal analgesia. Secondary outcome measures
      include time from spinal analgesia to delivery, total amount of epidurally administered
      levobupivicaine, adverse effects of neuraxial block and neonatal outcome.
