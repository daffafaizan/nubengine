      inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix Inj., manufactured by GSK) as the control vaccine to
      prove that the immunogenicity of the test vaccine treatment group is not inferior to the
      control vaccine treatment group and to statistically confirm that there is no difference in
      safety.
