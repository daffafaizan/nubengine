      prevent HO at the flare-up site in subjects with FOP as assessed by plain radiographs.

      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sponsor-unblinded,
      placebo-controlled study. Two cohorts of subjects will be randomized into different dosing
      regimens of palovarotene for a 6-week (42 days) treatment period. The study will consist of
      three periods:

        1. A Screening period to occur within 7 days of a distinct flare-up. The first dose of
           study drug will be taken within 7 days of the flare-up initiation.

        2. A double-blind treatment period of 6 weeks (42 days) duration.

        3. A follow-up period of 6 weeks (42 days) duration.

      An initial cohort (Cohort 1) of subjects will be randomly assigned 3:1 to either palovarotene
      or placebo daily for 42 days. Subjects randomized to palovarotene in Cohort 1 will receive an
      initial daily dose of 10 mg for 14 days followed by 5 mg daily for 28 days.

      In Cohort 2, new FOP subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned 3:3:2 to two dose regimens of palovarotene (10 mg for 14 days and 5 mg for 28 days;
      5 mg for 14 days and 2.5 mg for 28 days) or placebo daily for 42 days. Doses will be
      weight-adjusted and subjects randomized within three weight-range categories (20 to <40 kg,
      40 to <60 kg, and â‰¥60 kg).

      Subjects completing the study and still meeting eligibility requirements will be given the
      opportunity to enroll into an open-label extension study.
