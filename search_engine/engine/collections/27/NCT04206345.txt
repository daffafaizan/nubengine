      group, elbow bending exercises without blood flow restriction will be performed to the
      exercise group and control group will not receive any interventions. Participants will be
      evaluated before and after the exercise session. Control group is going to rest for 10
      minutes before the second evaluation. Evaluation protocol includes; muscle strength
      measurement with digital hand dynamometer, shoulder and elbow proprioception evaluation with
      inclinometer, Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stabilization Test, Functional Throwing
