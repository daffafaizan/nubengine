      cancer, HPV testing has many potential uses in cervical cancer screening. Unfortunately, like
      cytology, it suffers from a lack of specificity when used for population-based screening.
      Given that HPV testing detects more cases of CIN3+ than cytology and that it would probably
      be more practical in developing regions, finding a biomarker that would increase specificity
      has been the goal for much research on HPV and cervical cancer. The goal of this study is to
      explore potential predictors of viral clearance, specifically RNA levels of candidate genes
      in cervical swabs and host genetic polymorphisms, in the context of genotype-specific
      infection data.
