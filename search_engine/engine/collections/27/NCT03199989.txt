      cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Because of the absolute little benefit of
      adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection of stage II colon cancer，NCCN and ESMO
      guidelines do not recommend routine adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon
      cancer unless combined with high risk factors.

      Currently，most studies about stage II colon cancer with high risk factors were retrospective.
      Some suggested that patients with stage II colon cancer can benefit from adjuvant
      chemotherapy, however, more got the negative conclusions.

      The study was designed as a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.Patients
      who agreed to participate in the study would be randomly assigned to a treatment group of
      adjuvant chemotherapy or observation with 50% chance by a central randomization system
      determined by the computer program.

      After a follow up of at least 3 years, the disease free survival of the two groups will be
      compared.
