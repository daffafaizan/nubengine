    
      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To compare the lifetime prevalence of these major disorders between groups;

      B. To assess the association of different, targeted, qualitative biomarkers with clinical
      symptomatology;

      C. To assess the association between the presence of "transitory APS" and the presence of
      psychiatric disorders;

      D. Estimate and compare the current prevalence (= the day of assessment) of major psychiatric
      disorders in the sample of patients who developed clinical signs of obstetrical APS;

      E. Estimate the current prevalence (= the day of assessment) and intensity of major
      depressive episodes (MDE) in the sample of patients;

      F. Compare the prevalence of current MDE and the intensity of depressive symptoms present
      between groups;

      G. Estimate and compare the (lifetime and current) prevalence by category of psychiatric
      disorders (psychotic, anxiety, mood, etc..) in the APS group with that in the thrombophilic
      group and the remaining group;

      H. To study the average age of onset of psychiatric disorders and clinical manifestations of
      APS in the sample of patients who developed clinical signs of obstetrical APS;

      I. Compare the mean ages between groups;

      J. Compare the mean age at onset of psychiatric disorders with the average age of the first
      clinical manifestation of the disease in the group of women with APS.
