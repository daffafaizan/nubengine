      open-label multi-center efficacy and safety study. After a patient enrolls, leukapheresis
      will be performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells which will be sent to a
      manufacturing site to produce P-BCMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be returned to the
      investigational site and, after a standard chemotherapy based conditioning regimen, will be
      administered to the patient across 1-3 infusions, with or without combination therapy.
      Treated patients will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response.
      Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.
