      (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions
      such as manual signs, gestures or interaction with a touchscreen for communication. This
      clinical trial will test the feasibility of developing a smart-AAC system designed using
      individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique
      manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. The investigators will demonstrate
      the proof-of-concept that a single surface electromyographic (sEMG) and inertial measurement
      unit (IMU) hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in information
      transfer rate (ITR) and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is
      optimized compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface for subjects with SPI.
