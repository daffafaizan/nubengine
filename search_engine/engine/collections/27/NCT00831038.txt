      with dysphagia via a modified barium feeding study will be recruited into the study. The
      infants will be sedated with chloral hydrate and have pulmonary functions measured (pre- and
      post-bronchodilator spirometry and lung volume) using the infant pulmonary laboratory.
      Treatment for the infants' dysphagia/chronic aspiration will be treated as determined by the
      primary care physicians. Six months later the infants will again be sedated and have
      pulmonary functions measured. Results of the two sets of tests will be compared
      statistically.
