      proteins may result in the development of neutralising antibodies (NAbs). Antibodies are
      considered neutralising by their ability to inhibit the biological effect of interferon in a
      bioassay system. EMD Serono has actively pursued improvements in the formulation of
      interferon (IFN) beta-1a to reduce aggregate levels and to develop a formulation that is
      HSA-free. Reducing aggregates should reduce antigenicity of the product while removal of HSA
      may have an unpredictable effect on antigenicity. EMD Serono will conduct a study to assess
      the immunogenicity and safety of the new HSA-free formulation, manufactured using IFN-ÃŸ-1a
      drug substance produced by a new clone from the FBS-free process.
