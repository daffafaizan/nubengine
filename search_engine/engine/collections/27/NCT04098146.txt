    
      Prospective data will be collected in a minimum of 300 patients presenting with an acquired
      segmental mandibular defect â‰¥ 4 cm secondary to OSSC removal and who require mandibular
      reconstruction.

      The follow up (FU) will consist of standard of care (routine) procedures and data collection
      will be done at 3, 6, 12, 18 and up to 24 months after resection and/or reconstruction. The
      maximum FU for each patient within the registry will be 2 years after mandibular resection.

      Data collection will include confounding baseline data, tumor characteristics, neurological
      function, patient reported outcomes, quality of life as well as anticipated procedure-related
      adverse events (AEs). Available images will be collected and evaluated centrally to determine
      the location, positioning, osseointegration, bone quantity and quality of the transplants.

      Depending on the volume and quality of the collected data, different statistical analyses
      will be performed. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to find relationships between the
      different treatment modalities and their outcomes.
