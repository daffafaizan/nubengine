      pamidronate) study. All patients with AS will receive treatment with tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) inhibitor, as indicated by local guidelines. Randomization will be performed for
      pamidronate vs placebo group. Pamidronate will be prescribed as monthly intravenous infusion
      in the dose of 60 mg/month for the first 6 consecutive months of every study year. Primary
      outcome will be the rate of radiographic progression of ankylosing spondylitis (AS),
      calculated after 24 months of combined treatment. Clinical and laboratory disease parameters
      will serve as secondary outcomes. These outcomes as well as safety assessments will be
      performed on a monthly basis up to 24 months.
