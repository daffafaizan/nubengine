    
      This is an open-label Phase 1b clinical study of ipilimumab in combination with intravenous
      CVA21 in subjects who have uveal melanoma metastatic to liver. Subjects will receive up to 8
      cycles of CVA21 at a planned dose of 1 x 10e9 TCID50 per infusion, with the first cycle being
      a 28-day cycle consisting of an intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8 and subsequent
      cycles every 21 days from Day 8.

      Ipilimumab will be given by intravenous administration at a dose of 3mg/kg, for a maximum of
      4 doses, given on Days 8, 29, 50 and 71. On days when both CVA21 and ipilimumab are given,
      CVA21 will be given first.

      Subjects will be monitored for treatment toxicity using the current version of CTCAE.
