    
      SLT is used to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma, but it is not know whether the choice
      of eyedrops administered in the post-operative period affects SLT efficacy. Practitioners
      commonly use steroid drops, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drops, or no drops at all. This
      is a randomized, single-center, prospective, masked clinical trial to determine whether the
      choice of eyedrop affects efficacy of SLT in glaucoma patients.
