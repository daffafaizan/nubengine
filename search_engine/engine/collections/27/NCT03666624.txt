      Aim 1. Develop a personalized care network-RDAD intervention suitable for SGM older adults
      living with dementia without caregivers.

      Aim 2. Implement a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 30 participants with 2
      arms (routine medical care vs. the personalized care network-RDAD approach) to assess the
      acceptability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of the intervention.
