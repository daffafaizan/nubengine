      proportion of women who experience blood loss greater than or equal t 350 ml, the proportion
      of women who experience blood loss greater than or equal to 500 ml, side effects, adverse
      events and change in hemoglobin pre- to post-delivery. It will also assess whether a bleeding
      history questionnaire can identify women at risk for excessive bleeding and help to define
      the distribution of bleeding scores among women with and without excessive bleeding.
