        -  Determine the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on recurrence free and overall
           survival in women with a history of stage I or II endometrial adenocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      of endometrial cancer (IA vs IB/IC vs II). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral conjugated estrogens (Premarin) daily for 3 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily for 3 years. Patients are followed every 6
           months for 3 years and then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,108 patients will be accrued for this study.
