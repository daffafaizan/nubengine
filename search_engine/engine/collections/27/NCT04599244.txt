      one of the main reasons for seeking emergency dental treatment. Pain associated with
      irreversible pulpitis represents more than 45% of emergency patients in dental clinics. A
      pulpotomy has been demonstrated as an emergency intervention for effective pain relief by
      removing the coronal pulp tissue without penetrating radicular pulpal tissue. Inflammation
      and degeneration of the pulp usually progress apically from the point of infection, so
      selective removal of this tissue in the form of pulpotomy is usually effective in controlling
      pain and patient sedation.
