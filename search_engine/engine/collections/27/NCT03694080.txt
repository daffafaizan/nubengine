    
      This is an explorative, phase I clinical trial. The aim of this study is to establish the
      safety and efficacy of treating patients with early colorectal cancer with calcium
      electroporation as a down staging and immune-response enhancing treatment prior to intended
      curative surgery. The study involves recruitment of patients with histologically verified
      rectal and sigmoid colon cancer with no indication for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
      (experimental or standard care based) prior to intended curative surgery. In total the study
      will involve 24 patients, of these, 12 patients with rectal cancer and 12 patients with
      sigmoid colon cancer.

      In relation to the intervention, clinical examination, blood samples, biopsies and
      questionnaires will be collected to evaluate safety, tumor respons and immunologic response
      to the treatment.

      Patients will be followed for one month after the elective surgery.
