    
      From January 2010 to December 2015, data from patients requiring an elective left colectomy
      for benign or malignant indication were collected prospectively in our colorectal surgery
      database.

      According to our exclusion criterial patients were retrospectively divided into two groups:
      kidney transplant recipients (KTR-group) and control group (C-group).

      The surgical indication for an oncologic left colectomy was retained by the expert surgeon,
      after a multidisciplinary conversation meeting comprising at least one surgeon, one
      gastroenterologist, one nephrologist, one radiologist and one oncologist. The surgical
      indication for diverticular disease was based on French guidelines.

      Demographic, clinical, intraoperative and postoperative, histological, length of hospital
      stay and mortality data were collected over a 90-day period following the intervention.
