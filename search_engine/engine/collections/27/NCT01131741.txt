      during general anesthesia. Physicians usually use local anesthetics containing epinephrine to
      detect intravascular injection. Existing methods including heart rate, systolic blood
      pressure and T-wave amplitude are unreliable to detect intravascular injection during
      anesthesia and a method using changes in perfusion index was recently suggested. This study
      was designed to determine whether perfusion index is a reliable method to detect
      intravascular injection of epinephrine containing local anesthetics and to compare its
      reliability with conventional criteria in sevoflurane anesthetized adults.

      We will randomize patients to 2 groups: a saline group and an epinephrine group. Changes in
      perfusion index, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and T-wave amplitude will be measured
      during 5 minutes after injection of 3 mL of saline or 1% lidocaine containing epinephrine. we
      will determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive
      value.
