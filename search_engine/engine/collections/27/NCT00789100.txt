      based nursing services and care matrons in the management of patients with CHF and COPD and
      co-morbidities. The main issue is to design a study that will determine the impact of the use
      of the technology independent of other factors. A randomised controlled trial has been chosen
      in which equal numbers of participants with and without home-based monitoring will be
      followed over the study to determine differences in utilisation of healthcare services
      including number of hospitalisations, length of stay in hospital, GP visits and community
      matron and specialist community nurse home visits.

      The ethical issue is how to determine those that will receive home-based monitoring and those
      that will be denied. The study requires that participants are matched for severity of their
      condition in each arm and this could deny some from the potential benefits of monitoring.
      However, as only a limited number of home-based monitors are available and all participants
      will continue to receive normal health care services, we believe that those denied monitoring
      will not receive care that is different to patients not in the study and the ethical issues
      are acceptable.
