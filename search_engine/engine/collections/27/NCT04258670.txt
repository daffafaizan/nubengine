      that detect Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigen but these tests are unreliable
      in African nations where Loa loa is co-endemic because they yield false-positive results in
      some individuals with loiasis. The goals of this project are to define the cross-reactive
      antigen profile of persons with spontaneous antigenemia, how it varies over time, and to
      determine which L. loa antigens in cross-reactive sera best distinguish loiasis
      cross-reactivity from LF.

      This prospective study will prospectively enroll 50 adults who presented with cross-reactive
      antigenemia at screening and 10 negative controls. Participants will followed for one year
      and tested every three months for persistence of antigenemia.
