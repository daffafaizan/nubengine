      evaluate the impact of this intervention. Each of the 18 participating hospitals will be
      randomized one of the four wedges according to a random schedule; each wedge will consist of
      4 to 5 hospitals. With this design, the implementation of the intervention will be rolled out
      sequentially to the participating hospitals over a 5 month period for each wedge. All
      hospitals will have received the intervention by the end of the study.

      Note that the study design fields provided by ClinicalTrials.gov do not allow for describing
      this type of study design; therefore, the investigators have listed the study as a single
      arm. In reality, this study will have 4 wedges, each containing randomized clusters of 4-5
      hospitals.
