      provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether a commonly used anti-inflammatory agent
      used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CVD morbidity and
      mortality among patients with stable coronary artery disease. CIRT, is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial among 7,000 men and women with prior
      myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
      Eligible participants will be randomly allocated over a three to four year period to usual
      care plus placebo or usual care plus LDM (average dose of 15-20 mg po/weekly. CIRT proposes
      that the reduction in CVD events with methotrexate derives from its effect on vascular
      inflammation, thus it is crucial to incorporate a measure of vascular inflammation imaging
      for confirmation of the primary mechanism of action underlying CIRT. As such, the direct
      evaluation of arterial inflammation would enhance the scientific value of the CIRT trial.

      The inclusion of the proposed vascular inflammation imaging substudy has widespread
      implications that will allow this imaging modality to serve as a surrogate measure of
      disease, and thereby provide an opportunity for stratification in individuals at risk for CVD
      and evaluation of other interventions with presumed anti-inflammatory effects.
