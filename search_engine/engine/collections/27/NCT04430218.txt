      amputated limb, and muscle recording electrodes in muscles. These will be connected to an
      implanted stimulator. The stimulator will connect wirelessly to an advanced prosthesis. This
      may allow the user to move the prosthetic hand intuitively and feel what the prosthesis is
      touching.
