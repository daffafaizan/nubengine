      may be efficient in the treatment of chronically inflamed post-surgical temporal bone
      cavities.

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a well-known autologous blood-derived product with favourable
      immune, haemostatic and regenerative effects. It has been used in various medical fields
      including otorhinolaryngology.

      In fact, PRP contains important concentrations of extracellular vesicles (EV) which are the
      main contributors to PRP effects. For that reason, PRP can be identified as platelet- and
      extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP). In this study, PVRP will be prepared by a unique
      non-commercial 2-step centrifugation protocol developed by this study researchers.

      A radical cavity is a large post-surgical temporal bone cavity due to removal of the
      posterior external ear canal wall in open-technique cholesteatoma surgery. This technique is
      performed in approximately 40 per cent of cholesteatoma surgery.

      Radical cavities become inflamed in 3-20 per cent, which leads to the formation of
      granulation tissue and multiple suppurative periods. The large spectrum of surgical and
      nonsurgical treatment options have been applied to reduce patient discomfort. This
      significantly worsens the patients' quality of life and puts a significant burden on health
      care.

      Due to the knowledge of local immune response mechanisms in moist radical cavities and
      exhausted treatment options, new conservative treatment options have been researched. PVRP
      could present a promising treatment option for chronically inflamed radical cavities based on
      published preclinical and clinical studies.

      PVRP will be administered to chronically inflamed radical cavities via PVRP-soaked ear wicks.
