      is the ultimate source of epithelial renewal. Significant damage to limbal cells causes a
      disease state called limbal stem cell deficiency(LSCD),characterized by different extents of
      conjunctival overgrowth onto cornea, vascularization, chronic inflammation, and poor
      epithelial integrity.

      In unilateral LSCD, the damaged corneal surface may be reconstructed using two large segments
      of healthy limbal tissue (of approximately 6-8mm by 1mm) from the fellow eye in the procedure
      of conventional limbal transplantation.This may however compromise ocular surface integrity
      of the healthy eye depending on the amount of donated limbus. In more recent years, it has
      been possible to "save" limbal tissue by obtaining only a very small limbal biopsy (2mm by
      1mm) from the fellow healthy eye which is "expanded" into a viable sheet of limbal cells via
      laboratory cultivation.This cultivated sheet of cells is transplanted to treat the damaged
      ocular surface.

      This study is a prospective nonrandomized trial which evaluates the efficacy of
      transplantation of autologous ex-vivo expanded limbal epithelium on intact amniotic membrane
      for unilateral total limbal stem cell deficiency.
