      useful biomarker of lung cancer from microarray gene expression profiles in public database.

      Using the expression profile of a known metastasis suppressor, CRMP-1, as a template to
      search for and compare transcriptome expressions in publicly accessible microarray datasets,
      trophinin (TRO) was identified as the best correlated gene. The expression pattern of
      trophinin in a lung cancer cell lines of invasion model was investigated using quantitative
      RT-PCR. The role of trophinin in cancer metastasis was investigated by measuring the change
      of invasion activity in trophinin gene-transfected cell lines. The relationship of trophinin
      and the clinicopathological characteristics of lung cancer were further examined by
      immunohistochemical staining.
