      cell) had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese infants.
      The phase III study of inactivated vaccine has initiated on Jan 2012 in China. Over 10,000
      healthy infants have revieved the vaccines and no unexpected severe adverse reactions were
      reported. According to the requirement of SFDA (China), the sponsor should also provide the
      evidence for the consistency of three consecutive lots of EV71 Vaccines before the
      application for the market. Thus, a clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety
      of three consecutive lots of EV71 Vaccines in healthy infants volunteers is planed to
      conduct.
