      parameters of the post-stroke movement: increase of the speed of the walk, improvement in the
      width of the step with the affected side, improvement of the walking index dynamics (Dynamic
      Gait Index), improvement in cadence and improvement in the static balance.

      Current systematic reviews argue that more randomized controlled trials with a control group
      are needed.

      Main objective: To evaluate the effect of a rhythmic auditory stimulation on the quality of
      progress and balance in people with stroke.

      Methodology: experimental group will be done between 2019 and 2020 and historical control
      group of the years 2017 and 2018. Experimental group will do 3 sessions in a week of RAS, and
      daily 2 hours of physiotherapy except of Sundays. Control group received 2 hours daily of
      physiotherapy, except Sundays.

      The study has been approved by the hospital ethics committee.
