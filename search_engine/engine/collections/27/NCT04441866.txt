      measuring fetal biometry, and for the reconstruction of standard planes of fetal anatomy.
      Although there are studies that have assessed the application of these algorithms in terms of
      repeatability of the measurements made, or of possibility of acquiring diagnostic planes,
      there are no randomized controlled studies that evaluated their impact on the second
      trimester ultrasound scan.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the use of automated algorithms for the
      measurement of fetal biometry, and for the reconstruction of standard planes of fetal
      anatomy, compared with the standard ultrasound technique, in terms of:

        -  duration of the ultrasound scan

        -  quality of biometric measurements

        -  quality of the diagnostic planes

        -  operator satisfaction
