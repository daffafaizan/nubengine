    
      This study is an international phase 3 open-label, single-arm, long-term efficacy and safety
      extension study that will enroll eligible participants who have completed their participation
      in one of the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies,
      MVT-601-3001 (LIBERTY 1 - NCT03049735) or MVT-601-3002 (LIBERTY 2 - NCT 03103087). All
      participants will receive relugolix 40 mg orally once daily co-administered with low-dose E2
      (1.0 mg) and NETA (0.5 mg) for 28 weeks.

      Approximately 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will
      be enrolled, after having completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the parent studies.
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety through up to 52
      weeks of treatment (including treatment during the parent study) of relugolix co-administered
      with low-dose E2/NETA.

      Screening and baseline procedures will be done at the same visit for this extension study
      (referred to as the "Week 24/Baseline Visit"), which coincides with the Week 24 Visit from
      the parent study, and will be defined as the date of completion of the last Week 24 procedure
      in the parent study. Participants will have received their last dose of study drug in the
      parent study on the day prior to the Week 24/Baseline Visit and will receive their first dose
      of study drug for this extension study in the clinic after the participant is determined to
      be eligible for this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate. The
      administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT-601-3003 will define enrollment into
      this study. Study participants will then take the open-label study treatment orally once
      daily for 28 weeks.
