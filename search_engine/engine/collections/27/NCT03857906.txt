    
      Methods: Quasi-experimental, prospective, comparative, non-randomized study. The decision to
      place the BIAC is not part of the study and depends on the multidisciplinary decision of a
      Heart Team, based on the individualized risk / benefit. The study population consists on high
      surgical risk patients with atherosclerotic coronary disease undergoing CABG in our centre
      between 2014-2018. Patients are excluded if any condition is present: cardiogenic shock, with
      AMI 48 hours prior and / or severe aortic insufficiency. In one group BIAC will be inserted
      1-6 hours before surgery (BIAC group) and a second group is control (non-BIAC group). A
      minimum 30-day postoperative follow-up of will be performed, with primary end points
      (mortality and AMI type V) and secondary end points (additional PO complications).

      Analysis: An evaluation of normality distribution K-S will be performed, the means of
      quantitative (t-Test) and categorical variables (Fisher or χ² Pearson) will be compared. A
      multivariate analysis will be performed with linear logistic regression to evaluate the
      influence of age, sex, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and EuroSCORE-II on the primary
      goal. Statistical significance will be considered when p <0.05. Softwares: GraphPad-Prism-5.0
      and SPSS-15.0
