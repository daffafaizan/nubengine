    
      A Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      Investigator nor the participant know about the study treatment), placebo-controlled (a
      pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to
      test if the drug has a real effect) study of CNTO 1959 (Guselkumab) in the treatment of
      participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. Participants will receive either
      treatment of CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) 50 milligram (mg) or 100 mg or Placebo 50 mg or 100 mg.
      Participants will primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score and
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
