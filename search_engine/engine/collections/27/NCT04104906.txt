    
      Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial which will be composed of volunteers of both
      genders, aged between 35 and 60 years. All volunteers will undergo pre-assessment (Av1): pain
      sensation, pain and function, shoulder range of motion, muscle strength, electromyographic
      activity and kinematics of the shoulder complex. After the initial evaluation, the volunteers
      will be randomly divided into two groups to carry out the intervention: exercises (GE -
      conventional exercises with elastic band) and motor control (GCM - motor control training).
      The intervention protocol will last eight weeks. After four weeks, the second assessment
      (AV2), similar to AV1, will be performed and the global change perception questionnaire will
      be added. At the end of the intervention protocol, the third evaluation (AV3), similar to
      AV2, will be performed. A follow-up will be performed after 4 weeks of the end of the
      intervention protocol, with the assessment being equal to AV3.

      The project will be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of
      Rio Grande do Norte through the national interface "Plataforma Brasil". The study will also
      be registered on the international clinical trial platform, ClinicalTrials.gov. The study
      will only begin after approval of the ethics and research committee. All volunteers should
      read and sign the terms of free and informed consent.
