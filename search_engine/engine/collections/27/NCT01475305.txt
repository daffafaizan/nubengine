      participants will be randomized, dosed and followed. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of MEDI-557 or placebo. Participants will be
      inoculated with RSV-A. Participants will be followed for efficacy for 12 days post-RSV
      challenge. Safety follow-up will be approximately 12 months from randomization.
