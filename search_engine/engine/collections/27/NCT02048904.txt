      of protein in their urine. This indicates that they are starting to develop diabetic kidney
      disease. The standard treatment for this is the use of one of two blood pressure medicines,
      either an ACE inhibitor or ARB. However, these medicines are not always completely effective
      in stopping/reversing the kidney disease. Some studies have previously suggested that another
      type of medicine, called sitagliptin, normal used to treat diabetes may also help prevent
      diabetic kidney disease from getting worse.
