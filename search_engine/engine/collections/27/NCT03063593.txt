      Design Prospective, multi-site, multi-year post-market clinical follow-up study Study Group
      Primary/Unilateral and/or bilateral Total Ankle Arthroplasty subjects implanted with
      INFINITY速 Total Ankle System N Subjects 500 with 10 sites Follow-Up Schedule Subject
      enrollment will consist of a Pre-operative, Operative, 6 months, 1 yr., 2 yr., 5yr., 7 yr.,
      10 yr., and an unscheduled visit as needed.

      Primary Objective Evaluate the long-term survivorship of the INFINITY速 implant over 10 years

      Secondary Objective(s) Secondary objectives assessed will be to:

        -  Identify and assess the implant for component loosening and/or subsidence, any
           osteolysis and/or cyst formation through radiographic evaluation early and throughout
           the lifetime of the implant.

        -  Compare the improvements in self-reported pain and social interaction for quality of
           life measures from pre-op through 10 years post operatively; assessed by EuroQol
           (EQ5D5L).

        -  Compare pain and functional improvement in the Ankle Osteoarthritis Score (AOS), which
           is a visual analogue scale specifically designed as a modification of the Foot Function
           Index.

        -  Compare the improvement in self-reported pain-free function scores from pre-op through
           10 years post-operatively, assessed by the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ)
           walking/standing scores.

        -  Identify and report the safety of the implant in terms of complications and adverse
           events.

      Exclusion Criteria Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following
      criteria:

        -  Subjects with an ankle condition, as determined by the investigator, to be an
           inappropriate candidate for a total ankle replacement;

        -  Subjects requiring revision total ankle replacement of the ankle being considered for
           study
