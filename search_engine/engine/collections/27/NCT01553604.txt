      It is a clean operation, and surgical site infection (SSI) rates are low. However, a SSI,
      since a minor one, leads to the failure of the procedure. Thus, minimizing SSI risks is
      imperative.

      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides recommendations concerning
      prevention of SSI.No recommendation is offered for some practices, either because there is a
      lack of consensus regarding their efficacy or because of the available scientific evidence is
      insufficient to support their adoption.

      CDCÂ´s "Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection" recommends protecting with a
      sterile dressing for 24 to 48 hours an incision that has been closed primarily. There is no
      recommendation to cover the incision beyond 48 hours. One major risk factor for SSI is the
      presence of bacteria at surgical site.Thus, this trial was designed to verify the influence
      of dressing wear time on skin colonization.
