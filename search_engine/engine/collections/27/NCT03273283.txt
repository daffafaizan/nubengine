      efficacy of an SBIRT programme for hazardous drinkers presenting in an ED. All patients older
      than 18 years old attending the emergency department were potentially eligible. Cognitively
      impaired or medically unstable patients were excluded. Patients seeking treatment for alcohol
      use were also excluded. Patients were randomized to two groups, with the control group
      receiving two leaflets - one regarding alcohol use, and the other giving information about
      the study protocol. The intervention group received the same leaflets as well as a brief
      motivational intervention on alcohol use; and, where appropriate, a referral to specialised
      treatment. The primary outcomes were the proportion of hazardous drinkers measured by AUDIT-C
      scale and the proportion of patients attending specialised treatment at 1.5 and 4.5 months
      and 1 year.
