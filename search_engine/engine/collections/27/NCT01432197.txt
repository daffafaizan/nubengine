      Cancer patients often experience serious dysfunctions leading to problems with activities of
      daily living (ADL) and reduced quality of life. Occupational therapy is believed to be
      effective in handling many of the problems with ADL experienced by patients with cancer, but
      the evidence is sparse.

      Aim

      The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of an occupational therapy intervention
      targeting cancer patients.

      Outcome measures are the patients self-reported quality of life and the patients ability to
      perform ADL.

      Methods

      Randomised controlled trial with 288 patients with cancer treated at Naestved hospital in
      Denmark. Occupational therapy intervention programme for the intervention group (N=144) and
      standard treatment and care for the controls (N=144).

      A systematic review including studies of ADL intervention for cancer patients will be carried
      out. Feasibility of the recruitment and the intervention will be analysed and published.

      The patients need for occupational therapy will be analysed using baseline information from
      the randomised controlled trial.

      The effects of the intervention will be analysed using patient validated questionnaires
      including EORTC QLQ-C30 and the ADL taxonomy questionnaire.
