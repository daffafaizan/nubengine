      90 humanized anti-CD22 LL2 (Y90 MOAB hLL2) in combination with salvage chemotherapy and
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue in patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell
      malignancies. II. Study the effect of chemotherapy on the uptake of Y90 MOAB hLL2 into tumor
      sites and normal organs by pretherapy imaging using indium In 111 humanized LL2 and
      intratherapy imaging. III. Determine the extent and duration of tumor response in patients
      receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal
      antibody LL2 (Y90 MOAB hLL2). Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 5
      days and undergo harvest of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on 2 or more consecutive days.
      If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested, autologous bone marrow may be used.
      Chemotherapy-induced mobilization with filgrastim allowed. Patients undergo pretherapy
      imaging with indium In 111 humanized LL2 (In111 hLL2) for up to 40 minutes on day -7.
      Patients receive Y90 MOAB hLL2 for up to 40 minutes on day 0 plus In111 hLL2, followed by Y90
      MOAB hLL2 alone on day 3. Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour, cisplatin IV over 2
      hours, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 4. Oral etoposide is given daily on days
      1-7. PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on days 9-14, depending on MOAB clearance. Cohorts of
      3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB hLL2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 2 months,
      monthly for 6 months, and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-2.5
      years.
