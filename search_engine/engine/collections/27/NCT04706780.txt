      local anesthesia between the transverse process of the vertebra and the erector spinae
      muscle, it is stated that the effect mechanism of ESP is that spread blocks the ventral and
      dorsal rami to the paravertebral area. The aim of the study is to assess the incidence of
      hemi-diaphragmatic paresis following ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block.
