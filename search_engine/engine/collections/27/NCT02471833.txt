      have beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention in African Americans, who are
      at high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Blood pressure medications known as
      angiotensin-receptor blockers have been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's in
      Caucasians because they act on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a key regulator of blood
      pressure in the body and the brain. The drugs appear to slow the progression of the disease
      by affecting flow of blood and the amount of plaque in the brain, but these benefits have not
      been tested in African Americans. The investigator will evaluate if Telmisartan is able to
      influence the renin-angiotensin system in the brain and produce favorable effects on brain
      blood flow and enzymes that cause the brain plaques in Alzheimer's disease.The investigator
      will assess the mechanism by which Telmisartan modifies the brain renin angiotensin system,
      cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-Î², cerebral blood flow (CBF) and inflammatory markers in
      hypertensive African Americans.
