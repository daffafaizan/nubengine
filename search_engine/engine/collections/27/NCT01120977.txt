      approved in several countries. The approval is based on studies that show positive effect on
      body composition, physiology, lipid profile, bone density and life quality. One often
      observed side effect is fluid retention; this effect is dose dependent and temporary. The
      symptoms are swelling of soft tissue and joint stiffness.

      By comparing the body bioelectric impedance (BIA) with an Arm Muscle Area (AMA) measurement,
      it is possible to determine the hydrations status of a person. This measurement is a simple
      and non invasive method to evaluate the GH dosages applied in the treatment of GHD persons.

      The objective of this study is to create BIA/AMA reference data of healthy persons of both
      genders in the age 20-70 years.
