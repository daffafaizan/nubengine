      as a J-shaped curve with BMI on the x-axis and the biomarker of interest on the y-axis.
      However, BMI is frequently presented in the literature with a cut point of 35 on the x-axis,
      leading to the assumption that the steep association continues beyond a BMI of 35. This
      presentation does not capture the metabolically healthy individual with obesity.

      In the population of men and women with class II and II obesity who the clinical team
      studied, it was examined that the association between BMI as a continuous variable from 35 to
      69.9 and metabolic syndrome biomarkers (total-, low density, and high density cholesterol,
      triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and glycosylated
      hemoglobin), the study team found no evidence for a positive correlation between BMI and TC,
      LDL-C, TG, and FBG. And while the study team did find positive and significant correlations
      between BMI and HDL-C, SBP, DBP, and HgbA1C, the effect sizes were small and arguably
      clinically insignificant.

      The study team's research fills the gap in the obesity literature where BMI with a cut point
      of 35 is frequently used to show the association between BMI and metabolic syndrome
      biomarkers. The clinical team was unable to locate any papers that showed the association
      between metabolic syndrome biomarkers and BMI from 35 to 69.9, and especially graphically as
      this clinical team has presented.
