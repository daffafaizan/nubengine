      infusion during weeks 1 and 3 of a 4-week cycle to participants with solid tumors refractory
      to current therapies. Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cells via
      a folate vitamin receptor. Experimental evidence shows that the target receptor is
      over-expressed in many human cancers. There are no previous human studies of vintafolide
      treatment; however, lab research (research in test tubes and/or animals) using vintafolide
      has shown activity against tumors in animals. This activity in animal models suggests that
      vintafolide may be useful as chemotherapy against human cancers.
