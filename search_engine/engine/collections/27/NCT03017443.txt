      visits (visits 1 and 2; weeks -1 and 0) and six clinic visits (visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and
      9; weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16). One hundred and eighty healthy overweight and obese men
      and women (18-70 years of age; Body Mass Index 25.00 to 44.99 kg/m2) were randomly assigned
      (stratified randomization by two BMI and three age categories) to one of four treatment arms:
      a self-directed diet, or one of three different Nutrisystem programs: 1) My Way; 2) Turbo 10;
      or 3) a program modeled after the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) diet.
      Daily energy intake targets for each 16-week intervention were 1500 kcal/day (men) or 1200
      kcal/day (women), except for the first week of the Turbo 10 intervention, which included a
      more aggressive 1000 kcal/day diet to start. Body weight, body circumference (chest, waist,
      hip, upper arm, thigh and sum of the 5), and blood pressure measurements were obtained at
      baseline (week 0) and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16 in the morning following an
      overnight fast (9 to 14 hours). Total and regional fat mass and fat-free mass (lean soft
      tissue and bone) were quantified by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline (week 0) and
      at weeks 4, 8, and 16. Analyses of serum lipoprotein lipids were obtained at baseline (week
      0), week 8, and week 16. Lipoprotein lipid assessments included Total Cholesterol (TC),
      LDL-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, non-HDL-Cholesterol (calculated as TC minus HDL-C),
      Triglycerides, and the Total Cholesterol/HDL-Cholesterol ratio. Plasma chemistry and
      whole-blood hematology analyses were conducted at screening (week -1). Questionnaires
      designed to assess aspects of quality of life and sleep quality were administered at baseline
      (week 0) and weeks 4, 8, and 16. Quality of Life assessments included the Impact of Weight on
      Quality of Life-Lite (IQWOL-Lite), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Leeds Sleep
      Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ).
