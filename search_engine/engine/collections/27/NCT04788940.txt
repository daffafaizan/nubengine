      morbidity and mortality rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
      Nevertheless, there is a deterioration of left ventricular systolic function or development
      of heart failure in 40-50% of surviving patients with AMI after the percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI), and it is related to infarct size at the index procedure. Conventional
      methods of measuring the infarct size included electrocardiogram, peak cardiac enzyme, and
      echocardiography, but these do not indicate the exact irreversible tissue damage and only
      suggest indirect parameters. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides
      information on infarct size, microvascular obstruction, transmurality, and salvage index, and
      discriminative function between viable and non-viable myocardium with high spatial
      resolution. Also, magnetic resonance imaging is used as a gold standard for the evaluation of
      the myocardial remodeling index. However, it is not well known in which patients occur
      adverse remodeling for the myocardium and in which patients occur reverse remodeling.
      Therefore, the investigators sought to evaluate the clinical implication of CMR and to
      determine factors affecting the 6-month remodeling index assessed by cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging through the current registry.
