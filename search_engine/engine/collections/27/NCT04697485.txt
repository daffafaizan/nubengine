      bumetanide 0.5 mg + eplerenone 25 mg + dapaglifozin 5 mg on top of background therapy. These
      medicines are currently FDA approved and recommended by clinical practice guidelines for the
      treatment of HFpEF (bumetanide, eplerenone) and diabetes mellitus (dapaglifozin).

      This study is designed to evaluate if combination pharmacotherapies with synergistic or
      additive diuretic properties can improve adherence, treatment efficacy, and effectiveness
      with fewer side effects
