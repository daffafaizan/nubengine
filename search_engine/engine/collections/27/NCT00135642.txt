      The main aim of this study was to assess the effects of grass pollen immunotherapy on
      symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and quality of life in seasonal rhinitis and asthma.
      Forty-four patients with severe summer hay fever (of whom 36 reported seasonal chest symptoms
      and 28 had seasonal bronchial hyperresponsiveness) participated in a randomised double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study. After symptom monitoring for one summer,
      participants matched placebo injections (n=22) in a rapid up-dosing cluster regimen for 4
      weeks, followed by monthly injections for 2 years. Outcome measures included hay fever
      symptoms and medication use, health-related quality of life, and measurements of non-specific
      bronchial responsiveness.

      Results: Significant reductions were observed in immunotherapy group compared with the
      placebo group in hay fever symptoms (49%, 15%: P = 0.1), medication scores (80%, 18%;
      P=.007), and seasonal chest symptoms (90%, 11%; P < .05). Impairment of overall quality of
      life (mean score of 7 domains) during the pollen season was less in the immunotherapy group
      than in the placebo group (median difference [95% CI], 0.8 [0.18-1.5]; P=.05=2]. During the
      pollen season, there was no change in airway methacholine PC20 (provocation concentration
      producing a 20% fall in FEV1) in the immunotherapy-treated group (P=5), compared with an
      almost 3 doubling-dose decrease in the placebo-treated group (P=.5), compared with an almost
      3 doubling dose decrease in the placebo-treated group (P=.01, between-group difference).
      There were no significant local or systemic side effects during the study.

      Conclusion: Grass pollen immunotherapy improves quality of life in seasonal allergic rhinitis
      and reduces seasonal asthma symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
