      accompanying the high incidence of obesity-related and other cardiovascular risk factors.
      Indeed, obesity is the most relevant overnutrition disease worldwide, being more dramatic
      than a self-esteem problem or an aesthetic issue, since it is associated to different
      metabolic disorders such as coronary diseases, hypertension, certain tumors, dislipidemia,
      biliary disorders, immunodeficiencies and insulin resistance. Different studies have shown
      the efficacy of low-fat diets on weight reduction, which has been associated to an
      improvement in overweight-related chronic pathological conditions. Additionally, a moderate
      increase of protein content (up to 30% of total caloric intake) in the diet and the inclusion
      of low-glycemic index products have been shown as a good tool for weight loss and
      maintenance. Recent studies have also shown the benefits of partial nutritional
      interventions, mainly on modifying breakfast intake, on anthropometrical and cardiovascular
      risk factors in overweight patients.

      The study has been designed as a longitudinal nutritional intervention with two consecutive
      4-week periods: from week 0 to 4, volunteers will follow their habitual diet. The second
      period (week 4 to 8), the volunteers' habitual breakfast, mid-morning and afternoon snacks
      will be substituted by 40-30-30 products, without changing any other parameter of their
      habitual diet or lifestyle.
