    
      Background:The lack of tumor tissue for drug target and biomarker studies significantly limit
      the development of novel treatment for advanced HCC. In recent years, circulating tumor cells
      (CTCs) have been shown to be important prognostic biomarkers of overall survival for patients
      with breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer after anti-cancer therapy.

      Methods and Materials:This project plans to enroll 50 HCC patients who receive curative
      surgery or radiofrequency ablation therapy, 50 patients who receive trans-arterial
      chemoembolization, and 50 patients who receive systemic therapy at National Taiwan University
      Hospital in 24 months for CTCs analysis. The eligible patients will receive blood tests
      before and after anti-cancer therapy. The blood samples will be separated to blood cells and
      plasma. Blood cells will be used for isolation and enumeration of CTCs. Plasma will be used
      to extract DNA to measure molecular aberration (gene mutations related to
      hepatocarcinogenesis or response of HCC cells to molecular targeted therapy)

        1. to explore the correlation between CTCs numbers and other clinical characteristics in
           HCC patients with different stages;

        2. to compare the patterns of molecular aberrations between CTC and HCC tumor tissue in HCC
           patients who have archival tumor tissue available; and

        3. to measure the changes of CTCs numbers and molecular aberrations in HCC patients before
           and after molecular targeted therapy.
