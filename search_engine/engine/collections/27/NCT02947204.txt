      hospitalization and cumulative expense for the health care system. Supportive management,
      such as oxygen supplementation and monitoring, is the major focus of care, as active medical
      treatment is not effective. Oxygen saturation monitoring may be performed on an intermittent
      (e.g. every 4-6hrs) or continuous basis for stable infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.
      Observational studies find that the use of continuous monitoring is associated with overuse
      of supplemental oxygen and longer hospital stay. Based on this low quality evidence, practice
      guidelines state that clinicians may choose not to use continuous monitoring and practice
      variation exists due to a lack of RCTs.

      SPECIFIC AIMS Primary: To determine if intermittent vs continuous oxygen saturation
      monitoring will reduce length of hospital stay in infants with bronchiolitis. Secondary: To
      determine differences in other outcomes - effectiveness, safety, acceptability, and cost.

      METHODOLOGY Design: multi-centre, pragmatic, parallel group, 1:1, two arm superiority RCT.
      Population: Previously healthy infants (4 weeks-2 years) hospitalized with bronchiolitis who
      are clinically stable, will be recruited from children's and community hospitals in Ontario,
      Canada.

      Interventions: Randomization to intermittent (every 4hrs) or continuous oxygen saturation
      monitoring. In keeping with local and national clinical practice guidelines, an acceptable
      oxygen saturation target of â‰¥ 90% will be used for both groups.
