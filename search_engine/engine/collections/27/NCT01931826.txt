      Clinical and Surgical Gastroenterology of Hospital Universitário Professor Alberto Antunes,
      Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU/UFAL). It was approved by the local Research Ethics
      Committee (protocol #98/0039-3, code 4010000-6) and all patients provided written informed
      consent prior to study enrollment. Patients who met relative criteria for exclusion received
      the current standard of care and follow-up and were analyzed as a third group in the study.

      Over a two-year period, 79 patients were recruited for elective treatment of SPH. The
      criteria for selection were: a) an established diagnosis of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis as
      the cause of portal hypertension; b) a history of UGIB secondary to rupture of esophageal
      varices, with at least 20 days having elapsed since the most recent episode of bleeding; and
      c) age between 15 and 65 years.

      The exclusion criteria were: chronic alcoholism, defined as an alcohol intake of ≥60
      g/EtOH/day in men and ≥40 g/EtOH/day in women; evidence of decompensated liver disease of
      mixed etiology or of any chronic disease that contraindicated surgery were considered
      absolute exclusion criteria; the relative criteria for exclusion were altered hemostasis
      (platelet count < 50×109/L or INR > 1.5); presence of fundal varices on endoscopy.
