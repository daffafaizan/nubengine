      55 participants with evidence of the MetS and autonomic neuropathy will be assessed for fall
      risk with the Four Square Step Test (FSST), which is a measure of dynamic standing balance.
      Additional endpoints include the dynamic gait index. Measures of height, weight, and waist
      circumference will be taken and an oral glucose tolerance test as well as lipids and blood
      pressure will also be measured. Autonomic function will be measured using cardiac autonomic
      testing, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test and tilt table testing. Participants will be
      randomized into either a standard care group that will receive fall risk education or a
      targeted balance exercise intervention group. Both groups will meet once a week. The
      intervention group will receive a 12 week balance program with personalized incremental
      increases in the amount and difficulty of each maneuver.
