        -  To evaluate the efficacy of HLA-haploidentical familial donor hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation after reduced-intensity conditioning regimen comprising busulfan,
           fludarabine phosphate, and anti-thymocyte globulin in patients with bone marrow failure
           syndromes.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV daily on days -7
           and -6, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -2, anti-thymocyte
           globulin (ATG) IV over 4 hours on days -4 to -1, and methylprednisolone IV over 30
           minutes starting 30 minutes before ATG on days -4 to -1.

        -  HLA-haploidentical donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: Patients receive donor
           hematopoietic stem cells via Hickman catheter over 1 hour on days 0 or 1.

        -  Graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis (GVHD): Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2-4
           hours every 12 hours starting on day -1 (cyclosporine can be given orally once oral
           medication can be tolerated) and methotrexate IV on days 2, 4 , 7, and 12. In the
           absence of GVHD, cyclosporine is tapered starting between days 30 to 60.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
