      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current ESC/EACTS guidelines of myocardial
      revascularization support using radial approach (RA) rather than femoral approach (FA) if the
      operators are experts for RA. Recently, an alternative transradial access has been suggested
      at the anatomical snuffbox, with potential additional benefits including a reduction in
      radial artery occlusion rate (which allows reintervention through the same access site and
      potential use as a graft), a decrease in other local vascular complications, shorter
      hemostasis duration, patients' intra and post procedural comfort and shorter recovery time.
      However, the feasibility of PCI via snuffbox approach is still concerned due to the lack of
      data. Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare the two approaches concerning the patency
      of the radial artery â‰¥30 days after the intervention with Doppler in a randomized way. Due to
      the anastomosis of the distal radial artery with the superficial palmar arch, even in case of
      total radial artery occlusion within the anatomical snuffbox, the antegrade blood flow may be
      preserved and, therefore, decreased incidents of radial artery occlusion are expected in the
      right distal radial artery approach group. The mean diameter of radial artery at the
      anatomical snuffbox is 2.4 mm, whereas the mean diameter of the radial artery at the forearm
      is 2.7 mm, and this could potentially contribute to shorter hemostasis duration.
