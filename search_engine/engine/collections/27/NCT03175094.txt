    
      The aim of this study is to adapt and pilot test the Holistic Health Recovery Program for
      women with and at risk for HIV (HHRP+), a CDC evidence-based secondary HIV prevention
      intervention, that will serve as a framework to optimize HIV treatment outcomes and reduce
      HIV-associated risk for women under correctional community supervision.

      Hypotheses

        1. It will be feasible to recruit and retain HIV+ and at-risk women under community
           correctional supervision in the pilot study.

        2. Using the ADAPT-ITT methods, we will be able to adequately adapt HHRP+ for HIV-infected
           and at-risk women under community supervision.

        3. The adapted intervention will be feasible to implement and acceptable to participants.

        4. The adapted intervention will produce higher measureable preliminary effects on
           HIV-focused treatment outcomes in the intervention group compared with the control
           group.
