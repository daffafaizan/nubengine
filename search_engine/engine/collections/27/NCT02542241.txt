      of an infusion of hypertonic saline 3% vs. isotonic saline 0.9% at a dose of 50 mL/hr for the
      first 72 hours in patients with abdominal trauma requiring damage control surgery regarding
      some clinically relevant outcomes. These outcomes were: The timing of abdominal cavity
      closure, fluids balance, abdominal hypertension, and abdominal compartment syndrome
