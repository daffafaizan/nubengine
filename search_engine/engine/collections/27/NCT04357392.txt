      insulin, the investigators named this condition Exogenous insulin antibody syndrome
      (EIAs).Exogenous insulin antibody can lead to serious clinical consequences , such as blood
      glucose fluctuations, high blood glucose and refractory hypoglycemia, which is not only
      affect patients' blood glucose control, but also have a serious impact on the health of
      diabetic patients. Change to the oral antidiabetic drugs, change the insulin type or add
      glucocorticoids to the patients with serious disease are the main treatments. However, most
      of these treatment schemes are case reports, and there is no randomized controlled cohort
      study on the treatment scheme. The biosynthetic human insulin sequence is exactly the same as
      that of human insulin. Why do some diabetics have insulin antibody? The investigators
      speculated that insulin antibody production in some patients with EIAs is related to
      autoimmune disorder. After adding glucocorticoid, some EIAs patients can reduce insulin
      dosage, correct hypoglycemia, even eliminate insulin antibody in about half a year, and
      achieve the goal of blood glucose stability. However, there is no study to evaluate the
      effect of glucocorticoid intervention on the improvement of blood glucose in the EIAs
      population. This project plans to collect 20 cases of EIAs and carry out a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the improvement of blood glucose
      by glucocorticoid intervention, so as to provide scientific basis for the standardized
      diagnosis and treatment of EIAs.
