      as extensive stage disease in 60% to 70% of patients. Sites of metastases include bone (35%),
      liver (25%), bone marrow (20%), brain (10%), extrathoracic lymph nodes (5%), and subcutaneous
      masses (5%). Small-cell lung cancer has prominent markers of neuroendocrine differentiation.

      The staging classification for SCLC is the 2-stage Veterans Administration Lung Study Group
      system that categorizes patients as having limited or extensive disease. Limited stage SCLC
      is disease confined to 1 hemithorax with or without adjacent mediastinal and/or
      supraclavicular lymph node involvement, but without a pleural effusion. This extent of
      disease can be included in a tolerable radiation field. Extensive-disease SCLC is any disease
      beyond the definition of limited-stage disease.

      There are few proven treatment options for SCLC patients who fail first-line chemotherapy.
      New treatment strategies must be evaluated. The need to discover active agents with better
      toxicity profiles continues to be of great importance. Amrubicin may be an effective
      treatment for this population.
