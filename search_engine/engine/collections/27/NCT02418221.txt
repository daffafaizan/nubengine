      authors since the 1990ies. However, the existence of this multifactorial condition is also
      being contested due to the lack of both a positive definition and unambiguous diagnostics.
      Various provocation studies using pure histamine or histamine-containing foods support the
      existence of the disease pattern, however many questions still remain open.

      A lack of diamine oxidase (DAO) is considered the etiological cause of the condition. DAO is
      an enzyme known to degrade a wide array of biogenic amines. The aim of this study is to
      provoke a response in patients by oral administration of a defined mixture of biogenic
      amines. By administration of DAO before provocation an attenuation of the symptoms is to be
      expected.
