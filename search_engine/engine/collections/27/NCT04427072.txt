      treatment arms: capmatinib (investigational therapy) or docetaxel. The randomization will be
      stratified by prior lines of systemic therapy received for advanced/metastatic disease (one
      line vs. two lines).

      For all participants, the respective treatment (either with capmatinib or docetaxel) may be
      continued beyond initial disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 (as assessed by the
      investigator and confirmed by BIRC) if, in the judgment of the investigator, there is
      evidence of clinical benefit, and the participant wishes to continue on the study treatment.
      After treatment discontinuation, all participants will be followed for safety evaluations
      during the safety follow-up period, and the participant's status will be collected every 12
      weeks as part of the survival follow-up.

      Participants randomized to docetaxel treatment will be eligible to crossover to receive
      capmatinib treatment after BIRC-confirmed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease and after
      meeting the eligibility criteria prior to crossover.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of capmatinib versus docetaxel
      by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee (BIRC)
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between treatment
      arms.
