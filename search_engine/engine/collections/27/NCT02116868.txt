      validated analgesia monitor. The analysis of pupillary reflex is a new tool to assess
      analgesia during the intraoperative and postoperative period.

      During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation that produce pneumoperitoneum may
      induce hemodynamics events such as tachycardia or hypertension. These events may be
      misleading or confusing. Actually, these events are mainly considered as insufficient
      analgesia. Thus, anesthesiologists deepen analgesia and/or anesthesia by increasing
      concentration of anesthetics or opioids. These inappropriate actions may induce hypotension
      and/or bradycardia especially in elderly patients. On the contrary, insufficient analgesia
      may exist in hypovolemic patients or in patients with neuromuscular blocking agents.
