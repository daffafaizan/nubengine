    
      1. Objective： To observe the difference between Thyogen® injection or Eltroxin® withdrawal
           on metabolic profile.

        2. Background and method:： The prevalence of thyroid cancer has increased in recent
           decades. Patients with thyroid cancer need to choose between Thyrogen® injection and
           Eltroxin® withdrawal before radioiodine therapy or scan. This is a prospective,
           observational study, aiming to observe the difference of metabolic profiles between
           patients choose Thyrogen® injection and Eltroxin® withdrawal.

      Inclusion ： Patient number: 500人

      Inclusion criteria :

        1. Patients with diagnosis of thyroid cancer。

        2. Patients who need radioiodine therapy or scan。

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patients cannot cooperate with blood test.。

        2. Patients cannot cooperate with radioiodine therapy。 Study design： Prospective,
           observational study。

      Method： We will collect 20cc blood and 20 cc urine before and after radioiodine therapy
      during each visit (total 3 visits) and check lipid profiles, glucose profiles and
      inflammation markers. We will compare the difference between results of patients undergoing
      Thyrogen® injection and Eltroxin® withdrawal.
