    
      Urodynamic study is one of the most common procedures in urological outpatient practice.
      Patients who wait for the tests may experience significant anxiety.

      in this study, patients who are designated to have multichannel Urodynamic study will be
      randomized to two groups: group 1 - patients who received an explanation note about the test;
      group 2 - patients who did not receive the note. The explanation notes will be sent to the
      patients in group 1 by mail one month before the test.

      Investigators will use the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in order to assess emotional
      distress immediately before the test. Comparison opf the anxiety level between the two groups
      will be performed.
