      crowns provide horizontal stability, thus stabilizing the prosthesis against lateral
      dislodging forces. The overdenture's self finding mechanism in telescopic constructions
      facilitates prosthesis insertion considerably.

      Telescopic constructions seem to be easy to care for as they do not possess areas of
      difficult access for maintenance. This is why this construction also seems to be an effective
      treatment modality for geriatric patients with serious systemic diseases, which affect the
      degree of dexterity.

      Despite rapid development in overdenture attachments and implant-supported overdentures with
      cast metal copings remain a viable and usable modality in dental practice. There is limited
      clinical follow-up data of the complications associated with overdentures and abutment teeth
      restored with metal copings, including post-procedural and prosthetic problems.
