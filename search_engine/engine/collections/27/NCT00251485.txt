      The three-drug combination of oxaliplatin with 5-FU/LV for the first-line treatment of
      metastatic colorectal cancer has shown a significant increase in response rate compared to
      IFL (irinotecan and bolus 5-FU plus leucovorin ) and IROX (irinotecan plus oxaliplatin.
      Cetuximab has shown activity with and without irinotecan in subjects with colorectal cancer
      refractory to irinotecan alone.30,31 Cetuximab has also been shown to be safe and effective
      when administered with infusional 5-FU/folinic acid plus irinotecan. These results suggest
      that the addition of cetuximab to a 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin-based regimen (FOLFOX) used in the
      1st line setting may lead to the development of more treatment options for subjects with
      advanced colorectal cancer.

      This is a Phase II, open label, non-randomized study in patients with histologically or
      pathologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV, EGFR+ adenocarcinoma of the colon or
      rectum who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

      Patients will receive a modified FOLFOX 6 regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) every 2
      weeks in combination with cetuximab given weekly.

      Patients will be evaluated for response and progression-free survival. Overall survival will
      also be evaluated, as well as the safety profile of the regimen.
