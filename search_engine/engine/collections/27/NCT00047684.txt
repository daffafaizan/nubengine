      components. In this study, BIT is used to encourage women to focus on current issues and
      problems. The BIT therapist will help patients identify the impact of PTSD on their
      functioning, help them identify effective coping strategies for dealing with trauma-related
      distress, and encourage them to establish and maintain a certain degree of independence from
      the therapist.

      Patients receive 15 weekly sessions of BIT. Assessments occur pre-treatment, post-treatment,
      and at a 3-month follow-up, and include self-report measures, clinician administered PTSD
      scale questions, interviews, and evaluations of lifetime stressors.
