      Data. The results were published accordingly.The algorithm is implemented in the commercial
      App Preventicus Heartbeats. DETECT AF is designed as prospective follow up trial.

      Study design Prospective, blinded, multicenter international trial.

      Methods

      The subjects will be asked to position a smartphone on their index finger to allow their
      pulse curve to be recorded for five minutes. At the same time, an ecg will be recorded using
      an digital mobile ecg recorder as a reference.

      Data will be collected on person-related information, comorbidities and medication (estimated
      overall duration/patient <20 min). No follow-up is planned. Analogous to predecessor studies,
      the pulse wave curve data are coded with the patient's identification number (ID) and
      externally analyzed at Preventicus; based on the results, the subjects will be assigned to
      SR/AF groups. After evaluation of all files, the grouped results will be aggregated,
      unblinded and evaluated under monitoring.

      Primary target parameters are the app's sensitivity and specificity in correctly detecting
      atrial fibrillation compared to an automatically interpreted ECG.

      Secondary target parameters include the proportion of non-evaluable recordings in the overall
      study.
