      in pediatric ventricular septal defect (VSD) cases before and after transcatheter closure
      will enlighten us in terms of cardiac autonomic control.

      Methods: 19 VSD cases treated with transcatheter closure method and 18 healthy children were
      enrolled in the study. 24 hours Holter rhythm monitorization was applied to all patients
      before closure of VSD and to the control group. In the patient group, Holter rhythm
      monitorization was repeated in the third months. HRV parameters were obtained from Cardio
      Scan Premier 12Â® program. Frequency domain (Total power, VLF, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio) and time
      domain analysis (SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi, pNN50, rMSSD) were applied.
