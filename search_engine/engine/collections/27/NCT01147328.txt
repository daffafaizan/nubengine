      providers to electronically access and view community-wide clinical information for their
      patients, which has the potential to improve quality of care and reduce health care costs by
      providing timely and complete health information at the point of care. However, few empirical
      studies have been conducted to evaluate the economic effects of this technology. Along with
      other stakeholders, New York State is funding regional health information organizations
      (RHIOs) to deploy a virtual health record (VHR), which is technology that enables providers
      to electronically access community-wide clinical data for patients who have consented to have
      their clinical data accessed via a web portal. RHIOs bring together multiple stakeholders,
      including physician practices, hospitals, pharmacies, and laboratories, for the purpose of
      exchanging clinical information electronically across communities. The investigators will
      conduct a multi-RHIO retrospective pre-post, cohort study of adult patients who have
      consented to have their clinical data viewed by their providers using the VHR portal.
      Examining the effects of electronically accessing clinical data on healthcare utilization
      across multiple settings and communities can help inform the national health IT initiative
      that is underway and allow assessment of the economic value of these technologies.
