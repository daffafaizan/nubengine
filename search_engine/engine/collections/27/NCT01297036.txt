      crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of a newly developed formulation with a conventional formulation in healthy
      subjects.

      For this, a single-center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, 2-way crossover study with a
      21-day washout period was conducted in 22 healthy volunteers. Plasma samples for the analysis
      of donepezil were collected up to 240 h after drug administration. Participants received
      either reference or test drug formulation of 10 mg donepezil in the first period and the
      alternative formulation in the second period. Plasma concentrations of donepezil were
      determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
      spectrometry detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax and AUC, were determined
      by noncompartmental analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using
      log-transformed Cmax and AUC, and the mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals (CI)
      were calculated. According to regulatory requirements set forth by Korea and the US Food and
      Drug Administration, products meet the criteria for bioequivalence if the 90% CIs of the mean
      ratios for Cmax and AUC are within the range of 0.80 to 1.25.
