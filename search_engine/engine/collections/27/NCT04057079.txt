      dissection, bleeding was controlled and either Anugel or the gelatine sponge (SpongostanTM)
      is inserted in to the rectum as determined by patient allocation.

      The patients were monitored post operation and 5 days following the surgery. Pain was
      measured using the VAS scale and use of pain medication was monitored.
