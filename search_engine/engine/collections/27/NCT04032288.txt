      lung inflammation with increased vascular permeability and characterized by three clinical
      features: bilateral radiographic infiltrates; a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200 mmHg or less,
      regardless of the level of PEEP and no clinical evidence for an elevated left atrial
      pressure. If measured, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 18 mmHg or less. In 1994,
      the American-European Consensus Conference on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      issued the above definitions that have been widely used by clinicians and researchers (1, 2)
      When patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an age-adjusted incidence of
      64 per 100,000 person-years and a mortality of 41 percent were detected. Within intensive
      care units, approximately ten to 15 percent of admitted patients and up to 20 percent of
      mechanically ventilated patients meet criteria for ARDS (3-6). The mortality rate varies on
      the basis of the underlying cause, with most patients dying of multi-organ system failure
      rather than isolated respiratory insufficiency (5, 7). Large trials suggest that the overall
      mortality of ARDS ranges from 26 to 58 percent (8, 9). The better outcomes always came from
      tertiary medical centers or big clinical trials, which somewhat might conceal the fact of
      presence of higher mortality. The mortality rate in our hospital ever reached or even up to
      67.2%(10). To improve the quality of care in ARDS patients still has a long way to. We hope
      to establish a prospective registration system to understand the real status of quality of
      care first, and then quality improvement interventions will be followed.
