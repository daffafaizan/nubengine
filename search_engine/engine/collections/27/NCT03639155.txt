    
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period crossover study in healthy adults
      to assess the bioequivalence of a test formulation of vadadustat compared to the reference
      formulation of vadadustat. Blood samples for vadadustat PK will be collected at pre-dose (0
      hour) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, and 48 hours post-dose.
