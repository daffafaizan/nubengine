      at least 2 months with no decrease in the rate of objective clinical response OR an
      improvement by at least 15% in the rate of objective clinical response with no decrease in
      the median time to disease progression in patients with stage III or IV melanoma receiving
      dacarbazine with Allovectin-7 when compared with patients receiving dacarbazine alone.

      II. Determine the benefits, risks, and side effects of these regimens in this patient
      population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according
      to sex, age, and spread of disease (cutaneous or nodal vs visceral disease). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive dacarbazine IV over 1 hour on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive
      treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive Allovectin-7 intratumorally on days 3 and 10.

      Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional courses every 28 days.

      Patients are followed every 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 280 patients (140 in each arm) will be accrued for this study.
