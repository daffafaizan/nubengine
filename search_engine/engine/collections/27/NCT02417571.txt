      more optimal BP control and thereby would influence positively on renal progression and CV
      outcomes.

      In detail, when the eligibility criteria is met, all the subjects will undergo both
      ambulatory BP and office BP measurement at baseline.

      After randomization, ARB (fimasartan) will be administered to drug-naive subjects or will
      replace the other RAS blockers in subjects with current uses. Dosing of fimasartan will be
      adjusted or additional drugs of other classes will be added sequentially over 3 months
      (titration phase).

      At 3 months, ABPM will be performed in ABPM group to evaluate the adequacy of blood pressure
      control and dosing will be adjusted according to the ABPM results (target BP: daytime BP <
      135/85 mm Hg). This adjustment will be assessed at 6 months by ABPM once again.

      For subjects in office BP group, conventional care will be provided according to current
      guidelines (target BP < 140/90 mm Hg).

      At 18 months, ABPM will be performed in all the subjects and outcome measures will be
      assessed.
