    
      400 patients will be recruited for the study,Informed consent will be obtained from all
      patients following the research criteria once they are admitted in active labor, but they
      will be enrolled and randomized only when they reach the second stage of labor (fully dilated
      cervix) as it will be difficult in this stage to counsel patients.

      The recruited patients will be subjected to the following:

        -  History taking: with particular emphasis on past medical history (especially for
           bleeding tendency), past obstetric history.

        -  Checking vital signs, General and abdominal examination.

        -  laboratory investigations: complete blood count (CBC)

        -  Findings of the initial obstetric evaluation follow up, labor duration and the need for
           oxytocin augmentation will be recorded through a partogram.

        -  All deliveries will be attended by a senior resident in the hospital.

        -  Included patients will receive the medication according to randomization tables.

        -  After allocation, patients will be excluded only if they required cesarean section,
           instrumental delivery or had multiple or deep vaginal tears that compromise estimation
           of uterine blood loss.

        -  All patients will undergo gentle traction to the umbilical cord while providing counter
           traction against the uterine fundus after signs of placental separation; appearance of
           bleeding, elongation of the cord.

        -  All patients will undergo cord clamping and cutting within 30 seconds of delivery.

        -  All patients will undergo uterine massage for 30 seconds after placental delivery.

        -  Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) will be checked 15 minutes, 1 hour and 6 hours
           after placental delivery.

        -  CBC will be collected 6 hours after delivery.
