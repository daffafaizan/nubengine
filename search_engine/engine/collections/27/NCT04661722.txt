      patients over 18 years of age who present to the emergency department with chest pain will be
      included in the study. Patients who do not consent to participate in the study due to chest
      pain such as ST elevation myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism
      and esophageal rupture will be excluded from the study. Vital signs of the patients,
      background information, the nature of the pain, the drugs used will be recorded. Blood tests
      and electrocardiogram will be recorded. Heart Score, TIMI, GRACE score will be calculated.
      Shock index and lactate value will also be included in the heart score. Shock index 0.5-0.7 =
      0 points, 0.71-1 = 1 point and above 1 will be cal-culated as 2 points. Lactate levels 0-2
      mEq/L =0 points, between 2,1-3,99 mEq/L= 1 point, above 4 mEq/L levels will be calculated 2
      points. These points will be added to the Heart Score and will be named HEARTSIL. Patients
      will be followed in terms of major cardiac events (MACE) for 3 days and 1 month. Prog-nostic
      performance of HEARTSIL Score, Heart Score, GRACE, TIMI scores that the investigators
      developed will be compared.

      The data will be uploaded to the database for statistics. First of all, whether the data is
      normally distributed or not will be determined. Student-t for normally distributed data,
      Mann-witney-u test for data that are not normally distributed, and chi-square will be used
      for comparing categorical data. The ROC curve will be drawn and compared in determining the
      prognostic performance of scoring systems for MACE development. In addition, PPD, NPD, +LR
      and -LR sensitivity and spe-cificities will be calculated. Values with a p value below 0.05
      will be considered statistically signifi-cant.
