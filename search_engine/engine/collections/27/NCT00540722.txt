      I. To estimate the overall survival rate associated with AT-101 in treating adult patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess and estimate the acute and late toxicities. II. Tumor response rate. III. To
      estimate 6-month progression free survival. IV. To explore associations of the clinical
      outcome (overall survival) among the changes of potential serum biomarkers, baseline tumor
      protein expression and gene methylation status.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during
      study for biomarker correlative studies. Archived tumor tissue samples, if available, are
      analyzed for Bcl-2 family protein expression (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, MCl-1, Bax, Bak, and BH3
      domain for BH3 members only) and 06-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene
      methylation status. Blood samples are analyzed for apoptotic protein levels (Bcl-2) by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months.
