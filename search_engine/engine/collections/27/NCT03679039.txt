      metastasas which significantly reduce the survival. However, the majority of the patients
      cannot receive liver lesions resection resulting from the size, number and bad location.
      Conversion therapy can improve the resection rate of these patients. Unfortunately, the
      efficacy of conversion therapy is still poor in part of the patients. So, it is crucial to
      distinguish the beneficial ones from the others.

      The aim of this single center study is to establish a model for predicting the efficacy of
      conversion therapy for the patients with unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer
      based on the detection of 5-hmC. Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they suffer with
      unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer and have not received any anti-tumor
      treatment. Eligible patients will be assigned to effective group (group A) and drug
      resistance group (group B) according to the evaluation results of multidisciplinary team
      after 4-8 cycles of conversion therapy about 2-4 months.

      Then, 5-hmC in plasma cell-free DNA will be detected and compared between the two groups of
      patients (training group) to establish a model to predict the efficacy of convertion therapy
      of other individuals (validation group) who suffer with unresectable liver metastases of
      colorectal cancer receiving conversion therapy.
