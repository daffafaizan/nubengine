      using static two-point discrimination (2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) testing
      at final follow-up. The cold intolerance of the injured finger is measured using the
      self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire that was rated into mild,
      moderate, severe, and extreme (0-25, 26-50, 51-75 and 76-100). The pain of the injured finger
      is given subjectively by the patient using a grading system that included grade 1, none;
      grade 2, mild, no interference with daily activities; grade 3, moderate, patient works but
      has some limitation in use of the hand because of pain; and grade 4, severe, cannot work or
      use hand. To sum up, patients report their satisfaction with functional recovery of the
      injured finger according to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that was based on a
      5-point response scale.
