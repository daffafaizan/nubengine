      deficits together with willing and able administrators (As) to administer tACS to the
      participants. This study will include 20 older Ps and 20 As to assess the feasibility of
      deploying home-based tACS in larger clinical trials, and to prepare for the development and
      implementation of such trials. The proposed project will systematically examine the
      feasibility of remote, caregiver-led tACS for older adults who are vulnerable to memory
      decline. This study will provide data to support the safety and effectiveness of home-based
      tACS in this population and will lead to future research to increase access of tACS as a part
      of memory decline prevention and treatment for older adults who have more difficulty reaching
      a clinic for treatment due to disability or who live more remotely.
