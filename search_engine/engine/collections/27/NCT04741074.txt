      contraindications though there is great variability for exact BMI (35-45 kg/m2) and A1c
      (9-10%) thresholds for listing by center. Glucagon-lowering peptide-1 receptor agonists
      (GLP-1 RAs) offer great promise in this population as they have been shown to reduce weight,
      central adiposity, A1c, and risk of cardiovascular outcomes with similar effects in patients
      with and without CKD.

      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial, the investigators will
      evaluate the effect of subcutaneous semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml (up to 1.0 mg per week) in
      combination with lifestyle counseling in patients with T2DM, overweight/obesity, and stage
      4-5 CKD or dialysis-dependent ESKD on patients' eligibility for kidney transplantation in
      terms of diabetes control (A1c <9%) and obesity (BMI <35 kg/m2 or 35-40 kg/m2 with waist
      circumference <120 cm) at the end of 9 months.
