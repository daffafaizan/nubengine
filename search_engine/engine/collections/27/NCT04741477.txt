      conducted in 5 discrete stages, one for each product. In each stage, participants (N=20),
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 double-blind drug conditions that entail the use of: 1) a
      topical product that contains CBD and a low amount of THC (N=15), or 2) a placebo topical
      product that does not contain cannabinoids (N=5), but which contains similar non-cannabinoid
      ingredients to the active product. Thus, overall 100 participants will complete the study (75
      active, 25 placebo).

      Participants in each stage will complete a three-phase outpatient protocol that will last a
      total of 17 days. Phase 1 (Day 1) will be an acute laboratory dosing session (approximately 7
      hours in duration). Phase 2 (Days 2-10) will be an outpatient dosing period, during which
      participants will continue to use participants' assigned product twice daily (morning and
      evening) in participants' own environment. During Phase 2, participants will visit the
      laboratory for brief study sessions on Days 2, 3, 7, and 10. Phase 3, will consist of a final
      follow-up visit on Day 17, after a 1-week drug washout. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      assessments (subjective and cognitive effects) will be assessed during each phase.
