      African Americans and men with rheumatoid arthritis and there are identifiable genetic and
      environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of bone loss in these groups.

      The Specific Aims of the study are to:

        1. Determine baseline hip and lumbar spine bone density (BMD) values and
           osteopenia/osteoporosis prevalence among African American men and women with early RA
           and among male veterans with established RA.

        2. Identify environmental factors and candidate alleles, which confer increased risk of
           reduced baseline BMD loss over time among African American men and women with early RA
           and among male veterans with established RA.
