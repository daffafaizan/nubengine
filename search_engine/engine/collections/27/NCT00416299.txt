      pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), ischemia-modified albumin (IMA),
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), metalloproteinase (MMP) soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD40L), and
      inflammatory cytokine levels will be measured in 100 elderly patients undergoing elective
      cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass before induction of anesthesia and 12 h, 24 h,
      and 48 h after surgery. Optimum discriminators for prediction of postoperative cardiovascular
      complications wil be determined by the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves
      analyses.
