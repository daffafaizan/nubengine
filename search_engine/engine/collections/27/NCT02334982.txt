      and well-tolerated dose. This study looked at safety (lab results and side effects) and
      pharmacokinetic properties (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) in
      people who took TAK-137. This study was designed as a single ascending 6 Cohort dose study
      with planned doses of 2, 5, 15, 50, and 100 mg and Cohort 6 dose to be determined if the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. Anticipated enrollment was 48.

      This study enrolled 47 participants and consisted of 6 Cohorts. Participants in Cohorts 1, 2,
      3, 5 and 6 were randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-137 or placebo after a 10-hour
      fast. Participants in Cohort 4 were randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-137 or placebo
      under fasted conditions, followed by a single dose of TAK-137 or placebo under fed conditions
      14 days later. Participants in cohort 4 will receive the same dose in both fasted and fed
      conditions. The starting dose was 2 mg followed by administrations of 5, 10, 0.5 and 20 mg.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. For Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6
      the overall time to participate in this study was up to 42 days. Participants made 4 visits
      to the clinic including one 5-day period of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by
      telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

      For Cohort 4 the overall time to participate in this study was up to 56 days. Participants
      made 7 visits to the clinic including two 5-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and
      were contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
