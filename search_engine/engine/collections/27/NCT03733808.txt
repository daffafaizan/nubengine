    
      Gambling disorder (GD) is a progressive and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling
      behavior, leading to impaired functioning.

      GD has been recategorized from an impulse control disorder to an addiction-related disorder
      in the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental (DSM-5) reflecting the
      growing evidence of the substantially overlapping between the neurobiology of GD and
      substance use disorders (SUDs). Both GD and SUDs are characterized by malfunction in reward,
      stress and cognitive-control circuits, which underlie manifestations such as compulsive
      gambling or compulsive drug consumption, craving, altered reward sensitivity, impaired
      self-control and decision-making processes. Particularly, similar alterations in
      cortico-limbic-striatal and prefrontal control circuits have been shown associated to the
      emergence of drug cravings and gambling urges. Hence, craving might be seen as a core
      component across addictions. Indeed, identifying and targeting the neurocircuit alterations
      underlying craving, may allow to treat this feature across different addictions with similar
      strategies.

      In this regard, High frequency (HF) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC), is a promising approach for modulating
      brain circuits underlying cue-induced craving. Since alterations in these circuits have been
      shown to underlie the emergence of gambling urges, HF rTMS may represent a potential
      treatment also for GD patients.

      Thus, the main goals of this clinical trial are to 1) assess whether HF rTMS over l-DLPFC
      reduces urges to gamble and problem behaviors gambling related; 2) investigate whether rTMS
      induces hemodynamics changes in DLPFC activity in response to specific tasks that elicit such
      areas as visual stimuli associated with gambling; 3) assess whether rTMS induces improvements
      in decision making processes of GD patients; and 4) evaluate the effects of HF rTMS over
      l-DLPFC on resting functional connectivity, focusing mainly in connectivity changes of
      cortical and subcortical regions involved in this disorder.
