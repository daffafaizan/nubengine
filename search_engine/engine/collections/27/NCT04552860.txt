    
      For this pilot, vEAET will be provided to outpatient Veterans age 60-95 years with chronic
      MSK pain in order to obtain early implementation and clinical outcomes (i.e. acceptability,
      feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and effectiveness). Each Veteran will be provided a
      VTC capable tablet and technological support from a research coordinator as a strategy to
      overcome technology based obstacles and obtain feasibility data. Veterans will receive one
      90-minute individual session of vEAET plus eight 90-minute weekly group sessions of vEAET,
      all delivered over VTC to their homes. Assessments will be performed at baseline,
      posttreatment, and 2-month follow-up remotely using OutcomeMD (Los Angeles, CA), a
      HIPAA-compliant, VA-approved web-based platform. The entire study will be performed without
      any in-person visits.
