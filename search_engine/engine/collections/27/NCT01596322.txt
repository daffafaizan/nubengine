      one of the best established multi-disciplinary HIV antiretroviral treatment cohorts in rural
      Africa. The investigators will advance our theoretical understanding of HIV antiretroviral
      adherence behavior, HIV pathogenesis, and to address the monitoring and prevention of HIV
      antiretroviral treatment failure. Based on a successful pilot study in rural Uganda and
      favorable cost-effective estimates, the investigators will deploy the Wisepill real-time
      wireless adherence monitoring system to objectively monitor adherence in real time. The
      investigators will determine to what extent social capital mitigates economic barriers to
      long-term adherence and determine if the pervasive impact of stigma on adherence operates
      through social capital (Aim 1). The investigators will determine the relationship between
      missed doses, low-level viremia (between 1 and 50 copies RNA/mL), inflammation, bacterial
      translocation, suboptimal CD4 response, and mortality (Aim 2). Finally, The investigators
      will examine the relationship between complex adherence patterns and viral failure to both
      inform selective viral load monitoring and to lay the foundation for the first-of-kind
      intervention to prevent viral failure after missed doses, but before viral rebound (Aim 3).
      The investigators will secure behavioral and biologic data over nine years of potential
      treatment by recruiting 500 additional people to our existing cohort in Mbarara, Uganda for a
      total of 750 participants.
