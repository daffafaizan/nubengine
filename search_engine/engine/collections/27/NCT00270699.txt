      syndrome. More than 2 billion people living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world
      are at risk of dengue virus infection, which is the leading cause of hospitalization and
      death in children in several tropical Asian countries. This study will evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine called rDEN4delta30-200,201.
      This vaccine is derived from rDEN4delta30, another dengue virus vaccine candidate that has
      been shown to be safe and immunogenic in Phase I and II trials in healthy adults.

      This study will last 180 days. There will be three cohorts in this dose de-escalation study.
      Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to receive the highest dose of
      rDEN4delta30-200,201 or placebo at study entry. Cohort 2 will begin only after safety review
      of all participants in Cohort 1. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a lower dose of
      rDEN4delta30-200,201 or placebo. Cohort 3 will begin only after safety review of all
      participants in Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 3 will receive the lowest dose of
      rDEN4delta30-200,201 or placebo.

      After vaccination, participants will be asked to monitor their temperatures every day for 16
      days. Study visits will occur every other day after vaccination until Day 16, followed by
      four additional visits at selected days through Day 180. Blood collection, vital signs
      measurement, and a targeted physical exam will occur at each study visit. Some participants
      will be asked to undergo a skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.
