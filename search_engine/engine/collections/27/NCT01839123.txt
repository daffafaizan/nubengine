      significantly impact an amputee's limb health. If the prosthesis is not held securely to the
      amputee's limb, relative movement between the limb and prosthetic interface can cause
      bruising, skin irritation and skin breakdown. These poor outcomes are uncomfortable and can
      lead to much more serious health conditions. A positive solution to creating secure and
      comfortable suspension is the use of a vacuum suspension socket. The vacuum pressure assists
      in preventing movement in the socket. The clinical benefits associated with vacuum suspension
      include volume retention, increased proprioception, secure suspension, and frequently
      reported observations of wound healing. However, the long term effects of vacuum suspension
      on circulation remain undetermined or undocumented.

      This study examines a vacuum suspension system on the health of the residual limb (amputated
      limb). A vacuum socket creates a vacuum between the rigid prosthetic socket and prosthetic
      liner which is sealed to the socket. Therefore, vacuum is not directly applied to the skin of
      the residual limb.
