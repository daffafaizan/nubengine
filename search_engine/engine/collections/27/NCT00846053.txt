      our group suggests that labeled fluorodeoxyglocose-based positron emission tomography
      (FDG-PET) imaging may be a valuable quantitative biomarker of lung inflammation. The proposed
      study would validate our earlier findings, but in a younger patient population. The
      implications of such a test could be highly significant for both the testing of promising new
      anti-inflammatory agents and for patient management decisions. To capitalize on this exciting
      opportunity, the critical next step is to show that we can identify a cohort of young CF
      patients with both stable lung function and normal (or near normal) FDG-PET imaging studies.
      Similar patients, then, would become the subjects for a future prospective cohort study to
      determine if FDG-PET imaging can in fact serve as a predictor of future changes in lung
      function.
