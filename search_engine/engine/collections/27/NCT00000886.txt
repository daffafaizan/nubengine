      loop shared by approximately 80% of North American HIV-1 strains. Because of the critical
      role that this region plays in generating anti-HIV sequences, it is hypothesized that the
      test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) will be capable of inducing a broad range of cross-reactive
      neutralizing antibodies in the majority of recipients.

      Twenty-eight volunteers are randomized to receive two 0.5 ml injections of C4-43 peptides in
      IFA or placebo (IFA alone) administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months. At least
      50% of all volunteers (6 per Groups I and II; 2, Group III) must be HLA-B7 phenotype.
