      the disease,severity of the disease based on Osserman's classification, antiacetylcholine
      receptor (AChR) antibody positivity, preoperative drug therapy, history of preoperative
      myasthenic crisis, technique of anesthesia, drugs used for anesthesia, perioperative
      complications, and duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation. Even though the MG
      classification by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America is widely accepted,disease
      severity was graded according to the Osserman and Genkins classification preoperatively as
      per the authors' institutional protocol.
