      Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer
      deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis
      for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is
      limited. The study will test carboplatin in combination with a newly approved drug called
      cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab
      is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It
      is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR.

      Rationale:

      The present study is built upon the data from the described studies, incorporating cetuximab
      into a regimen of single-agent carboplatin. Previous data suggest that single agent
      carboplatin is active in NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent
      cetuximab to carboplatin will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping
      toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.

      Research Hypothesis:

      The population being studied in this trial is subjects with previously untreated Stage IIIB
      or IV NSCLC. The research hypothesis is that these subjects will achieve a response (based on
      RECIST criteria) to therapy with the combination of carboplatin and cetuximab.
