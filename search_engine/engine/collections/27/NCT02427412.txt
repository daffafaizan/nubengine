      significant effect on reducing blood loss following knee replacement. A few studies more
      shown a similar effect of intraarticular (IA) injected Tranexamic acid into the knee joint at
      the end of surgery for knee replacement.

      In this study investigators therefore investigate the possible combined effect of added
      intraarticular tranexamic acid to conventional intravenous Tranexamic acid.
