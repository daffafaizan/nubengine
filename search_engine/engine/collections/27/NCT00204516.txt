    
      vaccination protocol to induce clinically specific immune responses against melanoma
      associated antigens by intradermal injections of mRNA coding for the corresponding antigens.
      Half of patients is treated with mRNA coding for Melan-A, Mage-A1, Mage-A3, Survivin, GP100
      and Tyrosinase. The other half of patients is treated with an individualized selection of
      mRNAs after analysis of overexpressed melanoma antigens in autologous tumor tissue. GM-CSF is
      used as an adjuvants. Phase I/II clinical trial to analyse safety and immune responses in
      stage III/IV melanoma patients.
