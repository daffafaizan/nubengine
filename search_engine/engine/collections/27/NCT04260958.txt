    
      Due to the covid-19 pandemic, this study will be performed in two steps:

      1). National feasibility and safety study. 2). National multicenter registry-based cluster
      randomized crossover clinical trial (RRCT).

        1. In the feasibility study, patients will be offered remote exCR at all participating
           sites until the peak of the pandemic has been achieved and care goes back to normal. We
           estimate that the feasibility study will include patients during 2021. The experiences
           from the feasibility study will guide the detailed design of the R-RCT (part 2).

        2. CR centers (not patients) will be cluster randomized to either the intervention or
           control. Patients at intervention centers will be offered remote exCR or usual care
           centre-based exCR, as self-preferred choice. At control centers, patients will be
           offered usual care centre-based exCR only. The duration of each time period for each
           center will be approximately 12-15 months (depending on results from the feasibility
           study). The first period will take place approximately Q1 2022 - Q2 2023, then centers
           cross-over from intervention to control or the other way around to the second time
           period Q3 2023 - Q4 2024. The recruitment will be stopped when 1500 patients are
           enrolled. Long-term follow-up will be performed 1 year and 3 years after the index
           cardiac event.
