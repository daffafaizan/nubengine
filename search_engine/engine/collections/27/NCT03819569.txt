    
      Primary Objective

        1. To compare the decisional conflict between patients who undergo renal mass biopsy during
           their evaluation for SRMs versus those who do not.

        2. To validate the concordance of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and genomic-based risk
           stratification molecular biomarkers between renal biopsy tissue and surgical
           (nephrectomy) specimen tissue.

      Secondary objective

      1. To characterize the impact of biopsy on patient reported anxiety and uncertainty,
      assessment of cancer care communication, and satisfaction with cancer care.
