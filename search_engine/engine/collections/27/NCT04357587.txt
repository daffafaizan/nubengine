    
      This study investigates the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of Pembrolizumab, an
      immunotherapy agent, in combination with SOC radiation and Capecitabine (or 5-Fluorouacil) in
      treatment of patients with mismatch repair deficient locally advanced rectal cancer.
      Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by enhancing the
      functional activity of the target lymphocytes (immune cells) to facilitate tumor regression
      and ultimately immune rejection. Pembrolizumab in combination with radiation and Capcitabine
      (or 5-Fluorouacil) is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for this specific indication.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility
      of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with capectiabine (or 5-Fluorouracil ) in the
      treatment of patients with MMR-d locally advanced rectal cancer

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the treatment response in MMR-d rectal
      cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and Pembrolizumab.
