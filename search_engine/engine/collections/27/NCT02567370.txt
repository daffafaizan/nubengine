    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of single-ascending oral doses of AMG 581 in healthy subjects and subjects diagnosed
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving antipsychotic treatment.

      This will be a placebo-controlled, single-ascending oral-dose study of AMG 581 with a
      food-effect cohort. Approximately 70 subjects will be enrolled. This study will enroll
      healthy subjects into 8 cohorts (Cohorts 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 and 9), and subjects with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving antipsychotic medication into a single
      cohort (Cohort 7).
