      circulatory failure but it present some limits due to poor echogenicity of patients,
      operator-dependent variability and cannot provide continuous hemodynamic data. TPTD is an
      invasive technique for CO monitoring recommended especially in shock not responsive to
      initial therapy.

      Few studies have evaluated the level of agreement of each method (TTE and TPTD) with the
      reference method (pulmonary artery catheter) but they have never been compared between them
      with strong statistical analysis in particular trending ability.

      It could be interesting to determine the level of concordance of these two methods of CO
      monitoring and trend ability by TPTD relative to TTE.

      The investigators hypothesize that CO-TPTD are concordant with those performed by TTE.

      Mechanically ventilated patients requiring hemodynamic assessment will be included. CO-TPTD
      will be measured via intermittent thermodilution. Blindly, a second investigator will use
      standard-view TTE to estimate CO-TTE as the product of stroke volume and the heart rate
      obtained during the measurement the blood flow velocity (using a Doppler technique) at the
      left ventricular outflow tract. A second measurement will be done with the two devices after
      a fluid challenge when patient requires it to compare trending ability.
