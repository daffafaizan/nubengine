        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced or metastatic sarcoma treated with
           bortezomib.

        -  Correlate levels of cyclins D1, E, p21 (WAF1), p27 (Kip1), mdm^2, p53, and Ki67 with
           response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease (stratum I: soft tissue sarcoma not specified in stratum II, osteogenic sarcoma
      arising from soft tissues, or gastrointestinal stromal tumor vs stratum II: Ewing's sarcoma
      of soft tissue or bone, rhabdomyosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma of bone). (Stratum I closed
      to accrual as of 10/17/03.)

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for stratum I within 5-11 months
      and 21-41 patients will be accrued for stratum II within 10.5-22 months. (Stratum I closed to
      accrual as of 10/17/03.)
