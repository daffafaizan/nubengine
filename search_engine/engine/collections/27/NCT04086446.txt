      in treatment of drug-naïve OCD patients. 60 drug-naïve OCD patients will be randomized into
      two groups (i.e. active or sham stimulation). tDCS stimulation will be performed once a day,
      five times a week, for two weeks. The investigators will assess symptom severity before and
      after two weeks of tDCS. Through the study, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）,
      the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II
      (BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Pittsburgh sleep
      quality index (PSQI)and side-effect questionnaire will be obtained by a trained investigator.
      The patients will also receive MRI scan and TMS-EEG.
