      mental health among patients with severe mental illness. Findings on Chinese adults regarding
      this issue are limited. Thus, we aim to assess the lifestyle intervention on life quality and
      mental health among overweight adults with severe mental illness in Shenzhen, China.

      A total of 210 overweight adults with severe mental illness will be randomly allocated to two
      groups. Participants in the intervention groups will receive a 10-month lifestyle
      intervention while the control group will be waitlisted.

      In the intervention group, participants will receive lifestyle education delivered by trained
      staffs from Wuhan university. The main objective of the lifestyle education is to raise
      participants' awareness regarding the health complications related to obesity and
      subsequently to promote weight loss through behavioural modifications. Participants will be
      advised to reduce energy intake by having three main meals and avoiding snacks; limiting
      intake of sugary food and beverages as well as fried and fatty foods; increasing intake of
      fruits and vegetables, etc. They will be asked to increase physical activity, aiming for a
      minimum 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week and/or 10,000 steps per day.

      Outcome measurement include height, weight, blood pressure, dietary habits, sleep, physical
      activity, life quality, and mental health that will be measured by a group of trained
      investigator for all participants.
