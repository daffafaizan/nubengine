      trial of once-monthly vitamin D oral capsules (50,000 units) in nursing-home residents.

      Subjects from several Wisconsin nursing homes were randomized to receive once-monthly vitamin
      D oral capsules (50,000 units) or placebo. Blood levels of 25-OH D, parathyroid hormone,
      serum calcium, and a marker of bone turnover will be measured periodically by standard lab
      assays. Swallowing quality of life was measured by questionnaire. Appropriate statistical
      tests (paired T tests, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated with the large sample
      approximation for binomial variables, other).
