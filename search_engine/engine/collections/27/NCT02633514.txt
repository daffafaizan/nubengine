      OS and chemotherapy is playing an increasing role in treatment of patients with thymoma or
      thymic carcinoma.However,whether patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma could benefit from
      adjuvant radiochemotherapy after incomplete resection remains controversial. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate whether adjuvant radiochemotherapy after incomplete resection
      can improve survival for thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
