      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are a growing public-health concern with devastating
      effects.

      Referring to animal data, empirical studies, and pilot human trials, exercise should improve
      cognitive functions such as learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, the researchers
      study general brain functions in elderly subjects (50-80 years old) with impaired glucose
      tolerance during a short term exercise program.
