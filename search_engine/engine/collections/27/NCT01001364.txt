      and formoterol as individual capsules with inhalation powder for the pulmonary function of
      subjects with persistent asthma. This is a non-inferiority study, which hypothesis is that
      there is no difference on the pulmonary function measure between the groups studied at its
      end. Therefore, the study primary endpoint will be the forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1) at the final visit (FV) at each study arm.

      This study secondary objective is to compare the impact on the clinical control of two
      products containing budesonide and formoterol as individual capsules with inhalation powder
      in subjects with persistent asthma.

      The secondary endpoints considered for this study are:

        -  Score of asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-7) 34 at the end of the study ;

        -  Peak of expiratory flow (PEF) throughout the study;

        -  Symptoms score at the end of the study;

        -  FEV1 throughout the study;

        -  Treatment safety, including serum cortisol dosage;

        -  Frequency of observed adverse events.

      Some eligibility criteria:

        -  Current use of inhaled corticosteroids (equivalent to beclometasone dipropionate 1000µg)
           associated or not to long-acting β2-adrenergics and relief medication (salbutamol or
           equivalent);

        -  Diagnosis of mild to moderate persistent asthma, as per the ARIA classification, 35 with
           symptoms for at least 6 months, clinically stable for at least 1 month with ACQ-7 test34
           (see Attachment D) < 3.0;
