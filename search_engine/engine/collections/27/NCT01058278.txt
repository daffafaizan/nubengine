      glaucoma. A There is however a controversy regarding the use of drops post-treatment. Indeed,
      some would prefer not to pharmacologically modulate the post-op inflammatory response which
      can be an integral part of the treatment by favouring the mobilisation of the macrophages
      which participate to the trabeculae "cleaning". Others will prefer to calm the inflammatory
      reaction and choose an anti-inflammatory drug (either steroidal or non-steroidal).
