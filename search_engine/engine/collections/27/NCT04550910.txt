    
      166 patients of breast cancer patients after mastectomy ( 83 patients in each arm ) will be
      randomize into 2 hypofractionation arms : Arm A: 40 Gy /15 fx / 3 weeks, 5 days per week .
      Arm B: 28.5 Gy delivered in 5 once-weekly fractions of 5.7 Gy each week.

      Simulation:

      Patient will be simulated on CT simulator using breast wedge with angle. Serials will be
      taken every 2 mm from upper neck down to mid abdomen.

      Contouring:

      CTVcw, CTVRNI will be contoured through RTOG guidelines . PTV is added as 0.5 cm all around
      CTV. Lungs, Heart, brachial plexus, spinal cord, esophageus and thyroid will be contoured as
      OAR. (www.rtog.org/CoreLab/ContouringAtlases/BreastCancerAtlas.aspx).

      D)Dose Constraints:

      Arm A:

      PTV EVAL ( CW) : V90 % ≥ 90 %. - V105 % ≤ 5% - V107%≤ 3 %. Ipsilateral lung: V20 less than
      20-25% - V 8 less than 35%- Contra lateral lung: V4 less 10 %. Heart: V16 less than 5% (Lt
      sided). V20 less than 5% (Lt sided). V16 is 0%.(Rt sided) V20 is 0% (Rt sided). Mean heart
      dose ≤ 320-400 cGy. Contra lateral breast : D max≤ 240 cGy. V 144 cGy less than 5 %. SCV :
      V90 % ≥ 90 %. Thyroid : Mean dose less than 35 Gy - V30 less than 50 %.

      Arm B:

      PTV EVAL ( CW) : V90 %≥ 90 %. - V105 %≤ 5% - V107%≤ 2 %.

      Ipsilateral lung: V30%less than 15 -20% - V15% less than 30-35% - V5 % less than 50-55%.

      Contra lateral lung : V5 % less than 5%. Heart :V25 % less than 5 % - V5 % less than 30 - 35
      %. Contra lateral breast: V3 % less than 5 %. SCV : V90 % ≥ 90 %.

      Follow up:

      A)Weekly follow up will be done during sessions then regular clinical exam every 3 months to
      assess :

        1. Acute and late toxicity regarding pain, pulmonary toxicity, dysphagia, skin toxicity and
           lymphedema.Assessment will be done according to RTOG and CTCv.5.

        2. Any local (chest wall) recurrence, regional (nodal) recurrence.

      B)Annual Mammogram. C)Any another investigation (once indicated)
