      instructor-led Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise program on the perceived health status
      and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older adults. Through the use of convenience
      sampling strategy, eight community care centers with 232 older adults in Kaohsiung were
      recruited and randomly assigned based on their community care centers to a HBA experimental
      group or a wait-list control group. Participants in the experimental group received the HBA
      exercise program led by trained and certified instructors, three times per week, 40 minutes
      per practice for six months; participants in the wait-list control group continued with their
      regular daily activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, were
      conducted. Phase II: Using the same method as in the phase I, participants from the phase I
      continued practicing the HBA exercise program, but guided by a DVD, for another six months.
      The feasibility, compliance, and effectiveness of the DVD-led HBA exercise program on the
      community-dwelling older adults were tested, and another two post-tests, three months apart,
      were conducted on the same outcome measurements as in the phase I.
