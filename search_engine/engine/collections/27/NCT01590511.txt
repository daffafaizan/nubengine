        -  To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the variation of the velocity time
           integral after administration of 100 cc of normal saline over 1 minute (ΔITV100) to
           predict the response to the filling.

        -  To study the inter-observer variation of ΔITV100 measurement.

        -  To compare ΔITV100 to other clinical and radiological parameters for predicting response
           to filling (initial value of the subaortic velocity time integral, variation in mitral E
           wave, E / A, respiratory variation of the diameter of the inferior vena cava, marbling
           clinical evolution score.
