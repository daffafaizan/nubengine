      Orthopaedic Oncology trained surgeons. The Duke DEDUCE database will be used to identify
      retrospective patients using the above mentioned CPT codes. Individual chart review of the
      electronic medical record will then be used to identify those receiving a proximal femur
      replacement. Maximum number of charts to be reviewed in the study will be 300. Of these 300
      charts, the investigators plan to consent 25 subjects who have return appointments scheduled.
      The investigators also plan to consent 25 preoperative patients, for a total of 50 subjects.
