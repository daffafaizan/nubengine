      children 10 to 17 years of age who have T2DM and are experiencing inadequate glycemic
      control. This study will look at HbA1c fluctuations in children who take alogliptin in
      addition to their background antidiabetic therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 150 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the tablet containing
           alogliptin 25 mg but has no active ingredient (that is, has no alogliptin).

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study in addition to their current background antidiabetic therapy (metformin and/or insulin)
      if applicable.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Brazil, Germany, Italy,
      Poland, Russia, Israel and Mexico. The overall time to participate in this study is
      approximately 56 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
