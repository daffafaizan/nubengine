      tissues like breast or skin. The operator can track the lymphatic pathway without skin
      incision in real time. By these characteristics, indocyanine green is currently used for
      sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer surgery. Indocyanine green can also stain lymph
      nodes beyond the sentinel lymph nodes. This is why we can identify the lymphatic metastasis
      pathway of breast cancer.
