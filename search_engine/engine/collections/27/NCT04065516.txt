      dysfunction of esophageal peristalsis. Peroral endoscopic myotomy for the treatment of
      achalasia has an efficacy above 90%, being comparable with Heller's myotomy. The treatment of
      achalasia by peroral endoscopic myotomy is associated with a higher incidence of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, compared with alternative therapies such as Heller's myotomy
      or pneumatic dilatation. Hybrid argon plasma at the level of the esophagogastric junction
      could generate remodeling of this region generating a partial stenosis and thereby decrease
      the passage of gastric or gastroduodenal content into the esophagus.

      A clinical trial will be carried out, including all patients with achalasia, treated by
      peroral myotomy older than 18 years old, with abnormal acid exposure in the pHmetry test 3
      months or more after treatment, who accept the management of ablation with hybrid argon
      plasma. To whom the ablation will be performed with Hybrid Argon Plasma and its effectiveness
      will be evaluated by clinical questionnaires, endoscopy and pHmetry measurement at the
      beginning, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the procedure.

      Demographic and clinical data will be recorded in a data collection sheet, detailing the
      reflux questionnaire(GERDQ), Eckardt score, endoscopic findings of esophagitis according to
      Los Angeles classification and abnormal acid exposure in each evaluation. The data will be
      condensed into a database for subsequent statistical analysis and publication of results.
