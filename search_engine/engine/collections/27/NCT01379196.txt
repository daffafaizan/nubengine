      cosmetic morbidity and interference with quality of life. The disease has an inflammatory
      stage and a non-inflammatory, fibrotic stage.

      Treatment of inflammatory stage moderate-severe GO includes steroids, as recommended by the
      EUGOGO consortium. However, the length of treatment needed and the risk of steroid
      side-effects may lead to multiple undesired treatment induced morbidity.

      Antibiotics of the macrolide group posses known immune-modulatory effects that are separate
      from their antibacterial mode of action. This mode of action has lead to the routine use of
      macrolide antibiotics for delaying graft rejection following lung transplants.

      We propose to test the effect of this class of antibiotics for non-sight threatening,
      moderate-severe, inflammatory GO.
