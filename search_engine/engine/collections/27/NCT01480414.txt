      ischemic limb of 11 patients with PAD.first of all all the patients evaluate by physical
      examination,PFWD,ABI and serologic tests.then underwent bone marrow aspiration to take
      sample.In our lab the MNC are separated and divided in to equal doses.one of them inject to
      the ischemic foot and the othr one are freezed and inject after 3weeks.3 weeks after second
      injection again patient underwent bone marrow aspiration and the same process repeat.then
      after 4times transplantation,patients are followed up after 1,3,6,9,12 months after injection
      and evaluate by physical examination,PFWD,ABI and serologic tests.all the data are collected
      and analysed and the result will be shown.3 patients underwent cell transplantation just one
      time due to one time bone marrow aspiration.They are followed up after 1,3,6,9,12 months
      after injection and evaluate by physical examination,PFWD,ABI and serologic tests.at the end
