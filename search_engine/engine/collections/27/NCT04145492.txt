      mainly appears in the large and medium size arteries [3, 4]. It seems that vas¬cular
      calcification is caused by dynamic imbal-ance of intravascular calcium and phosphorus.
      However, more and more studies pointed out that vascular calcification were related with
      local cell's function and biological characteris¬tics.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of supplementation of vitamin K2 (menaquinone,
      MK-7) and cholecalciferol (inactive vitamin D) on circulating levels of calcification
      regulators and to assess their safety in pediatric patients on regular hemodialysis patients.
