      potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. This study will look at roflumilast combined
      with a medication called donepezil, and their ability to reverse mimicked Alzheimer's disease
      symptoms that have been brought on by administration of a drug called scopolamine.

      The study will enroll up to 28 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of four treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed
      to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical
      need). All participants will receive the following treatments at varying time points
      throughout the study:

        -  Roflumilast Dose A tablets

        -  Donepezil 10 mg capsules

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet or capsule that looks like the study
           drug but has no active ingredient

        -  Scopolamine 0.5 mg subcutaneous injection.

      All participants will be asked to take 2 tablets and 1 capsule and will receive a scopolamine
      subcutaneous injection on the first day of 4 separate study periods. Participants will then
      be assessed for how the scopolamine affects their mental processes and whether the study drug
      improves this.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in England. The overall time to participate in
      this study is up to 95 days. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, including 4
      separate periods of 2 days confinement to the clinic, and a follow-up assessment 14 days
      after the last treatment period.
