      Interstitial Cystitis (IC) based on sensory testing and to determine if subjects with IC have
      normal counterirritation-related modulatory systems. Previous studies by the PI suggest that
      two populations of subjects are present in the IC population but a larger number of subjects
      with IC would need to be tested in order to determine if this were indeed true. Other studies
      have demonstrated that counterirritation-related effects are absent in several chronic pain
      populations including fibromyalgia and chronic headaches. Identification of a subset of IC
      patients or the identification of a failure of counterirritation-related effects may predict
      responses to therapeutic interventions.
