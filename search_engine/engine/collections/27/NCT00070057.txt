      I. Determine whether celecoxib suppresses aromatase activity in postmenopausal women with
      invasive breast cancer planning to undergo surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate celecoxib-mediated inhibition of aromatase activity with levels of
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and HER-2/neu and estrogen receptor status in these patients.

      II. Determine the effect of this drug on histology, Ki67, RNA expression profile by
      microarray analysis, PI3-K, AKT and ERK1/2 MAP kinase activities, and PGE_2 levels in these
      patients.

      III. Determine whether any observed biological effect of this drug is dose-dependent in these
      patients.

      IV. Identify collateral targets (COX-2-independent) of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 1-3 weeks (according to the duration
      between biopsy and surgery) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive a higher dose of oral celecoxib as in arm I.

      Arm III: Patients do not receive treatment.

      All patients undergo definitive surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients (25 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-3 years.
