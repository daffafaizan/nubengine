      using a sirolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen to a tacrolimus-based regimen in kidney
      transplantation. This study was a prospective open-label trial randomizing patients to
      receive tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone or sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil
      and prednisone. All patients received antithymocyte globulin induction. All rejection
      episodes were proven by biopsy. The hypothesis was that CI free immunosuppression after
      kidney transplantation will lead to an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at one
      year after kidney transplantation.
