        -  To assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant capecitabine and concurrent
           3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with vs without panitumumab in patients with
           advanced K-ras unmutated rectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, T stage (T3 vs T4), tumor localization measured from caudal part of the tumor to the
      anocutaneous line (< 10 cm vs ≥ 10 cm), and number of EGFR gene copies (< 2.9 vs ≥ 2.9).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57
           and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 8-40. Beginning on day 8, patients undergo
           daily fractions of 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning
           approximately 6 weeks after completion of panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy, patients
           undergo surgery.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-33. Patients undergo
           concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning 6 weeks after
           completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
