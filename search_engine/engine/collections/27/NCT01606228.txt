      aimed to explore the tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone
      extended release (ER) among Filipino patients with schizophrenia who have not taken any
      antipsychotics in the past, and among newly diagnosed schizophrenia patients who have not
      taken any antipsychotics for at least one month prior to screening. Antipsychotics are drugs
      that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought
      disorders. Flexible dosing allows the investigators to adjust the dosage of each patient
      based on the individual needs.
