      post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and
      poor short term clinical outcomes. There is currently no doubt about the fact that NODAT is a
      condition that needs medical attention and treatment. Although most centers follow treatment
      regimens for DM type II prospective data about their effectiveness in NODAT are lacking.
      Little information exists in kidney transplantation regarding conventional glucose-lowering
      therapies, either oral hypoglycemic agents or traditional insulin regimens. The Aim of this
      study was to evaluate whether a monotherapy with Vildagliptin improve glycemic control and to
      assess the safety in kidney transplanted patients with newly diagnosed NODAT.
