      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung infections using an early bactericidal activity (EBA)
      study design. MAC is an environmental bacteria that can cause chronic lung infection. Early
      bactericidal activity is the amount of bacterial killing that occurs during the first few
      weeks of antibiotic treatment. By collecting information about the EBA of azithromycin for
      MAC, the investigators will quantify the efficacy of azithromycin against pulmonary MAC.
