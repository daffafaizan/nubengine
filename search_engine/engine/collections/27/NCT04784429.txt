      prostheses (MPK) in patients with a transfemoral or knee disarticulation level amputation
      categorized by Medicare Functional Classification Level (MFCL) as a Limited Community
      Ambulator (K-Level 2). There are two aims for the study. Aim 1 is to understand the effect of
      MPK technology for the K2 ambulator on reducing fear and anxiety of falling, improving
      health-related quality of life, and participation in society and activities. Aim 2 is to
      understand the long-term effect of MPK technology the aspects from Aim 1 as well as reducing
      morbidity. The trial will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will cover the initial 12-month
      period to address Aim 1, and phase 2 will monitor from 12 months to 5 years to address Aim 2.
