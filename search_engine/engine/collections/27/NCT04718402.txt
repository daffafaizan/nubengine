      efficacy of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in subjects with advanced gastric carcinoma.
      At least 30 subjects will be recruited in this study. The subjects will receive Mitoxantrone
      Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2 by an intravenous infusion (IV), every 21 days (q3w, 1
      cycle). All patients will receive the treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxic
      reaction, death, or withdrawal by investigator or patient decision (a maximum of 8 cycles).
