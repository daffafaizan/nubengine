      (CRS-R) was used to assess the DOC patients' consciousness levels and the Nociception Coma
      Scale-Revised (NCS-R) was used to evaluate their pain response over one week. Furthermore,
      the relationship between behaviorally assessed consciousness levels and pain response was
      analyzed.
