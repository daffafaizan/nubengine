      Data on patients with MDS will be collected prospectively at diagnosis and at 6-months
      intervals after diagnosis. The data will be gathered by seventeen (or more) countries that
      are represented within the LeukemiaNet MDS Working Party and will be combined in one central
      European Database. Data analyses will be conducted by the Data Management Centre at the
      University of York in various sub studies, at specific time points as decided or requested by
      the steering committee, but at least once a year included in the European Registry and at the
      end of the follow-up period.

      Number of Patients & Centres Over 149 hematology centres in eighteen (or more) different
      countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy,
      The Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom) will participate as
      referral centres in this Registry. The recruitment target is a minimum of 3000 cases
      lower-risk MDS and 1000 higher-risk cases.

      Population:

      The study population will consist of newly diagnosed patients with all subtypes of MDS
      classified according to the WHO criteria, including therapy-related MDS and MDS-F, AML with
      20-<30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), and CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD.

      Study Duration:

      The enrolment time is scheduled to continue until at least December 2022 but extension of the
      recruitment period is possible. Patients will be followed until withdrawal (for any reason)
      or termination of the EUMDS Registry.
