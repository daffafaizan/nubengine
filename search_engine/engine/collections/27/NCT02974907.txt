      aging, or living in an environment of low humidity for long periods of time. Dry eye is a
      complex disease that may result in symptoms like discomfort, visual disturbance, and dryness.
      Patients with dry eye often have damage on the surface of the eye. In previous studies,
      RGN-259 has been shown to promote healing of the surface of the eye and decrease
      inflammation. It suggests that RGN-259 has a significant potential to be an important new
      safe and effective therapeutic in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.
