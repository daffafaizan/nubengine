      endocarditis by the modified Duke criteria admitted to our center for treatment. A control
      group of healthy volunteers, paired by sex and age, will be included. The microcirculatory
      tests will be performed in an undisturbed quiet room with a defined stable temperature (23 ±
      1 °C) after a 20-minute rest in the supine position. Functional capillary density (FCD)
      defined as the number of spontaneously perfused capillaries per square millimeter of skin
      area will be assessed by video-microscopy system with an epi-illuminated fiber-optic
      microscope containing a 100-W mercury vapor lamp light source and an M200 objective with a
      final magnification of 200×. Images will be acquired and saved for posterior off-line
      analysis using a semi-automatic integrated system (Micro-vision Instruments, Evry, France).
      The mean capillary density for each patient will be calculated as the arithmetic mean of
      visible (i.e., spontaneously perfused) capillaries in three contiguous microscopic fields of
      1mm2 each. Capillary recruitment (capillary reserve) will be evaluated using post-occlusive
      reactive hyperemia (PORH) after arm ischemia for 3 min. Microvascular reactivity will be
      evaluated using an laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) system with a laser wavelength of
      785 nm (PeriCam PSI system, Perimed, Sweden) in combination with iontophoresis of
      acetylcholine (ACh), as an endothelium dependent substance, and nitroprusside (endothelium
      independent) for noninvasive and continuous measurement of cutaneous microvascular perfusion
      changes (in arbitrary perfusion units, APU).
