        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of perifosine
           administered as a varying series of loading and maintenance doses in patients with
           refractory solid tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
           myelodysplastic syndromes, or Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the profile of adverse reactions (including changes in laboratory parameters)
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine any disease responses that may occur in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the steady-state pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine on day 1 followed by a maintenance dose
      2-3 times daily beginning on day 2 or 3 and continuing until day 21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating loading and maintenance doses of perifosine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the
      MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
