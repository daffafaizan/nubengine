      of laughter therapy on life satisfaction and loneliness in older adults living in a nursing
      home.

      The study was conducted in the only nursing home in Hatay province of Turkey.

      The study participants were older adults living in a nursing home. A total of 62 older adults
      formed the experimental group (n = 31) and the control group (n = 31).

      In order to ensure randomization and equal gender distribution, first, two groups (men and
      women) were formed. After the stratification process, five blocks consisting of six people
      and one group consisting of four people were formed using the permuted blocked randomization
      method. After the formation of the blocks, the elderly were randomly assigned to the
      experimental and the control group using a random number table. The experimental group
      received laughter therapy twice a week for 6 weeks and the usual care. The control group
      received only the usual care. To collect data, a personal information form, the De Jong
      Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS) and the Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS) were used.
