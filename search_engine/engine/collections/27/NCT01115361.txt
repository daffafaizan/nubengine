      To determine the effectiveness of an intervention, which is designed to increase
      contraceptive prevalence among postpartum women attending vaccination services who desire to
      either space or limit their pregnancies, thus reducing unmet contraceptive need in this
      population.

      The Intervention:

      A. Brief, concise messages conveyed to women during group education sessions regarding
      pregnancy risk, benefits of FP, and family planning options during the postpartum period.

      B.IEC materials such as posters and brochures that deliver messages about the benefits of
      spacing pregnancies by at least 2 years, LAM, return to fecundity and pregnancy risk during
      the postpartum period and contraceptive options for postpartum women.

      C.Use of a screening tool (Appendix A) to assess pregnancy risk for postpartum women coupled
      with a brief counseling message depending upon risk classification which includes referral to
      FP services for those currently or soon-to-be at-risk of pregnancy.

      D.Convenient offer of FP services to women attending vaccination services for their infants
      either concurrently with vaccination services, or at the same facility and on the same day,
      but at a different time from vaccination services.

      Study Design:

      Experimental, two-group (intervention/control) pretest (pre-intervention) /posttest
      (post-intervention) design 12 month intervention period. A mid-course collection of process
      data will also be conducted at 6 months to assess the degree to which the intervention is
      being implemented as intended and to provide an opportunity for corrective action if needed.

      Participants: Women attending vaccination services for their infants, and vaccination and FP
      providers
