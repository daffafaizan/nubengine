      need to develop efficacious, accessible, and readily disseminable interventions to help them
      to improve their glycemic control. To do this, the investigators need efficacious
      interventions that specifically address the challenges that parents of young children face in
      daily T1D management, as well as learning activities that are targeted to the ever evolving
      abilities of young children. Providers need mHealth interventions that minimize barriers that
      families experience when trying to access face-to-face or in clinic interventions. Finally,
      interventions are needed that are packaged to be easily deployable by other diabetes centers.
      The investigator's proposed intervention, DIPPer Academy, will include all of these
      recommended advancements.
