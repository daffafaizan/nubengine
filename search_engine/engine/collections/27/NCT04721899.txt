      receptivity in infertile women undergoing IVF.

      Women will have endometrial biopsy twice. The first endometrial biopsy is performed using a
      Pipelle sampler 7 days after luteinizing hormone surge (LH+7) at baseline and the attachment
      rate of the trophoblast spheroid onto the isolated endometrial epithelial cells will be
      assessed to assess endometrial receptivity at baseline.

      They will take Vitamin D 50,000 IU once per week for 4 weeks, followed by 50,000 IU once
      every 2 weeks for 4 weeks. After 8 weeks of Vitamin D, a second endometrial biopsy using a
      Pipelle sampler by standard technique will be collected from the patients 7 days after
      luteinizing hormone surge (LH+7) and the endometrial receptivity will be compared.

      The laboratory staff will not know whether the patient is taking any vitamin D when
      performing the trophoblast spheroid attachment assay.
