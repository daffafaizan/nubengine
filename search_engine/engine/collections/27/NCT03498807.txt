      confirmed that: with low tidal volume to achieve lung protection strategy and high positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), both can effectively reduce the mortality rate. And increase
      PEEP，the alveolar pressure is greater than the atmospheric pressure when exhaled，So that can
      be effective expansion of the lungs to avoid spitting at the end of the alveolar collapse.

      The study of PEEP in the setting mode has not yet been conclusive. Currently in the clinical
      situation，there are several ways to choose the best PEEP mode for ARDS patients. In this
      study the investigators selected two best PEEP assessment methods to compare:

      First is using the conventional postive ventilator to choose optimal and the new non-invasive
      electrical impedance tomography guided method and evaluation the treatment outcome in
      moderate and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome patients by using pressure-volume
      curve guided and electrical impedance tomography guided positive end-expiratory pressure
      setting. In this project, the investigators utilize a newly available non-invasive method-
      electric impedance tomography (EIT) and Protective Ventilation to determine the optimal PEEP
      on ARDS patients required invasive mechanical ventilator support in ICU at the Far Eastern
      memorial hospital, Taiwan.
