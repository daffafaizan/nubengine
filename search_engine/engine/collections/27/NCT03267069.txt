      disease (acute alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis) who present to Weill Cornell
      Medical Center or Columbia University Medical Center New York Presbyterian Hospital or the
      Gastroenterology and Hepatology Clinic will be invited to join this study, which entails a
      survey at baseline and follow-up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months and then at 2, 5, and 10
      years. Follow-up will consist of a chart review, a phone or in person interview, and most
      recent clinic visit interview for alcohol recidivism. The clinical providers will be blinded
      to the survey results.
