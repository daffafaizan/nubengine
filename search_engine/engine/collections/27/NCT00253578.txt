      I. To assess the overall response rate (confirmed CR, R and PR) in patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To evaluate qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.

      III. To assess overall and progression-free survival in this group of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      IV. To explore, in a preliminary manner, associations between gene expression signatures and
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
