      intermittent pneumatic compression on recovery from a 161-km ultramarathon. Participants of
      the 2015 161-km Western States Endurance Run were randomized to a 20-minute post-race
      intervention of massage, intermittent pneumatic compression or supine rest. Each subject
      completed two 400 m runs at maximum speed before the race, and on days 3 and 5 after the
      race, and also provided muscle pain and soreness ratings and overall muscular fatigue scores
      before and for 7 days after the race.
