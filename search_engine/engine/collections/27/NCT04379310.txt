      with patient characteristics and comorbidities are intensely studied. Investigators also want
      to find out potential relations between major medications taken for chronic diseases and
      clinical parameters of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia.

      For the study, investigators will recruit patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia between
      March 11th, 2020 (the date at which the first case of Covid-19 in Turkey officially declared)
      and April 15th, 2020 in emergency, internal medicine and cardiology outpatient clinics,
      retrospectively. All of the demographic features, complaints on admission, reports of
      computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest without intravenous contrast issued by the staff
      radiologist, c-reactive protein (CRP) and complete blood count (CBC) values on admission will
      be recorded retrospectively. Their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results will be
      derived from the hospital records based on public health covid-19 database notifications and
      list of medications taken regularly for more than 8 weeks before the diagnosis of COVID-19
      pneumonia from the national pharmacy database. Information about other systemic diseases and
      major medical conditions of patients will be procured from the medical histories gained by
      relevant physicians. Patient taking each drug group will be compared to those not taking that
      drugs in terms of clinical and demographical features mentioned above. Statistical analysis
      will be performed by using SPSS software.
