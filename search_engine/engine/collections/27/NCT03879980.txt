      abdominal surgery, due to its spread to the thoracic paravertebral space and thoracolumbar
      fascia nerve. The effect of preincisional ultrasound (US)-guided QL block as "preemptive
      analgesia" on patient underwent laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy has never been
      evaluated. As preemptive analgesia, quadratus lumborum block could provide analgesics before
      and after surgery. Both groups immediately received basic postoperative analgesia regimen
      paracetamol 1 gr IV 8th hourly.
