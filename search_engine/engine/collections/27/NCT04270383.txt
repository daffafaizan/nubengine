      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, with at least 800 reported deaths. Additional cases have
      been confirmed in multiple countries, and some are reported in children. Patients with
      confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have reported respiratory illness with fever, cough, et al.
      Some are asymptomatic carriers. However, there are relatively few diagnosed cases of
      children, and the long-term prognosis is unknown. Therefore, a multicenter observational
      study is needed to better understand the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in
      children.

      This observational study will last from February to December 2020. The patients enrolled were
      diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection or 2019-nCoV pneumonia by Beijing Children's Hospital and
      other members of Chinese National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases in
      2019-2020. At the same time, children hospitalized with pneumonia other than 2019-nCoV
      pneumonia during the same period are classified as the control group by 3~5:1 matching for
      age and sex to the 2019-nCoV group. After guardians signing the informed consent forms, all
      the participants' clinical data, laboratory examination results, image data and also the
      follow-up information after six months of their treatment will be collected.

      The trial will be completed in 10 months, with subjects recruited from the hospitals that in
      partnership with clinical research collaboration of National Clinical Research Center for
      Respiratory Diseases.
