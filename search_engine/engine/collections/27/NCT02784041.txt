      of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Patients who will have primary unilateral
      total knee replacement between September 2016 to June 2018 at Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital and meet the inclusion criteria will be included. They are randomized into two
      groups. The total knee arthroplasty is performed by one surgeon and adductor-canal block is
      performed by one anesthesiologist who is not responsible for follow-up. Patients on both
      groups will have intravenous patient control analgesia with 1 mg morphine/bolus. One
      residency is responsible for the follow-up.
