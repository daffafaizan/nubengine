      prognosis, the median survival time of this kind of patients is less than 1 year and even
      worse in China. Recently, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested to improve survival in patients with
      peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer. Even though the REGATTA trial demonstrated that
      the removal of the primary tumor is not necessarily beneficial, the role of operation aiming
      at R0 resection combined with new regimens like HIPEC and new chemotherapeutic agents is
      still confusing. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prolonged OS of patients received macroscopically
      radical (CC0) surgery. Compared to systemic chemotherapy, HIPEC promotes chemotherapy to
      penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue, which needed multicenter randomized clinical trials
      (RCTs) to comfirm. Therefore, we has conducting prospective phase III trial of HIPEC combined
      with systemic chemotherapy and CRS for gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
