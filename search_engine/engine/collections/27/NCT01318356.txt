      constitutes a significant problem in the current outbreak of Q fever. QFS leads to
      substantial morbidity and has a high socio-economic burden, related to increased use of
      healthcare facilities and absence from work. It is envisaged that over 750 patients will
      become chronically fatigued due to Q fever in The Netherlands (20% of 4000 patients from 2007
      until now). Although the outbreak appears to diminish, it is expected that Q fever will
      remain an endemic disease, and therefore this number will continue to grow. A vast medical
      consumption can be anticipated, stressing the need for an accessible and effective
      intervention and clear treatment guidelines.

      The study will contribute to a better understanding of effective treatment of QFS, providing
      evidence-based guidelines for general practitioners and medical specialists.
