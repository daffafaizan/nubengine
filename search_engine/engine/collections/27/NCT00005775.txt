      life requires early hyperalimentation and the gradual introduction of enteral feedings.
      Glutamine, which is the most abundant amino acid in the human body and taken up in greatest
      quantity by the fetus from the placenta, is not routinely provided in neonatal parenteral
      nutrition preparations.

      This large multicenter double-masked clinical trial tested whether supplementation of
      standard neonatal parenteral nutrition with glutamine would reduce the risk of death or
      late-onset sepsis in extremely-low-birth-weight (ELBW, less than or equal to 1000 gm)
      infants. Neonates with birth weights of 401-1000gm were randomized to standard TrophAmine or
      TrophAmine supplemented with glutamine before 72 hours and continued until the infants are
      tolerating full enteral feedings.

      Infants received a neurodevelopmental assessment by masked, certified examiners at 18-22
      months postmenstrual age.
