      hypothesize that lifestyle modifications through aerobic exercise training without weight
      loss or diet-induced weight loss are effective in reducing NAFLD parameters by improving
      hepatic mitochondrial content and function in human subjects.

      The investigators propose a randomized, controlled human clinical trial to compare the
      effects of aerobic exercise training (without weight loss) versus diet-induced weight loss
      (without exercise) in individuals who have NAFLD or liver biopsy-confirmed NASH
