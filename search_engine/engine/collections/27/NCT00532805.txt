      test that measures how well the lungs exhale air, is used to diagnose and track the
      progression of emphysema. Some studies have suggested that forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) measurements, a type of spirometry test, may lack accuracy in detecting disease
      progression in cases of severe AAT deficiency. Another method, high resolution chest CT
      scans, may be more accurate at measuring the progression of emphysema. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if high resolution CT scans are better at detecting the progression of
      emphysema than lung function tests. Results from this study may lead to the development of a
      more accurate way to assess lung tissue loss and may improve the understanding of lung
      destruction in AAT deficiency.

      This study will last 4 years and will enroll people with AAT deficiency who have nearly
      normal lung function test results. Study visits, each lasting about 4 hours, will occur at
      baseline and months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36. At each visit, participants will undergo lung
      function tests, a CT scan, blood collection, and a physical exam. Female participants will
      have urine collected for a pregnancy test. All participants will also complete questionnaires
      to assess health status and lung function. Study researchers will call participants every 2
      months to collect information on lung disease symptoms and medication changes.
