      marrow, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood. The MSCs manufactured for this study are a
      subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors.
      These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can differentiate
      into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to contributing directly to
      repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate the body's own cells to
      regenerate.

      Though an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current
      treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for
      addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical
      applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a
      similar effect in skin rejuvenation.

      In the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered
      MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant cutaneous photodamage.
