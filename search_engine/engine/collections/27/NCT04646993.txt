    
      The WHITE study is an international, non-profit, multicenter, observational, prospective and
      no profit study 3,200 subjects having experienced a first-ever episode of DVT of the lower
      limbs and/or PE, receive anticoagulation therapy for a period as recommended by international
      and/or local practice guidelines will be enrolled across all the countries participating to
      the study.

      When this recommended period expires, the attending physician has to decide whether to
      continue with anticoagulation, switch to anti-thrombotic of another class, or stop any
      prophylactic pharmacological treatment.

      The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the distribution of decisions and of
      the reasons guiding the physician's decision on the modality to manage the secondary
      prevention of VTE in patients treated for a first-ever episode of VTE, after the initial 3-12
      months of anticoagulation therapy.

      The secondary objective is the collection of data during the follow-up: the frequency of
      thromboembolic complications, of bleeding complications, or death from any cause.
