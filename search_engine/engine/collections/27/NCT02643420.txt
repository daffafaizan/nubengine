    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare
      the efficacy and safety of SPI-2012 (a long acting myeloid growth factor) with pegfilgrastim
      (Neulasta [NDC 55513-190-01] manufactured by Amgen) in breast cancer patients treated with TC
      chemotherapy.

      Approximately 400 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment
      arms.

      Each cycle will be 21 days. Only 4 cycles will be evaluated for this study. On Day 1 of each
      cycle, patients will receive TC chemotherapy. On Day 2 of each cycle, patients will receive
      study drug (SPI-2012 or pegfilgrastim).
