    
      The Automated Response to Spontaneous Epileptiform Activity using the External Responsive
      Neurostimulator (eRNS) system clinical investigation involves subjects who are undergoing
      intracranial monitoring for the evaluation of epilepsy surgery and who are being monitored in
      the hospital's epilepsy monitoring unit. During the subject's participation, at the
      discretion of the investigator, the subject will be connected to the eRNS. The eRNS is an
      investigational device that attaches to standard intracranial electrode monitoring equipment
      to monitor the subject's seizure activity. It is anticipated that the subject may be
      connected to the eRNS for a period of time extending from one day to a few weeks. After the
      subject has enough seizures to complete their evaluation for epilepsy surgery, the physician
      may enable the responsive stimulation settings for the eRNS. The subject's participation in
      the clinical investigation will be complete prior to the removal of their intracranial
      electrodes.
