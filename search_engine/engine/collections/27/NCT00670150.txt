        -  To evaluate the efficacy (complete and molecular response rates) and toxicity of NRX
           195183 in induction therapy

        -  To evaluate the efficacy (molecular response rates) and toxicity of NRX 195183 in
           combination with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in consolidation therapy.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy (event free-survival, disease-free survival) and toxicity of
           NRX 195183 as maintenance therapy for patients with APL who achieve a molecular complete
           response.
