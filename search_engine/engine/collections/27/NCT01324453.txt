      coronary intervention (PCI) versus routine PCI during their ST-Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (STEMI, Heart Attack) presentation. The Post Conditioning protocol consists of
      performing four, 30-second PTCA (Angioplasty) balloon occlusions followed by 30-seconds of
      reperfusion over a total of 4 minutes. The first balloon inflation occurs immediately after
      an angioplasty guidewire is placed through the obstruction in the artery. Following this
      protocol the vessel is stented as part of the usual practice for treatment of STEMI. No other
      treatment differences will occur between the two groups and all patients will receive the
      usual post-STEMI care. Patients in both groups will receive a cardiac MRI 3-5 days following
      their STEMI for measurement of heart attack size and heart muscle function, among other
      measures. Patients will undergo collection of blood for creatine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin
      I every 8 hours for 24 hours following PCI. All patients will be followed by phone follow-up
      visits to review history and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) (death, recurrent STEMI,
      repeat revascularization, arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement
      and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF)). All patients will be required to
      take P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin for the duration of the trial. All patients will be treated
      with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), beta blockers and statins.
