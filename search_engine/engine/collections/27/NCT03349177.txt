      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable advanced breast cancer in different molecular typing.
      In this trial the investigators will randomly assign 200 primary breast cancer patients to
      receive six cycles of fluorourcil, epirubicin,and cyclophosphamide(FEC), or four cycles of
      epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by four cycles of docetaxel(T), or six cycles
      of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC). Trasuzumab was recommended combining docetaxel to
      patients if HER-2 positive.The effectiveness of therapy will be estimated after every two
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Surgery will be performed after completing designated
      full cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is to assess pathologic
      complete response (pCR, ypT0/is ypN0) rate in different regiments. The secondary endpoint is
      to assess the relationship between pCR rate with molecular typing in different regiments, so
      that the investigators could optimize neoadjuvant chemotherapy regiment according to
      molecular typing.
