      life-long disability in adulthood. After stroke, patients often experience incisive changes
      in their health, daily routine and quality of life. The developed model of care (StroCare
      treatment) forms a cross--sectoral, structured and coordinated treatment pathway that
      integrates a patient-centred outcome evaluation. It aims to optimize the transition from
      acute inpatient treatment after an acute stroke to the ambulant neurological rehabilitation
      treatment. This is done firstly by creating an electronic portal solution for a safe and
      coordinated transmission of clinical data between the three participating hospitals and five
      stroke-specialized ambulant rehabilitation clinics and secondly by introducing a case-manager
      provided by the participating health insurance agency for patient support and aftercare
      coordination. The presented study is a multi-centred controlled interventional study with a
      pre-post design. Stroke patients in both groups are assessed after the index ischemic event
      and 12 months thereafter. Further sources of information are the medical record, the
      electronic portal (only intervention group), and routine data provided by the collaborating
      BARMER health insurance agency (for the Intervention and control group and additionally for a
      historic control). The main hypotheses are : (1) The StroCare treatment is more effective
      than the routine aftercare treatment (primary outcome: patient-reported quality of life) and
      (2) the StroCare treatment reduces costs for care and in the inpatient sector by providing
      more coordinated and thorough rehabilitation and outpatient aftercare.
