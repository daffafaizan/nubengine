      disease, can affect a variety of body functions, including breathing, swallowing and speech,
      with great potential to cause various physical, emotional, and social problems to the
      patient, leading to considerable impairment of their quality of life. Several instruments
      were developed to measure this variable. Such evaluation is currently considered fundamental
      to report therapeutic results, but there is no consensus regarding the instrument to be
      employed. The University of Washington questionnaire has been the most widely used so far.
      EORTC (European Organization for Cancer Research and Treatment) recently published a new
      questionnaire specifically for patients treated for head and neck cancer (EORTC QLQ-H & N43),
      already validated in Portuguese for Brazil.

      Objectives: The aim of this prospective and multi-institutional study is to evaluate the
      quality of life of patients with metastatic head and neck cancer undergoing immunotherapy in
      different regions of Brazil. Other endpoints will also be evaluated such as disease-free
      survival and overall survival.

      Procedures: EORTC QLQ-30 and EORTC QLQ-H & N43 questionnaires, validated in Portuguese for
      Brazil, will be applied to all patients with metastatic head and neck neoplasms undergoing
      immunotherapy at participating institutions. These will be evaluated before the beginning of
      the treatment and then every 2 months, for an estimated period of 2 years or until death or
      on demand, in case of symptomatology that justifies it.
