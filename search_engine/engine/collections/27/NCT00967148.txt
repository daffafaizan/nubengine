      beyond the period of hospitalization. Thromboprophylaxis effectively reduces the risk of post
      operative VTE in cancer patients. Extended thromboprophylaxis beyond hospitalization (up to
      30 days) with LMWH has been shown to further reduce the risk of postoperative VTE.
      Concurrently, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that LMWH may have anti-cancer
      effects due to anti-metastatic properties and may improve survival in cancer patients, even
      in the absence of a documented VTE. Retrospective studies have shown that perioperative
      thromboprophylaxis (i.e., starting thromboprophylaxis before the surgery) seems to increase
      survival in cancer patients undergoing abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery with curative
      intent. The investigators propose to perform an open-label RCT to determine if
      thromboprophylaxis using tinzaparin 4,500 IU daily, starting from the time of decision to
      operate through the peri-operative period and extending for 4 weeks postoperatively, is
      feasible.
