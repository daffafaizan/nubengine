      infancy and runs a course of remissions and exacerbations. T-lymphocytes play a prominent
      role in this skin disease. they represent the majority of skin-infiltrating cells and
      patients suffering from AD also have increased levels of activated circulating T cells and
      increased levels of markers of lymphocyte activation such as L-selectin and IL-2R.
