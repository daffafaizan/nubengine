      relief followed paradoxically by a longer lasting hypersensitivity to pain. Recent genetic
      analysis in mice suggests that beta adrenergic receptor antagonists reduce opiate-induced
      hyperalgesia (OIH). The purpose of this study is to determine the analgesic and
      antihyperalgesic properties of the beta-blocker propranolol on remifentanil-induced
      hypersensitivity in humans.

      The investigators want to determine the analgesic and antihyperalgesic properties of the
      beta-blocker propranolol on remifentanil-induced hypersensitivity in humans. The
      investigators hope to learn whether the administration of beta-blocker propranolol will
      significantly diminish the hyperalgesic response after administration of an opioid.

      The primary outcome measure for this study is change in size (area) of secondary hyperalgesia
      after cessation of remifentanil infusion, a measure of OIH.
