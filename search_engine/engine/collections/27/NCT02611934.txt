      which is aimed to investigate whether MTH applied in patients with ACS and cardiac arrest
      treated with PCI is associated with better clinical outcomes as compared with therapy without
      MTH. This trial will provide important information regarding the impact of MTH in unconscious
      with a score of â‰¤8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission to the hospital after
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with diagnosed or presumed ACS and shockable initial
      rhythm.
