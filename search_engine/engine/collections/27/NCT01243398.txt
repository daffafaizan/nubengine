      Primary

        -  To assess whether gefitinib vs placebo will improve overall survival of patients with
           esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the toxicity of gefitinib monotherapy in these patients.

        -  To assess whether gefitinib vs placebo will have a significant positive or negative
           impact upon quality of life of these patients.

        -  To assess the impact gefitinib vs placebo will have on progression-free survival of
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Arm A: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm B: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected for genetic and translational studies. Patient's quality of life
      is assessed at baseline and periodically during the study with completion of EORTC Quality of
      Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) version 3.0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks.
