      (reference product) which is intended for a variation in the existing marketing
      authorization.

      The proposed study in healthy males and females is designed to establish a PK profile under
      fasting conditions for the orally inhaled test and reference products to evaluate
      bioequivalence.

      This will be a single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blind, randomized, two-period crossover
      study with inhalation administered budesonide200 Âµg conductedunder fasting conditions inat
      least 52 healthy males and femalesat a single study center.

      The study will comprise:

        -  Screening period, including serum cortisol levels and documented inhalation training, of
           maximum 21 days;

        -  Two treatment periods (each of which will include a profile period of 24 hours)separated
           by a wash-out period of 7 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of
           the analyte) to 14 calendar days (maximum number of days based on logistical
           arrangements) between consecutive administrations of the IMP;

        -  A post-study visit within 72 hours of completion of the last treatment period of the
           study.

      Participants will be assigned randomly to treatment sequence, prior to the first
      administration of IMP.
