      measure perfusion in lower extremities and to understand how it might be used in a podiatry
      clinic. SFDI is a non-contact optical imaging technology that measures tissue functional
      (blood volume, tissue oxygen saturation) and structural information (scattering index) across
      a large field of view. Our hypothesis is that SFDI parameters can eventually become a
      quantitative tool to assess foot health and identify patients at risk for ulcer formation.
      This phase of the study is designed to correlate SFDI outputs to current clinical risk
      categories
