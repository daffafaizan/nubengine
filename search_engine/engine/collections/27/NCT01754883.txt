      inadequately responsive to standard medication treatments, such as psychopharmacology with
      serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors. Although many agents have been studied in the
      management of posttraumatic stress disorder, including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and
      atypical antipsychotics, augmentation of existing treatments with lithium remains almost
      wholly unexplored. Lithium augmentation may represent a worthwhile treatment option in light
      of its broad clinical utility, including reported clinical benefits for aggression,
      suicidality, and mood; its apparent effects on mediotemporal and prefrontal brain areas; and
      the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder.

      Primary Aim:

      Establish the safety and tolerability of lithium augmentation of psychopharmacological
      treatment as usual for combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.
