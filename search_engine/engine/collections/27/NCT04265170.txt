      and VAC® in facilitating healing and reduction in bio-burden in pressure ulcers. After
      consenting, the ulcers of eligible subjects are treated with BlastX. After a 5 minute dwell
      time the wound VAC® is applied as per manufacturers guidelines. The subjects return to the
      center three times per week for dressing changes and application of BlastX. The duration of
      the trial is four weeks. Subjects undergo study procedures (biopsy for quantitative tissue
      culture, photography, fluorescence imaging and swabbing for protease testing) on a weekly
      basis. The standard of care for pressure ulcers will be continued including debridement,
      off-loading, and nutritional supplementation when appropriate.
