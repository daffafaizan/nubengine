    
      Our primary specific aim is to test the CDA by conducting a randomized clinical trial
      comparing the CDA to routine contraceptive counseling. Our primary outcome of interest will
      be selection of highly effective contraception including the intrauterine device (IUD), the
      implant, and injectable contraception compared to all other reversible contraceptive methods.

      We will also complete the following secondary specific aims:

        1. We will use the validated Decisional Conflict Scale to measure decisional conflict pre-
           and post-intervention and compare the change in decisional conflict score in women
           randomized to the CDA to women undergoing routine counseling.

        2. We will also evaluate satisfaction with contraceptive counseling and contraceptive
           continuation and satisfaction at 3 and 6 months.
