      screening among Korean Americans.

      The investigators will design a culturally specific intervention; an educational small group
      discussion led by a trained Korean leader. The effect of the intervention will be tested on
      1200 Korean Americans.

      Subjects will be recruited at Korean churches and invited to join a one-hour discussion of
      health issues with other members of their church. One half of the subjects will participate
      in the intervention group. These subjects will discuss HBV and will receive resources related
      to HBV and where to obtain screening. The other half of the subjects will participate in the
      control group. These subjects will discuss nutrition and physical activity and will receive
      resources related to these topics, but not related to HBV and where to obtain screening.

      All subjects will be interviewed before the sessions and 6 months after the sessions to
      assess HBV screening levels in the two groups. Self-reported HBV screening will be verified
      by a review of subjects' medical records.

      The primary study hypothesis is that the intervention group will have a higher rate of HBV
      serologic testing at follow-up compared to the control group.

      Secondary hypotheses are:

      The intervention group will have a higher level of knowledge of hepatitis B and liver cancer
      at follow-up compared to the control group.

      The effect of the intervention on hepatitis B serologic testing will be mediated by knowledge
      of hepatitis B and liver cancer.
