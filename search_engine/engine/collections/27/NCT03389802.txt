    
      This is a multicenter phase I trial of APX005M in patients with recurrent or refractory
      primary malignant central nervous system tumor, or newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine
      glioma.

      APX005M is a humanized IgG1Îº mAb that binds to CD40. APX005M binds to both human and
      cynomolgus monkey CD40 with high affinity, triggering activation of B cells, monocytes, and
      dendritic cells and stimulating cytokine release from both human and monkey lymphocytes and
      monocytes. APX005M does not bind to mouse or rat CD40. CD40 is also expressed on many human
      tumor cells, and APX005M can mediate a direct cytotoxic effect on CD40+ tumor cells.

      Activation of CD40 on tumor cells results in tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor
      growth. CD40 agonistic antibodies have demonstrated potent antitumor immune response
      stimulation in both animal models and cancer patients. Due to its action on both immune and
      tumor cells, CD40 has been studied as a target for novel cancer immunotherapy.

      Apexigen has declared the adult recommended phase 2 dose to be 0.3 mg/kg because no dose
      limiting toxicities were encountered at that dose and the pharmacodynamic profile was similar
      to the 1 mg/kg maximally tolerated dose. This phase 1 clinical trial is to study APX005M in
      children with central nervous system tumors.
