      development of RILD. There are currently limited data on how a local change in hepatic
      function associates with regional radiation dose, and how the change of hepatic function
      during and after radiation therapy (RT) associates with RILD. In the present study, a
      radiological methodology that is minimally invasive will be used to measure volumetric
      hepatic functions in patients with intrahepatic malignancies before, during, and after a
      course of fractioned radiation therapy.
