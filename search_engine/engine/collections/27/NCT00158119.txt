      physical functioning in the elderly, for example in avoiding impending falls, rising from a
      chair, and climbing stairs. Muscle power, which declines with aging at a different rate than
      strength, has been shown in previous studies to improve through power training utilizing
      specially designed exercise equipment. However, weighted vest exercise could provide an
      acceptable, low cost, readily accessible alternative.

      The hypotheses being tested in this study are: 1) weighted vest exercise will improve lower
      extremity power when compared to age matched controls in a standardized progressive
      resistance training program; 2) improvements in lower extremity power enhance functional
      performance as shown by improved gait velocity, stair climbing, and chair rise time; and 3)
      weighted vest exercise in impaired older adults will improve self-reported function and
      disability.

      One hundred sixty-four men and women ages 65 and older, with some physical limitation but
      able to climb stairs independently, will be randomized to one of two 16-week exercise
      programs. The intervention group will participate in a weighted vest exercise protocol,
      consisting of chair-based and stair-climbing exercise, while the control group will
      participate in a standardized progressive resistance training program. Participants in both
      programs will meet three times per week for 30-60 minutes per session, for a total of 16
      weeks, at a research exercise gym, and will be under the direct supervision of research
      staff.
