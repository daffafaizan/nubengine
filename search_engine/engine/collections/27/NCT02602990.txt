    
      This observational study will collect data about the treatment of ruptured, unruptured,
      untreated or endovascular previously treated AVM's.

      Primary endpoint is safety. Safety will be assessed with the number of procedure-related
      complications occurring during the endovascular treatment until 30 days after the final
      embolization.

      Secondary endpoint is efficacy. Efficacy will be assessed by angiography and clinical outcome
      assessments (mRS).

      For each patient enrolled, data will be collected at inclusion, at each embolization session
      and at 6 Â± 1 months after the end of the endovascular treatment phase.
