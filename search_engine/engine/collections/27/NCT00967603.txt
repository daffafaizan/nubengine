        -  Compare the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic
           cancer without progression after 6 months of induction chemotherapy treated with
           sunitinib malate as maintenance therapy vs observation.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for up to 6 months in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only.
