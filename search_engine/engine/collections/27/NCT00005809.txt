      (CTC) vs pathology and colonoscopy in the detection of clinically important colorectal
      neoplasia, defined as at least one proven lesion with a diameter measuring at least 1 cm. II.
      Compare the physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing
      platforms for CTC images.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Radiologists evaluate each patient's
      optimal diagnostic computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) data. Patients' CTC findings
      are evaluated by a radiologist at a central facility using an imaging display software
      platform from General Electric, Vital Images, or the Mayo Clinic. CTC findings are compared
      with conventional colonoscopy findings and pathologic analysis. A comparison is made between
      physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing platforms
      for CTC images.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
