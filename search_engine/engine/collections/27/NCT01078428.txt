      of hypertrophic scar. One disadvantage of SGS is its application technique. To be effective,
      SGS must be applied on the scar for at least 12 hours daily. Topical silicone gel is a novel
      therapy that has shown promising result on scar prevention. However, the efficacy and safety
      of topical silicone gel for treatment of hypertrophic scar has not been confirmed.
