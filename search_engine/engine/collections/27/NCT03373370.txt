      gene (according to the site http: // amyloidosismutations.com / mut-attr.php) in the
      laboratory of molecular biology of the CHU BICÃŠTRE (APHP) managed by Pr Anne Mantel.

      Preselection of the cases to be tested among the cases of peripheral neuropathies of
      indetermined cause referred via the network Cornamyl of which the reference centers of the
      neuromuscular diseases are belonging .

      Currently, FAP is a worldwide disease. Diagnosis of TTR-FAP is extremely difficult and
      usually delayed by 4 years in non endemic areas for many reasons :

        -  positive family history are lacking in 50% of cases (sporadic forms).

        -  incomplete ability of biopsies to characterize amyloid deposits.

        -  clinical presentation is varied and may mimick many types of rare peripheral
           neuropathies: CIDP, axonal idiopathic polyneuropathy, upper limb neuropathies, recurrent
           carpal tunnel syndrome after surgery, ataxic neuropathy, motor neuropathy.

      Conversely to endemic areas, look for V30M mutation is not enough to exclude TTR-FAP, TTR
      gene sequencing is required.

      With the help of the french network for FAP (Cornamyl), cases have been identified in 81/100
      geographical departments, with a wide genetic heterogeneity (41 mutations reported) ; age of
      onset is late: 75% after 50 yo.
