    
      A cross-sectional evaluation of burnout, perceived stress, average sleep propensity, and
      social support and coping mechanisms will be assessed from four years of Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center (VUMC) Anesthesia residents. Burnout will be assessed using the
      Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS).

      Participating interns, Anesthesia Residency Class 1 (CA-1), and Anesthesia Residency Class 2
      (CA-2) classes will be randomized to 8 weeks of an exercise intervention (15 min of activity
      at 70% of max heart rate or higher, 5 days a week) to meet the activity recommendations of
      the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion or 8 weeks of continuing their baseline
      activity level prior to the study.
