    
      This study comprises a dose escalation phase using 3+3 design to determine the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the OXIRI regimen and an expansion phase to further
      evaluate the MTD and to determine early signs of efficacy.

      Eligible patients will receive a novel chemotherapeutic regimen (OXIRI regimen) with xeloda
      being administered in a chronomodulated fashion and the dose of irinotecan being guided by
      the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 genotype status of the patient.
