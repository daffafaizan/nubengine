      assessment tools to examine the effects of mCIT on the more affected upper extremity of
      children with cerebral palsy with asymmetric motor impairments after treatment immediately
      and 1 year following. The clinical tools will include Motor Activity Log (MAL),
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP),Peabody-Developmental Motor Scales
      (PDMS-II), and Wee-FIM. (2) This study looked at the intervention impact on bimanual
      coordination and the less affected upper extremity. (3) It investigated the effects of forms
      (group vs. individual intervention) on upper extremity performance.
