    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of topiramate (400 milligrams/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of acute
      manic or mixed episodes in patients with Biplar I Disorder. In addition, a third group of
      patients will be treated with lithium (1500milligrams/day) as a comparator drug. The trial
      consists of 3 phases: a screening period; double-blind treatment for 12 weeks; and an
      optional open-label period of at least 6 months. Efficacy assessments include the change from
      baseline to Day 21 in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score. Also included as efficacy
      assessments during the 12 week study are the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, Global
      Assessment Scale (GAS), Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS), and health-related quality of life measures at specified time intervals.
      Safety assessments include evaluation of adverse events throughout the study, rate of
      withdrawal from the study due to adverse events, and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse)
      througout the study, as well as changes in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry,
      urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations at specified times. The
      study hypothesis is that the change from baseline in the total Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMSR) score at Day 21 will be significantly better for the topiramate groups than for the
      placebo group and that the study drug will be well tolerated by the patients. Topiramate oral
      capsule will be increased from once daily (50mg) to 3 times daily up to target total daily
      dose 400mg, maintained through Week 12. Lithium oral capsules will be increased from once
      daily (300mg) to 3 times daily up to target total daily dose of 1500mg, maintained through
      Week 12.
