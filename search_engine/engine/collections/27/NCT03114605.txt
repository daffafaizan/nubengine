      that this occupation ranks highest on diseases and accidents rates among all professions.
      These professionals presents a very high incidence of depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol
      dependence and suicidal behavior. In addition to mental health suffering, evidence suggests
      an increase risk of sudden cardiac death, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome.

      Mindfulness-based interventions have been tested and incorporated for several clinical and
      non-clinical conditions for more than three decades, with emphasis on stress reduction,
      promotion of quality of life, chronic pain, anxiety, depression and eating disorders.

      The main hypothesis is that mindfulness training will improve their quality of life and
      reduce burnout symptoms. The investigators expect that individuals allocated in the MBI group
      will report, besides showing a better quality of life, mental health and less burnout, lower
      levels of stress, anxiety and depression symptoms.

      With regard to the working mechanism of the MBI, investigators will examine if the changes in
      mindfulness trait, self-compassion, spirituality, decentering and resilience skills will
      mediate the main hypothesis.

      The study will be conducted in Porto Alegre-RS and SÃ£o Paulo-SP.
