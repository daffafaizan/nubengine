    
      The study includes screening and baseline, randomization & intervention, in-hospital visit,
      at 30Â±3 days visit after fibrinolytic therapy.

      Following an initial eligibility screening assessment, all eligible patients who have signed
      the informed consent will be randomly assigned by an interactive Web-based central system for
      fibrinolytic therapy with either rhTNK-tPA or rt-PA. The standard care should be given to all
      patients except for the study interventions.

      Prior to fibrinolytic administration, enoxaparin (30-mg intravenous) or Un- Fractionated
      Heparin (maximum 4000U, intravenous) should be administered, combined with antiplatelet
      therapy consisted of both clopidogrel and aspirin in a 300-mg loading dose followed by
      routine dosage.

      Successful reperfusion according to the clinical evidence (EKG) should be assessed after
      fibrinolytic therapy.TIMI flow should be assessed for those patients with 24 hours coronary
      angiography.

      MACCE and bleeding events should be followed up and documented during the study until 30 days
      after fibrinolytic therap. An independent adjudication committee will judge the major
      endpoint events.
