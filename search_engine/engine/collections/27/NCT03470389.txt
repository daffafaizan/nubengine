      validation cohort. Randomization is based on the computer-generated random digits table. This
      study consists of two independent and consecutive stages:

        1. Establishment and improvement of the HVPGBFM model: For 100 patients in the original
           cohort, biofluid mechanics specialists will use each patient's computed tomography,
           blood tests, Doppler ultrasound and HVPG results to adjust the parameters of the HVPGBFM
           model in order to make each patient's HVPGBFM and HVPG values match well.

        2. Assessment of the HVPGBFM model: For 100 patients in the validation cohort, biofluid
           mechanics specialists will use each patient's computed tomography, blood tests and
           Doppler ultrasound results to calculate each patient's HVPGBFM according to the HVPGBFM
           model established previously. Biofluid mechanics specialists will make no changes to the
           HVPGBFM model and will have no access to patients' HVPG results in this cohort. Finally,
           the researchers will compare each patient's HVPGBFM and HVPG value and make an
           assessment of the HVPGBFM model.

      Each patient's HVPG measurement will be performed after finishing computed tomography, blood
      tests and Doppler ultrasound. These results and other clinical data will be inaccessible to
      professionals for HVPG measurements in order to prevent certain biases. Each patient's
      computed tomography, blood tests, Doppler ultrasound and HVPG measurement will be performed
      within 30 days and treatments that may affect HVPG value will be avoided during this period.
