      medicinal plants used in the traditional systems of medicine have shown immense potential in
      non-hormonal treatment of menopausal symptoms without major adverse events. We hypothesize
      that Menopause Relief EP-40 (a fixed combination of Cimicifuga EP-40 and Rhodiola EPR-7
      extracts) will significantly relieve menopausal complaints such as hot flushes, profuse
      sweating hot flushes, excessive perspiration, night sweats, sleep disorders, nervousness,
      mood swings, physical and mental fatigue as compared to EP-40Â® capsules or placebo in adult
      females in menopause.
