      patients. It is not only painful, but also can limit adequate nutritional intake and decrease
      the willingness of patients to continue the treatment. Furthermore, extensive mucositis may
      require additional nutritional supplementation, and narcotic analgesic increasing the cost of
      the therapy. Quality of life is impaired in patients who develop severe mucositis.

      Clinically, it begins with asymptomatic redness and erythema and ultimately passing through
      different stages to large acutely painful contiguous pseudomembranous lesions with associated
      dysphagia and decreased oral intake. The common sites of oral mucositis are labial, buccal,
      soft palate, floor of mouth, and the ventral surface of the tongue. The loss of the
      epithelial cells exposes the underlying connective tissue with its associated innervations
      causing pain. Oral infections, which may be due to bacterial, fungal, or viruses may further
      exacerbate the mucositis as well as lead to systemic infections.

      Treatment and prevention of therapy related mucositis is essential; unfortunately, the
      efficacy and safety of most of the regimen used have not been clearly established.
      Prophylactic measures employed are use of: chlorhexidine, saline rinses, soda bicarbonate
      rinses, acyclovir, and ice. For treatment of mucositis and its associated pain local
      anesthetic, diphenhydramine, nystatin, or sucralfate are used alone or in combination as
      mouthwash. Oral or parenteral narcotics are also used for pain relief.

      There is a clear need for new therapeutic options for oral mucositis.
