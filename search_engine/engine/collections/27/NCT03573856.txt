      (TTP) on diabetes risk factors in Native youth. The investigators will enroll up to 360 youth
      who are aged 7-10 years, overweight/obese (BMI >85th percentile), self-identify as American
      Indian, and have >1 parent/primary caregiver willing to actively participate in the program.
      Within each community, youth will be randomized to the TTP program or a general health and
      safety control program. The multi-component TTP intervention is a youth-centered adaptation
      of the Diabetes Prevention Program designed to reduce diabetes risk factors by improving
      activity and dietary behaviors. Informed by the pediatric weight management literature, the
      12-month intervention includes 12 active learning group classes, 7 individual youth/parent
      motivational interviewing counseling sessions, and community-specific resource toolboxes. In
      this trial, the investigators will assess the effect of TTP on anthropometric, metabolic, and
      behavioral risk factors for type 2 diabetes at the end of the intervention (12mo) and after 1
      year of follow-up (24mo).
