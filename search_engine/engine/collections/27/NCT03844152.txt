      consumption on the activity (using short-chain fatty acid) and composition of the gut
      microbiota.

      Participants will be stratified according to their baseline faecal butyrate levels. Therefore
      volunteers will be asked to provide two faecal samples one week apart. Based on the average
      absolute level of butyrate in the faecal samples, volunteers will be stratified into either
      low, moderate or high baseline butyrate levels (detailed in table 1 below). The levels for
      faecal butyrate for each group are set based on a meta-analysis of 9 human studies of healthy
      volunteers carried out at the Rowett Institute (n=116; LaBouyer et al, 2016, unpublished).
      Thresholds were derived from the boundaries of tertiles. Therefore, the moderate butyrate
      producers represent the middle 33% (see table). Each stratification arm will have a minimum
      of 17 study volunteers bringing the total to n=51. This has been set to ensure the completion
      of at least 45 volunteers. To optimise equal gender distribution amongst all study arms a
      minimum of 5 females and 5 males will be recruited for each arm.

      Stratification Butyrate range Low ≤13 mM Moderate butyrate 13 - 20mM High butyrate ≥20mM

      Primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed between the low and high butyrate producing
      groups as well as the overall group effect on everyone.
