      of cardiovascular, respiratory or neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. These
      pathologies are at the origin of decompensations requiring sometimes multiple
      hospitalizations. It is clear that the goals of care (curative or palliative) are not always
      related to life expectancy. Decision making, especially in an acute context, is often tricky.
      The use of a tool with certain parameters of the patient could help to guide the reflection.
      The present study propose a tool proposed by an Australian team (CriSTAL), which lists items
      described in the literature as a risk factor for the death of elderly patients. This tool is
      currently being studied in several types of populations around the world (general population,
      cancer patients, hospitalized etc.).

      This is a prospective study aimed at evaluating routine, single-center care, conducted at
      Toulouse University Hospital.

      The successive inclusion of hospitalized patients in Post Emergencies Geriatric (PUG) unity
      will be carried out over a period of 9 months.

      The primary outcome will be the vital status (alive / deceased) at 3 months of
      hospitalization in acute geriatric medicine.
