      in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome. II. Determine the dose limiting toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      this regimen in these patients. III. Assess the antileukemia effect of this regimen in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of cytarabine. Patients receive
      cytarabine IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 of each course. Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 24
      hours on days 2-4 of course 1 and over 36 hours beginning on day 2 of subsequent courses.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      cytarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
