      treatment with vitamin K antagonists. It addresses the question whether replacement of the
      vitamin K antagonist by rivaroxaban is able to slow progression of vascular calcification
      (VC). The second research question is whether addition of vitamin K2 to rivaroxaban can
      further beneficially affect the progression of VC. Two non-invasive methods are used to
      evaluate the impact of interventions on the progression of VC: i.e. coronary artery
      calcification (CAC) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements. The detection of CAC is
      predictive for the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease and future coronary
      events. VC and stiffening of the central elastic-type arteries are independent predictors of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
