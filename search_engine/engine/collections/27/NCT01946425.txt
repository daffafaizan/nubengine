      3 years to < 9 years of age) based on the subject's age at the time of enrollment.

      Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each vaccination,
      unsolicited AE information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2, or to Visit 3 for those
      subjects receiving 2 doses. Serious adverse event information will be collected from Visit 1
      to Visit 2, or Visit 3 for those subjects receiving 2 doses.

      Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all subjects prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and
      at Day 28 after the final vaccination using the hemagglutination inhibition technique. For
      each influenza vaccine strain, pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titers will be
      calculated.
