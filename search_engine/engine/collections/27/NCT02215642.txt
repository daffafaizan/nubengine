      studies reported that nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern,
      obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement were
      associated cancer risk. Yet, the influence of nutrition and lifestyle factors on colorectal
      cancer outcome (i.e. recurrence and survival) in colorectal cancer survivors is largely
      unknown. And there is currently no large cohort studies investigated the impact of these
      factors on colorectal cancer outcomes in China.

      Objectives - Our study aims to evaluate the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors
      such as dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes,
      aspirin use and vitamin supplement on colorectal cancer outcome (disease-specific survival,
      disease-free survival and overall survival).

      Settings and methods - The study will recruit approximately 50,000 participants with
      colorectal cancer from 12 public hospitals in China after informed consent. Appropriate
      questionnaires will be utilized to evaluate nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as
      dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin
      use and vitamin supplement. The association of disease-specific survival, disease-free
      survival and overall survival with these factors will be evaluated.

      Impact - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large cohort, systematically
      investigation of the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors on colorectal cancer
      outcome. When complete, our investigation would supply a systematical and precise
      understanding of the impact nutrition status and lifestyle factors on cancer out come in
      China.
