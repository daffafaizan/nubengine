      For HCC with a diameter less than 3cm, RFA is becoming an effective topical method for the
      goal of a complete cure. Although RFA is successful for small HCCs, for HCCs with a diameter
      larger than 3 to 5 cm, the complete ablation rate is reported to range from 61.3% to 82.5%.
      These results may be obsolete due to the further development of RFA techniques and
      instruments. For example, the use of clustered electrodes and an improved motor can provide a
      higher power, and the multiple-electrode switching system RFA (MESS-RFA) uses various methods
      to create a sufficient ablation zone, the investigators need to further update the management
      strategy of the RFA treatment of early HCC.

      However, HCC recurrence after RFA is still a significant problem . the investigators divide
      the intrahepatic recurrence after RFA into local tumor progression (LTP) and intrahepatic
      distant recurrence (IDR); each type of recurrence has a different pathogenic mechanism and is
      thought to occur relatively independently . Understanding the pattern and risk factors of
      recurrence is very important for the development of RFA and its clinical application.

      The objective of our multicenter prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of MESS-RFA
      as a primary method for treating early HCC, to assess the pattern of intrahepatic recurrence
      according to the types of recurrence, and to determine the risk factors associated with tumor
      recurrence and survival.
