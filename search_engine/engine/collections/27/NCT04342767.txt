      cost of nonhealing wounds approximates 100 billion dollars.1-3 The presence of bacteria in
      and around the wound impedes wound healing. Clinicians treat elevated wound bacterial levels
      with mechanical and sharp debridement, topical antiseptics and systemic antibiotics. However,
      evidence on the best methods to reduce bacterial load is lacking. The EZ-1 clinical trial
      will utilize the latest fluorescence imaging technology to investigate whether mechanical
      debridement using the EZ DebrideÂ® tool reduces bacterial burden.
