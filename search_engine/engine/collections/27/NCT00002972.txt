        -  Assess the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with bronchoalveolar carcinoma
           (BAC).

        -  Assess the duration of response in patients presenting with an objective response.

        -  Characterize the acute side effects of paclitaxel in patients with BAC.

        -  Assess the role of some biological parameters in the natural history and the response to
           therapy of BAC; evaluate the expression of Ki67, p53, and K-ras mutation.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Paclitaxel is administered every 3 weeks as a 3 hour continuous infusion in dextrose or
      normal saline. Patients are treated for a minimum of 2 cycles unless serious toxicity or
      complication occur.

      Disease is assessed every 6 weeks until documented progression; treatment side effects are
      assessed separately for each cycle of therapy. Treatment is given up to a maximum of 6 cycles
      of therapy or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal occurs.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 16 or 25 patients will be accrued.
