      long and complex operation, the continuous infusion or repeated use of fentanyl can
      significantly delay emergence from general anesthesia. The scalp block with local anesthesia
      is widely used for awake craniotomy with great success but it is not routinely used in
      general craniotomy. In this study, the control group will receive standard general anesthesia
      with the use of fentanyl for intraoperative pain control and the study group will receive the
      addition of scalp nerve block with 0.5% levobupivacaine (local anesthetic). The scalp nerve
      block might reduce the total dose of fentanyl and promote faster emergence from general
      anesthesia.
