      inflammatory disease (PID) receive follow-up care within 72 hours of diagnosis. However,
      recent studies show that the majority of teenage girls diagnosed with PID do not receive this
      follow-up care within 72 hours. We hypothesize that text message reminders to girls diagnosed
      with PID in the emergency department (ED) will improve follow-up to their primary care
      provider (PCP) after being discharged from the ED.
