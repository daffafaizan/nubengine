      protective behavioral strategies. They were randomly assigned to receive a positive message
      about individuals that used protective strategies, a negative message about individuals that
      did not use protective strategies, or an assessment control. They were then followed for the
      next 12 months. Assessments were completed at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 26, and 52.
