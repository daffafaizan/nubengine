      18F-choline PET/CT at 3 time points during the course of treatment that is indicated for
      castrate resistant prostate cancer. The 1st PET/CT scan is performed at baseline before
      treatment initiation. The 2nd and 3rd scans are performed at two other treatment-releated
      timepoints or at approximately 1 month and 3 months after treatment initiation. Change in
      lesion 18F-choline uptake from baseline measured at each time point will be determined.
      Cancer 18F-choline uptake will be evaluated as a marker of therapeutic response in comparison
      to PSA response and symptom scores. Treatment-related changes in tumor 18F-choline uptake
      occur will be studied after the second and third PET scans to determine the acuity by which
      changes in tumor 18F-choline uptake can be expected following specific treatments for
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study evaluates a diagnostic intervention and the
      treatments themselves are not considered part of the investigation. All treatment decisions
      will be made independent of the study and must be deemed clinically-warranted by a treating
      physician.
