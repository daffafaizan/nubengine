      MRSA isolated from the respiratory tract (sputum or oropharyngeal (OP) swab). The purpose of
      the study is to compare use of a two week eradication treatment protocol to an observational
      group treated for MRSA only when respiratory symptoms meet the criteria for a protocol
      defined pulmonary exacerbation during the first 28 days of the study. A total of 90
      participants, four years of age or older, with new MRSA infection are planned to be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either the treatment arm or to the observational control arm.
      Randomization is stratified by age, P. aeruginosa status at screening and site. Each
      participant randomized to the treatment arm receives two oral antibiotics for 14 days,
      topical antibacterial treatment of skin and nares, and a three week environmental
      decontamination for high risk areas and equipment. Each participant randomized to the
      observational control arm is followed clinically with usual care except to treat new or
      worsening pulmonary symptoms with antibiotics between screening and Day 28 only when
      participant meets criteria for a protocol defined exacerbation. Participants continue in the
      study for 6 months with study visits at Day 84 and Day 168 corresponding with their normal
      quarterly visits, this extension of observation provides additional data regarding natural
      history of MRSA infection and durability of the eradication protocol. The primary outcome is
      the proportion of participants with MRSA eradicated from respiratory tract cultures at Day
      28. The secondary outcomes number of, and time to, pulmonary exacerbations, and use of
      antibiotics.
