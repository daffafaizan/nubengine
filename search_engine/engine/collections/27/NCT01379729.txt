        1. To implant an alginate embedded human beta cell graft in a "therapeutic" dose in the
           intraperitoneal cavity of type 1 diabetic patients under immunosuppression with
           tacrolimus/MMF.

        2. To obtain histopathology of a biopsy specimen of the intraperitoneal human beta cell
           implant.

        3. To assess the safety profile, metabolic and immune effects of alginate embedded implants
           in the intraperitoneal cavity.
