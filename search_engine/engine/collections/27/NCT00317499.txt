    
      Previously presented data from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Protocols 016.0612
      [Investigator IND] and 016.0030 [Immunex IND]) led to the approval of etanercept for reducing
      clinical signs and symptoms of PsA. One-year radiographic data from Protocol 20021630 led to
      an additional approval of etanercept for inhibiting structural progression in PsA.

      Data are used for the following purposes:

        -  To summarize the clinical efficacy and safety results previously described in the
           6-month clinical study report and the radiographic results previously described in the
           1-year clinical study report.

        -  To show the effect of etanercept on physical function in subjects with PsA and
           psoriasis, as measured by 2 patient-reported outcome measures (disability index of the
           Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] and Medical Outcomes Study Short-form
           Health Survey [SF-36]). â€¢ To present the radiographic results at 2 years from baseline
           and the final clinical efficacy and safety results during the open-label period of the
           study.
