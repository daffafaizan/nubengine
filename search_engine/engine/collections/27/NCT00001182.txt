      Program to accept patients, for diagnosis and conventional therapy, which do not otherwise
      meet the criteria for any of the current NIDCR research protocols. This clinical examination
      and therapy by Dental Clinic practitioners will provide an excellent forum for the
      observation of oral conditions and phenomena that may generate scientific inquiries and
      provide valuable educational experiences consistent with the goals of the Oral Medicine
      Program.
