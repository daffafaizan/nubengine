    
      This pregnancy registry cohort study will be conducted by the Organization of Teratology
      Information Specialists (OTIS) which is a network of university and health department based
      telephone information centers serving pregnant women and health care providers throughout
      North America.

      Participants in the first two cohorts are recruited concurrently from callers to OTIS
      centers, from health care providers and through direct to consumer marketing efforts. The
      source of historical controls is archived data on pregnancies that have been followed through
      the California Teratogen Information Service's Clinical Research Program located at the
      University of California San Diego.
