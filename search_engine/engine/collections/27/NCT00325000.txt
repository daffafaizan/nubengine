      diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder comparing 5 weeks of Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      modified for depressed inpatients (IPT-S) plus pharmacotherapy versus medication plus
      intensive Clinical Management (CM). The study included a prospective, naturalistic follow-up
      3- and 12 months after acute treatment in 97 of 105 treatment completers. The 17-item version
