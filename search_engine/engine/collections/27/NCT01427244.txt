    
      The primary objective will be to estimate the anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab by
      evaluating the response to trastuzumab therapy in patients with recurrent or persistent
      vulvar Paget's disease demonstrating HER2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry and/ or
      FISH ((fluorescence in situ hybridization).

      The secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the quality of life, based on the severity of the patients' vulvar itching
           on a 4-point verbal rating scale from 0 to 3 (0=no itching, 1=mild itching/ bothersome,
           2=moderate itching/ troublesome, 3=severe itching/ extremely troublesome) as well as on
           the severity of the patients' vulvar pain on a numeric pain scale from 0-10 (0=no pain,
           1-3=mild pain, 4-6=moderate pain, 7-10=severe pain).

        -  To assess the frequency and severity of observed adverse effects

        -  To assess the frequency/ incidence of HER2 in Paget's disease of the vulva
