      jaundice but in 25 -30% of cases also duodenal stricture with nausea, vomiting and
      nutritional difficulties. Ten years ago, the only palliative treatment for these patients was
      a bypass operation for bile flow and intestinal passage. This operation was often associated
      with a high morbidity. Developments in endoscopic treatments allow palliation with lower
      morbidity. However, stent treatment is not free of problems like stent dysfunction. During
      the last ten years, anesthesia and surgical techniques have developed which allow lower
      postoperative morbidity compared to earlier treatments. A total of 70 patients were
      randomized to surgery with hepaticojejunostomy on Roux loop and gastrojejunostomy or
      endoscopic treatment with self-expanding metallic stent in the bile duct and so-called
      duodenal stent. Based on the inclusion of 70 patients, we expected a 20% difference in some
      of the primary variables with a power of 80%.
