      Primary

        -  To establish the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of
           cisplatin, paclitaxel, and everolimus in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of response rate and time to
           progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Patients receive oral everolimus on days 1, 8, 15, and 21. Courses repeat
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression and unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
