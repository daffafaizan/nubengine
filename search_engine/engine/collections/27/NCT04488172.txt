      polymorphisms, epilepsy, and multi-vitamins supplementation from Taiwan Biobank and will
      further investigate potential genes related to vitamins signal pathways (especially vitamin
      B6, B9, D, E, and Q) involved in epilepsy. These results will not only generate the field of
      AEDs pharmacogenomics for further study, but also provide new potential treatment targets
      that may involve in epilepsy therapeutics. The clinical outcomes indicate disease severity,
      body weight, metabolic indices (i.e., the fasting levels of lipid), HRQoL, anxiety and
      depression scores. All outcome indicators will be repeated measured at baseline and after 1,
      3 and 6 months multi-vitamins supplementation. All of the participants will be assessed the
      genotypes.
