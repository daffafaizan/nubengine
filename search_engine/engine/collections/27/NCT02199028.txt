      set survival and improve the onset of insulin action. The investigators will also assess the
      accuracy of the Dexcom G4P sensors with extended site use beyond the 7 day FDA approved time
      frame.

      The use of sensor information combined with the knowledge of infused insulin from pump
      therapy could potentially help us detect when an infusion set is beginning to fail.
      Information from the sensor function to the point of failure, and sensor function in response
      to Tylenol may allow us to develop special formulas to determine when a sensor is not working
      well. This will be very important for creating an artificial pancreas.

      Thirty subjects will be enrolled. Fifteen patients from each of the two sites: Stanford
      University and University of Colorado.
