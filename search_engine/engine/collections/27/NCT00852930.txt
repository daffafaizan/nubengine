      (ANP) administered LLLT, as both a stand-alone and complementary treatment, on arm volume,
      symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer survivors with related LE. Findings from
      this pilot randomized study will be used to determine if LLLT has possible value in the
      treatment of LE and warrants subsequent evaluation in a larger study.
