      TNK-tPA (tenecteplase), a thrombolytic agent that is relatively novel to the treatment
      ischemic stroke but well-established in the treatment of myocardial infarction, to treat
      minor ischemic stroke patients with proven acute symptomatic occlusions. Up to 80% of
      ischemic stroke is minor and initially non-disabling. These patients present with a transient
      ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.An overwhelming majority are not treated with
      thrombolysis as they are considered "too good to treat" by most physicians.

      TEMPO-1 will enroll patients within a 12 hour time window with a NIHSS score of <6 and an
      ASPECTS >5. Patients must have an intracranial occlusion on CTA. Study drug must be
      administered within 90 minutes from the first slice of CTA. This is an open- label,
      multi-centre trial, dose- escalated trial. A total of 50 patients will be enrolled, 25 per
      tier. There will two dose tiers at 0.1 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg. Advancement to the second
      dose-tier will be dependent upon safe completion of the 1st dose tier and the approval of the
      DSMB.

      Patients will undergo a study CT angiogram of the intracranial circulation between 4-8 hours
      after treatment to determine the biological effect of the drug - whether the occluded artery
      has recanalized or not. Patients will be assessed at 24 and 48 hours, and at Days 5, 30, and
      90.
