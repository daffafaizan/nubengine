      1:3500 male births worldwide. Despite an increase in our understanding of the disorder since
      the discovery and characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987,
      current therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Improvement in the treatment of
      DMD will depend upon the development of better therapies. Affected boys become symptomatic at
      3 to 5 years of age with proximal leg weakness that impairs mobility, ability to get up from
      a squat, and precludes a normal ability to run. By 8 years of age, some affected boys begin
      to lose the ability to walk and resort to a wheelchair for mobility. This shift from the
      ambulant to non-ambulant phase occurs in all boys with a diagnosis of DMD by age 12 years. In
      this study, participants will be randomized into groups after being screened to determine
      eligibility. Participants will then be followed for a 12-month investigation period.
