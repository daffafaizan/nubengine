      ventilatory support. Commonly, they are ventilated in controlled and assisted-controlled
      volume (VCV) or pressure (PCV) modes, with weaning at pressure support (PSV).

      Systematic reviews indicate that there is no difference between the VCV and PCV ventilatory
      modes for some clinical outcomes or that the existing evidence is insufficient. The
      distribution of regional ventilation and diaphragmatic mobility can be measured from the use
      of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and diaphragmatic ultrasonography (US) to clarify
      the physiological changes and / or mechanisms of adaptation of the organism submitted to
      controlled modes cycled at volume or at pressure and spontaneously flow cycled mode.

      Besides EIT and US measures, gasometric, hemodynamic and respiratory data will also be
      recorded. The statistical analysis will be considered α≤0.05 for a statistically significant
      difference.
