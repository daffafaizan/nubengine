      healthcare cost. A lot of risk prediction models have been developed for identifying patients
      at increased risk of postoperative acute kidney injury. Recent advances in artificial
      intelligence make it possible to manage and analyze big data. Prediction model using an
      artificial intelligence and large-scale data can improve the accuracy of prediction
      performance. Furthermore, the use of an artificial intelligence may be a useful adjuvant tool
      in making clinical decisions or real-time prediction if it is integrated into the electrical
      medical record systems. However, before implementing an artificial intelligence model into
      the clinical setting, prospective evaluation of an artificial intelligence model's real
      performance is essential. However, to our knowledge, there was no artificial intelligence
      model for prediction of postoperative acute kidney injury, which was prospectively evaluated.
      Therefore, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model which predicts postoperative
      acute kidney injury and evaluate the model's performance prospectively.
