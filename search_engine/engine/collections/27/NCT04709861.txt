      of charts of 35 patients who received a total ankle replacement porous prosthesis by an
      orthopedic surgeon at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. This group was
      received a delayed 6 week post-operative weight-bearing protocol.

      The second group will be prospective and include patients who will receive the same total
      ankle replacement porous prosthesis but will be assigned to early 2 weeks post-operative
      weight-bearing protocol.The retrospective and prospective groups will be age and gender
      matched. A Wright Medical Infinity Total Ankle Replacement System will be used for both
      groups.

      Both groups will be assessed at 1 year and 2 years post-operative. This assessment will take
      place during the post-operative care period and will be conducted as part of their
      post-operative care by the operating physician.
