      study. The principal goal of the proposed research is to utilize functional magnetic
      resonance imaging to further investigate and characterize pain-related neural activity at the
      level of the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord in healthy subjects and chronic neck pain
      patients. Healthy subjects and chronic neck pain patients will be recruited and participate
      in a single session of data collection. For both the healthy and chronic neck pain groups,
      painful thermal stimuli will be applied over the skin of the upper extremity while whole
      brain, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord functional images are acquired (on separate
      scans). For the chronic neck pain group, additional scans (brain, brainstem, and cervical
      spinal cord) will be acquired while the subjects rate their spontaneous chronic neck pain.
