      with determination of biochemical parameters such as fasting blood glucose, blood count,
      hs-CRP, AST and ALT, uric acid, creatinine and BUN. An extra blood aliquot will be collected
      to assess the serum biomarkers under investigation.

      During surgery two samples of peritoneal tissue macroscopically undamaged will be collected.
      On those samples will be executed separation of adipocytes cells, RNA and protein extraction
      for measuring of inflammatory and neoplastic biomarkers, determination of P2X7R-inflammasome
      activity and mitochondrial DNA analyse.
