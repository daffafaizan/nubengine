      back pain. Up to half of ED patients with acute, new onset low back pain (LBP) report
      persistent moderate or severe pain one week after the ED visit. Non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an effective treatment of acute LBP, though their impact
      is only modest.Given the poor pain and functional outcomes that persist beyond an ED visit
      for acute LBP, this clinical trial proposes to determine whether there is a difference in
      efficacy between the NSAIDs ketorolac, ibuprofen, and diclofenac and for the treatment of
      acute, non-traumatic, non-radicular low back pain.
