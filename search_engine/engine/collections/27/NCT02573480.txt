      department (ED) and the leading cause of hospitalization among males aged 20 to 24. Injury is
      a chronic, recurring disease. In Winnipeg, Canada, 20% of youth injured by violence visited
      the same ED in the next year with a repeat injury due to violence. Currently the standard of
      care for this vulnerable population is to discharge them from our EDs with no effort to
      prevent the next injury.

      There are 5 components key to implementing wraparound care for youth who are at risk of
      violence. The 1st component is the establishment of a relationship between support worker and
      youth at the time of injury - i.e. during a teachable moment. The 2nd component is that the
      support worker has extensive "lived experience". Many youth affected by violence have been
      marginalized by society and have significant trust issues with figures of traditional power
      (i.e. doctors, social workers etc.). It is imperative that the support worker establish trust
      quickly and act as a role model. The 3rd component is that the care program is individualized
      for and by each youth. The support worker helps the youth to define their own goals and the
      steps required to achieve them. The 4th component is to provide trauma-informed care.
      Trauma-informed care is an approach used by caregivers that acknowledges the current and past
      traumas a person may have experienced and helps the person heal and build a sense of control
      over their lives. The final component is the opportunity to access community supports within
      their own culture.
