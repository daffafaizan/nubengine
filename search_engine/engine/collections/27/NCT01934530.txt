      defects or a combination thereof associated with single crowned dental implants participated
      in this randomized control trial. The control group (N=7) received SCTG and the test group
      (N=6) received ADM, both under coronally positioned flaps. Data were collected before
      surgery, and 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the surgery. Outcome measures included
      soft tissue, hard tissue, and esthetics parameters and psychosocial data.
