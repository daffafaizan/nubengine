      and a commercially available control composite material for the restoration of class
      II-cavities. Primary endpoints of the study are a mean score for each patient calculated from
      aesthetic, functional attribute and biological parameters. Secondary endpoints are the
      evaluation of secondary caries, plaque accumulation and gingival reactions and the comparison
      of the primary score at week 1, month 6, month 12 and month 24 after restoration. Beside
      this, the single components of the three categories of the primary endpoints will be
      compared. The study will be executed as a multi-center (Oregon Health & Science University,
      Portland, OR, USA and Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany), single-blinded and
      randomized clinical investigation. 90 comparable cavities per study site will be treated (45
      cavities for each material at each site).
