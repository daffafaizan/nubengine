      hypertension were derived from a registry conducted at our institution prior to 2006. Since
      then, targeted therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension have been introduced in China.
      It is probably that the prognosis of Chinese patients with WHO group I pulmonary arterial
      hypertension and WHO group IV pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
      hypertension has also been improved as western countries. Therefore, the aim of the present
      study was to describe real-world outcome of Chinese patients with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and identify factors that may
      predict outcome. Our study will provide an updated picture of the clinical course of a more
      broadly defined scope of pulmonary hypertension and the effects of current therapy on
      survival, enabling the collection of data on demographics, clinical course, treatments, and
      outcomes.
