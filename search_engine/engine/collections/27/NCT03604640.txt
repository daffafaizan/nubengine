      training and health education, over the functional capacity of elderly hospitalized patients.

      The Randomized controlled trial with patients hospitalized in the Acute Care Unit of the
      Geriatric Department. Participants aged 75 years or older admitted for a short hospital stay
      will be randomly assigned in a four-week block, to either usual care (control) group or an
      intervention (training group). Participants allocated in the control group will receive
      standard hospital care. Participants allocated in the intervention group will perform during
      hospitalization, training program (30 minutes per session, two sessions per day, lower limb
      strength training, balance training, walking and inspiratory muscle training) and also health
      education. Health education consists of several informational activities. Each activity
      session will teach the patient and caregiver how to perform the exercises to ensure they will
      continue to be performed at home and before discharge the entire session will be devoted to
      reviewing the entire program. The type, frequency and progression of the exercises to be
      carried out will be reviewed; they will be explained how to do them at home and given
      personalized written instructions with illustrations of the exercises. Also, after one month
      and two months of discharge, the professional with whom they have completed the training will
      call them to insist on the completion of the program or to clarify any doubts that may exist.
