    
      The study is a double-blind, randomized Phase 2 trial of Exemestane +/- MM-121. The trial is
      designed to demonstrate whether MM-121 + Exemestane is more effective than Exemestane alone
      in ER+ and/or PR+ and Her2 negative breast cancer patients that have failed first-line
      anti-estrogen therapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting and patients that have
      progressed during (or within 6 months of completing) adjuvant treatment with a non-steroidal
      aromatase inhibitor (AI)and/or tamoxifen. Patients will be treated until radiologic or
      clinical progression of their disease is documented. Local radiologist and/or PI assessment
      is accepted.
