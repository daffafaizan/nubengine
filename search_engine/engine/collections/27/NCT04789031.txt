    
      This study is a multi-centred randomized, open label-controlled trial where a total of 54 HD
      patients (29 intervention; 27 control) with PEW were recruited from government, private and
      non-governmental organization settings. Patients were randomized to either the intervention
      or control group. The intervention group received ONS (475 kcal and 21.7 g of protein), daily
      for 6 months. Both intervention and control group received standard nutritional counseling
      during the study period.

      Patients who consented were subjected to a screening for identification of PEW and other
      eligibility criteria. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomized to either
      control or intervention group. During the 6 months of treatment period, patients in both
      control and intervention groups were assessed at baseline, 3rd months and 6th months for
      changes in muscle status using ultrasound imaging and bio-impedance spectroscopy method,
      malnutrition inflammation complex syndrome using Malnutrition-Inflammation Score, and other
      measures indicative of nutritional status including anthropometry, biochemistry, dietary
      intake and quality of life assessment. These parameters were compared at baseline and 6
      months for within and between group differences using general linear model test.
