      state-of-the-art techniques to assess improvements in cognitive functioning, functional
      status, mood, hippocampal neurogenesis and functional connectivity as well as
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of treatment with resveratrol. Design: The proposed
      study will be an intent-to-treat outpatient, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of 93
      Veterans who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kansas case definitions
      for GWI.

      The study involves a comparison of resveratrol at a dose of 2000 mg and placebo. All doses
      will be administered orally once or twice daily. Doses of resveratrol at 500 mg will begin
      with a dose titration period. In order to reach a maximum dose of 2000 mg for the
      resveratrol, titration will begin at 500 mg for 6 weeks, then increased to 1000 mg for 6
      weeks and increased to 1500 mg for 6 weeks and increased to 2000 mg for the remaining 6 weeks
      on treatment. Morning dosing will be taken with or before breakfast. Evening dosing will be
      taken with or before dinner.
