      Primary

        -  To evaluate the changes in performance status and symptom distress in older patients
           with presumed or advanced ovarian cancer undergoing surgery and/or chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the association between these changes with chemotherapy drug change, dose
           reduction, or dose delay due to toxicity in these patients.

        -  To explore the association between these changes with the development of surgical
           complications in these patients.

        -  To observe the response in the Geriatric Assessment (GA) and report the individual item
           scores.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete the Palliative Performance Scale and the McCorkle Symptom Distress
      Scale questionnaires at baseline, at 10-20 days after surgery*, at 14-21 days after courses 3
      and 6 of chemotherapy ( if applicable), and at approximately 2-3 months at the patient's
      first follow-up visit. The research team completes the Professional Geriatric Assessments.
      Patients' medical records are also reviewed for any surgical complications, chemotherapy
      toxicities, dose reductions or delays, or change in medications secondary to chemotherapy
      toxicities.

      NOTE: *Patients who complete the assessments and questionnaires at baseline but who are found
      not to have ovarian cancer during surgery will remain eligible for assessment of surgical
      complications.
