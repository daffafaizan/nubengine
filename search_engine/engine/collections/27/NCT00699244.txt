    
      A comparison of the infraclavicular placement of local anesthetic either centrally (posterior
      cord) vs peripheral placement (lateral or medial cord) using ultrasound guidance. This will
      be done to determine if ultrasound increases the success rate and if there is a difference in
      success rate between placing the local anesthetic centrally versus peripherally.
