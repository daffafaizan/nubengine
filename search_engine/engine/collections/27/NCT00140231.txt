      decrease appetite and increase energy use. Leptin levels usually go down with fasting. This
      study will evaluate the secretion of an investigational agent called leptin in lean and
      overweight individuals while fasting and investigate the potential role of leptin as a
      regulator of immune function and mediator of the neuroendocrine response to food deprivation
      in humans. Data derived from these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms
      underlying altered hormone levels and immune function in malnutrition and obesity and thus
      may provide the basis for future therapeutic interventions for obesity.
