      coronary bifurcations lesions, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in this setting
      remains challenging. When compared with non-bifurcation lesions, treatment of bifurcation
      lesions is associated with increased adverse clinical events and inferior angiographic
      outcomes including procedural complications. This is due to several technical challenges,
      including both anatomical (proximal-to-distal vessel mismatch [tapering], angulation and
      calcification) and procedural (plaque shift, and side-branch [SB] closure) features. Current
      balloon-expandable drug-eluting stent (DES) have not been designed to treat the bifurcation
      lesions; in particular, the inability of DES to adequately scaffold and preserve the ostium
      of SB represents a the major reason of failure, because this is the most common site for
      restenosis. Recently a large variety of dedicated bifurcation stents have been developed in
      order to 1) provide an easier access to the SB and to scaffold more effectively its ostium,
      and 2) adapt to main vassel (MV) tapering, and to the bifurcation anatomy.
