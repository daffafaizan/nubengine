      intensification phase with starting dose at 1m/kg every 2 weeks for 4 doses. The DLT
      observation period is 29 days starting with the first dose taken on Day 1, The study
      treatment will continue until one of the discontinuation criteria is met. Each dose level
      (1-2) will be tested using the 3+3 design. If level 2 of 3mg/kg is reached without DLTs,
      3mg/kg will be used for the dose expansion cohort. After the intensification phase, patients
      will start Nivolumab every 12 weeks maintenance phase till 2 years post allo-SCT. Patients
      will also receive best supportive care (BSC), including blood product transfusions,
