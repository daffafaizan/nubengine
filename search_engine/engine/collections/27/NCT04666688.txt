    
      This is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter Phase 1/2 study with a dose escalation phase
      (Part 1) and a cohort expansion phase (Part 2) in patients with relapsed/refractory
      metastatic solid tumors.

      Part 1: Dose Escalation Phase A dose-finding study will be conducted using a continuous
      reassessment method (CRM) to establish dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Part 2: Cohort Expansion Phase The second part of the protocol will adopt a Simon's two-stage
      optimal design. The Sponsor plans expansion cohorts for specific solid tumors, eg, pancreatic
      cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and/or potentially other solid tumor types based on results from
      part 1.
