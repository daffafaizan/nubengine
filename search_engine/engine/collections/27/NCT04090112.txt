      allocated into Gr. A and B. Group A received four puffs of 10% lidocaine sprayed at the cuff
      of ETT and four puffs at laryngeal inlet whereas Gr. B received 15 mg/kg of 2% lidocaine
      intravenous injection prior to extubation. The same general anesthesia protocol was applied
      in all of the patients. Incidence and severity of cough during extubation was evaluated.
      Furthermore, incidence of 24-hour postoperative adverse events (including sore throat,
      dysphagia, and hoarseness) and hemodynamic response after extubation were analyzed.
