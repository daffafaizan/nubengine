      patient care, during which different incidents can occur and induce frequent
      re-hospitalisation. There is therefore a growing interest in strengthening the physical and
      functional capacities of hospitalised elderly patients to prevent re-hospitalisation.

      Researchers have extensively studied the use of computer-aided physical rehabilitation to
      promote physical activity. Serious games coupled with monitoring devices such as Kinect have
      shown to positively impact patient's motivation to do rehabilitation exercises. Whether such
      devices would be as efficient as the standard care in the hospital and engage the elderly to
      remain active after discharge is still understudied.

      In the present study , the researchers aim at conducting a randomised clinical trial with 46
      patients during 6 weeks, to measure the added value of the REACH concept. REACH is a H2020
      funded project, the project abbreviation stands for Responsive Engagement of the Elderly
      Promoting Activity and Customised Healthcare.

      The intervention consists of a mobility device called ActivLife developed by Alreh Medical,
      that is coupled with serious games, a Kinect sensor and a wearable sensor called Stepwatch,
      to continuously measure the patients physical activity.

      The main objective of the study is to investigate whether rehabilitation using the mobility
      equipment is as effective as the standard care; secondly, to determine if there is an
      improvement in clinical outcomes such as physical strength, balance, and risk of falls after
      using the mobility equipment; and third, to establish whether the use of the REACH concept
      adds value to the continuity of patient care, specifically in terms of engagement and
      motivation to be more active during the hospital stay and when returning home.
