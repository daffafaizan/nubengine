      the progression of liver fibrosis. Immunoassay for the AST (cytoplasmic [c] AST/mitochondrial
      [m] AST) and ALT (ALT1/ALT2) have been suggested as one of the alternatives for the
      enzy-matic analysis. We evaluated the efficacy of immunoassay in predicting liver fibrosis
      and in-flammation. A total of 219 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who underwent
      hepatic ve-nous pressure gradient (HVPG) and liver biopsy before antiviral therapy were
      recruited. Serum samples were prepared from blood during HVPG. The liver function test
      including enzymatic AST/ALT and immunological cAST, mAST, ALT1 and ALT2 were checked with
      sandwich ELI-SA immunoassay with fluorescence labeled monoclonal antibodies, and were
      compared with the METAVIR stage of live fibrosis and the Knodell grade of inflammation.
