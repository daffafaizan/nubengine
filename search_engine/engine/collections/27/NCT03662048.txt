      parents through the patient portal of the electronic health record (EHR) can be used to a)
      deliver individualized feedback on safe infant sleep surfaces and sleep health and b) improve
      parental knowledge of and adherence to guidelines for safe infant sleep surfaces and sleep
      health. The feasibility of this approach will also be assessed through a randomized, clinical
      trial involving 130 infants with primary care through Penn State Health. Participants will be
      randomized to receive personalized feedback on the infant sleep position and surface at age 1
      month in addition to usual care or a usual care group. Both groups will receive personalized
      feedback on the infant sleep position and surface at infant age 2 months.
