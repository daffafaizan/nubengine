      15-24 years are over three times more likely to be infected than young men of the same age
      group. HIV testing and counseling remains critical to identifying new infections and
      preventing the spread of HIV but many young women do not test and still continue to engage in
      high risk behavior.

      HIV programs have begun to leverage mobile phones and text messages to increase the reach and
      scale of interventions. Kenya currently has 32.2 million mobile phone subscribers,
      representing a 79.2% country penetration. Text messages have been used successfully in Kenya
      for marketing purposes and have even been demonstrated to increase antiretroviral (ART)
      adherence. Despite advances in mobile-based applications to improve issues in health, none of
      these health applications have yet been able to reach the scale of mobile phone-based
      financial products in Kenya.

      Given the potential synergies of text message use and need for HIV testing, a randomized
      quasi-experimental study was conducted to test whether weekly text messages encouraging HIV
      testing and improving HIV awareness would increase HIV testing, enhance HIV risk perception
      and reduce high risk behaviour among young women 18-24 years old in a predominantly rural
      region in Kenya.

      Women in the intervention arm received access to a suite of HIV sensitization text messages
      sent weekly to increase their awareness of HIV and encourage them to test with the option of
      texting back for more information to a maximum of three times per week. Women in the control
      arm did not receive these messages. All women were followed up for six months with monthly
      SMS surveys collecting data on their HIV testing practices, sexual behaviour and risk
      perception.
