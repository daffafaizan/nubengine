    
      This is an open label study expanding on work by other groups in animals, ex-vivo human lungs
      and human subjects. Both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images will be obtained using 1H MRI
      comparing images obtained while breathing oxygen to those obtained breathing room air.

      Objectives

        -  To determine if 1H magnetic resonance images of the human lung and airways can be
           obtained in both single breath-hold and gated breathing imaging studies with adequate
           signal level and image contrast to extract regional lung functional information with
           oxygen as a contrast agent.

        -  To determine the short term reproducibility of the lung functional imaging in a subset
           of subjects (5 control subjects and 5 subjects with lung disease) with repeat MRI
           studies (Visit 2) at a time point ≥ 1 week to ≤ 4 weeks from Visit 1
