      in ICSI cycle or incubation of them in IVF cycle. Human blastocyst consists of cells forming
      an outer layer called trophotoderm that will form the placenta in case of successful
      implantation, an inner cell mass which become the fetus, a fluid-filled blastocoel cavity in
      the center, and a surrounding zone pellucida from which the embryo hatches to implant in the
      uterus. Human blastocyst contains a large amount of liquid in the blastocoel, which alters
      the infiltration of vitrification solution during the vitrification procedures leading to ice
      crystal formation. Therefore, investigators need to compare blastocyst survival, clinical
      pregnancy and implantation rates between vitrified untreated expanded blastocysts and
      vitrified blastocysts with artificially eliminated blastocoels by a laser pulse prior to
      vitrification
