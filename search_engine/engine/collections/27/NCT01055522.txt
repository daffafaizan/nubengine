    
      Dose limiting toxicity will be assessed during the dose-escalation part of Phase IIa from day
      1 through day 21 of the first cycle.

      Response will be measured using RECIST criteria every 6 weeks (after every 2 cycles of
      treatment). Patients with stable or responding disease at each assessment may receive
      additional treatment for a maximum of 6 cycles of induction. Patients with stable or
      responding disease after induction may receive L19IL2 (without dacarbazine) every 2 weeks as
      maintenance therapy.

      Tumor expression of ED-B FN and tumor uptake of L19IL2 and of Dacarbazine will be assessed
      via immunohistochemistry and/or other methods deemed appropriate on tumor tissue biopsies.
      Tumor biopsy will be performed on superficial accessible cutaneous and/or subcutaneous
      lesions only. Tumor biopsy will be considered optional and will not preclude patient entry on
      to study should the patient refuse.

      Pharmacokinetics of L19IL2, Dacarbazine and AIC will be assessed from serial blood samples
      using standard methods.

      Overall response rate, PFS, survival rate at 6 and 12 months, and overall survival time for
      all patients and separately for the patients in the Phase IIb part will be assessed using
      standard methods.
