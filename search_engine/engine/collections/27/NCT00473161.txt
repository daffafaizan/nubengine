    
      Children ages newborn to 21 with a diagnosis of arm weakness, hypertonia, or hyperkinesia due
      to cerebral palsy will be recruited. A muscle that is either over-active or under-active will
      be selected for each child. The child will be provided with the device to wear for 1 month in
      order to call attention to the identified muscle. At the beginning and end of the month,
      reaching will be assessed using three-dimensional kinematic motion capture. The outcome
      measure will be the speed and curvature of reaching to a target in front of the child.
