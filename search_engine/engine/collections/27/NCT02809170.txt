      children. The investigators will study control children to be able compare the results of
      children with mitochondrial diseases to control healthy children. Therefore, the
      investigators will study control children only once to compare these results to the results
      of children with mitochondrial diseases at baseline. To assess the effect of arginine and
      citrulline on children with mitochondrial diseases, the investigators need to assess children
      with mitochondrial diseases four times. First time as baseline. Then children with
      mitochondrial diseases will be randomized to receive either oral arginine or citrulline at a
      dose of 500 mg/kg/day divided in 3 doses daily for 2 weeks after which a second assessment
      will be performed. Oral arginine or citrulline will be discontinued and after a two-week
      washout period another baseline assessment will be done. After that, the child will be
      started on oral citrulline (if the participant received arginine the first time) or arginine
      (if the participant received citrulline the first time) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day divided in
      3 doses daily for 2 weeks after which a fourth assessment will be done.
