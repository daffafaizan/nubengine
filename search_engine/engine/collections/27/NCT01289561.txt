      self-administration. Volunteers will participate in 7 experimental sessions in which they
      will be given the opportunity to self-administer an alcohol + caffeine or alcohol +
      caffeine-placebo beverage. The first 6 sessions will involve exposure to the two beverage
      conditions in mixed order three times each (e.g., A, B, B, A, A, B). The seventh session will
      be a choice session in which the participant will make a single choice at the beginning of
      the session about which beverage they will consume that day. In addition to the primary
      outcomes of quantity of alcohol self-administered and beverage choice, three additional
      outcomes will be measured including: 1). indirect measures of reinforcing effects (e.g.
      subjective ratings of liking, well-being, take again); 2). an alcohol-sensitive behavioral
      measure; and 3). participant ratings of degree of behavioral impairment.
