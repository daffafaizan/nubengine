      mg twice weekly versus placebo in subjects with palmoplantar psoriasis (PPP). Subjects who
      meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to either 50 mg etanercept twice weekly or
      placebo. Subcutaneous injections will occur twice weekly at approximately the same time of
      day over the 12-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed after
      12 weeks of treatment. At the end of the first 12 weeks, all patients (both treatment and
      placebo arms) will be treated with etanercept 50 mg twice a week (BIW) for an additional 12
      weeks.
