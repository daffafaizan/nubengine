      determine thresholds that will predict increased risk for SOS in pediatric patients receiving
      HCT or high intensity chemotherapy/irradiation with the future goal of a randomized,
      interventional, open-label, multicenter trial that will test the preemptive use of
      defibrotide for prevention of SOS in an enriched high-risk population.
