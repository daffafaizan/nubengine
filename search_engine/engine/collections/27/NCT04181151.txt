      study. Individuals will be asked to reach midsternal height cups in two separate planes,
      sagittal and scapular, at arm's end, 125% of arm's distance and end point where it can reach
      according to modified functional reach test.

      Muscle activation of latissimus dorsi, erector spina and anterior deltoid muscles will be
      measured by superficial electromyographic measurement. Muscle activation according to SENIAM
      for erector spina and anterior deltoid will be evaluated. For latissimus dorsi, activation
      will be measured in six segments separated according to anatomic dissection.

      Reach activity will be performed 3 times on each side and at 1 minute intervals.
