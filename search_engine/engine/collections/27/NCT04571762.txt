      intermediate risk prostate cancer is standard of care. Using higher fraction doses that might
      be beneficial for disease control is not safe in all patients, unless adaptive treatment is
      performed. In this clinical trial the feasibility of online MR-guided SBRT fraction dose
      adaptation (between 7 and 8 Gy) for prostate cancer will be investigated. A fraction dose to
      the planning target volume (PTV) will be adapted to organs-at-risk (OAR) geometry (position,
      shape and volume) on online planning MRI scans of the treatment day ("geometry-of-the-day").
      Thus the investigators hope to maximize treatment individualization.
