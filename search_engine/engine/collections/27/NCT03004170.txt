      remain high. Brief motivational interventions delivered face-to-face have demonstrated
      efficacy at reducing condomless sex in HIV-positive persons. However, these interventions are
      not contextualized to the unique sexual health needs of HIV-positive older adults. Further,
      many HIV-positive older adults have difficulty accessing face-to-face services due to
      transportation, stigma, and other barriers. Telehealth interventions represent one delivery
      approach that overcomes such barriers.
