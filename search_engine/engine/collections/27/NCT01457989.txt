      VRX-RET-E22-304 (Study 304) will be pooled, summarized, and published with the goal of
      providing updated long-term safety and efficacy information for subjects and prescribers
      following the recent positive CHMP opinion for retigabine for adjunctive use in patients with
      partial seizures. Studies 303 and 304 are the open-label extensions of two Phase 3 studies
      (VRX-RET-E22-301 and VRX-RET-E22-302), respectively. Studies 301 and 302 were randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies of 600 mg and 900 mg
      per day (Study 302) and 1200 mg per day (Study 301). All subjects who wished to enter the OLE
      studies and, in the opinion of the investigator, were expected to benefit from participation
      in the OLEs, entered a 6-week (Study 301) or 4-week (Study 302) transition phase in which
      their dose of retigabine was titrated to or maintained at 400 mg TID (Study 301) or 300 mg
      TID (Study 302). Upon completion of the Transition phase, subjects enrolled into the
      extension studies. Once enrolled in the OLE, doses could be adjusted within the range of 600
      mg to 1200 mg per day. Treatment in Studies 303 and 304 is planned to continue until
      regulatory approval and commercialization of retigabine or until the program is discontinued.
