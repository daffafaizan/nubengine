      albuterol in an HFA metered dose inhaler (MDI) after single albuterol doses of 90mcg and
      180mcg delivered by the DPI and 180mcg delivered by the MDI. Another study objective is to
      compare the pharmacokinetics (metabolism) of albuterol with the two inhalers in all subjects
      treated. To participate in the study, subjects must provide written informed consent, washout
      any prohibited medications and pass all the screening criteria. Once this is done, there will
      be 3 treatment visits for each subject. At each of these visits, the subject will inhale from
      either the DPI or the MDI. Assignment of subjects to one of six (6) unique sequences of
      treatment will be according to a randomized scheme. The subject will inhale albuterol either
      once from the DPI (90mcg), twice from the DPI (180mcg) and twice from the MDI (180mcg).
      Following inhalation of the study drug, there will be a series of assessments taken at times
      postdose with spirometry (FEV1) measured up to 2 hours postdose, vital signs measured up to
      10 hours post dose, ECGs obtained up to 5 hours postdose, blood taken to measure potassium
      and glucose up to 6 hours postdose, and blood for pharmacokinetic evaluation obtained up to
      10 hours postdose. A washout period of 60 to 192 hours will separate each of the 3 treatment
      visits. Following these visits, there will be a study concluding visit 3 to 10 days later.
