      Pharmacokinetic studies of azithromycin in older children show better tolerance, higher
      tissue concentration, fewer side effects, and fewer drug interactions, when compared to
      erythromycin. Thus far, there have been no published data on the pharmacokinetic profile of
      azithromycin in neonates including low birth weight infants. However, the clinical
      pharmacology profile suggests a substantial therapeutic advantage of this drug in the
      newborn. To date, there are no data on the PK profile of IV Azithromycin from whence rational
      dosing can be derived.
