        -  To determine whether the use of a selective neck dissection (SEND) used electively on
           all patients presenting with stage I-II oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
           improves survival, disease-free survival, and loco-regional disease control rates.

        -  To determine how SEND and complex reconstruction affect quality of life and mental
           health.

        -  To determine whether the use of SEND on all patients presenting with stage I-II oral
           cavity SCC represents a cost-effective use of resources.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by age (< 40 vs 40-64 vs â‰¥ 65
      years of age), tumor stage (T1 vs T2), and surgeon.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo resection of the primary tumor with neck dissection.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo resection of the primary tumor alone. Patients complete the
           EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ - H&N35, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
           before surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Patients also complete the
           EQ-5D questionnaire at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Additionally, a
           self-completion Health Service Use questionnaire is completed every 2 months, during the
           first 24 months after treatment, to enable costs to the NHS to be monitored.

      After surgery, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
