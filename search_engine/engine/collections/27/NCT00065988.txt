      its introduction 150 years ago, but until recently it has been assumed that the exposure to
      mercury from dental amalgam is limited to the acute placement phase. However, some recent
      studies have raised safety concerns by demonstrating chronic release of mercury vapor from
      amalgam fillings during chewing and brushing. The Children's Amalgam Trial (CAT) is a two-arm
      randomized trial of safety, comparing amalgam with a mercury-free restorative material. A
      single masking procedure is used to ensure that all investigators and staff measuring
      outcomes are unaware of assigned trial arm. The study follows 534 New England children, aged
      6-10 years at enrollment, for 5 years. The children were recruited from two northeastern U.S.
      communities, one in rural Maine, and one in urban Massachusetts. No trial subjects received
      prior amalgam restorations, and all were in need of at least two posterior occlusal fillings.
      Participants were randomized to receive either amalgam or composite material for all
      posterior restorations at baseline and at subsequent visits. The primary endpoint will be
      5-year change in IQ scores. Secondary endpoints will include measures of other
      neuropsychological assessments and renal functioning.
