    
      The specific aims are (1) to test the feasibility and costs of methods and procedures for
      later use of MB-based combination therapy on a large scale, (2) to assess the safety of
      MB-based combination therapy, (3) to estimate the efficacy of MB-based combination therapy
      against malaria relapse, (4) to study the community acceptance of MB-based combination
      therapy, and (5) to strengthen the local capacity for malaria research and control in
      Jimma/Ethiopia.

      Study design:

      The study is designed as a pilot trial in adult patients with uncomplicated P. vivax malaria
      in Jimma, Ethiopia. Patients will be randomised to three treatment groups:

        1. Arthemeter/Lumefantrine (AL)

        2. AL-PQ, and

        3. AL-MB. Follow-up will be over a period of 6 months.

      Study population:

      Adult patients with uncomplicated P. vivax malaria (age â‰¥18 years) in Jimma/Ethiopia (G6PD
      deficient subjects are excluded) will become enrolled in the outpatient departments of the
      study centres. The sample size will be 33 per study arm, a total of 99 patients.

      Study treatments:

        -  AL standard treatments twice daily (total of 80 mg/dose A plus 480 mg/dose L) over first
           three study days

        -  PQ 15 mg once daily for 14 days

        -  MB 780 mg once daily for 14 days Treatments will be 100% directly observed.

      Study outcomes:

      Outcome parameters will be on feasibility and costs (e.g. recruitment rates, retention rates,
      costs per patient), on safety parameters (e.g. haemoglobin development during follow-up,
      incidence of adverse events), on efficacy parameters (e.g. incidence of P. vivax relapse
      during follow-up, malaria recurrence-free efficacy until day 180), and on community
      acceptance (e.g. perceptions on blue urine) during follow-up.
