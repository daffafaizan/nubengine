      (Rigshospitalet) patients treated with IVIG will be shifted to treatment with SCIG with an
      unaltered dosage. The medication is administered at home two or three times weekly. IVIG is
      often administered every 3 to 6 weeks. All patients will be trained in managing the treatment
      with SCIG by a nurse from the neurological department. When the patient is able to manage the
      treatment regimen it can be done at home.

      All patients will be evaluated eight times during the study period. Four times before and
      four times after shift of treatment.

      Prior to participation the intervals will be standardized to 3 or 6 weeks giving an extra
      infusion for those with an interval of 3 weeks, i.e. patients on 4-week interval will be
      switched to 3-week interval while patients on 5-week interval will be switched to 6-week
      interval. The dose will be adjusted leading to an unchanged weekly dose of IVIG. All patients
      will be evaluated in connection to two IVIG infusions. For those receiving 3 infusions
      examinations will be executed before and 2 weeks after the first and last infusion. SCIG is
      initiated 2 weeks after the last IVIG infusion.

      Patients on maintenance therapy with Subcuvia® or Hizentra® will be shifted to treatment with
      Gammanorm® according to guidelines from the Danish Healthcare Society, the weekly dose of
      immunoglobulin being unaltered. They will be evaluated 3 times (once before, at the time of
      shift of SCIG and once after).

      All evaluations at each time point in both groups consist of measurement of isokinetic muscle
      strength of four affected muscle groups and blood sampling detecting blood hemoglobin and
      hemolytic parameters.
