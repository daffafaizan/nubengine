    
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -10 to -7, and
      receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -6 and -5, fludarabine IV over 30
      minutes on days -6 to -2, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV
      continuously starting on day -1, CD34+ enriched CD45RA-depleted donor T-lymphocytes IV on day
      0, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute
      GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month
      for capsules (or per week for liquid).

      ARM B: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -9 to -6, and receive thiotepa IV over 3 hours on
      days -5 and -4, anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6-8 hours on days -4 and -3, cyclophosphamide
      IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2, and CD34+ enriched PBSC IV on day 0.

      ARM C: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -4 to -2 or -3 to -1, and receive PBSC IV on day 0.
      Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 3 and 4, and tacrolimus (or
      cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV continuously starting on day 5. If there is
      no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or
      sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).

      ARM D: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -6 to -4, and receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour
      on days -3 to -2, tacrolimus (or cyclosporine or sirolimus if toxicities occur) IV
      continuously starting on day -1, PBSC IV on day 0, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and
      11. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, tacrolimus (or
      cyclosporine or sirolimus) is tapered per month for capsules (or per week for liquid).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 80,
      180, and 270 and at 1, 1.5, and 2 years.
