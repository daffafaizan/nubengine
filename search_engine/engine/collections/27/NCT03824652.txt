      prostate cancer progression as measured by Ki67 expression in the prostate tissues. Subjects
      will be randomized 1:1 to usual diet or usual diet with the addition of 2 ounces of walnuts
      daily. The baseline visit will occur in conjunction with a standard of care visit
      post-biopsy, the intervention period will range from 4-10 weeks dependent upon the scheduled
      date of the standard of care radical prostatectomy (RP), and the final visit will occur in
      conjunction with a standard of care visit prior to RP.
