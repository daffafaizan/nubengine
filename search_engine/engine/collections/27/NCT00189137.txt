    
      The purpose of this study is to explore the relative activity and toxicity of a newer
      combination of chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and docetaxel, as compared to a standard
      combination of chemotherapy drugs, ifosfamide and doxorubicin.

      Ifosfamide and Doxorubicin, given in combination, are recognized as a standard of care for
      some types of sarcoma. Both gemcitabine and docetaxel are approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of some cancers (cancers of the pancreas, lung)
      because patients with those cancers treated with either gemcitabine or docetaxel experienced
      shrinkage of their tumor or improvement in their symptoms. However, neither gemcitabine or
      docetaxel is approved for sarcoma, but the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel is a
      standard treatment for advanced sarcoma.
