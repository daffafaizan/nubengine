    
      This will be a randomized controlled trial of primiparous women with singleton pregnancies
      who plan on delivering at Prentice Women's Hospital. Women will be recruited during their
      first trimester by their obstetrician as well as through standardized Northwestern Memorial
      Hospital flyers and ads. Demographic and delivery information will be obtained from the
      Northwestern Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), as well as by the attending midwife or
      physician at the time of delivery using a standardized Delivery Information Form. Women will
      also be asked about their other physical activities (including other forms of daily/weekly
      exercise) as well as whether or not they are participating in other birthing classes at the
      time of their first Total Control class (intervention group) or 2nd trimester visit with
      their providers (controls). All women will wear pedometers to track daily general activity.
