      salvage chemotherapy regimen in ALL. Abundant data suggests that leukemic cells receive key
      growth and survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment. Our preclinical data show
      that 4-5 days of G-CSF treatment is associated with a loss of osteoblasts and decreases
      expression of key chemokine/ cytokines which support lymphocyte development. The
      investigators hypothesize that G-CSF will disrupt the protective effects of the bone marrow
      microenvironment and augment the effect of chemotherapy in adults with ALL. This is a pilot
      study of G-CSF priming in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL to determine the
      feasibility and to characterize the effect of G-CSF treatment on the marrow microenvironment.
