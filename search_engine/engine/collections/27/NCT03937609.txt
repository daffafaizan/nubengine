      receiving IFX are different from patients receiving IFX while in remission.(5) The clearance
      of IFX is not only determined by demographic parameters (gender, body weight), blood
      chemistry (CRP, albumin) and anti-drug antibodies, but also disease related variables play an
      important role. Among others, we have demonstrated that faecal loss of IFX in ASUC patients
      increases IFX clearance during the induction phase (3). Furthermore, increased expression of
      TNF-α, the target of IFX, influences the clearance of IFX due to target mediated drug
      disposition (TMDD). Active IBD with high tissue concentrations of TNF-α thereby acts as a
      sink for anti-TNF-α antibodies (4). The PK of IFX has been mainly characterized during
      maintenance therapy. Evaluation of factors that influence the clearance of IFX during
      induction therapy will allow further optimization an individualization of IFX therapy in ASUC
      patients.

      At present, determination of IFX concentrations in the serum with an enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is time consuming; physicians often receive the results after as
      many as 10-20 days. To allow for proactive adjustments in dosing, faster laboratory results
      are required, preferably in a point-of-care setting. This test is now made available by
      Bühlmann Laboratories (Switzerland).

      The study hypothesis is that in patients with acute severe UC an intensified and personalized
      IFX dosing regimen using individual PK data from point of care tests as a rapid input to the
      dashboard system during the induction phase will lead to improved clinical outcomes when
      compared to standard dosing regimen.
