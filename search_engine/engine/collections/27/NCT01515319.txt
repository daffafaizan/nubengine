      ideal. Intravenous infusion of a hormone called PYY reduces food intake but its effects only
      last for a few hours and it can cause nausea. Y242 is a longacting analogue of PYY. Given
      subcutaneously in rodents, it has a profile of action of at least 72 hours and strongly
      inhibits food intake. It causes weight loss without behavioural effects. With MRC funding,
      Y242 has passed Good Laboratory Practice toxicology testing and the present proposal is a
      first in human study to investigate its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in
      overweight but otherwise healthy men.

      The study is a combined single ascending dose (part A) and multiple ascending dose (part B)
      Phase 1 investigation. The primary objective is to investigate safety and tolerability. The
      secondary objective is to assess Y242's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Possible effects on
      food consumption will be explored. For part A up to 48 subjects are planned, with up to 40
      subjects for part B. In each part subjects are divided into groups, each of which is dosed
      with the same level, starting with a single dose (part A) much lower than is expected to
      cause an effect. Subjects are admitted to a Unit so they can be closely observed for adverse
      effects and safety tests, blood concentrations of the drug and food and liquid intake and
      output will be monitored. Subjects are allocated at random (like tossing a coin) to receive
      Y242 or placebo (dummy). Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data will be summarised and
      available results considered in deciding dose escalation, with stopping rules designed to
      enable us to explore the relationship between dose and adverse effect (eg nausea) without
      causing unacceptable nausea or other symptoms in the volunteers.
