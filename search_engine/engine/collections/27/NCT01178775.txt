      clinics in two medical center hospitals in Taipei. Purposive sampling will be used to recruit
      outpatients or inpatients receiving chemotherapy. Data will be analyzed by descriptive
      analysis, independent t-test, Pearson correlation, one-way analysis of variance, and
      exploratory factor analysis.

      In the second and third years, an experimental design consisting of three groups including a
      control group, an education only group, and an education and walking program group will be
      used. Data will be collected at treatment weeks 1, 4,8,12,16 including three cycles of
      chemotherapy. Data will be analyzed by descriptive analysis, independent t-test, Pearson
      correlation, and generalized estimating equations. At least 230 subjects will be interviewed
      in the first year.

      At least 105 of patients with gastric cancer or colorectal will be classified into the three
      groups in the second and third year. We expect the results of this study to explore the
      meaning of fatigue and to help develop a common strategy to manage fatigue in Taiwan. The
      results can help clinicians and researchers to tailor interventions for cancer patients with
      severe fatigue.
