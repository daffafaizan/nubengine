      proliferation of T cells and to protect injured tissues through paracrine mechanisms. There
      is an urgent need to evaluate the real efficacy of MSC transplantation, and its possible
      position in the current therapeutic armamentarium. An international panel of MS neurology and
      stem cell experts, as well as immunologists formed an "International Mesenchymal Stem Cells
      Transplantation" (MSCT) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should
      be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that
      will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism
      that underlie the benefit. 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of
      autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells. Clinical and objective evaluations
      will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up.
