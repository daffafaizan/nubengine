      United States and thousands more worldwide, making it a leading cause of vision loss in
      children. Of these cases, approximately 1500 infants will develop severe ROP that requires
      surgical treatment. Despite those treatment, about 400-600 infants with severe ROP still
      become legally blind each year.

      ACULARÂ® (Ketorolac eye drop) is a member of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      available for toipcal ocular use. ACULAR acts as prostaglandin inhibitor and as such decrease
      prostaglandin E2 production. An increase in prostaglandin production has been associated with
      various inflammatory eye disease.For instance ACULAR has been shown to be effective in
      preventing the post cataract surgery inflammation that result in macular edema in adults.
      Activation of the prostaglandin cascade has been demonstrated in animal models of ROP. A
      previous non randomized study using ACULAR for ROP prevention has shown a possible beneficial
      effect and no observed adverse effect. To clearly demonstrated and confirm this finding a
      randomized study is thus necessary before one can advocate its use for prevention of ROP.The
      medication is FDA approved in pediatrics for allergic conjunctivitis and post surgical ocular
      inflammation.
