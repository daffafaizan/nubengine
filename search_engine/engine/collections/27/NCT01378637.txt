      through conventional therapies, are not brought to a level of maximal recovery. The aims of
      the proposed project are to obtain a set of data from a total of 20 chronic stroke subjects,
      all with severe lower extremity disability, between the ages of 18-85, using a robotic
      therapeutic device placed in a rehabilitation clinic. This data will allow us to quantify the
      extent to which a combination of robotic-assisted exercise and tendon vibration from the AMES
      beta device induces secondary recovery from the effects of stroke on the lower extremity.
