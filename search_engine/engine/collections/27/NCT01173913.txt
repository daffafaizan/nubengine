      enzymes, which are abundantly present in the gastrointestinal tract.

      Inhibition of CYP3A4 enzymes with ritonavir (an anti-retroviral drug) has in previously
      conducted proof-of-concept and phase I trials, proven to enhance the bioavailability of oral
      docetaxel.

      Oral administration of docetaxel has been investigated in five clinical trials, all initiated
      by the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital (NKI-AVL). The
      department of pharmacy of the Slotervaart Hospital and Netherlands Cancer Institute developed
      a solid oral dosage form for docetaxel, ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules. This formulation has now
      been investigated in more than 40 patients in a first clinical study. The preliminary results
      with ModraDoc001 10mg are promising and a linearity between systemic exposure to docetaxel
      and the applied dose of ModraDoc001 10mg capsules is seen. In an attempt to further improve
      and prolong the systemic exposure we will explore a twice daily dosing schedule.

      Two other novel dosage forms for docetaxel, ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50
      mg tablets, were developed. Both are spray-dried solid dispersions of docetaxel pressed in
      tablets. The distinction between both is that ritonavir is included in the co-formulation of
      ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets (10 mg docetaxel and 50 mg ritonavir). Both dosage forms will be
      investigated in arm B to see whether these new formulations have comparable pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of docetaxel to the capsule formulation.

      Arm A Arm A is a dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of weekly
      bi-daily ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules. This study will be done with a classical dose escalation
      design. The starting dose will be 40 mg BID. This dose is based on a safety of weekly 80 mg
      single dose in the previously conducted study.

      Arm B ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets will be investigated in arm
      B to see whether these new formulations have comparable pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      docetaxel to the capsule formulation od ModraDoc001 10 mg.

      Another part of this study is the screening for 2 different polymorphism, C1236T (for
      MDR1)and CYP3A4*1B. Polymorphic variants may influence the absorption and elimination of
      docetaxel and ritonavir.

      Arm D is a dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of weekly
      bi-daily ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets. This study will be done with a classical dose escalation
      design. The starting dose will be 20 mg BID. This dose is based on a safety of BID weekly
      ModraDoc001 mg in the previously conducted arm A.
