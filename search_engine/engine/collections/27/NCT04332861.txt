      the renal collecting system. In this setting, decompression with a ureteral stent or
      percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) is associated with decreased mortality and both methods have
      similar efficacy. At the time of initial evaluation, it is sometimes uncertain whether
      infection is present, resulting in difficult management decisions. It is also difficult to
      identify infected patients at greatest risk of developing sepsis, defined as life-threatening
      organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

      There are currently no widely adopted criteria for the accurate diagnosis of infection in the
      setting of an obstructing stone. Abnormal vital signs, leukocytosis, and abnormal urinalysis
      are relied upon, but these findings are often indeterminate. Most studies to date addressing
      this problem have retrospectively evaluated associations of single variables with infection
      including pyuria and bacteriuria, or performance of sepsis screening tools such as the
      Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA).

      More accurate diagnostic measures for infected obstructing urolithiasis and a better
      understanding of its natural history are needed in order to improve patient outcomes. While
      early recognition of patients at significant risk of developing sepsis is essential,
      treatment of patients who are not clinically infected with antibiotics and decompression
      procedures is unnecessarily morbid. Therefore, the investigators aim to develop and validate
      diagnostic criteria to predict development of life-threatening infection in a prospective
      observational fashion.
