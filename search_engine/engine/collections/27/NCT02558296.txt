    
      Approximately 130 investigative sites globally are planned to participate in this study.

      An estimated 1650 subjects with inadequately controlled T2DM and an elevated risk of
      cardiovascular adverse events will be randomized to bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, or placebo
      in a ratio of 2:1 in addition to the background anti-diabetic medications.

      The study is an event-driven trial. The treatment period will end when the last randomized
      subject has completed at least 52 weeks of treatment and a total of at least 134 subjects
      have experienced a cardiac event.
