      were 18 years or older, enrolled full-time, non-Pok√©mon Go players, and were able to walk
      leisurely. Daily steps were measured for 6 consecutive weeks via the Fitbit Flex 2. Habitual
      activity was first measured during the first two-weeks. After the 2-week baseline assessment
      of physical activity and GPS travel patterns, participants were randomized to one of three
      study conditions for the remaining 4 weeks: (1) "No Play," (2) "Play At Will," or (3) "Goal
      Oriented Play". The 4-week intervention period was followed by a post-study interview
      completed within one week from the end of the intervention period.
