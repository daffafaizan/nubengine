      immunoglobulin A (IgA)-dominant immune deposits. The clinical manifestations of severe HSP
      vary from massive hemorrhage and necrosis of the skin to severe gastrointestinal symptoms.
      The course of the disease would encounter delay and relapse. To some extent, the traditional
      therapy alleviate the clinical symptoms, but fail to timely clear up the immune depositions,
      causing the damage to the kidney.

      In the study, the patients will be given dexamethasone 0.5mg/kg/d, then be randomised to
      receive either gamma globulin i.v. or hemoperfusion if the disease can't be controlled with
      steroid treatment for more than two days.

      The investigators will explore the biological markers and compare the efficacy and safety of
      both measures in the treatment of serve HSP in children. The purpose of the study is to
      optimize the treatment of severe HSP for children with different ages.
