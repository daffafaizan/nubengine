      (IPV). Although a range of interventions have been tried to improve the mental health of
      women survivors of IPV, the results are inconclusive. In this trial, a 12-week advocacy
      intervention consisting of empowerment and telephone social support is provided to abused
      Chinese women in a community setting. Usual community services provide the control condition.
