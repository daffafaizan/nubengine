      them associated with the placental vascular anastomoses. Fetoscopic laser coagulation (FLC)
      is a surgical technique that allows minimally invasive access into the uterus and has emerged
      as a useful tool in the management of the most common and severe of these complications, twin
      to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Even though, preterm birth remains a common cause of
      adverse outcome because TTTS is associated with a 29% risk of delivering before 28 weeks.

      A short cervical length (CL), defined as a CL â‰¤ 25 mm, detected by transvaginal ultrasound is
      an independent risk factor for preterm birth in twin pregnancies but no effective treatment
      has been described to prevent it.

      Although is usually accepted that in twin pregnancies cerclage may increase the risk of
      preterm birth, Salomon and co-workers, found that in cases of TTTS with a CL below the 5th
      percentile (15 mm) at the time of surgery, performing an emergency cerclage prolonged the
      pregnancy and allow for better outcome, But still preterm birth after FLC remains a big
      challenge, so new methods to prevent it must be investigated.

      Previous studies in singletons and twins have shown that the use of cervical pessary
      significantly reduces the frequency of birth before 32 weeks and prolongs pregnancy. The
      advantage of using cervical pessary is that it is less invasive than cerclage and can be
      removed easily. That's the reason why pessaries could be considered an alternative, non
      invasive option to prevent preterm birth in cases of twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)
      treated by laser surgery.
