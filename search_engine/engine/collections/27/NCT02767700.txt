      extraction and NGS. Pseudonymised sequencing data will be fed into a TDS software tool
      (TreatmentMAPâ„¢, Molecular Health) and based on published evidence, suggestions will be made,
      graded into NCCN categories of approved drugs in indication or otherwise, clinical evidence
      or experimental. Same with anticipated inefficacy. In addition, FDA-approved biomarkers for
      toxicity will be analysed. This information is taken to the tumor board for making a decision
      whether this information is useful and eventually to recommend a treatment for a given
      patient.
