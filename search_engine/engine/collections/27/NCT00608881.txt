      affected and their families. There are no treatments that slow the progression of HD, only
      mildly effective symptomatic therapies are available.

      The purpose of this trial is to find out if coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) is effective in slowing the
      worsening symptoms of HD. In this study, researchers also will learn about the safety and
      acceptability of long-term CoQ use by determining its effects on people with HD.

      Participants in this trial will be randomly chosen to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive
      CoQ (2400 mg/day), and group 2 will receive a placebo (an inactive substance). Researchers
      will compare the change in total functional capacity (TFC)-a measure of functional
      disability-in the two groups. The TFC is a valid and reliable measure of disease progression
      and is particularly responsive to change in the early and mid-stages of HD. Researchers will
      also compare the changes in other components of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale
      '99 (UHDRS) including: the total motor score, total behavioral frequency score, total
      behavior frequency X severity score, verbal fluency test, symbol digit modalities test,
      Stroop, interference test, functional checklist, and independence scale scores. The groups
      will also be compared with respect to tolerability, adverse events, vital signs, and
      laboratory test results as measures of safety.
