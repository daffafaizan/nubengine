      carbohydrates, potassium, magnesium, and fiber, but low in fat and sodium. Starch is the main
      complex carbohydrate found in potatoes that yields glucose to contribute to overall energy
      needs. Another type of starch found in potatoes is resistant to amylase hydrolysis in the
      small intestine which is resistant starch (RS). Trials using RS as a functional ingredient
      (~15-30 g/day) in healthy and overweight adults resulted in improvements in postprandial
      glucose, insulin sensitivity, satiety hormone response, and subjective satiety. Limited data
      exists using RS naturally found in commonly consumed foods, such as potatoes. Altering the
      cooking methods and serving temperatures of potatoes can influence the amount of RS to impact
      glucose, satiety hormone response, and subjective satiety. Using a cross-sectional,
      cross-over design, the aim of this study will determine how potatoes 1) baked and chilled or
      2) boiled and consumed hot influence postprandial glycemic parameters, satiety hormones
      (glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide),
      subjective satiety, and subsequent energy intake in overweight females.
