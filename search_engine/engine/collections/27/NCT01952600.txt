      identify factors that matter the most to patients with kidney disease and study how they are
      impacted by different types of dialysis. The inclusion of patients, caregivers, and patient
      advocacy organizations as research partners will assure that the study addresses questions of
      greatest relevance to patients facing the need for dialysis.

      Aim One of EPOCH-RRT identifies outcomes that are most important to different groups of
      advanced CKD and dialysis patients through qualitative methods applied for conducting
      in-depth interviews.
