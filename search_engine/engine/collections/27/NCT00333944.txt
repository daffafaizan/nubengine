      intravenous atropine and oximes to counter acetylcholinesterase inhibition.1 Treatment with
      atropine is well established, but the efficacy and dosage schedule of oximes are
      controversial.2-5 A dose of 1g every four to six hours has been the standard regimen in Asian
      district hospitals but many clinicians remain unconvinced by its effectiveness.3 Randomised
      controlled trials (RCT) performed in Vellore during the nineties compared a 12g infusion over
      3-4 days with a 1g bolus dose and then with placebo.6,7 The authors reported no benefit from
      pralidoxime and an increased mortality in those receiving the infusion, and have stated that
      pralidoxime should not be given to organophosphorus poisoned patients.2

      Others consider that the dosage regimen was not ideal, with therapeutic concentrations being
      obtained rarely during the treatment.3,4 Furthermore, many patients presented late and had
      taken dimethyl pesticides - a class that does not respond well to oximes after several hours
      - biasing the study against finding benefit.

      The proposed minimum effective plasma levels for pralidoxime of 4 mg/L were based on in vitro
      and animal experiments by Sundwall.8 Recent evidence, however, suggests that higher blood
      concentrations of pralidoxime are needed to antagonise the toxic effects of many pesticides
      and that a bolus loading infusion followed by a maintenance infusion would be the best
      regimen.9 The WHO have proposed that patients receive around 30mg/kg pralidoxime salt as a
      loading dose followed by an infusion of at least 8mg/kg/hr (roughly equivalent to 1-2 g bolus
      followed by 0Â·5 g/h in a 50kg south Asian patient).9,10 However, no trials have yet been
      performed to determine whether such a regimen reduces morbidity and mortality in severely
      poisoned patients.3 Since organophosphorus pesticides kill hundreds of thousands of people in
      rural Asia every year, it is essential to determine whether it benefits or harms such
      poisoned patients.

      Our hospital has typically used a regimen of 1g q4h in organophosphorus poisoned patients but
      we were unconvinced about the effectiveness of this expensive drug since many patients
      required ventilation for >10 days. We informally treated several patients with the
      WHO-recommended regimen but saw little benefit. Since pralidoxime has a high therapeutic
      index, we then decided to conduct a RCT with still higher doses, i.e. to compare a 1 g
      infusion every hour (q1h, 24 g/day) with 1g every four hours (q4h, 6 g/day), after a 2 g
      loading dose, to assess the effectiveness of high dose pralidoxime in organophosphorus
      poisoned patients.
