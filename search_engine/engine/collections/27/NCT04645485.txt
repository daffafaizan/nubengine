      investigational product formulation were performed at the same center according to Good
      Laboratory Practices (GLPs) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Participants received
      the investigational therapy through compressor (jet) nebulization (two doses divided on Days
      0 and 1). The primary endpoint was the safety assessment, to be measured as Adverse Reactions
      (ARs) incidence [by the World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC)
      causality assessment system], and the nebulization tolerability rate (Days 0 and 1). The
      Laboratory testing profile was evaluated before treatment (Day 0 or -1) and on Days 14 and
      28. Two thorax radiography tests (chest X-rays - CXR) were assessed: before the therapy (Day
      0 or -1) and on Day 7. An electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment was performed on Days 0 (or -1),
      14, and 28. The application of the validated St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) on
      Days 0 and 28 was a surrogate safety endpoint. The whole clinical assessment in SANTANA Study
      was daily recorded until Day 28, taking into account the ARs incidence. The secondary
      endpoint was the tolerability assessment, measured by nebulization tolerability rate (Days 0
      and 1), and Adverse Events (AEs) tolerability within 28-days. The trial was approved by the
      ADSCC Research Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all
      participants. SANTANA Study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki principles
      and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and the authors are responsible for designing the trial,
      compiling, and analyzing the data.
