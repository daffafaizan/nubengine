      chemotherapy will help people with aplastic anemia who have failed other treatments.

      You have a severe, life threatening disease (severe aplastic anemia) in your bone marrow.
      Your disease has come back or not responded after receiving one or more immunosuppressive
      treatments. High dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been
      used to treat blood diseases like yours but complications from Graft vs. Host disease (GVHD)
      and graft failure have limited the survival for those people.

      A small study done at Johns Hopkins has shown that in subjects with other diseases (blood
      cancers) some immunosuppressive drugs given after the BMT have decreased how often subjects
      had complications of GVHD and engraftment failure.

      People with aplastic anemia who have refractory disease (not responding to standard
      treatment) may join.
