      prevalent illness and the leading cause of death worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that
      inflammation plays a primordial role in atherogenesis and is closely associated with the
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules.
      HLA genes are located in 6p21.3, the proteins encoded by these HLA genes have a major role to
      play in antigen presentation and inflammatory pathways. HLA involvement in inflammation is
      mainly associated with the HLA-dependent activation of T cells. studies reported that the
      susceptibility to CAD is related with the polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1. The above evidence
      indicates that the polymorphisms in HLA class II are associated with the risk of CAD . This
      study research investigate three objects , firstly what is the similarity of the coronary
      artery lesions according to the compatability of HLA alleles between the first degree
      relatives who went angiography before , secondly is there any relation between HLA subtype
      allels and the coronary artery (RCA ?LAD ? ,CX? and can such a relation be responsible from
      the lesions in this artery ,finally is there any relation between HLA subtypes and turkish
      race coronary artery disease
