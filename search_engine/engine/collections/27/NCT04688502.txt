      COVID-19. Gymnasiums have been identified as being susceptible to virus transmission;
      therefore, wearing face masks during exercise is important during pandemics. This study will
      evaluate performance and physiological stress during high-intensity exercise while wearing a
      face mask during Crossfit exercise training. Twenty-four men and women will be randomly
      assigned to perform exercise during Crossfit exercise while wearing or not wearing a surgical
      face mask in a cross-over study. Two types of exercise sessions will be assessed: A high
      intensity interval session and a continuous exercise session. There will therefore be four
      exercise sessions evaluated in our randomized cross-over design: 1) high intensity exercise
      while wearing a face mask; 2) high intensity exercise with no face mask; 3) continuous
      exercise while wearing a face mask; 4) continuous exercise with no face mask. Outcome
      variables to be assessed include exercise performance during the sessions (total repetitions
      for pull-ups, push-ups, and squats during continuous exercise and total repetitions for box
      jumps during high-intensity exercise). Heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and dyspnea
      will also be assessed throughout the exercise sessions.
