      described, and are produced by rapid uptake of N2O during the first several minutes of an
      inhalational anesthetic. This significantly increases alveolar and arterial O2 partial
      pressure. Theoretical modelling of alveolar gas exchange has predicted that these effects may
      not be transient but may be a persisting phenomenon. However, N2O is known to promote
      absorption atelectasis in poorly ventilated lung units.

      This study, carried out pre-cardiopulmonary bypass in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery
      surgery, measures change in PaO2 after a minimum of 30 minutes of relaxant general anesthesia
      with a FIO2 of 30%. Patients are randomised to two groups. The intervention group has N2O
      introduced following baseline blood gas measurements, while the control group continued
      breathing an identical FIO2 in N2. The change in PaO2 in the two groups is the primary
      endpoint for comparison.
