      are effective in relapsed and refractory B-CLL. Methylprednisolone acts independently of p53
      apoptosis pathway. The combination of both drugs may improve response and outcome in
      previously treated high-risk B-CLL patients.

      Study Objectives

      Primary:

      To determine the clinical benefit of high-dose Methylprednisolone and Rituximab in previously
      treated high-risk B-CLL patients in terms of clinical and flowcytometric response rate.

      Secondary:

      To determine progression free and overall survival. To characterize the safety profile of
      high-dose Methylprednisolone and Rituximab.

      Patient Population Patients with previously treated symptomatic high risk B-CLL 18 years of
      age and older.

      Study Duration The study period for each subject is expected to be 21 months. Subjects will
      receive up-to 6 cycles of IV infusion of Methylprednisolone and Rituximab. Maximum duration
      of treatment is expected to be 9 months. All infusions of study treatment will be
      administered by medically qualified site staff in an inpatient or outpatient clinic under the
      supervision of an Investigator. Subjects will complete scheduled visits not later than Study
      Month 21, after which time they will enter into the long term follow up period. Subjects will
      be followed every 3 months for disease progression, initiation of subsequent leukemia
      treatment or survival, except in cases lost to follow up, or if a subject withdraws informed
      consent.

      Study Design Phase II, multicenter, non-randomized, open label study.

      Maximum Recruitment Period 2 years

      Number of Planned Subjects Approximately 50 patients.
