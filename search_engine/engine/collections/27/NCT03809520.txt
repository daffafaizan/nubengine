      participate in this study. We will obtain pedCAT scans at 6, 12, and 18 months post-injury,
      as well as several questionnaires that will be administered during the clinical visits. We
      will also review the subjects' electronic medical record for data related to the injury,
      including the timing and mechanism of injury, time from injury to surgery, length of hospital
      stay, any complications and/or subsequent ankle surgeries, as well as any clinic notes,
      imaging, and/or outcomes scores related to the calcaneus fracture.
