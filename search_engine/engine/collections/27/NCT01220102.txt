      adherence under daily clinical practice conditions in adults and adolescents (12 to 20 years)
      with moderate inflammatory acne using this drug first time in topical monotherapy. This
      non-interventional trial will include a larger population of teenaged acne patients in order
      to establish the practical contribution of a new mini-questionnaire to the evaluation of
      adherence for the physician in the daily clinical practice in general and in young adults
      topically treated with Epiduo in particular. In addition safety and local tolerability
      profile of Epiduo are to be assessed under marketed conditions.
