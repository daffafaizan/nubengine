      I. To determine the response rate to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel and
      panitumumab in women with ER-, PR- and Her-2 negative metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability and toxicities of the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin
      and panitumumab.

      II. To determine the markers that co-occur with EGFR expression in the triple negative breast
      cancer.

      III. To assess the association between tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes (response and
      survival).

      IV. To examine the effect this regimen has on time to progression and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive
      panitumumab IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
