      algorithm on the radiologists' estimation of skeletal age. Currently, radiologists make the
      estimation using only the patients' radiographic images and health records. As part of this
      study, the radiologists will make diagnoses about their patients using the patients'
      radiographic images, health records, and the output of the CADx algorithm. The investigators
      wish to understand how radiologists using the Artificial Intelligence algorithm compare to
      radiologists who do not for the specific task of estimating skeletal age.

      This study is organized as a multi-institutional randomized control trial with two arms -
      experiment (receiving the Artificial Intelligence algorithm's output) and control (no
      intervention). Both of these arms will be compared to a clinical reference standard ("gold
      standard") composed of a panel of radiologists. The metric of comparison will be Mean
      Absolute Distance (MAD). The investigators plan to use statistical tests such as the t-test
      to determine any statistically-significant difference in skeletal age estimation between the
      two groups.

      The investigators hope to recruit and analyze data from a sample size of 1500 patients.The
      patients will not undergo any research procedures that deviate from the current standard
      practices.
