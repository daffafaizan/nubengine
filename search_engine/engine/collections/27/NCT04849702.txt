      rise in costs of treatment. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) was developed as a
      scoring system that does not only take the most severe complication into account, but all
      complications after surgery. Our aim was to compare the Clavien-Dindo scoring system with the
      CCI in predicting length of hospital stay (LOHS) and in-hospital costs after colorectal
      resections.
