      parameters (e.g. vital signs, laboratory values, previous illnesses), which in themselves do
      not necessarily have a pathogenic effect, but in a specific combination may have a high
      relevance for the patient-centered outcome.

      This project pursues as research goal the anesthesiological and intensive care risk
      reduction. To this end, the existing data sets of routine care are to be used to identify
      outcome-relevant patterns in order to derive recommendations for improving treatment in line
      with the patient's wishes. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Quality Indicators (QIs)
      in combination with the data of routine clinical care will be used as a basis. The approach
      outlined is closely linked to the development of quality-based treatment structures. In order
      to be able to offer medical treatment at a high level, associated processes must be known and
      operationalized, i.e. measurable. QIs (quality indicators) are an established instrument for
      measuring individual dimensions of treatment quality, and our clinic is a leading participant
      in this process at both national and international level (see Spies et al. Guidelines for
      Delirium, Analgesia and Sedation). The mapping of quality-based treatment structures as SOPs
      (Standard Operating Procedures) is also essential in this context (see Spies et al. SOPs in
      Anesthesiology and Pain Therapy, Thieme Verlag). By applying data science-based methods, this
      study pursues the overall goal of supporting the transfer of evidence-based findings in the
      form of QIs and SOPs into patient care.

      Numerous projects and sub-projects can be evaluated from this data set.
