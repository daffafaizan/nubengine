      I. To assess the efficacy of AZD0530, in terms of disease control rate (i.e., response rate
      and stable disease rate), in patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic soft
      tissue sarcoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity, time to progression, and response duration of AZD0530 in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD0530 once daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 8 weeks.
