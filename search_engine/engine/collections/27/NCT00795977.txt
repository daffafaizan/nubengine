      development of new treatment modalities is much-expected for cure of this disease. Dendritic
      cells (DCs) immunotherapy is expected favorable outcome when it is approached directly to the
      cancer tissue. To evaluate safety and immunological responses, we conducted a phase I/II
      study of intra-tumor DCs immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer patients.
