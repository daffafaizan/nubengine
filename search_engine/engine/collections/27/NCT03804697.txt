      August 2016 to August 2017 were randomly divided into selective anticoagulation group (SAG)
      and conventional anticoagulation group (CAG). SAG used anticoagulant when TEG indicated
      hypercoagulability while CAP used anticoagulant until one month after surgery regularly. Data
      including patients' basic information, postoperative complications, perioperative clotting
      index, intraoperative blood loss, perioperative TEG, volume of drainage, and blood
      transfusion were evaluated.
