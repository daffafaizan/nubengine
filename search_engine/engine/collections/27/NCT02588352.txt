      increase in mortality, intervention by lifestyle modification including the reduction of
      sodium intake could prevent subsequent increases in blood pressure and development of
      hypertension, cardiovascular disease and death. It would therefore be beneficial to have a
      simple method of identifying salt sensitive young adults so that risk factor modification can
      be achieved to prevent progression of the effects of hypertension on heart function.

      This study is a longitudinal pilot study to identify characteristics of salt sensitive young
      adults so that this population of people can be identified early on and appropriate lifestyle
      modifications can be made to prevent the subsequent progression of hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The study will be conducted at 2 visits separated by one week. At the first visit, eligible
      subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding childhood and current sodium
      intake.Subjects will be asked about family history of hypertension and cardiovascular
      disease. Subjects will also undergo blood pressure measurement in both arm, and will provide
      a blood sample and spot urine sample. Subjects will then be asked to take salt pills 3 times
      a day for one week, and then return to the study center for a repeat of the above
      measurements.
