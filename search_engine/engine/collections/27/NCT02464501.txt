    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel administration
      using the occlusion perfusion catheter (OPC) for the prevention of restenosis in
      infrainguinal de novo, restenotic femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal stenoses and occlusions,
      and in-stent restenosis. Subjects will be treated with the endovascular intervention selected
      by the treating physician in SFA reference vessels ranging from 4mm to 7mm in diameter and
      infrapopliteal vessels ranging from 2mm to 4mm. Following the achievement of optimal
      interventional results (less than thirty (30) percent residual stenosis without stenting) the
      OPC will be placed at the interventional treatment area and paclitaxel will be delivered to
      the treated segment. Data will be collected to assess acute safety, long-term safety and
      durability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel delivered with the ACT, Inc.
      OPC device.
