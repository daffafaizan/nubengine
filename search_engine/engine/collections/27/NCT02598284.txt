        1. Evaluate the ability of small practices in the investigators region to 1) implement
           point-of-care (POC) and population management (PM) quality improvement strategies to
           improve the ABCS, and 2) implement the popHealth quality measurement software to
           evaluate performance on the ABCS and allow regional benchmarking.

        2. Conduct a practice-randomized trial to determine a) whether POC strategies improve ABCS
           performance measures (i.e. aspirin prescribing, blood pressure control, cholesterol
           management, and smoking cessation counseling) compared to baseline, and b) whether
           adding locally-tailored PM strategies to POC strategies improves performance on the ABCS
           measures more than POC strategies alone.

        3. Deploy an open source quality measurement platform (popHealth) to establish a regional
           QI benchmark based on participating practice ABCS measures and enable longitudinal
           tracking of electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) across the investigators
           region. The investigators will perform a mixed-methods evaluation to examine changes in
           practices' perceived capacity for quality improvement and whether access to comparative
           quality data within a region improves the capacity of practices to sustain their quality
           improvement program around the ABCS and provides a long-term framework for practices to
           implement new QI activities.
