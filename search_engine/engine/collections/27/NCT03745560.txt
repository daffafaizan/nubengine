      study. Preoperatively an eABR is carried out, as well as before and after tumor resection.

      Postoperatively patients are fitted with a cochlear implant as routinely carried out. The
      postoperative hearing results with cochlear implant are correlated to the eABR results. The
      study is an observational study since eABR measurements are not part of the study. A
      correlation between eABR results categorized in three groups (good response, weak response,
      no response) with monosyllable understanding with cochlear implant (measured with Freiburger
      monosyllables test).
