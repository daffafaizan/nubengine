      increased longevity and changed the nature of risk factors for morbidity and mortality.
      Alcohol consumption has become an increasingly serious health issue among HIV primary care
      patients. Drinking is a key factor in progression to severe liver damage (especially those
      co-infected with hepatitis), and liver disease is now one of the most common causes of death
      among those with HIV. Excess drinking is also associated with medication noncompliance,
      reduces the effect of antiretroviral treatment, and is linked to other health problems.
      Therefore, helping HIV patients reduce unsafe drinking is crucial to their long-term health.
      The intervention combines the brief MI, an established, evidence-based counseling approach,
      with an innovative procedure designed to strengthen the effects of the MI. An effective,
      easily implemented alcohol-reduction intervention could be incorporated into standard care in
      HIV clinics helping prevent or slow the progress of some medical problems in HIV-infected
      individuals, improve medication compliance, prolong lifespan and decrease risk behavior
      associated with alcohol use.
