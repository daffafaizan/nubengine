      the muscles employed during the training and rehabilitation of the shoulder and trunk than
      traditional interventions such as cuff weights and Therabands. There is few literature which
      studied the effect of Body-blade exercises on neck problems. So there is insufficient
      evidence for their effectiveness on improving forward head posture.
