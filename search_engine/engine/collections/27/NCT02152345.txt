      250 renal transplants annually; of these approximately half are recipients of a variety of
      deceased donor kidneys, usually with cold ischemia time (CIT) >24 hours leading to an
      approximate incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) of 50%. The main focus of this study
      will be to determine whether initial immunosuppression with belatacept with Thymoglobulin
      induction will result in lower incidence and/or more rapid disappearance of DGF than that
      observed in patients who receive tacrolimus based immunosuppression. NGAL determinations will
      bne made in the first months after transplantation to correlate with clinical DGF.
