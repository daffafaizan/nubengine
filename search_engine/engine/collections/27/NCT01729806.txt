    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a recommended phase II dose for ipilimumab in combination with rituximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary information on the effect of adding ipilimumab to rituximab in
      regard to: immune response; clinical anti-tumor response/overall remission rate (ORR)
      (complete remission + partial remission); progression free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab followed by a randomized study.

      PART I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks
      for 12 weeks and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly for 4 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours
      once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.

      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-4 and ipilimumab
      IV over 90 minutes once weekly in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV
      over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-4 and ipilimumab
      IV over 90 minutes once weekly in weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV
      over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
