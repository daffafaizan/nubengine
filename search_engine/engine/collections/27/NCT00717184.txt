      (NPC). Recent small studies have shown that EBV specific cytotoxic T cells can be infused
      into NPC patients with some good clinical effect including tumor responses. We are trying to
      achieve a similar result using a less complex and less costly approach, with Natural Killer
      (NK) cells. NK cells are known to recognize tumor and virally infected cells through a
      variety of mechanisms. Also, NK cells influence the development of antigen-specific T cell
      responses via reciprocal interactions with dendritic cells and the secretion of IFNÎ³.

      This is a pilot clinical trial to study the feasibility of collecting, manipulating , and
      infusing autologous enriched NK cells activated by short-term incubation in IL-2.
      Leukapheresis units will be collected from eligible patients with NPC. NK cells will be
      selected and activated with IL-2 prior to re-infusion. Patients will receive low dose IL-2
      after infusion of activated NK cells. Post infusion monitoring will include peripheral blood
      T cell subsets, cytokine secretion and serum cytokine levels. The parameters will be
      correlated to clinical observations. If clinical efficacy is shown, our protocol could
      represent a simple way of harnessing the immune system of the patient for treatment of this
      disease. This study will also serve as platform technology development for later trials
      involving manipulating cell therapy products.
