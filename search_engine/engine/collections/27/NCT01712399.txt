      arthritis (RA), there is still a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects
      with this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of
      remission. This study is an open-label extension study for subjects who have participated in
      one of the qualifying development program studies with mavrilimumab. Participation in this
      study will allow these subjects to continue to receive long-term treatment with mavrilimumab.
      The data from this study will provide an evaluation of the long-term safety of mavrilimumab
      in adult subjects with RA. In addition, long-term exploratory efficacy outcomes such as joint
      damage and disability will be evaluated.
