        -  Determine the efficacy of temozolomide, in terms of response rate and safety, in
           patients with relapsed or progressive small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Assess quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      chemotherapy (chemosensitive at least 60 days after prior therapy vs chemoresistant less than
      60 days after or progression during prior therapy).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to each course of chemotherapy, at 30 days after study
      completion, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37-79 patients (14-33 chemosensitive and 23-46 chemoresistant)
      will be accrued for this study.
