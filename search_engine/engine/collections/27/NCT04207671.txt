      invasive thoracic surgery has evolved considerably over the last three decades. The concept
      of "tubeless" involves non-intubated anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation and no chest
      tube placement. Chest tube placement always causes pain, and its duration is known to be one
      of the most important factors influencing hospital stay and costs. Early tube removal allows
      patients to breathe deeply with less pain, which leads to more compliance with chest
      physiotherapy, as demonstrated by a concomitant improvement in patients' ventilatory
      function. Hence, more and more experienced surgeons choose the omission of chest tube
      placement after lung wedge resection. However, based on previous retrospective studies,
      residual pneumothorax was noted in about 10% cases, and some of them need re-intervention.
      Hence, the investigators designed a intra-operative two-lumen catheterization as improved
      drainage strategy. Therefore, this study evaluates the viability and safety of two-lumen
      catheterization versus omission of chest tube placement in patients with lung wedge
      resection.
