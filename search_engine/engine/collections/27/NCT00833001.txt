      as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with women's sex
      life. There are a number of different surgical procedures which are used to repair prolapse.
      Sometimes a mesh is placed in the pelvis to support the weakened tissues. There is a lot of
      research going on to find the most suitable type of mesh to repair vaginal prolapse. The
      GYNECARE PROLIFT + M* Pelvic Floor Repair system is similar to a mesh already used for this
      procedure called ULTRAPRO*, but is lighter in weight. Currently, ULTRAPRO* is only approved
      for use in hernia repair and is not licensed for gynecological procedures. This study will be
      the first clinical investigation of this mesh in vaginal prolapse.
