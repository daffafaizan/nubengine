    
      The Chronic Pain OneSheet (OneSheet) is an electronic health record (EHR) based clinical
      support tool that was developed and built in Epic. The OneSheet is a dashboard that was
      designed to assist providers in treating patients with chronic pain conditions, by providing
      an overview of patient information needed by providers when treating these patients. The
      dashboard does not provide new information to providers, but rather works by aggregating and
      structuring information that is already being collected, and that is available in other
      places in the medical record. By aggregating and structuring this information in a more
      convenient manner, the goal of the OneSheet is to make the information that is important in
      clinical decision-making more readily available, and to reduce the amount of time that
      providers need to spend locating this information.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether and how having access to the Chronic Pain
      OneSheet activity in Epic affects the ordering, prescribing, goal-setting, risk monitoring,
      and outcome measuring behavior of participating providers in visits with patients with
      chronic pain conditions. The investigators will also assess whether access to the Chronic
      Pain OneSheet results in primary care providers making chronic pain treatment decisions that
      are more concordant with the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain.

      To test this, researchers will conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) with 80 primary care providers (PCP) across two health systems. The investigators
      will assess outcomes by analyzing EHR usage log files and PCP ordering records extracted from
      the healthcare systems' clinical data warehouses.
