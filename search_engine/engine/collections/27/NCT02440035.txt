    
      This is a single-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), double-blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving) and Phase 1 study in healthy participants. The study comprises a 4-week screening
      period; vaccination for each participant on Days 1, 85, and, 169; a 28-day follow-up period
      performed after each vaccination and a final visit at Day 323 or 351. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the 4 treatment groups (Group 1/2/3/4) to receive either
      Ad35.RSV.FA2 or Ad26.RSV.FA2 or placebo. The study duration will be approximately 52 weeks.
      Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected. Participant's safety will be evaluated
      throughout the study.
