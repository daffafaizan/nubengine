      from a normal human breast tissue. To this end, 10 human breast tissue samples will be
      obtained from risk-reducing mastectomy in healthy premenopausal women with BRCA1 mutations.
      Tissues from 10 premenopausal women undergoing esthetic breast surgery with no family history
      of breast or ovarian cancers will serve as a control group. In order to isolate primary
      epithelial cells, human mammary tissue will be minced and enzymatically digested overnight in
      collagenase and hyaluronidase to yield suspension of epithelial organoids. These organoids
      will be collected and further digested with trypsin, dispase and deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNAse),
      will be filtered to generate a single cell suspension, resuspended in Hank's + 2% fetal
      bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1 mg/mL DNAse, and also incubated with a blocking antibody for 15
      minutes on ice.

      Cells will be treated with estrogen (E2) (10 nM) for 48 h and then will be irradiated for
      inducing double-strand break. Cells will be irradiated with 8 Gray (Gy) using a Co60 source.

      To accomplish our study, estrogen exposed and unexposed BRCA mutation heterozygous epithelial
      breast cells will be irradiated and 1 h later RNA will be extracted from the cells using
      Tri-reagent (Sigma). The RNA will be converted to a library of cDNA (complementary DNA)
      fragments and will be sent for deep sequencing in the illumina Hi-Seq platform.
