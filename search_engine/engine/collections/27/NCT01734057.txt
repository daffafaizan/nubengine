      of 240 primary ITP adult patients from 14 medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive recombinant human thrombopoietin (given
      subcutaneously at a dose of 300Units/kgfor 14 consecutive days, following with a flexible
      dosage depending on platelet count until the 28th day), combining with rituximab (given
      intravenously at a dose of 100 mg weekly for 4 weeks, i.e. Day 1, 8, 15, 22; the others are
      selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 40
      mg daily for 4 days). Platelet count was evaluated before and after treatment,in order to
      report the conversion ratio of primary ITP to chronic ITP.
