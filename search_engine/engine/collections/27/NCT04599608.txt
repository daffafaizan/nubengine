    
      This is a A Phase II multi-centre prediction study of the Curesponse Ex Vivo Organ Culture
      (EVOC) model in patients with suspected or confirmed advanced or metastatic malignancy.

      Patients with suspected or confirmed, advanced or metastatic malignancy in whom at least 1
      site is amenable for biopsy, and who would be planned to receive systemic anti-cancer
      therapy, where disease response can be measured by conventional imaging methods will be
      recruited for this study.

      Patients will undergo a research biopsy where up to 6 tissue samples will be collected.
      Patients will also have the option to provide an additional single blood sample for germline
      genetic testing. Patients will then attend their hospital clinical to receive standard of
      care anticancer therapy as discussed with their oncologist.

      Concurrently to the patients treatment, the tissue samples will be transported to the
      Curesponse laboratory for the development of the EVOC. The EVOC will be treated with a range
      of anticancer therapies, including the same treatment that the patient will be receiving in
      clinic. The model will predict whether the cancer will respond to the therapy. Additionally,
      providing the patient consents, the tissue will also undergo tumour gene profiling related to
      the secondary and exploratory endpoints and objectives.
