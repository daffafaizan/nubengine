    
      Trial design: Randomized controlled trial.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of adhesive glue compared to fast-absorbable running
      sutures on pain sensation following repairing perineal skin in cases of tears grade 1 and 2.

      Trial population: Women delivering vaginally at Emek Medical Center, and experience a
      spontaneous perineal tear, grade 1 or 2, or episiotomy.

      Trial course:

      Eligible patients will be asked to participate in this trial before perineal tear repair.
      Following providing an explanation about the trial, patients will be asked to provide written
      informed consent to participate in the trial.

      The patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio:

        1. Suturing the perineal skin of the perineum using fast-absorbable running sutures (Vicryl
           Rapide 3-0)

        2. Closing the perineal skin using adhesive glue- dermabond®. Other than skin closure, both
           groups will be treated similarly according to standard protocol used for perineal tear
           repair.

      Sample size In order to detect a reduction of 20% in the VAS (visual analogue pain score)
      within 2 hours of the procedure between the groups [from 40% to 20% in the running sutures
      and glue groups, respectively) with a level of significance of 95% (α = 0.05 - two tailed)
      and a power of 80% (β = 0.2) a sample size of 182 women (91 per group) is needed.
