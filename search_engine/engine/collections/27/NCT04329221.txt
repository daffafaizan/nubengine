      topical calcipotriol combined with 5-flourouracil (5-FU) treatment in organ transplant
      candidates with precancerous skin lesions called actinic keratoses (AKs) with a history of
      skin cancer in order to prevent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development after
      transplantation. SCC is the most common cutaneous malignancy seen after transplantation, with
      a 65-250 fold greater incidence in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) compared to the general
      population. This increased risk is due to the systemic immunosuppression caused by
      anti-rejection medications, which are indispensable for protecting against allograft loss.
      Previously, we have demonstrated the high efficacy of topical calcipotriol plus 5-FU
      immunotherapy for AKs on the face and scalp in significantly reducing the risk of SCC
      development within 3 years post-treatment in immunocompetent patients. This SCC risk
      reduction is accompanied by the induction of robust T cell immunity and TRM cell formation
      against AKs. Calcipotriol is a low calcemic vitamin D analogue that is FDA-approved for the
      treatment of psoriasis. Topical 5-FU is a chemotherapy that is the standard treatment for
      AKs. Our previous research demonstrates the synergistic impact of calcipotriol in combination
      with 5-FU on a robust T cell immunity against early skin carcinogenesis in immunocompetent
      patients. Therefore, we aim to determine the efficacy of this immunotherapy before
      transplantation in reducing the risk of SCC post-transplant despite the immunosuppressive
      medications.
