    
      The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of
      pharmacokinetically-guided, patient-individualized dosing and to obtain preliminary evidence
      of anti-tumor activity of intravenous ascorbate in combination with gemcitabine to inform a
      subsequent Phase II trial. Soft tissue and bone sarcomas will be studied as different cohorts
      given the differences in biology and historical responses to single agent gemcitabine in
      these disease types. As such, 10 evaluable patients per disease cohort will be included.
