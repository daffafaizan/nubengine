      arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for advanced hepatocellular
      (HCC). Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) antibody has been proved effective and safety
      for advanced HCC. There is no study about HAIC plus PD-1 antibody. Thus, the investigators
      carried out this prospective randomized control study to compare HAIC plus sorafenib and HAIC
      plus PD-1 antibody.
