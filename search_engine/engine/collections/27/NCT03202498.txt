    
      First-in-human clinical investigation with Yaq-001. This is a multicentre, randomized, double
      blinded, placebo controlled trial to intended to evaluate safety and tolerability of oral
      administration of Yaq-001 therapy in two dosing cohorts.

      56 cirrhotic patients with diuretic-responsive ascites will be enrolled. Patients will be
      randomized to two dosing cohorts.

      Cohort 1 (1:1 randomization)

        -  Standard medical treatment + Yaq-001 (4 g/ day) - n= 14.

        -  Standard medical treatment + placebo-control (placebo for 4 g of Yaq-001/ day) - n= 14.

      Cohort 2 (1:1 randomization)

        -  Standard medical treatment + Yaq-001 (8 g/ day) - n= 14.

        -  Standard medical treatment + placebo-control (placebo for 8 g of Yaq-001/ day) - n= 14.

      Study patients will be dosed daily with Yaq-001 (or an equivalent quantity of placebo) for 12
      weeks. Assessments of DSMB will take place after 4 and 12 weeks. Investigational centres
      specialized in the management of patients with liver cirrhosis will participate in the study.

      For each patient, the study duration will be up to 17 weeks, including the screening (up to 4
      weeks), treatment (12 weeks) and 7-day follow up period.

      The total study duration is estimated to be approximately 6 months from screening of first
      patient until study completion of the last patient.
