      in ventilated infants. Various modes of noninvasive respiratory support are being
      increasingly used to minimize the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of
      this trial to compare the effects of noninvasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation
      (NHFOV) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm twins infants as the
      primary mode.
