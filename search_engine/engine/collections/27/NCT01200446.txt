      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A study on the specific formula that is most effective
      in preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) has yet to be conducted in humans.
      Nevertheless, it has been shown that a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) metabolite, protectin D1,
      is involved in the active resolution of airway inflammation and that its concentration is
      greater in healthy control subjects' exhaled breath condensates as compared to patients with
      asthma during a clinical exacerbation. Supplementing asthmatics with DHA could enable an
      increased availability of protectin D1 to help resolve airway inflammation during an asthma
      attack. Furthermore, DHA is known to support a healthy cardiovascular system, maintain brain
      function, and reduce depression in addition to alleviating inflammatory diseases. Thus, pure
      DHA supplementation could help patients manage their asthma while providing for their overall
      health.

      The main aim of this study is to determine whether pure DHA can attenuate EIB and airway
      inflammation in adults with asthma. It is hypothesized that DHA supplementation will diminish
      EIB and airway inflammation compared to placebo.
