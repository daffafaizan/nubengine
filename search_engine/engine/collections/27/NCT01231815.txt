    
      Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to compare the quantitative (using 15O-H2O PET) and
      semi-quantitative (using perfusion CMR) assessment of coronary reserve to the presence of
      coronary artery lesions documented by multidetector CT coronary angiography.

      Methods. 30 patients with heart transplantation > 3 yrs will be included in two heart
      transplantation centers (Caen and Rouen university hospitals)

      Expected results.

        -  To demonstrate that quantitative analysis of coronary reserve using 15O-H2O PET allows
           the assessment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy

        -  To establish the feasibility of adenosine stress CMR in this population

        -  To show a relationship between coronary lesions demonstrated using MDCT and the extent
           of coronary reserve impairment assessed using cardiac functional imaging (PET and CMR).
