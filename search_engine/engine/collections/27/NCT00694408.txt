      Is it possible to avoid the use of corticosteroids in pediatric liver transplantation?

      3.3 Trial objectives

      This will be a pilot study to

      i) investigate to what degree a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen is as safe and
      effective as a steroid containing regimen following pediatric liver transplantation

      ii) investigate the effect of a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen on lymphocyte function
      and donor-specific immune responsiveness following pediatric liver transplantation

      iii) investigate the effect of a steroid free immunosuppressive regimen on expression of
      tissue markers of tolerance following pediatric liver transplantation

      It is hoped that this pilot study will be used to develop a definitive multicentre study of a
      steroid free regimen.
