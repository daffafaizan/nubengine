      clinical indicator to evaluate the status of a newborn, and critical to the correct guidance
      of resuscitation efforts.

      One of the knowledge gaps identified by the International Liason Committee on Resuscitation
      (ILCOR) is how best to assess ventilation during newborn resuscitation, and improved
      technology for rapid application of ECG.

      Laerdal Medical has developed a novel heart rate meter, NeoBeat, implementing ECG
      dry-electrodes in a snug-fit abdomen-shaped buckle for for rapid application on the newborn.

      In a multicenter randomized controlled trial the investigators will study the efficacy of
      NeoBeat on ventilation performance and short-term outcomes compared to standard care in
      newborns in need of positive pressure ventilation to initiate spontaneous respiration after
      birth.
