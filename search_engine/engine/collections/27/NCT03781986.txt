    
      This is an open label multi-institution phase I/II study with an initial randomized component
      then followed by a planned single-arm phase. Arms will be monitored using the time-to-event
      continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM). In the initial randomized phase, patients will be
      randomized to one of two arms: Arm A (APG-115 alone) or Arm B (APG-115 + Carboplatin) at a
      ratio of 1:2. After 14 patients have been accrued in Arm A and 28 patients have been accrued
      to Arm B, responses will be tabulated. The outcomes of the arms will be considered, and a
      single arm will be selected for further study in part 2 of the study. Response rate (defined
      as CR or PR after cycle 2) will be the foremost consideration for deciding on the most
      promising arm; in addition, a comprehensive evaluation of the available data including
      toxicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) data will also be considered. After an arm has been chosen
      to advance an additional 20 patients will be accrued.
