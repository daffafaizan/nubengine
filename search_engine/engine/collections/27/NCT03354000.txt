      instructions and 11 how-to videos for accessing features of an online patient portal. Using a
      deeply participatory approach, this curriculum was created in consultation with a patient
      advisory board from the San Francisco Health Network, a local Medicaid health plan. From June
      until October 2016, 93 patients with 1 or more chronic diseases were randomized to receive
      either: 1) an in-person tutorial with a trained research assistant versus 2) a link to view
      the videos on their own. The primary outcome was portal log-in (yes/no) between 3 and 6
      months post-training, assessed through a portal administrative dashboard within the EHR.
      Secondary outcome included baseline and follow-up survey measures on participants'
      perceptions of the portal use and their care, as well as views of the web-based lessons.
