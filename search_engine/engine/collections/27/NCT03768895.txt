      assessing their morphological characteristics and correlating them with the pathology found.

      A retrospective search was performed using a database of consecutive reports of 137 adults
      pelvis MRI examinations obtained at MRI center in Zaragoza.

      The investigators create a protocol for a retrospective review study, with the aim of
      analysis all the recorded MRI findings during this time. The criteria for patient inclusion
      were: Age > 18 years old, who had realised a pelvis MRI for any cause at MRI Center.
      Exclusion criteria included age < 18 years old, inadequate imaging quality, medical history
      likely to affect pelvic and hip morphometry: pelvic oncological disease, infection or
      inflammatory arthritis, postsurgical change disruptions, soft tissue abnormality, avascular
      necrosis, or pelvic and hip fracture.

      In all the images the investigators are going to measure the ischiofemoral space, quadratus
      femoris space, cervicodiaphysal angle and femoral version angle. The investigators evaluated
      different qualitative changes in the signal intensity of the quadratus femoris muscle as
      normal, edema, fatty infiltration or atrophy, and of the gluteus muscles as tendinopathy or
      atrophy, too.
