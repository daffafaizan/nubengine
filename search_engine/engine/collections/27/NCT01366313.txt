      groups. Determination of median effective (ED50) doses was performed by the Dixon and Mood
      up-and-down method. Initial doses were 1.5g and 5mg, with dose adjustment intervals of 0.5g
      and 1 mg, in the paracetamol and morphine groups, respectively. The initial doses of
      paracetamol and morphine were 1.5g and 3mg, respectively in the paracetamol-morphine
      combination group with dose adjustment intervals of 0.25g for paracetamol and 0.5mg for
      morphine. Analgesic efficacy was defined as a decrease to less than 3 on a 0-10 numeric pain
      scale, 45 min after the beginning of drug administration. Isobolographic analysis was used to
      define the nature of their interaction.
