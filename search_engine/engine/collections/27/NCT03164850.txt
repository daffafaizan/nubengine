      the evaluation of LTI. In the cases of sacrocolpopexy, often performed in conjunction with a
      hysterectomy, one of the most frustrating elements is the lack of tactile feedback at the
      level of the sacral promontory. The surgeon needs to open up the peritoneum and dissect the
      underlying tissue to expose the sacral bony structures and ligament without injury to the
      surrounding bowel, ureter or vascular structures. Sometimes, the sacral promontory is covered
      with a fat pad which makes it difficult to visualize the promontory and the "safe" space
      below the aorta and between the iliac arteries/veins is difficult to discern. A difference
      that is very easy to appreciate with an open procedure where one can easily palpate through
      the fatty tissues. That step is very critical for the repair and has the greatest potential
      for catastrophic error without tactile sensation. Because of the reproducibility of the
      surgical technique and target anatomy for this portion of the procedure, it was thought the
      sacral promontory dissection to identify and clear the anterior longitudinal ligament would
      be appropriate surgical procedure to evaluate the use of LTI.
