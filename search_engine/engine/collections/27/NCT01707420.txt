    
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effect of a
      preoperative oral dose of gabapentin on postoperative analgesic requirements and subjective
      pain levels in children undergoing tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy. Investigators will also
      look for a limited set of genotypic variations to explain any difference between individuals
      or groups in their response to the medication. Additionally, investigators will document
      potential adverse effects including excessive sedation, respiratory issues, surgical bleeding
      and emergence agitation/delirium.

      Investigators hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce opioid analgesic requirements and pain
      scores up to 36 hours post adenotonsillectomy without increased adverse effects such as
      emergence delirium, respiratory complications or bleeding. The clinical effect may depend on
      the individual's pharmacogenetic profile to look for a specific set of genetic polymorphisms
      that relate to the metabolism and effect of the study drug, gabapentin, and opioid analgesic
      pain medications.
