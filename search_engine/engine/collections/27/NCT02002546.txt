    
      Primary Aims: 1) Demonstrate that a 2hr delta troponin as measured by the i-STAT platform can
      reliably identify and exclude MI on the initial ED evaluation. 2)Demonstrate that a 2hr delta
      troponin is useful in the discrimination AMI versus non-AMI conditions in patients with low
      abnormal baseline Troponin-I values.

      Secondary Aims: 1) Demonstrate that a positive 2-hr delta troponin-I identifies patients at
      highest risk for 30 day ACE. 2) Other Secondary aims TBD.
