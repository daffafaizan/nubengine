      fraction (LVEF) post myocardial infarction benefit from the implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). However, retrospective analyses of the MADIT-II data have
      revealed a significantly increased morbidity and mortality in patients with appropriate ICD
      therapy: Appropriate ICD therapy is associated with 3.3-fold increased all-cause mortality,
      and the risk of a first heart failure hospitalization is 90% higher after 1st appropriate ICD
      therapy. Hence, the 1st appropriate therapy might indicate the necessity and utility of
      further clinical diagnostics and therapy in these patients.

      This trial is designed to (i) improve the knowledge of the group characteristics of patients
      suffering from 1st appropriate ICD therapy, (ii) but moreover to take additional therapeutic
      steps to reduce the mortality of this patient population.

      After standard ICD implantation procedure, the following steps are performed at the
      pre-discharge follow-up:

        -  Programming: VR-T: VVI 40 ppm, Onset 20%, Stability 20 ms

        -  DR-T: DDD 50-60 ppm, activation of IRSplus and SMART

        -  HF-T: DDD-BiV 50-60 ppm, achieve at least 85% biventricular resynchronisation,
           activation of SMART

        -  All devices: VT zone as therapy zone, VF zone. Programming recommendations for VT/VF
           zones to standardize treatment:

             -  VF zone: 200-250 bpm/ 300-240 ms, ATPoneshot ON

             -  VT1 zone: 167-200 bpm/ 360-300 ms, ATP ON

             -  VT2 zone: 120-167 bpm/ 500-360 ms, ATP ON

        -  Activation of Home Monitoring (HM) and online registration for HM service

      Standard Follow-up: Timing and scope of follow-up in patients without episodes is to the
      physician's own discretion and should follow the standard clinical routine.

      Follow-up after 1st appropriate ICD therapy: Immediately after having received the 1st
      appropriate ICD therapy, the patients have to be called to the clinic for intensified
      clinical diagnostics and, if necessary or useful, intensified therapy. Standard ICD follow-up
      has to be started within 72 hours after 1st appropriate ICD therapy.

        -  ICD interrogation

        -  General health status (weight, BP, NYHA)

        -  Laboratory tests (hemoglobin, Nt-proBNP, creatinine, GDF-15)

        -  Echocardiography (LVEF, LVEDD, mitral regurgitation)

        -  Non-invasive ischemia evaluation

        -  Coronary angiography (if indicated by ischemia evaluation)

        -  Upgrade to CRT, if indicated

        -  Ventricular ablation (if indicated: VT storm, slow VT, bundle branch reentry)

        -  24 hrs ECG Holter (Heart rate variability)

        -  Further treatment (if applicable)

        -  Changes in ICD settings, or medication

        -  Adverse events / adverse device effects

      Final follow-up visit: For patients without appropriate ICD therapy, the final follow-up
      shall be performed 12 months after enrolment.

      For patients with appropriate ICD therapy, the final follow-up shall be performed 12 months
      after 1st appropriate ICD therapy.

      The final follow-up visit comprises:

        -  ICD interrogation

        -  General health status (weight, BP, NYHA)

        -  Echocardiography (LVEF, LVEDD, mitral regurgitation)

        -  Laboratory tests (hemoglobin, Nt-proBNP, creatinine, GDF-15)

        -  24 hrs ECG Holter (Heart rate variability)

        -  Further treatment (if applicable)

        -  Changes in ICD settings, or medication

        -  Adverse events / adverse device effects
