      I. To determine whether chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) cleansing decreases central line
      associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in children with cancer or those receiving an
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CHG cleansing decreases acquisition of multi-drug resistant organisms
      (MDRO: vancomycin resistant enterococci [VRE], methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      [MRSA], etc.) in children with cancer or those receiving allogeneic HCT.

      II. To determine whether CHG cleansing in children with cancer or those receiving allogeneic
      HCT is associated with cutaneous bacterial isolates with reduced susceptibility to CHG.

      III. To determine whether CHG cleansing decreases positive blood cultures in children with
      cancer or those receiving allogeneic HCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive CHG cleansing with topical skin wipes once daily (QD) for 90 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive control cleansing with topical skin wipes QD for 90 days.
