      oppression. The new nation that emerged, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), remains an
      all-to-potent reminder of how human rights violations, and their related health and economic
      impacts, can devastate individuals, families and communities. The genocide in neighboring
      Rwanda, coupled with the collapse of the Mobutu government, has spawned two wars and over a
      decade of warfare throughout the region, resulting in millions of deaths in what is the
      deadliest conflict since World War II 1. The last decade has seen the use of rape as a weapon
      of war in the DRC, where rebels and soldiers subject women, men and children to brutalizing
      attacks, rape, torture, and mutilation. Survivors of the assault are often further
      traumatized by infections, disease, poverty, stigma and social isolation.

      The US plays a significant role in global health. It is both the largest funder of innovation
      in global health and the largest donor to care and support programs in sub-Saharan
      Africa-notably through The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and
      responses to humanitarian crisis, such as USAID funded programs in DRC. The effectiveness and
      sustainability of these efforts are limited by gaps in knowledge of the role of social
      determinants, such as poverty, social isolation, chronic stress and trauma, and limited
      access to health care services has on the health of women and families. To begin to address
      these gaps, our overall goal is to build the science base for large-scale implementation of
      economic programs to improve the health of survivors of trauma living in man-made and natural
      disaster settings.
