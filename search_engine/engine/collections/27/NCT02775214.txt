    
      Specific aims of this study include determining if there is a difference in the desaturation
      rates of the two different intubation techniques- Direct Laryngoscopy and the C-MAC video
      laryngoscope. Also is there a difference in intubation success between the two techniques,
      does intubation success vary with different training levels, and does desaturation rate
      differ among training levels.
