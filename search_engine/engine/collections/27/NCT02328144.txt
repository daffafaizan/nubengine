      placebo in pain control after hemorrhoidectomy.

      Material and methods: Controlled clinical trial, composed of 44 patients in a randomized
      manner, realized at the Coloproctology, Western Medical Center, Mexican Institute of Social
      Security. Referred beneficiaries adults were included, of either sex, who merited elective
      hemorrhoidectomy for hemorrhoidal disease grades III-IV using Ferguson's technique. They were
      assigned to receive metronidazole (study group) or homologated (control group) and the
      randomization was conducted by sealed envelopes and subsequently. We collected demographic
      and clinical variables. Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analog scale at 6 and
      12hrs, 1, 4, 7 and 14 days; additional analgesic use; complications; return to normal
      activity and patient satisfaction; also were measured, in a blood sample after surgery and 12
      hrs later, interleukin 6 and 10.

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
      frequencies and percentages
