    
      This is a nation-wide proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial conducted entirely
      remotely. Participation will last 6 months and entails:

        -  Completing a scripted onboarding call (approximately 30-45 minutes)

        -  Making a quit attempt

        -  Engaging with smoking cessation support (randomized) over the course of seven weeks, one
           week prior and 6 weeks following the originally chosen quit day

        -  Completing five online, REDCap-administered surveys, administered prior to the quit day
           (online, as part of a screening test), and at 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month
           follow-ups of the participant's chosen quit day

      The Aims of the study are:

        1. Test for differences between randomized groups on the primary outcome (i.e.,
           self-efficacy to remain abstinent, as measured via the Smoking Self-Efficacy
           Questionnaire), as measured at end of treatment (i.e., 6 weeks after the participants'
           chosen smoking quit day)

        2. Test for differences between randomized groups on secondary outcomes (as listed in
           Detailed Protocol)

        3. (exploratory) To test, via mediational modeling, how treatment via the proposed app
           conferred benefit; or, if not effective, if failure is due to the treatment failing to
           impact hypothesized mechanisms of change, or because these mechanisms fail to impact
           outcome.
