    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational clinical study for seeking out a better way
      to predict the pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced rectal
      cancer (LARC) based on the post-neoadjuvant treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.
      Patients who have been pathologically diagnosed as rectal adenocarcinoma and defined as
      clinical II-III stage will be enrolled from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
      University, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical
      College. All participants should follow a standard treatment protocol, including neoadjuvant
      treatment, total mesorectum excision (TME) surgery. Patients with LARC who received
      neoadjuvant treatment will be enrolled and their post-neoadjuvant treatment MRI images will
      be used to predict their pathologic response (pCR vs. non-pCR). The artificial intelligence
      prediction system and the expert radiologist will define the pathologic response as pCR or
      non-pCR, respectively. The pathologist will provide the final pathology report of TME surgery
      specimen (pCR or non-pCR) as a standard. The predictive efficacy of these two back-to-back
      approaches generated will be compared in this multicenter, prospective clinical study.
