      radiography remains the gold standard for confirming endotracheal tube positioning, however,
      ultrasonography can be a useful alternative. The objective of this study is to determine the
      feasibility of a combination of tracheal and thoracic ultrasonography to confirm adequate
      positioning of endotracheal tube placement in a cohort of critically ill participants
      including those with novel coronavirus-2019.
