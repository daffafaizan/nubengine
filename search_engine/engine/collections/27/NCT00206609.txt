      limited and include behavioural therapies such as relaxation, and pharmacological therapies
      such as opioids and anxiolytics. The latter are associated with problematic side effects in
      many patients. Inhalational oxygen is frequently administered but there are few studies in
      this population which define its role and benefits.

      Main Aim: To compare patient preference for inhalational oxygen versus air for relief of
      dyspnoea.

      Specific aims:

        1. To compare the patient preference for inhalational oxygen versus compressed air in the
           relief of dyspnoea.

        2. To compare the response to oxygen and air in improvement of dyspnoea in patients with
           advanced cancer.

        3. To compare the response to oxygen and air in improvement of dyspnoea in those patients
           with advanced cancer with documented hypoxia.

        4. To identify factors other than hypoxia which impact on the sensation of dyspnoea and its
           relief, when patients are administered oxygen and air.

      Hypotheses

        1. Oxygen improves dyspnoea in patients with cancer more than compressed air.

        2. Patients with cancer who are hypoxic are more likely than those who are not hypoxic to
           have improvement of dyspnoea with oxygen administration.

        3. The cause of the dyspnoea may affect whether dyspnoea improves more with oxygen than
           with air.

      Using a randomised, double blind, crossover study design, patients will be adminstered air
      and oxygen for 15 minutes and be asked to rate dyspnoea scores before and after each gas.
      Measures of oxygen saturation will be simultaneously measured, and finally the patient
      preferences for the gases will be sought at trial completion.
