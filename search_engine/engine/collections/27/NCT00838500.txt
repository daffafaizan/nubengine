      most advanced forms, with skin changes (CEAP clinical classes C4-5-6) affect 5% of the
      population and are those most often indicated for spa treatment. A venous condition is
      recognized as justifying spa therapy by 12 spa resorts in France. However, no specific or
      global benefit has been clearly scientifically shown for such therapy. One methodologically
      sound study (Carpentier 2009) demonstrated a benefit of spa therapy using a non-clinical
      intermediate endpoint (severity of skin changes). No study has shown efficacy of spa therapy
      in the primary and secondary prevention of the major and most common complication of advanced
      chronic venous insufficiency: leg ulcers.

      Vascular hemodynamics and in particular venous return from the lower limbs is subject to the
      laws of physics. Thus, the roles of the calf muscle venous pump and hydrostatic pressure in
      venous insufficiency rationalizes the use of balneotherapy techniques in the management of
      this pathology.

      The spa therapy techniques used in the context of venous insufficiency have well-defined
      physiopathic targets and the hemodynamic and microcirculatory effects of some of them have
      been demonstrated. The high degree of satisfaction of patients taking the waters annually for
      venous conditions indirectly testifies to their enhanced well-being. Among venous
      indications, the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome is one of the best recognized by the
      medical profession.Nevertheless, there has been no real validation of this indication with an
      acceptable methodology that meets the canons of evidence based medicine.
