      section may lead to catheter-related bladder discomfort with varying degrees of severity
      during the postoperative period. Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) symptoms
      associated with an indwelling urinary catheter are similar to overactive bladder symptoms
      such as discomfort in the suprapubic region, urinary urgency, frequency, burning sensation
      with or without urge incontinence. Hyoscine N-butyl bromide also known as scopolamine is a
      drug with anticholinergic effects which exerts its effects by inhibiting the acetylcholine
      effects in parasympathetic receptors of smooth muscle cells, secretory glands, and central
      nervous system. Hyoscine-n-butylbromide was reported to be effective for treatment of CRBD.

      More preventive than therapeutic drugs for CRBD should be investigated to improve patient
      comfort in all surgery patients with a urinary catheter.

      A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted to investigate whether
      hyoscine-n-butylbromide has preventive effects on early postoperative CRBD in patients with
      urinary catheters who will undergo elective cesarean sections.
