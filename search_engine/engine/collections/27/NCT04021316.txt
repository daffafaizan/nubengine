      least six months and are caused by a poorly functioning venous system. The affect about 1% of
      the general population and about 4% of those over 65. The wounds cause pain, reduced
      movement, and can smell - greatly affecting the quality of life of leg ulcer patients. The
      standard care for these patients is compression bandaging, which requires changing several
      times a week by community or district nurses; this drives the high cost of leg ulcer care,
      which can amount to Â£2.5 billion per annum.

      Skin grafting can be used alongside compression bandaging and can help the ulcers heal faster
      than compression alone. Grafts can be taken from the patient's own skin, from a donor or from
      tissue engineered skin. An autograft (using own skin) can cause scarring and the need for a
      formal surgical procedure in theatre so are not suitable for all ulcer patients. Allografts
      (donor skin) and xenografts (animal skin) have been used successfully, but present similar
      drawbacks to autografts, plus the potential for the body to reject the graft and disease
      transmission. Tissue engineered skin has several advantages as it has been processed to
      remove the cells, and therefore is won't be rejected via the immune response. Human
      decellularised dermis (DCD) is generated from donated skin from deceased people and processed
      to remove the cells. It can be glued or sewn onto the skin under local anesthetic, in an out
      patient setting. DCD has mainly been studied in patients with diabetic foot ulceration and
      has shown improved healing rates and quality of life.

      This study will investigate the use of DCD in addition to compression therapy versus
      compression therapy alone in patients with chronic venous leg ulceration.
