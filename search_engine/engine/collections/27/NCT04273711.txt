      more patients with high body mass index (BMI) are undergoing surgical procedures of all kinds
      and, in this context, obese patients are undergoing thyroid surgery more than ever before.
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether thyroidectomy can be considered safe in
      obese patients.

      Methods: Patients undergoing thyroidectomy in our Unit between January 2014 and December 2018
      were retrospectively analysed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with BMI < 30 kg/m2
      were included in Group A, while those with BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 in Group B.
