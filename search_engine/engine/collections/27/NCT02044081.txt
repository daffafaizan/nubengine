      adverse event monitoring, oral cavity assessments, targeted physical exams and vital signs.
      The study will also assess the study drug's ability to selectively reduce or eliminate
      specific bacteria in the mouth by comparing a liquid and gel product applied in different
      modes, such as mouth rinse administration and gel application using a dental tray, electric
      toothbrush or manual toothbrush administered over 7 consecutive days. Subjects will be
      followed for approximately 8 days after the last study drug administration for safety and
      microbiology.
