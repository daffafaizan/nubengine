      degree of disease involvement in each tertile was determined by assessing three parameters:
      villous edema, ulceration, and stenosis. Endoscopic remission was defined as CESI of <135.
      Mild inflammation was defined as CESI of 135-790, and moderate-severe inflammation as â‰¥790.

      HBI HBI was used to assess the clinical disease activity. Patients with HBI >4 were
      considered to have clinically active disease.[7]

      Blood analysis At the time of CE, patients provided a blood sample for measurement of
      hemoglobin, serum CRP, and albumin. Hemoglobin (normal ranges: women, 120-160 g/L and men,
      140-180 g/L), albumin (normal range: 35-55 g/L), and CRP (upper limit of normal: <8 mg/L)
      were determined by routine laboratory tests.
