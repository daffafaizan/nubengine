      reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies in at-risk women (at-risk drinking childbearing
      age women who are heterosexually active, and not consistently using contraception). The trial
      will assess feasibility of a dual-focused (i.e. contraception use-drinking reduction) brief
      physician intervention (DFBPI) and determine whether physicians, trained in DFBPI and
      monitored for compliance, can foster greater reduction of women's risk behaviors compared to
      standard care. The intervention is specifically designed to be deliverable routinely by
      Obstetrics and Gynecology physicians(OB/GYN) to large numbers of women at women's clinics.
