    
      Hypothesis A combination of lopinavir/ ritonavir, ribavirin and interferon beta-1b will
      expedite the recovery, suppress the viral load, shorten hospitalisation and reduce mortality
      in patients with 2019-n-CoV infection compared with to lopinavir/ ritonavir alone

      Primary objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy in mortality reduction with a
      combination of lopinavir/ ritonavir, ribavirin and interferon beta-1b in the treatment of
      patient hospitalised for 2019-n-CoV infection and compare this to lopinavir/ ritonavir alone

      Subject/patient definition: Recruited subjects include adult patients â‰¥18 years of age,
      admitted to the HA Hospitals from February 2020 onwards, with laboratory confirmed 2019-n-CoV
      infection. All subjects give written informed consent. Subjects must be available to complete
      the study and comply with study procedures.

      Study design: This is a prospective open-label randomised controlled trial among adult
      patients hospitalised after February 2020 for virologically confirmed 2019-n-CoV infection.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either a 14-day course of lopinavir/ ritonavir
      400mg/100mg twice daily, ribavirin 400mg bd and zero to three doses of subcutaneous injection
      of interferon beta-1b 1mL (0.25mg; 8 million IU) on day 1, 3 and 5 (depending on day of
      admission from symptoms onset) plus standard care, or a 14-day course of lopinavir/ ritonavir
      400mg/100mg twice daily plus standard care alone (2:1).

      Intervention/study article: lopinavir/ ritonavir, ribavirin and interferon beta-1b

      Primary outcome: Time to negative nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) 2019-n-CoV coronavirus viral
      RT-PCR

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Time to negative saliva 2019-n-CoV coronavirus viral RT-PCR

        2. Time to clinical improvement of NEWS2 (National Early Warning Score 2) of 0 maintained
           for 24 hours

        3. Length of hospitalisation

        4. Adverse events during treatment

        5. 30-day mortality

        6. Cytokine/ chemokine changes
