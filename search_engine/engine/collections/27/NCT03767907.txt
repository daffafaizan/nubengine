      Addiction and Mental Health Addictions Program will be randomized to receive either a
      computer-based training for cognitive behavioural therapy or treatment as usual for eight
      weeks. Participants will complete interviews, questionnaires, and other assessments (urine
      toxicology and physiological assessments) at week 0, at week 8, and at 6 month follow-up).
      Measures will assess alcohol and drug consumption, substance use disorder symptoms and
      associated features, quality of life, and healthcare costs.
