      stabilization of critically ill neonates in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).Recently,
      video laryngoscopy (VL) has become available in neonatal clinical practice to allows trainees
      and frontline providers to perform standard direct airway visualization (i.e., traditional
      laryngoscopy) while the supervisor can simultaneously view a real-time video displaying what
      the laryngoscopist is seeing. However, VL associated coaching during TI has not been
      rigorously evaluated.The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of video coaching
      training for neonatology attending providers on tracheal intubation procedural outcomes in
      neonatal ICUs. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the video coaching
      skill training for neonatology attendings reduces the occurrence of adverse tracheal
      intubation associated events among all tracheal intubations in neonatal ICUs over 2 years
      before and after intervention. The secondary objectives are to 1) determine if video coaching
      training is feasible to all neonatology attending physicians using train the trainer approach
      with a remote simulation and 2) determine if the video coaching skill competency among
      neonatology attending physicians who completed the training using a remote simulation
