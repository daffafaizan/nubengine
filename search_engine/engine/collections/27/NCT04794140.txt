      world, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7.2%-9%. Because some patients are resistant to
      multiple chemotherapy drugs, and there are differences in drug sensitivity between
      individuals, the current pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) chemotherapy effect is not
      satisfactory. In order to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and achieve precise treatment,
      it is important to establish an accurate and individualized PDAC research model.

      Because most of patients with PDAC have developed to advanced stage at the time of diagnosis,
      it is not suitable for surgery. That limits our ability to obtain tumor cells seriously. With
      the development of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) technique, it
      can be used not only to diagnose diseases, but also to provide specimens for molecular
      analysis and create valuable preclinical disease research models, so as to guide the
      selection of the most appropriate individualized treatment. EUS-FNB can obtain lesions
      without any treatment. Therefore, the preclinical disease research model established by
      EUS-FNB is more representative of the original tumor.

      However, compared with surgical specimens, the specimens obtained by EUS-FNB are smaller in
      size, which may affect the successful construction of research models in vitro. Therefore,
      the investigators plan to use EUS-FNB wet suction technique, a modified specimen acquisition
      method, to obtain PDAC tissue, and use it for primary cell culture, to explore the amount of
      tissue required for the successful cultivation of human-derived pancreatic cancer primary
      cells, so as to provide a prerequisite for the successful establishment of human-derived
      preclinical disease research model.
