      the postoperative course of a cesarean delivery 6-27% of the time. This complication, up to
      10 times more frequent than after vaginal delivery, can lead to serious complications.
      Additionally, cesarean deliveries are frequently complicated by maternal fever and wound
      complications including seroma, hematoma, infection, and separation. These morbidities can
      lead to significant delay in a return to normal function. Our study will randomize 1000 women
      who are about to undergo a cesarean delivery into one of two groups. The control group will
      receive the standard surgical preparation of the abdomen alone, the current standard
      pre-cesarean preparation. The other group will also receive a povidone iodine washing/scrub
      of the vagina before the cesarean delivery. Maternal and surgical variables will be recorded.
      At one months postpartum, maternal outpatient data will be reviewed and the incidence of
      postpartum uterine infection, wound separations, and other wound and infectious complications
      will be determined and compared between the two treatment groups.

      Comparison: Women receiving standard surgical abdominal cleansing versus women receiving
      standard abdominal and preoperative vaginal cleansing before cesarean delivery.
