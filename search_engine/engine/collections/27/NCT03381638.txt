      thus possible Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) aka Concussion, in addition to the current
      approved protocols, patients are scanned with the Blink Reflexometer. Results are not
      available until the end of the season, thus eliminating the potential of someone relying on
      the results. The Blink Reflexometer uses 5 puffs of air on the side of the eye over 20
      seconds. The air causes a blink reflex which is being correlated to a concussion. The results
      of the blink post concussion are compared to a baseline scan taken at the beginning of the
      season.
