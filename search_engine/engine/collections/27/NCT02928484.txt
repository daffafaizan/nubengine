    
      Sixty volunteers with functional GI disorders (Functional dyspepsia according to Rome-III
      criteria) will be recruited for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm
      parallel study in which the effect upon the gastrointestinal function of a probiotic mix
      containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (manufactured by Biopolis SL) will be compared
      with placebo (maltodextrin). The study design includes a 4 week run-in period, in which the
      volunteers will not consume any probiotics/prebiotics, followed by a 4 weeks intervention
      period (a daily capsule of placebo or probiotic) and an 8 weeks washout period. At the
      beginning/end of each period questionnaires in gastrointestinal function, dyspepsia related
      symptoms and diet will be carried out. A serum sample will be taken for cytokine levels
      determination. A faecal sample will be taken for 16S microbial population profiling and for
      determining the faecal levels of Bifidobacterium, Bacteriodes, Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia,
      Lactobacillus and Blautia by qPCR and the concentration of the main bacterial metabolites;
      acetate, propionate and butyrate by gas-chromatography.
