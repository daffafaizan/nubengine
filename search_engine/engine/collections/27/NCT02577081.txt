      and mortality. literature shows that around 10 percent of those who fracture their femoral
      neck for the first time will later fracture their contralateral neck of femur and in most
      cases with the same fracture characteristics. This study is based on a new technique
      developed in Ben Gurion University, with which investigators are able to asses the structural
      3 dimensional strength of a bone by applying a unique simulation on a CAT scan of the bone.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of a contralateral neck of femur fracture
      after the first neck of femur fracture and to estimate the potential fracture
      characteristics.
