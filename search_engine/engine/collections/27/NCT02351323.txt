      when we were able to increase recruitment. The following changes were made from initial to
      final study design:

        1. Study moved from Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) to clinical setting
           (Nutrition and Fitness for Life Clinic)

        2. Ages eligible expanded from 12-19 years old to 12-19.9 years old

        3. Ethnicity/Race expanded from Hispanic only to include all races/ethnicities

        4. Patients without a past family history of T2DM were made eligible

        5. Study period was shortened from 6 months to 12-14 weeks

        6. Number of required visits were reduced from 5 visits to 3 visits (all of which took
           place during regularly scheduled clinic appointments)

        7. Open labeled but still randomized

        8. Those in the Glutamine arm were provided lifestyles change intervention

        9. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) used instead of fasting Homeostatic Model
           Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)

       10. Non-fasting blood draw rather than a fasting blood draw was instituted
