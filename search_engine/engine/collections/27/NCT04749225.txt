      anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation to widen the surgical field and to ease undergoing
      surgery. However, a nasotracheal tube blindly passing through the nasal cavity may easily
      result in nasal cavity and oropharynx damages.

      The aim of the study is to investigate use which angulation including 45 degree, 70 degree
      and 90 degree is appropriate to assist the nasotracheal tube passing the nasal cavity,
      oropharynx, and advanced into the tracheal. Patients are randomized into three groups by 45
      degree, 70 degree and 90 degree to facilitate nasotracheal tube sliding through into trachea
      and compared with each other group.

      Hemodynamic changes in each time interval, each time taken of tube going through the nasal
      cavity, tube advanced from oropharynx into trachea will be recorded. The incidence of using
      the video stylet with different angulation to accurately place tube tip into trachea,
      intubation related side effects and complications are recorded at postoperative time stages.
