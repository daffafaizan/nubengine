      for the first 3 weeks of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 4 weeks.

      This is a 3 part study. Part A will evaluate enfortumab vedotin in subjects with
      histologically confirmed malignant solid tumors (excluding sarcomas) that are resistant or
      have recurred. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of
      enfortumab vedotin, investigator decision or consent withdrawal. Part A will follow a
      modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM).

      Part B, will evaluate enfortumab vedotin in 3 different expansion cohorts: 1) Urothelial
      cancer subjects with renal insufficiency defined as a Creatinine Clearance â‰¥ 15 ml/min and <
      30 ml/min, 2) subjects with Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and 3) subjects
      with Metastatic Ovarian Cancer. With the exception of the renal insufficiency cohort,
      enrollment into Part B will occur at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in Part
      A. Enrollment into the renal insufficiency cohort will begin at starting dose and escalated
      using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Subjects will continue treatment until disease
      progression, intolerability of enfortumab vedotin or consent withdrawal.

      Part C will evaluate enfortumab vedotin at the RP2D (determined from Part A) in subjects who
      have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in the metastatic
      setting. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of
      enfortumab vedotin, investigator decision or consent withdrawal.

      All subjects will be followed post-treatment every 4 months via disease assessment or
      telephone contact to obtain information on disease progression and death.
