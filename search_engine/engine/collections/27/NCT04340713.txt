      It has gradually become one of the most common malignant tumors of the urinary system in men.
      However, a large number of studies have shown that, patients with prostate cancer during
      hormonal therapy generally face the imbalance of high information demand and low information
      acquisition, which affects their mental health and quality of life, and even reduces their
      treatment adherence. Thus, the investigators designed a randomized control study in one
      cancer center in Shanghai. Prostate cancer patients during hormonal therapy were followed up
      in the urology clinic and ward of a cancer center in Shanghai from July to October 2019 ,then
      patients were randomly divided into control group and experimental group according to the
      order of enrollment. The control group was given routine information communication, and the
      experimental group was given information support program intervention on this basis. The
      effects of the intervention was evaluated after 3 months. The investigators expected that the
      information support program would be helpful to improve patients' self-efficacy level, and to
      enhance their confidence in self-management and coping with difficulties, so as to improve
      patients' adherence of health behaviors and improve their health-related quality of life.
