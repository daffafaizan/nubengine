      apical surgery . In a previous study, orthograde retreatments presented a success rate of 81
      % classified as healed and 93 % as no symptoms and fully functional. In a systematic review,
      it has also been concluded that endodontic surgery offers more favorable initial success but
      orthograde retreatment yields to a better long-term outcome . Although early results of
      single-visit treatments are contradictory ; Completing the treatment in a single appointment
      reduces the treatment time and cost, decreases micro leakage risk and avoids recontamination
      of root canals between appointments in multiple-visit treatments . Again, reviewing the
      literature concerning primary treatment showed that, no significant differences were observed
      in healing of periapical radiolucency between teeth treated in single-visit and those treated
      in two-visits. Even, after using calcium hydroxide for four weeks . The presence of a
      positive bacterial culture at the time of filling did not influence the outcome of treatment
      .

      Thorough online search revealed that, few studies are found concerning post- operative pain
      after single visit retreatment . The present study is designed to compare the effects of
      single-visit and two-visit root canal treatments on postoperative pain in retreatment cases.
      The primary outcome measure of this study is proposed to be whether single-visit root canal
      retreatment influenced the occurrence of postoperative pain as compared to two-visit
      treatment.
