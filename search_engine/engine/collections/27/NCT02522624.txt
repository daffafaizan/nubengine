      participants, health providers, community advisors, and health policy experts) to refine the
      DS tool through a series of individual semi-structured interviews. Next, the investigators
      will use their feedback to program the DS strategies into an online DS tool. After its
      initial production, the tool will be pilot tested with 30 individuals to assess readability,
      message clarity, format, and function of the tool as well as to test the randomized trial
      study procedures. Then, for Aim 1 part 2, the investigators will test the DS tool in a
      randomized trial with 362 participants eligible for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges.
      Half will use the DS tool and the other half will use the federal government site to learn
      about the exchanges. The investigators will use computerized random assignment to assign
      participants to study condition, after which they will all complete the same short survey.
      For Aim 2, the investigators will collect 40 stakeholders' feedback on likelihood of adoption
      and implementation of the DS tool to plan for dissemination and implementation. Stakeholders
      will be asked both open-ended and closed-ended questions in order to gather feedback about
      delivering the DS tool. These stakeholders will be different from those who were interviewed
      in Aim 1 as to ensure broader applicability of the DS tool.
