      population seen in an ambulatory environment, through the use of targeted and evidence-based
      health education messages regarding pneumococcal immunization and staff training on the use
      of gain-framed messaging.

      We hypothesized that there would be an increase in immunization rates for at-risk adults
      following implementation of the intervention.

      The objective of the project was to increase our local immunization rate by 30% (from 20% to
      50%) and to provide tools and processes that can be utilized in other ambulatory healthcare
      settings.
