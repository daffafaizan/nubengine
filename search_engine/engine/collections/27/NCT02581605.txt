      arthrosis. Osteotomy can be used to correct angular deformities around the knee. A number of
      studies have found that the success of this procedure in delaying the progression of knee
      arthrosis is highly dependent on an accurate of deformity correction.

      It is possible to produce a precise pre-operative surgical plan of the osteotomy required for
      a favourable outcome. However, the majority of surgeons still rely upon relatively crude and
      ipso facto unreliable intra-operative measurements to guide the actual operation. This is
      reflected in studies comparing the pre-operative plan with final outcome.

      So to facilitate accurate translation of pre-operative osteotomy planning to intra-operative
      execution, the investigator proposes to transfer two technologies that are already
      commercially available in arthroplasty into the filed of corrective osteotomy i.e. 3D
      planning and custom-made patient-matched cutting blocks. This will permit translation of the
      surgeon's pre-order to ensure precise intra-operative positioning. Once secured slots and
      holes in the cutting block will ensure that the bony cut and angular correction is performed,
      and secured with a plate and screws, in the precise location determined by the pre-operative
      plan.

      A prospective multi centre study is proposed, primarily to confirm the efficacy of use, and
      accuracy of deformity correction around the knee using patient-matched cutting blocks.
      Accuracy will be assessed by comparing post-operative alignment (measured on plan radiographs
      and CT scan) with the pre-operative surgical plan. Patient questionnaires to assess outcome
      will also be collected, and optional gait analysis performed.
