    
      A study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of temsirolimus and sunitinib in subjects with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC) (dose escalation phase). Once the MTD is determined, this study will also evaluate the
      efficacy of this combination by determining progression free survivial (PFS) at 12 months in
      subjects with advanced RCC (expanded cohort phase).
