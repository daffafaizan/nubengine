      will be assessed by the 6-minute walk test, spirometry, and questionnaires to evaluate
      quality of life. After fulfilled the series of assessments individuals will be randomly
      divided into two groups, with group 1 (control) will hold only one interval aerobic exercise
      program on treadmill and group 2 (intervention) will hold a combined exercise program for
      prior use of ventilatory support noninvasive. For both groups will be held an aerobic
      exercise program associated with resistance exercise for 12 weeks. The first two weeks will
      be considered in period. In the 10 weeks following both groups maintain the preset exercise
      program gradually. In the intervention group will be added before the exercise program the
      use of noninvasive ventilation for 30 minutes.
