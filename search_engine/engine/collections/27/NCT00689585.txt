      clinical trial for adults suffering from complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

      Twelve (12) subjects diagnosed with CRPS will be enrolled and randomized to receive orally,
      either ethosuximide or placebo. If the maximum trial medication dosage (1500mg) is reached,
      the subject will be in the study for a maximum of 10 weeks from screening (Clinic Visit 1) to
      the end of the drug cessation period. The minimum period a subject could complete the study
      would be 4 weeks presuming they were not previously on any disallowed drugs and only found
      the 500mg dose tolerable.
