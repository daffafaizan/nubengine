    
      Double design study including a clinical trial and a nested case-control study.

      A) Experimental study (clinical trial): Phase IV, prospective, randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled with 12 months follow-up. Inclusion criteria are: 1) diagnosis of DM2, 2)
      HF with preserved EF with a hospital admission in the previous 6 months with demonstration of
      diastolic dysfunction. 3) Stable clinical situation at inclusion. 4) Clinical indication of
      cardiac catheterization.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to received Dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo. The main
      objective is to compare the impact of the drug on LV diastolic properties at the peak of
      effort and in levels of plasma deposit and cross-linking biomarkers of type I collagen
      between the two treatment groups at baseline and after 12 months.

      52 patients will be recruited.

      B) Descriptive study: Nested case-control study, considering patients from the experimental
      study as cases and 10 additional patients with HF with preserved EF but no type 2 DM as
      controls. The main aim will be compare the histological, molecular, biochemical and
      biomechanical features of the HFpEF patients with and without DM2.
