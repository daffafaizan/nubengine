      filled in the department. The findings, outcome features and characteristics of follow-up for
      all cases with pleural diseases have been recorded in this database. The patient data,
      including epidemiological characteristics, smoking status, history of other diseases and
      co-morbid conditions, previous asbestos exposure, medications and additional physical and
      radiological examination findings, including computed tomography scans, both serum and
      pleural fluid laboratory investigational data and indications of invasive procedures, were
      recorded in the database mentioned above. The methods employed in the diagnosis of patients;
      any complications; characteristics such as the stages of diseases, treatments, and course of
      treatments; and results were also recorded in the database. From the date of the first
      database establishment, a "tissue, blood, serum, and fluid specimen bank" was constructed;
      tissue, blood, serum and pleural fluid samples of patients, which had been taken at the
      beginning of diagnosis process, were stored in this bank at -80Â°C. The blood, serum, and
      pleural fluid samples of patients were stored during the diagnosis process, and if conducted,
      pleural tissue samples taken during invasive procedures were also stocked.
