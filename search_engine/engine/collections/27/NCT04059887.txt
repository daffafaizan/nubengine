    
      Atezolizumab is approved as the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy by
      the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) and the treatment is available on the National
      Health Insurance Service in South Korea. Patients will be treated with atezolizumab until
      loss of clinical benefit or unmanageable toxicity as routine practice.

      In this study, the investigators will register patients who have a plan to be treated with
      atezolizumab as MFDS approval condition and meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
      investigators will collect study related information during routine practice and collect
      blood and/or tissue(optional) samples to conduct the study.

      Tumor assessment will be performed by investigator on the base of RECIST (version 1.1) and
      related information will be collected until disease progression for patients who have
      discontinued treatment. However, it will be collected until treatment discontinuation for
      patients who continue to receive atezolizumab following initial disease progression.
