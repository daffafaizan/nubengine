      age, and is associated with poor outcomes and rising costs, which emphasizes the need for
      prevention at earlier ages. To address this need, the investigators designed the ENCOURAGE
      Healthy Families curriculum; a program based on the scientifically proven U.S. Diabetes
      Prevention Program, and while data demonstrate a reduction in obesity and diabetes risk for
      mothers and their children, the investigators have encountered several barriers to widespread
      implementation, including:

        1. helping youth/families understand the importance of prevention,

        2. on-going interest and participation, and

        3. differing personal beliefs.

      Patient-centered research is needed to better understand what adolescents/families want in
      prevention initiatives, who should deliver program content, where and when to deliver
      programs in the community, and how adolescents/families wish to be informed of results. The
      investigators believe that by engaging patients and the community in the development process,
      the investigators will be able to obtain workable answers to these questions at a population
      level for high-risk youth/families in "real world" settings.
