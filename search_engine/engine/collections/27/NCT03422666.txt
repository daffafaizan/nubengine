      advertisements. Each subject will be their own control, receiving both placebo and
      teduglutide, administered on separate occasions. A member of the study team will explain the
      study in detail on visit 1, and if the individual is interested in participating, informed
      consent will be obtained and preliminary screening will occur on visit 2. On visit 3 & 4
      participants will receive a high fat liquid meal after an overnight fast. Hourly blood
      samples will be taken for 5 hours, followed by randomized assignment to receive either
      subcutaneous placebo or teduglutide at visit 3 and the opposite treatment at visit 4.
      Following the injection, blood samples will be taken every 15 minutes for the first hour and
      every 30 minutes for the subsequent 3 hours.
