      that will enroll a total of 1,548 patients at up to 80 sites in the US. The ENDEAVOR IV Trial
      will assess if the Endeavor stent is equivalent in safety and efficacy to the Taxus stent for
      the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a RVD of 2.5-3.5 mm.
