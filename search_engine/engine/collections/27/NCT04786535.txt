    
      A controlled, randomized, crossover clinical trial is planned to compare the magnitude of the
      B2-microglobulin reduction rate in three different extracorporeal therapies (ETs): HDc, HDx,
      and HDF.

      The selection of study subjects will be consecutive and for convenience

      This study will be divided into six periods: three treatment periods (one for each therapy to
      be compared) and three of "washout" periods (interspersed between the treatment periods). The
      treatment periods will last four weeks (12 ET sessions, three per week) and will be preceded
      by a one-week washout period (three ET sessions)

      After inclusion in the protocol, patients will be randomly assigned (with the help of a table
      of random numbers) to one of three ETs to be evaluated (HDc, HDx, or HDF). Afterwards, the
      first washout period will begin with high-flow conventional hemodialysis (HDc). At the end of
      the first washout period, the ET randomly assigned to one of three ETs to be evaluated (HDc,
      HDx, or HDF), following the sequence: Washout 1 -> Period 1 (HDC, HDx, or HDF) -> Washout 2
      -> Period 2, etc.

      For each period of ET, there will be two sampling times: baseline and final

      Blood samples will be obtained through the arterial port of the extracorporeal circuit, at
      the beginning and at the end of the ET session. The "slow flow" method will be used (UF: 0
      mL/min, Qd: 0 mL/min, and Qb: 100 mL/min, for 30 seconds, before extracting the sample from
      the arterial port) (24). Blood samples will be collected in dry tubes (without anticoagulant)
      and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 RPM. The supernatant will be divided into three
      aliquots and stored at -70°C for further processing.

      To calculate sample size, the formula for a noninferiority study was used (Pharmaceutical
      statistics. 2016;15(1):80-9), which is detailed below:

      n= ((r+1) (Z_(1-β)+Z_(1-α) )^2 σ^2)/(r((μ_A-μ_B )-d_NI )^2 )

      The terms above, are substituted with values obtained from the publication of Kirsch et al.
      (Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2017 Jan 1;32(1):165-172) as follows:

      Objective: Non-inferiority (Ho µA - µB ≤ -dNI vs. µA - µB > -dNI) Outcome: B2-microglobulin
      reduction rate. r: allocation ratio by group:1 beta: type II error (90% power):1.2816 alpha:
      type I error (level of significance 5%):1.960 (variance in the population):1.33 µA - µB
      (magnitude of the observed effect):80.6 - 78.5 = 2.1 dNI (non-inferiority limit): 3.5

      n= ((1+1) (1.2816+1.960)^2 〖(1.33)〗^2)/(1((2.1)-3.5)^2 )= 19, we estimate a 20 % loss in the
      follow-up , then we consider a sample size of n = 23 patients

      The nominal variables will be presented in frequencies and proportions. Continuous numerical
      variables will be analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov "Z" test to determine their
      distribution. The results will be shown as the means ± standard deviation in case of normal
      distribution and as a median with minimum and maximum limits for variables with non-normal
      distribution.

      The total serum concentration of the biochemical variables in general as well as the uremic
      toxins will be analyzed. Additionally, the reduction rate and purification of the uremic
      toxins will be analyzed.

      The analyses of the inter- and intra-group differences will be performed using the one-way
      multiple comparisons (ANOVA) method. Post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni method will be
      used in cases where the groups present a normal distribution; otherwise, the Kruskal-Wallis
      method will be used. A result with a p < 0.05 will be considered significant
