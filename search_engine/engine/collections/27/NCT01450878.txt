      numerous studies have demonstrated that EPO is not only involved in erythropoiesis but also
      exerts pleiotropic effects on cells. Among these, one of the most exciting is its role in the
      prevention of ischemic-reperfusion lesions such as after acute ischemic injury of the brain
      or the heart. However, most of these studies were carried out in animal models and no
      definitive proof exists today to demonstrate that EPO has similar beneficial effects in human
      pathology. Kidney transplantation is one ischemic situation where EPO pleiotropic effects
      could be of great interest since ischemic-reperfusion lesions have been involved in delayed
      graft function and impaired graft outcomes.

      The aim of this prospective randomized double blind study is to assess the effect of 100 000
      UI of béta-epoiétin on kidney graft function, given to the deceased donor one hour before the
      retreaval of the organ. Recipients will be followed for three months in order to evaluate
      kidney function (glomerular filtration rate) and the number of acute rejection episodes to
      determine whether beta-epoietin could modify the immunogenicity of the graft.
