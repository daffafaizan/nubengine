    
      Analysis of the effectiveness of azacitidine 6 months after start of therapy to prevent a
      hematological relapse in MDS or AML patients with significant residuals or an increase of
      minimal residual disease (MRD) which is defined as:

        -  decrease of CD34 donor chimerism (<80%) after allogeneic related or unrelated HSCT in
           CD34+ or CD117+ MDS or AML or

        -  increase in the AML-specific molecular markers in the quantitative PCR for t(6,9), NPM1+
           AML >1% (ratio to reference gene) after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT or

        -  persistence of the (above) MRD level >1% after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic
           HSCT

        -  tolerance of azacitidine

        -  quality of the response of the MRD (major vs. minor) and the relapse-free survival and
           overall survival 12, 24 and 30 months after starting treatment with azacitidine

        -  modulation of CD34+, NK- and T-cells of MDS and AML patients by azacitidine
