      laryngoscopy, However, it may aggravate cervical spine injury. The Trachway® video stylet is
      an intubating device that may avoid cervical movement during intubation. Nonetheless, the
      effectiveness of limited neck movement in patients with neutral head or head-lift position
      using the Trachway® video stylet remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare
      the intubation time of the two positions with the Trachway® video stylet.
