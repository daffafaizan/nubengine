      of remifentanil with stepwise increase in infusion rates and Group II- demand bolus only with
      stepwise increase in bolus dose, as per the patient's analgesic requirement. Visual analog
      scores will be the primary outcome. Maternal and fetal side effects will be recorded. The
      results of this study will determine the regimen that suits the patients needs for painless
      labor with high efficacy, less adverse effects and a higher patient satisfaction.
