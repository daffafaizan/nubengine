      many patients with high-risk disease (as determined by gene array studies - studies that look
      at specific genes using special equipment) tend to have shorter remissions (disappearance of
      signs and symptoms of myeloma) and do not survive as long as participants with low-risk
      myeloma. The Total Therapy approach to treatment carried out at the Myeloma Institute where
      multiple chemotherapy agents are given as induction followed by a stem cell transplant,
      post-transplant consolidation, and maintenance therapy has proven to be the best available
      treatment strategy. However, the availability of new treatments that work in different ways
      offers the possibility of improving the effectiveness of Total Therapy treatment while
      potentially reducing the number of side effects patients' experience. Daratumumab is a human
      monoclonal antibody or protein drug. It recognizes a specific protein, CD38, which is found
      at high levels on multiple myeloma cells. An antibody is something that finds and kills
      foreign objects in your body, in this case, myeloma cells. The other drugs that will be used
      in the study treatment regimen include carfilzomib or bortezomib, thalidomide, lenalidomide,
      dexamethasone, cisplatin, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone.
