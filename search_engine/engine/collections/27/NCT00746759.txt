      diagnostic tool measuring global gene expression in airway epithelial cells obtained at
      routine bronchoscopy in suspect lung cancer patients. The test, which is highly sensitive and
      specific for lung cancer, measures the levels of expression of genes in cells brushed from
      the large bronchi during diagnostic bronchoscopy. Similar brushings of epithelial cells from
      the nose will be analyzed to determine if gene expression in these cells can be used as a
      screening tool in subjects who may have now or be at risk for developing lung cancer in the
      future.
