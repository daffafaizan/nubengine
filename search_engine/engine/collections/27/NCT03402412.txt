    
      Patients will be scored with Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Eczema Area and Severity
      Index (EASI), SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to
      assess disease severity. The investigators will measure trans epidermal water loss (TEWL),
      take bacterial swabs for analysis of the microbiome and culture for Staphylococcus aureus and
      test for mutations in the filaggrin-gene by sputum samples. Blood serum samples will be taken
      to measure serum (s) -Immunoglobulin E, s-vitamin D status, full blood count including white
      cell differential and different cytokines. Any history of allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis
      or food allergy will be noted as well as any recent history of sun exposure, use of tanning
      beds or UVB-therapy.

      The suberythemal dose of UVB for each patient will be established. In each patient two
      contralateral areas (e.g. both underarms) with eczema will be chosen, which are as similar as
      possible regarding distribution and severity. One area will be biopsied with a 4mm punch
      followed by locally treatment with nb-UVB (311nm) three times. In this way the untreated side
      will serve as an internal control. Both sides will be biopsied after these initial three
      rounds of treatment. The patients will then undergo 24 standard full-body nb-UV-treatment
      sessions followed by a new biopsy of the same area. Skin from non-lesional sun-protected skin
      from nates will also be samples prior to and after UVB-treatment.
