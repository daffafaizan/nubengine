      occurs in 30-50% of cases, with highest rates in radio-cephalic fistulas. Inflammatory
      cytokines are involved in this process of nonmaturation. By suppressing inflammation,
      corticosteroids might promote maturation, but have significant systemic side effects.
      Liposomal prednisolone has a long circulation time and targets inflamed tissue with low
      systemic concentrations and limited side effects. In an animal study, it was demonstrated to
      promote AVF maturation. At present, no drug therapy aimed at improving shunt maturation is
      available. This study will investigate if liposomal prednisolone is effective in promoting
      AVF maturation when administered to human subjects after surgical creation of a
      radio-cephalic AVF.
