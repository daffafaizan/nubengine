    
      This trial is being conducted in patients with indolent (or low-grade) non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma, who have either relapsed or been refractory to previous treatment.

      Pixantrone belongs to the DNA intercalator family of chemotherapy agents, which includes
      anthracyclines. DNA intercalators are commonly used to treat patients with indolent NHL,
      often in combination with the monoclonal antibody rituximab. This study represents the first
      large-scale, comparative trial in indolent NHL, designed to determine whether the response
      rate and time to tumour progression in patients treated with a combination of rituximab and a
      DNA intercalator, is significantly higher than seen in patients treated with rituximab alone.

      This trial is randomized and controlled, which means that participating patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:

        1. Patients treated with both pixantrone and rituximab, in combination

        2. Patients treated with only rituximab

      This trial is expected to recruit around 800 patients in the US, Europe and Israel, with 400
      patients recruited to each group.

      Patients will be treated for around 18 weeks and will recieve regular physician monitoring
      for five years from the end of treatment.
