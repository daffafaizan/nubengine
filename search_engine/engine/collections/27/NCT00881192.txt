    
      RCT including patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery (with or without associated
      procedures) and having a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35. Exclusion criteria: age <
      18 years, no patient's consent, contra-indications to the use of IABP (severe peripheral
      arteropathy; endovascular abdominal aortic prostheses).

      Patients will be randomly allocated to either a control group or a treatment group. Patients
      in the control group will not receive an IABP preoperatively, and patients in the treatment
      arm will receive an IABP positioned immediately after the induction of anesthesia and before
      beginning surgery.

      Randomization will be performed the day before the operation. Primary endpoint: reduction of
      major morbidity rate (defined as either prolonged (> 48 hours) mechanical ventilation, acute
      renal failure, mediastinitis, surgical revision, stroke).

      Secondary endpoint: reduction in inotropic drug use, shortening of mechanical ventilation and
      ICU stay.

      Interim analyses and stopping rules: interim analyses will be done at half (80 patients)and
      2/3 (106 patients) of recruitment. The trial could be prematurely stopped in case of a
      difference in the primary endpoint reaching a P value of 0.005 at the first analysis, and
      0.01 at the second.A specific stopping rule is settled for operative mortality (30 days) at
      0.01 at the first interim analysis and 0.05 at the second interim analysis. Given the
      invasive nature and the costs of the intervention, a stopping rule for futility was settled
      in case of a lack of difference for the primary outcome. This was settled at a relative risk
      for the primary outcome not including the hypothesized value of 0.5 within 99% CI at the
      first interim analysis and 95% CI at the second.
