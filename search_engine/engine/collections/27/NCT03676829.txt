    
      Purpose: The primary aims of this study are to determine if arterial embolization of the
      shoulder will reduce the severity of pain as well improve Range of Motion (ROM) caused by
      adhesive capsulitis and if it can be performed safely. The secondary aim is to determine if
      AES can result in the decreased necessity for ongoing conservative therapies, such as
      medication therapy and joint injections.

      Participants: Twenty patients with adhesive capsulitis, resulting in shoulder pain that is
      refractory to conservative therapies, who are not planning to undergo surgery within 6
      months.

      Procedures (methods): This will be an open label 24-month pilot study with a small population
      undergoing AES to determine safety and efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will
      consist of a preoperative screening assessment to determine if the potential study subject
      meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for arterial
      embolization of the shoulder, and follow-up visits at 24 hours, 1, 3 & 6 months. An MRI will
      be performed at the 1-month visit to detect a change in capsular vascularity and to exclude
      complication.
