      controls. Due to drop outs we calculate a need of inviting at least 250 patients with
      colorectal cancer. We will use controls from an ongoing epidemiological study of sleep apnea
      in the population.

      Exclusion: Dementia, CPAP treated sleep apnea Methods: Patients are investigaged before
      surgery with Lung-function measurements, blood-gas sample, questionnaire, Overnight
      polysomnographic sleep apena recordings including oro-nasal airflow, thoraco-abdominal
      respiration belts, chin-EMG, EOG, EEG, ECG (V5) and body position.

      Outcome variables: complications of surgery including anastomosis insuficiency and wound
      infections. Short and long term mortality, Sleep apnea, hypxoia, hyprecapnia and effect on
      lungfunction (VC, FEV1). Detailed morphologic analysis of cancer type.

      Controls will be age and BMI matched from the population with exclusion of dementia and CPAP
      treated subjects

      Investigations after surgery Inclusion: 100 patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for
      open or minimally invasive surgery surgery, Exclusion: Dementia, CPAP treated sleep apnea
      Methods: Patients are investigaged before and 2 days after surgery with Lung-function
      measurements, blood-gas sample, questionnaire (only before surgery), Overnight
      polysomnographic sleep apena recordings including oro-nasal airflow, thoraco-abdominal
      respiration belts, chin-EMG, EOG, EEG, ECG (V5) and body position.

      Outcome variables: Effect on sleep apnea, sleep parameters, blood-gas and lungfunction before
      and after surgery. Complications of surgery including anastomosis insuficiency and wound
      infections. Short and long term mortality. Detailed morphologic analysis of cancer type.
