      or palm (these are called "autologous skin fibroblasts"), multiply them in the lab, inject
      the cells (now called a "graft") back into the same person but at a different site of skin
      like the buttock, and then eventually remove the injected cells to see if they caused the
      skin to change.

      Investigators hope that information from this study will help with problems like skin
      break-down in patients with amputations and prosthetics. The skin at their stump was not
      meant to withstand the pressure and friction of prosthetics and this study is the first step
      in trying to convert stump skin to palm/sole-like skin.
