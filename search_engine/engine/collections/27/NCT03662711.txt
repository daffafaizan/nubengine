      comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular, which increase its severity. Chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease affects 5% of people globally, increasing to 10% in the elderly. According
      to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), there were 384 million cases of COPD in
      2010, with a global prevalence of 12% (www.who.int). Deaths due to COPD are 3 million/year
      globally (GOLD 2018) and >20,000/year in Italy.

      The investigator speculated that multimorbid elderly COPD patients recently hospitalized due
      to an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and who have concomitant cardiovascular disease may
      have fewer re-hospitalizations and increased survival in the following year if treated with
      LABD+ICS rather than with LABD alone.

      The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of currently recommended and
      prescribed inhalation therapies to elderly, frail and multimorbid COPD patients with a recent
      hospitalization due to an AECOPD. The study involves a group of patients who have never
      before been selected for a clinical trial and who represent the 5th most common cause of
      hospitalization and the 3rd most common cause of death in Italy.
