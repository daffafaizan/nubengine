    
      Secondary study endpoint:

        -  Correlation between adverse events and radiation doses with biologic, phenotypic and
           genetic data.

        -  Evaluation of T-lymphocyte apoptosis to predict radiation-induced late toxicity

        -  Gene associations with risks for adverse events related to radiotherapy

        -  Levels of circulating microparticles and bystander effect after irradiation

      Inclusion criteria:

      Consecutive patients treated for a prostate adenocarcinoma in the radiation department of the
      Jean MONNET Hospital between 2000 and 2006.

      Potential. Better identification of patients at high risk of adverse events related to
      radiotherapy.
