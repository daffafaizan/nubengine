      Thus, providing oral and denture hygiene care instructions after denture delivery is crucial
      for prevention of oral diseases. A mobile application was developed using the progressive web
      application technology for chairside education and to serve as a reference material. The
      effect of the mobile application on patient's dental knowledge compared to the conventional
      method was evaluated using a knowledge questionnaire administered before and after education.
      The knowledge scores obtained were analysed using the Two-way mixed ANOVA test. Patients'
      oral hygiene was assessed by comparing the Silness and Loe Plaque Index and Gingival Index
      scores before and after education. Denture hygiene was evaluated by comparing the denture
      plaque score before and after education. Statistical analysis of the Plaque Index, Gingival
      Index and denture plaque score was done using Mann-Whitney U Test and Friedman Test.
