        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with newly
           diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, temozolomide, and
           erlotinib hydrochloride.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42 and undergo concurrent
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Four weeks after
      completion of radiotherapy and temozolomide, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on
      days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride once daily beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy and continuing in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
