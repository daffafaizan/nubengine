    
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the adhesion of the test product when
      compared to the reference product following a single transdermal application.

      The following evaluations will be assessed as "yes" or "no":

        -  Cold flow (dark ring formed around the patch)

        -  Patch movement/displacement

        -  Patch wrinkling

        -  Residue formation (at patch application on the release liner and at patch removal on the
           skin) Safety and tolerability of a single dose application of a patch containing 18 mg
           rotigotine (Test) against a patch containing 18 mg rotigotine (Reference) will be
           evaluated in terms of vital signs and AEs.

      AEs and clinical tolerability will be monitored at all clinical trial visits. The safety
      evaluation will be based upon the review of the individual values (potentially clinically
      important abnormalities) and descriptive statistics (summary tables, graphics).

      As additional safety parameters for the clinical trial physical examination findings,
      clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead ECGs will be assessed at the screening and
      follow-up.
