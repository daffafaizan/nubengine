    
      "Leaky gut" - or, increased permeability of the intestine - involves the leakage of certain
      intestinal constituents (e.g. endotoxins or even bacteria) from the gut into the rest of the
      body. This condition is associated with many widespread diseases including coeliac disease,
      inflammatory bowel disease, HIV, liver cirrhosis, sepsis and environmental enteric
      dysfunction (EED). It has a considerable impact on quality of life and, in extreme cases
      (e.g. sepsis), it can even lead to death. Furthermore, in the developing world (as part of
      EED), it severely hampers the mental and physical development of young children. Thus, new
      devices that can help us to learn more about leaky gut and more accurately monitor its
      effects are urgently needed.

      In this project, patients will drink a small dose of a fluorescent dye. Then, by shining
      light on the patients' skin and recording the color and brightness of the light
      (fluorescence) that comes back, it will be possible to measure the amount of dye that has
      leaked into the blood (indicating the likelihood that bacteria are escaping from the gut and
      causing infections). We refer to this as a "Spectroscopic gut permeability test." We will
      also ask patients to take a traditional permeability test (known as a PEG permeability test)
      so that we can validate our new sensor. Overall, this research will deliver vital information
      that will improve our understanding of leaky gut and help guide the development of treatments
      for the many diseases in which it occurs.
