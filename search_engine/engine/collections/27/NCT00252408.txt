      and changes in bone mineral density, and side effects.

      The project was designed as a comprehensive cohort trial. One group accepted randomisation,
      and was randomised to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or not (no placebo used).

      502 were randomised to HRT, and 504 were randomised to no HRT) One group was allowed to
      choose HRT or not. A total of 221 chose HRT, and 789 chose no HRT.

      First line HRT was oral sequential oestradiol/norethisterone in women with intact uterus and
      oral continuous oestradiol in hysterectomised women.

      The study was initiated in 1990, and inclusion ended in 1993.
