      repetitive intense training required for rehabilitation of fine motor recovery. There are
      also limited interventions are available for home use after discharge from a rehabilitation
      centre. Hence, there is now a need to determine the feasibility of innovative strategies for
      home use, to cover the gap after discharge from rehabilitation institutions.

      iHOME is an original, low cost, potentially high impact intervention to fulfil this gap. If
      proven to be effective, the use of tablet technology has a broad range of potential outcomes
      and benefits. The anticipated public benefit is for stroke patients to be able to potentially
      employ the iPad, an accessible technological device, as an expansion of rehabilitation in an
      in-home setting.

      iHOME is a pilot randomized controlled trial with a blinded outcome assessment. The trial is
      subdivided into iHOME Acute and iHOME Chronic, where patients have had a stroke less than 3
      months or more than 6 months ago, respectively, at the time of randomization. Participants
      will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the interventions arms (i.e. the investigational
      and control group).
