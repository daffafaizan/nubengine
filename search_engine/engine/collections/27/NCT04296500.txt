      treatment strategies for inflammatory bowel disease patients. However, variability in pattern
      identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)/Traditional East Asian Medicine (TEAM)
      has been criticised. Using data of patients who achieved and maintained clinical remission
      after TCM/TEAM herbal medicine prescription, the investigators aimed to develop treatment
      algorithms refined by identified pattern and key symptoms which practitioners can easily
      discriminate.

      Based on herbal prescriptions which induced clinical remission, IBD patients were divided
      into 5 patterns, i.e., Large intestine type, Water-dampness type, Respiratory type, Upper
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract type, and Coldness type. By term frequency-inverse document
      frequency (TF-IDF) method, the association between 22 symptoms that were described as
      indications of the herbal medicine prescriptions and 5 patterns were analysed. Decision tree
      modeling was used for prediction of relevant patterns from symptoms.
