      overnight stay in the hospital. The design of the device allows it to be effective
      immediately. The device is similar to the LINX device used for esophageal reflux. It is a
      circular set of magnets which surrounds the ano-rectal support. The size of the device is
      determined at the time of surgery so that the ano-rectum is closed. When the patient strains
      at stool, this pressure separates the magnets and allows passage of stool. The magnets are
      held together by an independent malleable titanium wire. Once straining at stool stops, the
      magnets are able to re-connect or close the rectum. We will monitor patients for
      postoperative complications related to surgery.
