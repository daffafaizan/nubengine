      effectively treated with osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), the cognitive piece is
      vastly ignored. Previous research has already reported related psychiatric outcomes,
      including relief from stress, self-perception and anxiety, suggesting that OMT may produce
      more global effects on cortical processing than currently thought. The current study is
      designed to extend previous research in several ways:

        1. To describe the neuropsychological (NP) characteristics of adults with pain within an
           osteopathic and allopathic setting

        2. To correlate NP with clinical outcomes (pain severity, number/location of osteopathic
           lesions)

        3. To determine if OMT is associated with improved NP function.

        4. To use saliva to measure cytokine concentration of IL-1β,IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α

        5. To correlate cytokine concentrations with clinical outcomes (pain severity,
           number/location of osteopathic lesions, NP)
