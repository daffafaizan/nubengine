    
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation
      program (MPP) in CRLM patients, which will be implemented right through the period of
      preoperative CT and during the 4-weeks of recovery before liver resection.

      MPP will consist of in-hospital high-moderate intensive exercise training, nutritional
      assessment and high-protein supplementation, smoking cessation, psychological support and
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment.

      Expected improvement in physical fitness will be measured by the difference in meters
      achieved in the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and will be compared with patients that will
      follow the MPP only during the 4-weeks before surgery, when preoperative CT has been
      finished.

      Secondary aims include patient reported outcomes measures such as quality of life,
      postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, 30-day mortality and re-admissions.
      Protocol feasibility will be evaluated by monitoring all interventions.
