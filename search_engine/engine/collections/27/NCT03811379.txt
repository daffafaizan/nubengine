      SCCE and constructed a complete genomic profile of SCCE. The analysis of transcriptome data
      showed that the number of effector T cells in SCCE immune microenvironment was significantly
      higher than that of other cancers, and NK cells were relatively high. Macrophages in SCCE
      mainly showed M2-like phenotype and maintained at a relatively high level, suggesting the
      possibility of immunotherapy in SCCE treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
      clarify the efficacy of PD-1 antibody in the treatment of patients with SCCE who failed
      chemotherapy, so as to provide a basis for further large-scale clinical research.
