      maintain equal stability of heart rate and oxygen saturation without a prolongation of time
      to completion of intubation when compared to a protocol using atropine, fentanyl and
      succinylcholine.

      In order to answer this question we plan to undertake a prospective randomized double blinded
      control trial of use of atropine as an adjunct for elective intubation of infants less than
      46 weeks postmenstrual age.
