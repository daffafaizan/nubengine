      volitinib and 3 mg/kg docetaxel induced TGI of 55.8% and 80.8%, respectively, whereas
      combination resulted in a TGI by 101.1%, and statistical significance was seen between
      combination group and either of mono-therapy group. Plasma exposures of volitinib and
      docetaxel were determined after last dose at the end of study, and there was no significant
      difference between combination and single agent on exposures of either volitinib or
      docetaxel. More importantly, combination was well tolerant and no body weight loss was found
      in the animals. These results suggested that it would be worthwhile to study the combination
      use of volitinib and docetaxel in clinic.
