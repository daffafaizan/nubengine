    
      Randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the
      relative bioavailability of two risperidone 1 mg tablet formulations under Fed conditions.

      The test formulation was Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited's 1 mg Risperidone tablet, and the
      reference formulation was RisperdalÂ® (risperidone) 1 mg tablet (Janssen Pharmaceutica
      Products, L.P.).

      The study was conducted with 26 healthy adults. In each study period, a single 1 mg dose was
      administered to the subjects following a standardized high-fat breakfast preceded by an
      overnight fast of at least 10 hours.

      The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the
      other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule.
      There was a 7-day interval between treatments.
