    
      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to obtain skin tissue for gene expression,
      DNA mutation, microbiome and related analyses from subjects with dermatologic conditions.
      After subjects are consented for the study, site staff will collect skin tissue from the
      subject using DermTech's non-invasive skin collection kit. Skin samples will be collected
      from both lesional and non-lesional skin as applicable.

      Additional skin tissue may be collected from the lesion and non-lesional area with the
      DermTech non-invasive skin collection kit at a later time point as directed by DermTech to
      track the dermatologic condition for progression, improvements or lack of response to
      standard of care therapy.

      Each Dermtech non-invasive skin collection kit will consist of the sequential application of
      up to 24 individual patches to lesional and non-lesional areas. Sites should apply the
      DermTech patches to the most severe lesion(s).

      Dermatologic conditions include but are not limited too; atopic dermatitis, atopic asthma,
      skin cancers (i.e., basal, and squamous carcinoma, melanoma, etc.), lupus, rheumatoid and
      psoriatic arthritis, gutate and plaque psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, palmoplantar
      contact dermatitis, fungal infections and cutaneous T cell Lymphoma. Skin tissue will be
      collected using DermTech's proprietary adhesive patch skin biopsy kit and extracted for
      analysis at DermTech's CLIA and CAP Laboratory. Analysis of the samples will include gene
      expression signatures and DNA mutation as well as microbiome analyses associated with the
      medical conditions of interest.
