      with minimum 18 and maximum 59 years old. The volunteers were allocated in two groups:
      experimental and control. The variables related to range of motion, pain and functional
      capacity were measured by biplane goniometer, Visual Analog Scale and Foot and Ankle Ability
      Measure respectively in four moments: 1- baseline; 2- after the first intervention; 3- after
      the sixth intervention (two weeks); 4- follow-up (one month). The experimental group received
