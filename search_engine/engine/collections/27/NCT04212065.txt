      decrease in the general population in the same time frame. Given the increased use of
      buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, it has now become the most commonly misused
      prescription opioid subtype. Untreated opioid use disorder is associated with worse maternal,
      fetal, and neonatal outcomes. To improve compliance with medication assisted therapy,
      decrease relapse and neonatal abstinence syndrome, we propose a randomized control trial of
      long acting subcutaneous buprenorphine compared to short acting sublingual
      buprenorphine/naloxone administration in pregnant and lactating women.
