    
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a relatively low cost pediatric
      primary-care based intervention that integrates brief pediatric counseling and a home-based
      phone program to prevent unhealthy weight gain in overweight children ages five-nine.
      Parent-child dyads will be recruited for the Healthy Homes/Healthy Kids Study via a
      multi-step process including use of electronic medical record data to identify children,
      pediatrician approval, and outreach via letters and phone calls. Four hundred and twenty five
      parent-child dyads from pediatric primary care will be recruited to participate and be
      randomized to one of two interventions:

      Healthy Eating/Physical Activity Home-based Intervention: This intervention arm will include
      brief pediatrician counseling regarding the child's current BMI percentile status,
      recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve a healthy weight gain trajectory,
      and home safety and injury risk reduction environmental recommendations paired with a 12
      month home-based program delivered via phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to
      promote implementation of the obesity prevention home environmental strategies.

      Safety/Injury Prevention Home-based Contact Control Intervention: This intervention arm will
      include the same brief counseling from the pediatrician paired with a 12 month home-based
      program delivered via phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to promote
      implementation of the safety and injury prevention home environmental strategies.
