      patients who have been seen in the retinal clinic, and involves a retrospective casenotes
      analysis to identify patients who have suffered visual loss and the reason for that visual
      loss. These data will be analysed to enable the identification of factors that predict visual
      loss in patients who present earlier in the course of their disease.
