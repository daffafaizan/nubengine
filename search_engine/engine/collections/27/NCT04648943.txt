      Ex-PRESS mini shunt inserted in the operated eye and in group 2 the patients underwent
      standard trabeculectomy.

      The corneal biomechanical properties were measured with the Ocular Response Analyzer before
      surgery and at 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The corneal biomechanical properties
      measured were the Corneal Hysteresis (CH) and the Corneal Resistance Factor (CRF).

      The change of the CH and CRF was compared in each group before and after surgery (at the
      aforementioned predetermined time points) and between the two groups.

      The intraocular pressure was also measured with the Goldmann applanation tonometer at the
      same time points and the change was compared before and after surgery in each group and
      between the two groups.
