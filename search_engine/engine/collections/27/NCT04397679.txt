    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety of partial brain radiation therapy plus temozolomide and
      chloroquine followed by tumor treating fields (TTFs) plus temozolomide and chloroquine,
      specifically grade 3 or higher dermatitis within the first 3 months of the adjuvant therapy
      phase.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To measure treatment effect via advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT)-positron emission tomography (PET).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 30 fractions of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT) or
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and receive temozolomide orally (PO) and
      chloroquine PO daily from day 1 for the duration of radiation therapy up to day 49. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Beginning 4 weeks after the last day of radiation therapy, patients
      receive temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and chloroquine PO daily on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients demonstrating continued benefit may continue to receive
      temozolomide and chloroquine for up to 12 cycles. Patients also undergo TTF therapy over 18
      hours or longer per day.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.
