    
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) affects approximately 11% of patients with
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Diabetic neuropathy as the underlying disease is the
      most common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus estimated to be experienced by a
      majority of patients at least in a mild manner.

      Many patients with (DPNP) do not respond adequately to any individual treatment option. None
      of the various treatments used can be considered a cure. As a result, although a variety of
      drugs are available for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, there is a strong need to
      develop new drugs with greater efficacy and/or fewer adverse effects.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of TRO19622 versus placebo on the
      24h neuropathic pain scores during the last 7 days of the 6-week treatment period.

      Secondary objectives are to compare the efficacy on neuropathic pain, impact on emotional
      functioning, safety profile, pain time course, and response rate of TRO19622 versus placebo.
      Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of TRO19622 will be assessed.
