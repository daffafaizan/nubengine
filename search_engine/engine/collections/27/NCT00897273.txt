    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the prevalence of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, 18, 6, or 11
           infection in young adult men.

        -  Assess the independent effect of distinct sexual practices, including kissing, oral sex,
           and vaginal intercourse, on oral HPV prevalence.

        -  Estimate the 6-month incidence of HPV infection in this study population.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assessed for oral human papillomavirus virus (HPV) infection (i.e.,
      types 16, 18, 6, and 11) and for known or potential risk factors associated with the
      infection, including sexual behavior (e.g., kissing, performing oral sex, or vaginal
      intercourse), demographic characteristics (e.g., age or race), and history of HPV or other
      sexually transmitted infections. Prior exposure to HPV vaccine is also assessed.

      Oral rinse samples are collected from participants at baseline and at 6 months for detection
      of HPV genomic DNA in oral exfoliated cells. Baseline serum samples are also collected.
