      endarterectomy, however in 12 to 60% it does not present surgical susceptibility, so
      pulmonary balloon angioplasty is the secondary option. In these procedures the complication
      that occurs most frequently is pulmonary oedema after reperfusion is a frequent complication
      (17.8-65%), appears between 24-72 hours after the intervention and the diagnosis is made in
      the presence of infiltrate interstitial in chest radiography or computed tomography of the
      chest. Initially it was believed that it was difficult due to the increase in perfusion of
      secondary flow in the territory due to pulmonary vascular dilation, it is now believed that
      microtraumatism is involved by the guides and balloon used, vascular dysfunction and
      cytokines and innate immunity and adaptive, complement activation, coagulation cascade
      activation, apoptosis pathway activation, endothelial dysfunction caused by reperfusion
      contribute to cell dysfunction.

      The use of N-acetyl cysteine for its antioxidant properties, inflammatory response
      attenuator, reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that in addition to having already
      had to reduce the condition of decrease in post-reperfusion ischemia15,16 in other situations
      is a viable option in the treatment of acute post-reperfusion edema in patients sometimes a
      pulmonary endarterectomy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty.
