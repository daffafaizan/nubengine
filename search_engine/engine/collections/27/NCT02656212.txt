    
      This project is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase I study that will
      include (+)-epicatechin dosing over seven days.

        -  Subjects will meet the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for pre-diabetes,
           including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [refer to inclusion/exclusion criteria].

        -  The Project includes: 7 day evaluation of a single daily dose of synthetic
           (+)-epicatechin in pre-diabetic individuals as compared to placebo.

        -  The Project has 4 outpatient clinic study visits: screening (Visit 1), randomization
           (Visit 2), end of study drug (Visit 3), follow up end of study (Visit 4).

        -  This Project has 2 telephone visits

      Primary hypothesis: As these studies are designed to evaluate safety and tolerability, there
      is no primary hypothesis to test.

      Primary outcome measures. Vital signs and safety labs: BP, HR, creatinine, alkaline
      phosphatase, and liver transaminases

      These studies will provide initial data about if (+)-epicatechin can influence glycemic
      control in individuals with prediabetes.
