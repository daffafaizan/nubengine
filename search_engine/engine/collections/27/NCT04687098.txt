    
      Induction chemotherapy: Idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous, days 1-3), Low-dose cytarabine
      (200mg/m2/day, intravenous in continuous infusion, days 1-7) and G-CSF priming 150mcg/m2/day,
      subcutaneous from day 0 to the last day of chemotherapy if white blood cell count (WBC)
      <30x10E9/L.

      This induction chemotherapy can be repeated twice in the case of partial response (PR) to
      achieve complete response (CR).

      Once CR is achieved (with one or two induction cycles), all patients receive a consolidation
      course with high-dose cytarabine (3000mg/m2/12h days 1, 3 and 5) and pegfilgrastim 6mg on day
      6.

      After this, patients will be allocated to the different risk groups as follows:

        -  Favorable risk group [patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1/RUNX1T1, inv(16)(p12;q22) or
           t(16;16)/CBFB/MYH11; Intermediate risk cytogenetics (MRC 2010) and NPM1 mutation with
           FLT3 wild type or low ratio of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD)/wild type (<0.5);
           or CEBPA biallelic mutation]. Patients in this group will receive 2 additional courses
           of consolidation therapy

        -  Intermediate risk group [Intermediate risk cytogenetics (MRC 2010) without NPM1
           mutations, FLT3-ITD, or CEBPA biallelic mutation]. Patients in this group receive an
           allogeneic stem cell transplant in first CR. Patients without an available donor can be
           autografted per center decision

        -  Adverse risk group [Adverse risk cytogenetics (MRC 2010), intermediate cytogenetics with
           FLT3-ITD without NPM1 mutation or NPM1-FLT3-ITD high ratio or MLL rearrangement; any
           favorable or intermediate risk patients with positive MRD following 1 (intermediate) or
           2 (favorable) consolidation courses]. Intention to treat of those patients is allogeneic
           stem cell transplant from any source.
