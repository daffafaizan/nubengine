      delivery of sepsis care. Currently, patients with severe sepsis do not receive key
      evidence-based therapies until they have been assessed in emergency departments - often
      introducing considerable delays. This research tests whether integrating paramedics directly
      into a chain-of-survival for sepsis will improve outcomes for these critically ill patients.
      In essence, this research seeks to break down silos of care, delivering sepsis treatments
      based on when they are needed, rather than on where the patient is physically located. If the
      trial is positive, the results will have broad implications for other health systems by
      showing that prehospital identification and treatment of sepsis increases the number of
      patients that survive this life-threatening condition. If the trial fails to demonstrate
      effectiveness of prehospital sepsis treatments, it will ensure that resources are not
      needlessly invested in large-scale implementations of paramedic sepsis protocols, as has been
      done in several other jurisdictions. A lack of benefit would also cast doubt on the
      observational data suggesting that early antibiotics are important, and suggest a more
      restrained approach to empiric antibiotic therapy.
