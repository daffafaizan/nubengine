    
      A structured triglyceride (1,3-di-octanoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, called C8-diet oil), which upon
      digestion results in generation of two medium-chain fatty acids and 2-oleoyl-glycerol (2-OG),
      may lead to activation of GPR119 only, since medium fatty acids are poor agonists for fatty
      acid receptors.
