    
      Purpose: To improve identification and proper prioritization of patients with non-specific
      symptoms prehospitally, we intend to investigate whether Q-CRP, a rapid test for CRP,
      correlates with time-critical states in the above-mentioned patient group alone or together
      with CRP, lactate and suPAR. The primary endpoint is need for hospital care.

      Material: Patients over 18 years who exhibit non-specific symptoms and transported to the
      emergency room.

      Method: In patients with unspecified conditions, defined according to the inclusion template,
      a venous blood sample was taken prehospitally at the scene by the EMS.

      Analysis: Significance tests and regression analyzes with 95% CI were used. The diagnostic
      accuracy of Q-CRP, lactate, suPAR and combinations thereof were compared with optimal
      boundary values.
