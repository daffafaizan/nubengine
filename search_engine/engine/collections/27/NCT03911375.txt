      reduction based on mindfulness. It consists of a program of 30 hours of duration divided into
      9 sessions with a weekly frequency of 2.5 h and an intensive session between the week 6 and 7
      of the program with a duration of 7.5 hours. Each week, the theoretical contents that are
      necessary to understand the attention development practices will be covered. In addition,
      basic concepts of the psychobiology and psychology of stress and pain will be explained. The
      subjects will have a homework load of approximately 45 minutes per day during the
      intervention program.
