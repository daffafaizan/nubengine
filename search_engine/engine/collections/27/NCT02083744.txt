      and final measures on the intervention and control groups. A sample of 60 adult Hispanic
      heart failure patients will be recruited. Each patient will either participate in the
      psychoeducational intervention or usual care. A repeated measures (longitudinal) analysis
      will be used to examine these aims by employing a linear mixed models approach. The basic
      analysis has one between subjects (fixed) factor, group, with 2 levels (education and
      control) and one repeated factor, time, with 2 levels (baseline and 12 months). This analysis
      allows for testing the main effect of group, main effect of time, and the group by time
      interaction. The potential benefit of improving heart failure knowledge and self-care in
      Hispanic heart failure patients is that these patients may better understand how to care for
      themselves. This study will provide data to examine the longer-term outcomes of emergency
      department visits and hospitalization events in Hispanic patients.
