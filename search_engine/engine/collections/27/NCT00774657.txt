      with aortic stenosis, and compare two-dimensional echocardiography measurements (wall
      thickness) with three-dimensional echocardiography data(left ventricular mass). Along with a
      second objective to assess Doppler diastolic filling indices associated with the various
      patterns of left ventricular remodeling.

      Previous studies(see reference list) were primarily derived from two-dimensional echo data
      set(based on wall thickness). Various patterns of left ventricular remodeling have been
      described in response to increased pressure overload.

      Three-dimensional echocardiography is a relatively new technique that is being increasingly
      used in the Echocardiography Lab in selected patients. This technique holds promise of being
      more accurate for volume-related measurements than the standard 2-dimensional
      echocardiography techniques.
