      antiretroviral medications would be referred to the study by the medical staff of the
      incarceration facilities prior to release or within 30 days of release an individual would be
      able to self refer.

      Subjects would be screened and consented and interviewed prior to their release from
      incarceration, on their day of release, and monthly for a period of one year. At the time of
      their day of release interview, subjects are randomized to either the intervention DAART
      group or the standard of care SAT group. All subjects would be assessed and offered opiate
      substitution therapy if there was a prior history of opiate dependency as a means of relapse
      prevention.

      Subjects in DAART would be seen everyday for a period of six months by a team of research
      assistants who observe the subjects taking their medications, and their last six months would
      be done as standard of care. Standard of care SAT subjects would continue to take their
      medications on their own as prescribed. All subjects would be interviewed monthly and
      quarterly would have laboratory blood tests completed.
