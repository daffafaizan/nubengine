      the % reduction in post void dribbling episodes (events) as the primary endpoint.

      Secondary endpoints will include:

        1. The % of patients with at least a 50% reduction in post void dribbling episodes.

        2. Patient's perspective of the impact of their disease, which will be captured using the
           Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, and another questionnaire that asks about urinary
           symptoms and quality of life.

      We will compare Solifenacin 5 mg to placebo. 140 subjects will be enrolled, with 70 subjects
      in each arm. The treatment group will receive 5mg of Solifenacin daily for 12 weeks. Astellas
      Pharma will be supplying both drug and placebo, they will be prepackaged and numbered. The
