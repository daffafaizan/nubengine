    
      The purpose of this phase III, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter,
      international study is to compare the efficacy and safety of brigatinib to that of crizotinib
      in ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC participants who have not previously been
      treated with an ALK inhibitor. Participants will be stratified by the presence of CNS
      metastases at baseline and prior chemotherapy used for locally advanced or metastatic
      disease. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either brigatinib, 90 mg
      orally once daily (QD) for 7 days, then a 180 mg orally QD, or crizotinib, 250 mg orally
      twice daily (BID). Participants will receive treatment until disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death. Crossover from crizotinib to brigatinib is also
      permitted.

      The total estimated duration of the study is at least 4.5 years, including 1.5 years to
      accrue participants, with at least 3 years for treatment and follow-up.
