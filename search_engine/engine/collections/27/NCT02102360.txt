      defects were treated with MIST (Test Group) or CST (Control Group). Furcation defects in both
      groups were filled with anorganic bovine bone (ABB) and enamel matrix derivative (EMD).
      Patient-centered outcomes including analyses of pain, discomfort, edema, hematoma, root
      hypersensitivity and daily activities interference were recorded using a Visual Analogue
      Scale seven days after surgeries. Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed at
      baseline and 6 months postoperatively. Data were statistically analysed.
