      prevention and the associated morbidity of bed rest and further secondary complications.
      Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid (ZA) has been shown to be more effective than other agents
      in reducing bone mass resorption and fracture of the legs in post-menopausal women, but has
      not been studied in acute spinal cord injury. Two previous studies of ZA in persons with
      subacute SCI, while promising, were inconclusive. As stated in the long range plan of the
      National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), one goal in the area of
      health and function is to "focus on the onset of new conditionsâ€¦exacerbation of existing
      conditions, or the development of coexisting conditions." This study is intended to
      demonstrate reduction in loss of bone mass at the hip and knee regions in acute SCI in a
      rigorous study of sufficient size to determine effectiveness of our intervention.
