      radiotherapy in patients with high grade glioma. II. Assess this regimen in terms of toxicity
      and survival in these patients. III. Assess the acute neurotoxicity of continuous infusion
      cladribine in these patients. IV. Assess this regimen in terms of response, local control,
      and time to progression in these patients. V. Define a dose level of cladribine associated
      with potentiation of acute and/or delayed radiation toxicity (radiosensitizing dose level).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cladribine. Patients receive cladribine by
      continuous IV infusion 5 days a week for 4 weeks and undergo radiotherapy twice a day,
      beginning 3 hours after initiation of cladribine, 5 days a week for 4.5 weeks. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of cladribine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months thereafter for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
