      intake of aspirin (chronotherapy) has been shown to reduce morning activity of platelets. It
      has been shown that platelet reactivity follows a clear circadian rhythm, with a peak of
      platelet reactivity during the morning (6-12 AM). Importantly, studies have shown in
      meta-analyses that high platelet activity is predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
      patients with stable CVD. Given this knowledge, it is highly likely that the morning peak of
      platelet reactivity contributes to the morning peak of cardiovascular events and that
      reduction of morning platelet activity prevents cardiovascular events during morning hours.
      This may be achieved by intake of aspirin at bedtime instead of on awakening. This study will
      be a comparative effectiveness research to determine the difference in major adverse
      cardiovascular events between the group with aspirin after awakening and placebo before
      bedtime and the group with placebo after awakening and aspirin before bedtime.
