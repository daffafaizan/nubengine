      genetic mutation resulting in deficiency or absence of a critical enzyme, leading to the
      accumulation of toxic deposits in cells across multiple organ systems.

      Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a rare, neurodegenerative, LSD, caused by a deficiency of the
      aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) enzyme, which leads to toxic accumulation of
      aspartylglucosamine and subsequent cellular dysfunction. AGU has been most commonly reported
      in people of Finnish and Nordic descent, but is present across ethnicities and is typically
      misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.

      Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is characterized by developmental delay and intellectual
      disability that worsens with age. Early disease is characterized by increased frequency of
      bacterial ear infections, recurrent ear tube placement, intestinal dysfunction, disruptive
      sleep patterns, skeletal abnormalities, and gait disturbances, among others. Individuals
      progressively lose motor and cognitive skills, develop behavioral/emotional lability and
      their risk of seizures increases with age. People with AGU have a shortened life span.

      No prospective natural history study for AGU has been reported. This study aims to
      prospectively investigate the natural history of AGU, and concurrently to identify potential
      outcome measures that could be used in future clinical trials. No investigational product
      will be provided in the study.
