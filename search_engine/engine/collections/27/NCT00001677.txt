      (MTX) and the nucleoside analog fludarabine in 40 patients with severe refractory rheumatoid
      arthritis. The patients enrolled will be those who have experienced inadequate disease
      control with MTX alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs such as
      sulfasalazine (SSZ), cyclosporin A (CsA), or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In this randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial, patients will be maintained on oral MTX at 17.5
      mg/week to which either placebo or subcutaneous fludarabine at 30 mg/m(2) daily for three
      consecutive days per month will be added for four months. The fludarabine (or placebo)
      treatment period will be followed by two months of follow-up, at which time patients will be
      evaluated for response. Patients will be monitored for adverse effects/tolerability, disease
      activity, and changes in synovial volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Additionally synovial biopsies will be obtained before and after treatment for investigation
      of infiltrating cell numbers and phenotypes, cytokine profiles, Th1 versus Th2 responses, and
      angiogenesis.
