      combination with opioids for adults with a american society of anesthesiology classification
      ASA ≤ III. Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have shown a positive effect of xenon on
      several organ functions such as in brain, kidneys and heart. In two studies, an enhanced
      expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) could be shown in animal kidneys and
      kidney cells. Interestingly, HIF-1α leads to an enhanced formation of erythropoetin (EPO).
      This might result in an enhanced oxygen transport capacity and an enhanced oxygen-level after
      xenon-treatment.

      Aim of the project is to analyze the effect of xenon-inhalation on circulating
      erythropoetin-level in blood of healthy volunteers in a randomized controlled pilot study.
      Besides, other positive stimulating factors for erythropoiesis (such as HIFa stabilizing
      factors) and growth factors (such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), hepatocyte growth
      factor (HGF), mechano growth factors (MGFs), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs),
      vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs)) shall be analyzed.
