    
      This study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter registry of approximately 50 patients
      undergoing PCI with the ProNOVA Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System according to its
      Instructions for Use.

      The purpose of this registry is the evaluation of the performance, safety and efficacy of
      ProNOVA XR DES in real-world patients. Following initial stent implantation, all patients
      will have clinical follow up at 30 days, at 6 and 12 months. Additionally all patients will
      have a angiographic F/U at 6 months to assess the late luminal loss by QCA measurements and
      the neointimal volume including stent apposition by intravascular ultrasound.
