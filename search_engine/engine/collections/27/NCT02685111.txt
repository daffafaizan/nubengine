      hrs after the last dose of chemotherapy and continue until absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
      has recovered to within the normal range (or for 14 days). However, for economic and
      practical reasons and/or patient's convenience, it has been common practice to initiate
      filgrastim at a later days of cycle and/or administer a shorter course of treatment. Data
      from several clinical studies have shown that 10-11 days' filgrastim treatment is required
      for optimal prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia (FN), and data from other cancers shows that
      suboptimal use of G-CSFs could deteriorate clinical outcomes. However, in two recent
      randomized study with breast cancer patients undergoing TAC chemotherapy, acceptable
      incidence (7-18%) of FN was shown with the consecutive 6 or 7-daily filgrastim schemes. Also,
      although there is theoretical concern that there can be wide fluctuations in the patient's
      ANC over time in alternate or intermittent filgrastim administration, because there was no
      difference in clinical outcomes between daily- or intermittent-dose filgrastim schedules in
      previous literatures, the intermittent every other day of 5 shot-filgrastim scheme would have
      clinical outcomes comparable with previous consecutive 6 or 7-daily filgrastim schemes in
      coverage of ANC nadir. Therefore, it can be justified to investigate the non-inferiority of
      intermittent every other days of 5 shot-filgrastim scheme compared with control arm using of
      pegfilgrastim on D2.
