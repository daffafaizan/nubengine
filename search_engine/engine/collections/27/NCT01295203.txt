      increase physical activity among inactive persons. Main objective is to determine if access
      to a website with personalized feedback on PA level and suggestions to increase PA results in
      improvements in self reported PA, anthropometrics and applied physiological measurements.

      Physical inactive adults (n=12,287) participating in a nationwide health survey and
      examination (DANHES) were asked to randomly assigned to either intervention (n=6,055) or
      control group (n=6,232). The intervention group had access to a PA website with personalized
      advice and suggestions to increase PA. After 3 and 6 months, a follow-up questionnaire was
      administered by e-mail. The 7-day International Physical Activity Questionnaire was included
      in the questionnaires to assess four domains of PA in daily-life (work, transportation,
      domestic, and leisure-time) and sedentary time. Furthermore, at the 3 month follow-up a
      subgroup of participants (n=1,190) were invited complete anthropometrics and physiological
      measurements.
