      abnormal hypersensitivity to harmless as well as harmful stimuli. This type of pain is
      extremely difficult to manage, fails to respond to standard analgesic medications or
      interventions, and often gets worse instead of better over time. Current approved therapeutic
      agents often have intolerable side effects and limited efficacy. Thus, there is an urgent
      need to develop safe and effective drugs to treat neuropathic pain.

      Study DTCL100 will be conducted at multiple centers and will enroll patients that have
      advanced cancer AND neuropathic pain that has not responded well to previous treatment.
      Eighteen patients will be randomly assigned to receive up to 8 doses of active drug (KRN5500)
      or placebo. A maximum of 8 doses will be administered weekly over a 10 week period. Patients
      are encouraged to complete at least 4 treatment visits before a decision is made to complete
      the full 10 weeks of treatment and the 1 month followup period.
