      therapy.The current guidelines recommend the catheter ablation at the first episode of AFL
      (Class IIa) or in any case of recurrent episodes of AFL (Class I). Recent studies have
      already demonstrated a high degree of procedural efficacy (higher than 90%). However, there
      are still two main areas of investigation. First, what is the best method to obtain an
      effective lesion. Second, what is the most reliable method to validate the procedure
      success.The present study is aimed at investigating these aspects in the current Italian
      clinical practice.
