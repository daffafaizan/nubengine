      System is more effective than guideline directed medical therapy for the treatment of
      ischemic heart failure. This is a prospective, multi-center, dual-arm randomized controlled
      study comparing treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy induced heart failure with the Revivent
      TC System plus Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) compared to GDMT alone. This study
      will include 180 patients of which 120 patients will be treated with the investigational
      device and 60 patients will be maintained on GDMT.
