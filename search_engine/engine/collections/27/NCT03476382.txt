      primarily a bone disease, and the joint changes are secondary. Bone growth stimulators
      function to alleviate intraosseous venous congestion through the process of bone remodeling.
      The working hypothesis is that alleviation of intraosseous venous congestion leads to
      improved delivery of nutrition to the tissue to support the health of the bone with
      improvement in biomechanics leading to clinical improvement. Venous congestion is measured
      with intraosseous pressure. Additional objective evidence of biomarkers of bone metabolism as
      well as measurements of subjective questionnaires can provide evidence of benefit.
