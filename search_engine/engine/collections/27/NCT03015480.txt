      MyFitnessPal on their smartphone or computer to log meal data daily, weekly website
      educational materials, and weekly telephone visits with a dietician for 8 weeks. Patients
      receive a follow-up phone call from the dietitian and 5 and 11 months for further support and
      counseling, and are also invited to attend a local dietitian-led grocery tour. This pilot
      study examines the feasibility of dietary app-supported tele-counseling in the treatment of
      patients with stage 1-3a chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.

      Main outcomes include sodium intake assessed by 24 hour urine collection as well as other
      dietary measures related to kidney disease (sodium/potassium ratio, Healthy Eating Index
      score, 24-hour urine phosphorus, estimated net endogenous acid production) and health
      measures (24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, weight, albumin/creatinine ratio)
