           patients with ischemic cardiopathy, stroke and intermittent claudication.

        -  The acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is the most used antiaggregant substance, nevertheless,
           and spite of being centenarian, it last some questions pending regarding the most
           appropriate dose, mechanisms of action implicated, the association with oder drugs, and
           the pharmaceutical fom in order to improve the efficacy and safety of the ASA.

        -  Some previous studies indicate that the slow release form of ASA has a different
           behaviour in the platelet effect in comparison with plain formulation.

        -  The aim of this study is to demonstrate the best antiaggregant and safety profile of a
           low dose of a slow release formulation in a long term treatment period of one year.
