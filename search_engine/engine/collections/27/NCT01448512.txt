      Experimental, Control x Time, Baseline, Post-Intervention, Pre-delivery 32 weeks,
      Pre-delivery day, Delivery, Post Partum). Twelve community health centers (CHCs) in
      communities within the Gert Sibande and Nkangala Districts in Mpumalanga, South Africa (SA)
      will be randomly assigned to condition in a 1:1 ratio. Six usual care condition clinics will
      provide the standard of care, PMTCT; six experimental condition clinics will offer
      PartnerPlus to mothers completing HIV testing, regardless of serostatus, who are willing to
      enroll with their male partners and participate in the integrated PartnerPlus intervention.
      This study will recruit 240 couples (n = 480 individuals); community clinics will recruit 2
      cohort per clinic over 3 months (10 couples per cohort, n = 40, 120 individuals per
      condition).
