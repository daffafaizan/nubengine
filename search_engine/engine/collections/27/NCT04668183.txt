      include the peripheral nerve blocks of pudendal nerve block (PNB) and dorsal penile nerve
      block (DPNB). Ultrasound (US) has recently become increasingly popular in regional anesthesia
      practice and is used to aid these two peripheral nerve block applications in various
      pediatric urological procedures. US-guided DPNB has been shown to provide effective and
      long-term analgesia when compared to caudal epidural block in a recent study on hypospadias
      surgery in the pediatric population.
