      effects of 12 weeks of Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES),
      Cyclic Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (cNMES), and Task Oriented Training. Dexterity,
      upper limb impairment, and activity limitation will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 12 (end of
      treatment), and 36 weeks. The treatment dose will be the same for all three groups: 10
      sessions per week of self-administered treatment at home plus 2 sessions per week of
      group-specific occupational therapy in the lab.
