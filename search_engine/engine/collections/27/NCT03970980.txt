    
      Patients who are aged ≥20 years, are undergoing planned elective cardiac surgery, and
      provided signed informed consent are included in the present study. Any patients with cardiac
      arrhythmia or an intra-cardiac shunt are excluded.

      The patients are randomly assigned to 2 groups: FIO2 <70% or FIO2 >90%. And during the
      surgery, the oximeter values are kept ≥98%. Intra-operatively, FIO2, PaO2, SvO2, PvO2, Hb,
      and TD-CO are recorded.
