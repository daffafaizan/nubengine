      approved in writing by the appropriate local site Independent Ethics Committee
      (IEC)/Institutional Review Boards (IRB) (Ethics Committee of the Universidad Autónoma de
      Nuevo León, School of Medicine).

      The patients were recruited as outpatients from the Geriatrics Clinic. A total of 67 patients
      were screened out of which 40 male and female patients diagnosed with mild to moderate
      dementia were recruited to the study. Following inclusion, all patients underwent
      randomization to treatment with melatonin (5 mg orally) or placebo for 8 weeks. To prevent
      bias, matching placebo tablets, which were identical in appearance, taste, and odor, were
      used. The treatment was double-blinded, with two parallel treatment groups. Selection for a
      treatment group was determined by a computer-generated randomization list, in a 1:1 ratio
      using the randomized permuted blocks method.
