        1. To test strategies to improve retention in treatment on medications for opioid use
           disorder (MOUD), among patients initiating treatment for OUD.

        2. To test strategies to improve outcomes among patients who have achieved stable remission
           on MOUD and want to discontinue MOUD.

        3. To develop models to predict who is able to discontinue MOUD without relapse, based on
           patient characteristics, including duration of MOUD prior to discontinuation.

      The study will have a multicenter, randomized, pragmatic non-blinded design. The study has
      two phases, a Retention Phase and a Discontinuation Phase.
