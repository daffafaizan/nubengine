      of heart failure (HF). Increasingly, the clinical syndrome of HF is one of "cardiorenal"
      failure owing to the frequent presentation of combined cardiac and renal dysfunction. Recent
      studies have established the prognostic importance of renal dysfunction in patients with
      chronic HF. An analysis of the patients in the second prospective randomized study of
      Ibopamine on mortality and efficacy (PRIME) by Hillege et al1 demonstrated that estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most powerful predictor of mortality, exceeding
      functional status and ejection fraction (EF).

      In an ongoing prospective study, we are assessing the neurohumoral and renal hemodynamic
      profile of hospitalized patients with ADHF who do or do not develop the CRS. Our preliminary
      findings suggest that indeed the combination of pronounced activation of
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), decreased renal perfusion pressure and
      importantly, a relative deficiency of the natriuretic peptides (despite marked volume
      overload) predisposes to the development of CRS.
