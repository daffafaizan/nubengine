      perform kaolin-based activated clotting time (kACT) as monitor of heparin therapy in patients
      undergoing cardiac operations on cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Apart from kACT, the device allows the assessment of the patient's coagulation status by a
      glass-bead activated test (gbACT+, depicting also clot rate = CR and platelet function = PF).
      Recently, a new SONOCLOT analyzer (S2) has been developed. Although the S2 shares the
      technical fundamentals with the S1, the redesign of the device may result in performance
      changes of kACT and gbACT.

      Routine management in cardiac surgery patients is guided using S1 and addition, tests are run
      on S2. Data are entered into the the cardiac surgery data base and S1 and S2 performance is
      compared by Bland-Altman analysis and % error calculation in order to establish new reference
      values.
