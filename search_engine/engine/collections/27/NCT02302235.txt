      treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. 2) To evaluate the safety of
      ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme.
      Secondary aim will be to evaluate tolerability of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of
      radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme.

      Participants will be seen at one, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after KG diet initiation, and then
      monthly until month 6 after diet initiation, then every 2 months until 2 years after
      treatment initiation or death, then every 3 months until 3 years after treatment initiation
      or death. KD treatment will last for 6 months or until exit criteria are met, whichever comes
      first. Exit criteria are the primary outcome measures, the first of either (a) MRI tumor
      progression or (b) death. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment compliance,
      hunger scale scores, fasting serum glucose and BOH levels and occurrence of adverse events.

      Patients with documented tumor progression will receive standard care for progressive GBM as
      directed by their treating oncologist, independent of the study.
