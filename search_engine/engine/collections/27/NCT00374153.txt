      colleges and universities have instituted a range of alcohol intervention and prevention
      programs for students. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is one brief intervention that has been
      shown to reduce heavy drinking among college students. To date, all college studies of MI
      have used a format that includes an assessment and feedback delivered in an MI style.
      Although this format has considerable empirical support, it remains unclear which of the
      components is necessary to produce behavior change. This study will evaluate the separate and
      collective effects of MI and feedback among "binge" drinking college students. Additionally,
      this study will evaluate the effects of the initial drinking assessment, through including a
      delayed-assessment control group. After an initial screen, 350 students at Southern Methodist
      University who report at least one heavy (i.e., "binge") episode during the previous two
      weeks will be randomized to: (1) MI with feedback, (2) MI without feedback, (3) Mailed
      feedback only, (4) Assessment only, or (5) Delayed assessment only. MI sessions will be
      delivered by trained and supervised counselors. Participants will be assessed via a secure
      Internet site at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months (12 months only for the Delayed-assessment
      group), with primary outcome measures including self-reported quantity and frequency of
      drinking, and drinking-related problems. Since college drinking is associated with
      substantial negative effects for drinkers, as well as for others, the findings of this study
      may have significant public health implications in terms of reducing costs, and improving
      services for students who choose to drink.
