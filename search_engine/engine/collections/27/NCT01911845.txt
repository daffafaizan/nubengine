      period (for all participants who received study drugs). All participants who received at
      least 1 dose of study drug were to be followed for 48 weeks post-treatment to monitor for
      safety, HCV RNA, the emergence and/or persistence of resistant viral variants, and assessment
      of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments.
