      usually leads to severe and permanent paralysis and the projected data related to the burden
      of spinal cord injuries across the globe is quite alarming. Pharmacological and
      rehabilitation therapies to SCI have got limited effect. There is definitely an urgent need
      for finding different methods of treatment for these patients who cannot undergo established
      modalities of treatment or these have been tried unsuccessfully. Another promising
      therapeutic approach for SCI is "Stem cell transplantation". Bone marrow derived stem cells
      have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by
      promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and remyelination. In our present study, we
      want to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells
      surgically transplanted intrathecally into patients with spinal cord injury.
