      and etoposide (VP-16) increases the response rate and duration of response in adults with
      refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II. Correlate response to this
      treatment with the presence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) multidrug resistance (MDR) and the
      degree of in vitro modulation of leukemic blasts, including CD34+ blasts. III. Correlate
      response with the presence of other resistance mechanisms, such as atypical MDR and non-P-gp
      phenotype. IV. Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment in AML patients. V. Study the effect
      of CYSP on DHAD and VP-16 pharmacokinetics and metabolism and, potentially, on intracellular
      drug accumulation.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: CYSP Cyclosporine, NSC-290193
      DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Arm I: 2-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy. DHAD; VP-16. Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Drug Resistance
      Inhibition. DHAD; VP-16; with CYSP.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 25 patients/arm will be entered over approximately 3 years.
