      cesarean section. The incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension is as high as
      62.1-89.7% if prophylactic measures are not taken. Vasopressors has been highly recommended
      for routine prevention and/or treatment of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. As a potential
      substitute drug for phenylephrine, norepinephrine has gradually been used in parturients
      undergoing cesarean section. There's some evidence that prophylactic infusion of
      norepinephrine could effectively reduce the incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension
      in parturients undergoing cesarean section. However, our study (NCT03997500) had been shown
      that inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVC-CI) markedly decreased in prophylactic
      norepinephrine infusion versus normal saline after spinal anesthesia and fetal delivery,
      suggesting that more prudent fluid management is required. The ideal dose of coload and
      coload is still unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the optimal coload
      guided by IVC-CI in parturients with prophylactic norepinephrine infusion undergoing cesarean
      section.
