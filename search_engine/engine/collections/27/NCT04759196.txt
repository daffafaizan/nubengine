      hemorrhage may present a diagnostic challenge. Many of these patients end up with a probable
      diagnosis of epilepsy (or acute symptomatic seizures), despite a negative
      electroencephalogram. The investigators believe that the origin of these transient neurologic
      symptoms in a significant subpopulation of these patients may in fact be cortical
      depolarization, rather than epileptiform activity. Very specific characteristics have already
      been identified that differentiate these patients from those who ultimately have epilepsy.
      The NESIS entity (nonepileptic, stereotypical, and intermittent symptoms) has been proposed
      to represent this group of patients. A NESIS score was then designed to help distinguish
      patients with epileptiform activity (confirmed by EEG) from those likely to have cortical
      depolarization. In other diseases presenting cortical depolarizations, certain antiepileptic
      treatments (including Topiramate) have already been recognized as effective. The
      investigators therefore want to perform a prospective, multicenter, randomized-controlled
      study (Topiramate group and Levetiracetam group) to determine whether a significant
      difference in the response to treatment exists between Topiramate and Levetiracetam in the
      NESIS group compared to the non-NESIS group. In addition, in a few eligible patients, the
      investigators will implant an electrocorticography electrode to demonstrate the existence of
      cortical depolarizations.
