    
      This is an open-label extension study for participants of the randomized placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, parallel-group, enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal NMS-Nab Study,
      assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of nabilone for non-motor symptoms in patients
      with Parkinson´s Disease. Nabilone is an analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
      psychoactive component of cannabis.

      Eligible subjects will be re-tapered with open-label nabilone, optimally up to the dose the
      patient had in the NMS-Nab Trial. It is the investigator´s decision to modify this dose, if
      necessary. The re-tapering will be performed up to a maximum dose of 1 mg twice daily.
      Treatment responders will enter the open-label treatment period for 6 months with visits
      being performed every 3 months in the context of the patient´s regularly scheduled visits in
      the specialized outpatient department. The last visit will be the Termination Visit.
      Following this, nabilone will be tapered. During this period the patients will receive phone
      calls every other day. A Safety Follow-Up Visit will be performed.
