      postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PHH) has increased. PHH is characterized by
      increased glycemic variability and hypoglycemic episodes occurring 2-3 hours after a meal
      together with a markedly increase in insulin and glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels.
      Symptoms vary from dizziness and palpitations to confusion, loss of consciousness and
      convulsions. At present there are few treatment options available for RYGB patients with PHH
      and most of them rely on dietary changes that are difficult to adhere to.

      Pasireotide has been shown to reduce hypoglycemia in RYGB operated subjects with PHH, but
      often leads to increased hyperglycemia as well.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate two doses of pasireotide in RYGB operated subjects
      with PHH.

      Each subject will undergo two meal tolerance test (MTT) preceded by either 75 µg or 150 µg of
      pasireotide. Blood samples will be collected throughout the meal test at predefined time
      points and will be analyzed for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and glucagon levels.
