    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-018. TAK-018 is used for the prevention of
      postoperative CD recurrence. This study will evaluate the efficacy of TAK-018 in reducing
      endoscopic recurrence of intestinal inflammation in postoperative participants with CD after
      planned laparoscopic ileocecal resection with primary anastomosis.

      The study will enroll approximately 96 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) in 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups-which
      will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during the study (unless there
      is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-018 0.30 g Low dose

        -  TAK-018 1.5 g High dose

        -  Placebo

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets twice daily immediately after a meal (that
      is, breakfast and dinner) with water, approximately 8 to 12 hours apart.

      Participants will have flexibility to either to opt for home health care (HHC) solutions at
      Screening, Week 3, Week 6, Week 12, Week 18 and Week 30 or travel to the clinic for all
      scheduled visits per protocol as permitted by local regulations. This flexible approach is
      designed in response to health care delivery challenges presented by the coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) pandemic and to provide additional flexibility during the course of the trial.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, France,
      Austria and Germany. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 34 weeks.
      Participants will make final visit to the clinic or can opt for HHC visit at Week 30 (30 days
      after the Week 26 endoscopy) for safety follow-up.
