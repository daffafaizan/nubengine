      transparent surgical N95 respirator (i.e., FaceView mask) designed to improve communication.
      The study aims to gather participants' perceptions of the novel transparent surgical N95
      respirator vs. a conventional surgical N95 respirator. Following fitting of the masks (5
      minutes wear time each), the participants will complete a questionnaire to provide their
      perceptions of fit, comfort, ease of use, and benefit to communication.
