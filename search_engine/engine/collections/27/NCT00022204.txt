      patients previously treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer. II. Compare the normal
      tissue injury and quality of life in patients treated with this regimen vs placebo.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vitamin E and oral
      pentoxifylline twice daily for 6 months. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily
      for 6 months. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients
      are followed at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
