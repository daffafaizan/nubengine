      contributor to specific neonatal and other complications that may extend throughout
      subsequent life. The PPROM is a high risk condition for developing chorioamnionitis.
      Available biological markers have a low prognostic value. Indeed, currently the diagnosis of
      intra-uterine infection relies only on placental cultures and anatomo-pathological exam after
      the delivery.

      Moreover, pregnancy is an immunologic particular condition. Indeed an immune tolerance is
      required with respect to the fetus and is mediated by Treg lymphocytes, which suppressed Th17
      activity.

      Recent studies have shown among women with frequent miscarriages, a balance between Treg and
      Th17, with a decrease in Treg number and an increase in Th17 number in decidua and blood.

      In case of infection, the immune pro-inflammatory response (Th17) is restored in peripheric
      tissues and in blood in order to limit the extention of intra-uterine infection. This
      restoration of this pro-inflammatory response could be due to a modification of Treg number
      ou tolerogenic activity.

      In this context, our hypothesis is that chorioamnionitis will lead to a decrease of treg
      proportion and an increase of Th17 proportion in lymphocyte populations of maternal blood and
      placenta, with a back to values near than which is observed in beginning of pregnancy or in
      no pregnant women.
