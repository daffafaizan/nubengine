      (LABA), for the indication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Because the use
      of LABAs has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with asthma,
      the health authorities requested the conduct of a post-approval drug utilisation study to
      assess potential off-label use of olodaterol in asthma and to characterise the use of
      olodaterol in clinical practice. The single agent indacaterol, the only other marketed LABA
      authorised in clinical practice for COPD but not for asthma, will also be assessed. Study
      objectives include the following: (1) Quantify the frequency of off-label use of olodaterol
      and indacaterol among new users of these medications; and (2) Describe the baseline
      characteristics of new users of olodaterol and indacaterol. This cross-sectional study will
      use information among new users of olodaterol or indacaterol collected in the following
      healthcare databases: the PHARMO Database Network in the Netherlands, the National Registers
      in Denmark, and the IMS Health Information Solutions (IMS) Real-World Evidence (RWE)
      Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD) in France. The source population is all patients enrolled
      in the selected study databases at the date olodaterol became available in each database's
      country. The study groups are those patients from the source population who receive a first
      dispensing for single-agent formulations of olodaterol for the primary objective or
      indacaterol for the secondary objective and have at least 12 months of continuous enrolment
      in the study databases. The study will describe the number and proportion of new users by
      indication and potential off-label use and according to medical history and use of
      co-medications.
