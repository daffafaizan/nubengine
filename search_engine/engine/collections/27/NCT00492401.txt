      I. Determine the rate of complete remission (CR) in patients with previously untreated acute
      myeloid leukemia treated with decitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rate of overall survival at 1 year in patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the overall response rate (CR, incomplete CR, and partial remission) in
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Correlate the biological activity of decitabine with clinical endpoints and maximum
      concentration of plasma decitabine.

      IV. Correlate intracellular concentration of decitabine with global DNA methylation, other
      biological endpoints, and clinical response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood sample collection periodically for
      pharmacological and correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for gene expression,
      methylation of gene promoters, fetal hemoglobin (HgF), DNMT1 protein expression, maximum
      concentration of plasma decitabine, and global DNA methylation. Samples are analyzed by
      RT-PCR, Bio-COBRA, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry, SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), immunoblotting, and LC-MS/MS.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 30 days.
