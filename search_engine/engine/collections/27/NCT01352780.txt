      for many patients behaviour change to improve health outcome. Changing behaviour is a
      challenge that requires a commitment by the patient to implement successfully. Motivational
      interviewing is a patient centered directive counseling technique that focuses on assisting
      patients to identify their problems and involves exploring ambivalence in an empathic manner.
      It is a well-known method of counseling, and is considered to be a useful intervention
      strategy in the treatment of lifestyle problems.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial using telephone motivational interviewing. The
      counseling intervention comprises 6 telephone calls during a 12 week period, after attending
      3 weeks of supervised climate therapy on the Canary Islands
