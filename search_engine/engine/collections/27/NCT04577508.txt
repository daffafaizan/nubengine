    
      The main objective of this randomized, rater-blind controlled trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of Functional Remediation (FR) in improving functional, clinical and cognitive
      outcomes in euthymic and clinically stable patients with Bipolar Disorder.

      FR is a novel group-based intervention, based on a neurocognitive-behavioural approach,
      making use of ecological techniques, specifically developed for patients with Bipolar
      Disorder and aimed at restoring psychosocial functioning in this population.

      The study will involve subjects recruited from outpatient clinics (residential or
      semi-residential care) within the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services of ASST
      Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.

      Study participants will be assigned via central randomization to either FR or treatment as
      usual, the latter consisting of evidence-based drug treatment and case management.

      Pharmacological treatment will be maintained stable during the course of the trial, but no
      restriction will be applied in terms of access to evidence-based non-pharmacological
      interventions.

      Efficacy of the study intervention (lasting 6 months) will be assessed at post-treatment, and
      later investigated at 6-months follow-up.

      The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
      Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. It will take place within an experimental project
      related to the "PhD Course in Biomedical Sciences and Translational Medicine", curriculum
      "Neuroscience" of the University of Brescia, Italy.
