      internal structure, convergent validity and reproducibility, in a sample of patients before
      scheduled surgery, and (ii) structure and convergent validity against external criterion, in
      healthy volunteers. A secondary objective is to study the relationship of scores of the PSQ
      with a scale assessing sensitivity to natural smells, noise and light sensitivity.
