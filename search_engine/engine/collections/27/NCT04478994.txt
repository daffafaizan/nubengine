    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, multicenter study.
      Participants will be screened for the study within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1)
      Visit. Approximately 25 participants who meet the study eligibility criteria will be
      randomized on Day 1 in a 3:2 ratio to receive 8 infusions of TEPEZZA or placebo q3W. During
      the 24-week double-blind Treatment Period, study drug will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline) and
      Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 with a comprehensive visit at Week 24 (end of treatment). On
      each dosing day, scheduled assessments (except for Adverse Events [AE] and concomitant
      medication use monitoring, which will be monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be
      completed prior to study drug infusions.

      At the end of the Treatment Period (Week 24), participants will enter a 24-week Follow-up
      Period, during which study drug will not be administered and a clinic visit will be scheduled
      for Weeks 28, 36 and 48. A phone call or email at Weeks 32 and 42 will occur to inquire how
      the participant is doing.
