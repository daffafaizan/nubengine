    
      The main aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the iD-Systemâ„¢, One-handed Disposable
      Internal Defibrillation System The device is made for manual defibrillation during
      intra-thoracic procedure, by transferring a shock from a defibrillation device to the
      patient's heart, in combination with the iD-Electrode. The device will be used when the
      patient reaches a stage of ventricular fibrillation or rapid ventricular tachycardia during
      cardiac surgery.

      In case ventricular fibrillation occurs and the iD-system is not effective to restore the
      sinus trythm, the conventional approach with use of the two paddels spoons will be performed
      immediately.

      the following will be assessed:

        -  Ease of use of the device

        -  Safety of the device

        -  Efficacy of the device
