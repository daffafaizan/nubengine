      radiofrequency energy has become an important therapeutic option to treat atrial fibrillation
      over the last years. Importing images from pre-acquired 3-D CT or MRI scans into the 3-D
      mapping system with superimposition of the electro-anatomical map is increasingly used.
      Despite these advances, the interventional electrophysiologist must be aware of potential
      complications that are associated with this procedure. As the left atrium is in close
      vicinity to the esophagus, radiofrequency ablation in the left atrium may damage the
      esophagus and create esophageal perforations and esophageal left atrial fistula. To prevent
      this lethal complication integration of an esophagus tag into the electroanatomic left atrium
      map visualizing the anatomic relationship has been studied und reported. Another possibility
      of visualization of the esophagus is to perform the CT after placing a conventional
      radio-opaque gastric tube, which provides information about the course of the esophagus in
      relation to the LA and may be scanned by CT . It has been shown that under normal conditions,
      if no barium is administered, there is little change in the anatomical relationship between
      the posterior left atrium and the esophagus during the entire cardiac cycle. However it is
      not clear whether the position of the esophagus in relation to the left atrium is changing
      over days.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether visualization of the esophagus by placing
      a conventional gastric tube before performing the CT scan and visualization and integration
      of the esophagus into the 3-D electro-anatomical map the day before ablation is accurate
      compared with integration of an esophagus tag into the electroanatomic left atrium map
      visualizing the anatomic relationship during the radiofrequency ablation.
