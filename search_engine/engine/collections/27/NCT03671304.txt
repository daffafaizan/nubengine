      with RCC.1. Physical activity also provides additional benefits for patients undergoing
      treatment for cancer such as improved quality of life and sleep, and reduced
      treatment-related fatigue. However, individuals receiving treatment for renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC) often fail to engage in sufficient physical activity. Many cancer survivors experience
      a decrease in their physical activity after diagnosis2 and the majority of RCC survivors do
      not meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity.3 Traditional physical activity
      interventions require significant resources and present substantial barriers for participants
      (travel, time commitments, etc.). In contrast, mobile technologies enable delivery of
      interventions with significantly fewer resources. These technologies also facilitate the
      delivery of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) in which intervention support is
      provided at only at times when an opportunity for positive changes exists.4 The purpose of
      this support the development of a JITAI in RCC patients. Evaluation of the acceptability and
      efficacy of three intervention strategies (affective framing, intention planning,
      goal-setting, and savoring) will determine their inclusion in the JITAI.
