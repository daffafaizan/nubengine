      cancer risk. The associations of any particular nutrient with increased or decreased risks,
      however, may not be due to that nutrient per se but to the whole foods that are rich in that
      nutrient. Simultaneously, reducing intakes of foods associated with increased risk while
      increasing foods identified in preventive diets may be the best approach for prevention. The
      Cretan-Mediterranean diet in particular appears to hold great promise for cancer prevention.
      The major components of the traditional Cretan diet have been associated with decreased colon
      cancer. Relative to the American diet, this diet has lower n-6/n-3 and n-6/n-9 fatty acid
      ratios, lower polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, lower red meat intake, and higher intakes of
      plant-based foods and monounsaturated fatty acids.

      The hypothesis of this study is that adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet will result in
      a decrease in n-6 fatty acids and increased n-3 and n-9 fatty acids in human colorectal
      mucosa. This together with aspects of the diet such as increased intakes of fruits and
      vegetables, is expected to modulate eicosanoid metabolism and epithelial proliferation in
      normal mucosa. 120 persons, with an increased risk for colorectal cancer, will be randomized
      to a modified Mediterranean diet or a Healthy People 2010 diet for six months.
