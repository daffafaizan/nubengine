    
      The main objective is to describe the psychological state during confinement (and the impact
      of the confinement) in a sample of the French general population.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  to assess the evolution of psychological health between the period of confinement and
           post-confinement.

        -  to identify clinical factors modulating psychological state during confinement

      It is expected to highlight :

        -  a link between the intensity of anxiety symptoms and the number/quality of social
           contacts

        -  a reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms in the post-confinement period.

        -  higher consumption of drugs during the confinement period

      Self-questionnaires (Google form format) are sent by mailing lists or social networks to
      participants in order to complete the assessment of psychological state. A unique identifier
      is sent in a separate email. These assessments are performed at least once during the
      confinement period. It is planned to repeat them when the confinement is lifted: 15 days, 3
      and 6 months after the lifting of the confinement because of the risk of developing
      anxiodepressive symptoms, in particular post-traumatic stressors.
