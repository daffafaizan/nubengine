      represent, any joint effusion must be considered as a septic arthritis until proven
      otherwise, thus justifying an arthrocentesis and an adequate treatment. Nevertheless, because
      of epidemiology in primary care, this pragmatic attitude is quite commonly obscured and
      practices vary according to the experience of the doctor and his personal habits. As a
      result, the arthrocentesis is not commonly performed and anti-inflammatory treatment, whether
      based on NSAIDs or corticosteroids, is even sometimes administered to the patient despite the
      contrary guidelines. Although usually effective, this attitude is however not without risks.
      In this context, it seems interesting to develop a simple, reproducible and applicable
      diagnostic tool in a primary care setting for predicting the risk of septic arthritis.

      This study is therefore aimed at the development and validation of a predictive score based
      on simple clinical and paraclinical data (such as the macroscopic appearance of the synovial
      fluid removed) in a patient with an effusion, whatever either the clinical presentation,
      whether isolated or integrated in a more complex clinical presentation, whether associated
      with locoregional inflammatory or general signs or not.
