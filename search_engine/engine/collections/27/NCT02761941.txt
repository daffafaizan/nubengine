    
      This is a retrospective study setting. Source data will be collected by reviewing medical
      records and through computer searches. The basic study population will be identified from
      laboratory INR test results taken between 2003-2015.

      Identifying patients with INR values over 9 will be selected for further analysis, concerning
      the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, 90 day survival and adverse event rates.
      The focus is in identifying patient characteristics and factors influencing the risk of high
      INR value. Also we will analyse the effects of medically reversing the high INR values on
      stroke and other adverse event rates. The results will be collected manually using an
      electronic case report form, and analysed statistically using SPSS/SAS statistics tool.
