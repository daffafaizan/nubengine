      will be confined until at least 24 hours post-dose. On Day 1, eligible participants will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Treatment A or Treatment B. The randomization will be
      stratified by weight categories: >= 60 to < 70 kg, >= 70 to < 80 kg, >= 80 to < 90 kg, and >=
      90 to <= 100 kg.
