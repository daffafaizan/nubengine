      cause of cancer death. Many patients will receive chemo- or immunotherapy in either the
      neoadjuvant setting or for recurrent or metastatic disease. The registration and handling of
      side effect is crucial in bladder cancer treatment, since the missing identification and
      insufficient treatment of such can lead to incomplete treatment and thereby decreased effect.
      It is therefore of utmost importance to develop new tools which can increase identification
      of the side effects and improve treatment to secure the best life expectancies for these
      patients.

      This study will in a randomized trial using PRO-CTCAEâ„¢ questions, EORTC QLQ-C30 + QLQ-BLM30
      in one arm versus standard procedure regarding side effect registration and handling in the
      other arm, test the effect of electronic reporting of side-effects and quality of life with a
      specifically developed alert-algorithm. Both study arms will include chemotherapy and
      immunotherapy patients as standard therapy.
