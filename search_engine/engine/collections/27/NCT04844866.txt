    
      This study should determine superiority of MB-CART2019.1 treatment compared to SoC therapy
      with R-GemOx (rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) with respect to progression-free
      survival in second-line therapy in participants with R-R DLBCL, who are non-eligible for
      high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.

      MB-CART2019.1 is designed to effectively target malignant B cells in patients suffering from
      late stage haematological B-cell malignancies. MB-CART2019.1 consists of autologous cluster
      of differentiation CD20/CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced CD4/CD8 enriched T
      cells, derived from a leukapheresis and processed by using the CliniMACS Prodigy® device.
      Patients who are suitable for this study will be randomized 1:1 to either MB-CART2019.1 or
      SoC. Both treatment arms are unblinded.

      MB-CART2019.1 arm: Single infusion of fresh formulation of 2.5 × 10^6 CAR-transduced
      autologous T cells. IMP is only to be administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. For MB-CART2019.1 production, patients will undergo a
      leukapheresis.

      SoC arm: R-GemOx (8 cycles of 14 days each) or (10% of SoC arm) BR (Bendamustine/Rituximab) +
      polatuzumab vedotin (6 cycles of 21 days each).

      The duration of the active part of the study for each individual participant from screening
      to the end of the 1-year follow-up after infusion of MB-CART2019.1 cells (experimental arm)
      or the start of SoC therapy (comparator arm) will be approximately 55 weeks. The LTFU in Year
      2 after infusion of MB-CART2019.1 cells or the start of treatment in the comparator arm will
      not be part of the active part of the clinical study and will be reported separately.
