      post-bariatric surgery patients. The intervention would consist of weekly sessions for 4
      weeks, followed by one session every two weeks through 12 weeks, with weight change as the
      primary outcome. We will provide behavioral weight loss education to the patients and monitor
      how many calories they are taking in once per week.
