      verify small benign-looking pancreatic NETs. It can be especially important in case of
      insulinoma. The organic hyperilsulinism and severe hypoglicemia causeb by the
      insulin/proinsulin - producing lesion can lead to severe complications and evem death.

      There are some cases of the blinded resections of the pancreas in patients with the "hidden"
      insulinoma when the tumor can't be revealed during the preoperative diagnostics and
      intraoperatively. Unfortunately, blind resection do not solve the problem of the hypoglicemia
      but also cause the specific pancreatic complications.
