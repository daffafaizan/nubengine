      (SERMS)(clomiphene) increase testosterone production through stimulation of the hypothalamic
      pituitary axis. While these drugs both reduce the feedback inhibition of estrogen on the
      pituitary, SERMs cause an increase in serum estradiol, whereas AIs reduce estradiol levels.
      Using these medications, we can obtain therapeutic testosterone levels with either an
      increase or decrease in estradiol levels.
