    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine maximum tolerated carboplatin/gemcitabine dose administered with SBRT as
      measured by < 30-day acute toxicity defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) v4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Off-study SBRT target local control assessment: 6-week post-trial fludeoxyglucose F 18
      (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or other imaging
      response by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) PET criteria
      as listed and National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines.

      II. Off-treatment late toxicity assessment: record 3-month and 6-month radiation-related
      toxicity defined by CTCAE v4.0.

      III. Off-study global clinical benefit assessment: 6-month post-therapy clinical benefit
      (defined as percentage of patients who had complete, partial, or stable disease for at least
      6 months).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Associate pretherapy tumor biopsy ribonucleotide reductase (R1, R2, p53R2), Tip60 and
      Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 expression with 6-week therapy response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      Patients also receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo SBRT on days 2-4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 2 years.
