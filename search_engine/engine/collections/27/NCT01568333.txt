      patients from 9 medical centers in China. All the participants are selected to receive
      low-dose of decitabine treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 3.5mg/m2 for 3 days per
      cycle for 3 cycles). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and
      after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study.
