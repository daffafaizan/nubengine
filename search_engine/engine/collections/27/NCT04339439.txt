      process that can be uncomfortable for the patient and consume clinic time and resources.
      Anecdotal evidence suggests that the addition of a vessel loop under the sutures both
      simplifies suture removal and reduces discomfort. In this study, we propose a prospective,
      randomized, controlled, superiority trial to assess the impact of a vessel loop wound closure
      and suture removal for elective carpal tunnel release (CTR). Patients will be prospectively
      enrolled to one of two groups: closure without a vessel loop or closure with a vessel loop.
      The primary outcome measure will be patient satisfaction with suture removal. Time for wound
      closure, time for suture removal, pain with suture removal and other patient reported
      outcomes will be measured. These data will allow us to determine the benefit of addition of a
      vessel loop in wound closure.
