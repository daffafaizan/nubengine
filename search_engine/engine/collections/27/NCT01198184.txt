      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of temsirolimus in
      combination with RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for both drugs when administered in combination in
      order to quantify the expected interactive effects in PK between these two agents.

      II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of both drugs when administered in combination,
      with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need further
      exploration and validation in future trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on day -6 (course 1 only). Patients then
      receive temsirolimus IV or orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood
      and tumor tissue samples may be collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and correlative
      analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
