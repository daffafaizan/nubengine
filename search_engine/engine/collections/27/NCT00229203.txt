    
      This is a phase II study to determine the efficacy following treatment with Aplidin® 5 mg/m2,
      given as a 3 h iv infusion every 2 weeks, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma (MM) and to obtain the following :

        -  Additional pharmacokinetic information for Aplidin® given as 3-hour IV infusion every 2
           weeks in patients with MM.

        -  To obtain additional genomic and pharmacodynamics information on MM and Aplidin.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of Aplidin® given as 3-hour IV infusion every 2
           weeks in patients with MM alone or in combination with dexamethasone given orally as a
           20 mg daily for 4 days

        -  To determine the response rate in the second cohort of patients following treatment with
           Aplidin®, given as a 3 hour infusion every 2 weeks, plus dexamethasone given orally as a
           20 mg daily for 4 days, starting the same day of Aplidin® administration, as a second
           treatment stage in patients with suboptimal response to Aplidin® as single agent
           (progressive disease after three cycles or stable disease after four cycles).
