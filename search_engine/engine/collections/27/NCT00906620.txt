    
      In this health promotion program, a pilot intervention study will be implemented to assess
      the effects of three different health promoting / suicide prevention programs in 11,000
      students across 11 European countries (Sweden, Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary,
      Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain): 1. A general health promotion program
      targeting students' awareness on healthy/unhealthy behaviours and students' self-efficacy in
      diminishing unhealthy behaviours; 2. ProfScreen - screening by professionals of at-risk
      students through a questionnaire. For adolescents identified as high risk (screen positives)
      the program includes referral to mental health treatment and ensuring compliance. 3. QPR
      (Question, Persuade & Refer) - a gatekeepers' program, training all adult staff at schools
      (teachers, counselors, nurses etc.) and parents on how to recognize & refer a student with
      risk-taking behaviours or suffering from mental illness to mental-health help resources.

      Each of these prevention programs uses a different active component in order to be
      successful. The first prevention program empowers the students by increasing their
      self-efficacy. The second prevention program (ProfScreen) empowers mental health professional
      in identifying subjects at risk. The third program (QPR) empowers teachers and parents in
      at-risk case finding and referring to mental health facilities. The registration of the
      complete RCT is available on the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00000214).
