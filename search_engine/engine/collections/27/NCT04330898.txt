      reason, the request for this imaging technique in these patients is complicated and, often,
      the MRI-based test is replaced by a CT scan that may not be so beneficial for the diagnosis.

      Current data indicate that, with cardiological control and maintaining basic safety
      precautions, MRI could be performed in patients with peacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillators (ICD) that require it for clinical reasons, although it should be noted that
      currently, due to lack of data published, the absolute safety of an MRI in these patients and
      the protocol used in each case cannot be guaranteed.

      This registry proposal is to have data of all patients implanted with Biotronik cardiac
      stimulation devices and evaluate how many of them have an indication for an MRI-based
      diagnostic test, how many of them are already undergoing this diagnostic test, how many are
      given an tomography as an alternative to avoid subjecting patients to an MRI
