      common despite the lack of clinical trials demonstrating either the efficacy or safety of
      these treatments. Two of the more common complementary therapies used in young children with
      a history of recurrent otitis media are preparations of the herb Echinacea purpurea and
      cranial osteopathic manipulative treatment. This study represents one of the first
      double-blinded, placebo controlled trials of each approach in a population of young children
      who presented with three or more recent episodes of acute otitis media.
