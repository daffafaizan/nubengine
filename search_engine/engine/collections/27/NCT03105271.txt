      consent to participate in this study. Patients will consent to daily blood and urine
      collection during their hospitalization and during well clinic visits.

      Each AM, participants will have blood and urine collected, processed, and strored for future
      analysis of hemolytic markers and biomarkers of kidney injury. Patients will also have strict
      urine output recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) will be defined by the current KDIGO
      definition based on either a rise in serum creatinine or decline in urine output. Patient
      medical course will be reviewed to determine interventions and outcomes of their admission
      based on the development of AKI.
