      haematologist and consent obtained. A bone marrow sample will be sent to RMH as per usual
      diagnostic pathway.

      Once received at the RMH, an aliquot will be frozen down for sequencing by the Molecular
      Pathology lab. Only those cases of cytopenia without a specific diagnosis will be the focus
      of this study.

      Results will be fed back to referring consultants with caveats regarding significance.

      Patients will undergo telephone follow up and data will also be provided by local
      consultants.

      The investigators will look at overall survival, development of haematological malignancies
      and full blood count. This will occur annually.
