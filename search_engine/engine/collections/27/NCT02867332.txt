      knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to
      determine the maximal tolerant dose. After the lower number of cycles are considered
      tolerant, an arm of the next higher number of cycles will be open to next patients.
      Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.
