    
      TREATMENTS:

        -  Clopidogrel (Plavix® and/or Iscover®) is an agent inhibiting platelet aggregation
           involved in clot formation. Each tablet contains 75mg of clopidogrel. A matching placebo
           of clopidogrel is an inactive substance that looks similar to the active clopidogrel
           tablet.

      TREATMENT PLAN:

        -  There will be two treatment groups; one will receive clopidogrel 75 mg (1 tablet qd),
           the second matching placebo of clopidogrel (1 tablet qd). These study drugs will be
           administered on top of low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg qd) systematically prescribed to such
           patients. In addition, patients enrolled in CHARISMA will be managed as appropriate for
           their risk factors for atherosclerosis: eg. high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
           diabetes…etc.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:

        -  Combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, acute myocardial infarction.

      STUDY EXECUTION:

        -  Some 7,600 patients per group will be recruited within two years. Patients will be
           observed over a maximum of 3.5 years.

      STUDY TERRITORY:

        -  Approximately 900 sites throughout North/South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and
           South Africa.
