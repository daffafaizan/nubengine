      protection in developing countries, but such schemes may not benefit the poorest. We evaluate
      alternative strategies for improving the uptake of benefits of a community based health
      insurance scheme by its poorest members.

      Comparisons: Three groups are compared to standard insurance scheme members (Control). One
      group is provided with after-sale service and supportive supervision (AfterSS). A second
      group is provided with prospective reimbursement (PR). A third group is provided with these
      two interventions together (Both).
