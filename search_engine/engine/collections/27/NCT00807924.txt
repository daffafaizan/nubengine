      clinical outcomes from patients undergoing Novilase for benign breast conditions (i.e.
      fibroadenomas, papillomas, etc). Data captured will assess the potential advantages and
      disadvantages of the procedure as compared with lumpectomy. Tumor characteristics, equipment
      used, complications, patient satisfaction and cosmesis ratings will also be tracked.
