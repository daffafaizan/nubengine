      obliterating bronchiolitis presenting a "ceiling" to any improvement in function that can be
      achieved by therapies that dilate the airways or lessen inflammation. Such severe COPD is
      commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension at rest or during exercise. Although hypoxia
      has been classically considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism of pulmonary
      hypertension in COPD and oxygen has been the mainstay of therapy, other mechanisms may play
      important roles. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction can be observed in patients with mild to
      moderate COPD who do not have hypoxemia and in smokers with normal lung function. In
      addition, long-term oxygen therapy does not generally result in resolution of the pulmonary
      hypertension. A key question that remains is whether the newer therapies for pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH) could improve pulmonary hypertension and therefore exercise
      tolerance in COPD.

      Unfortunately the use of non-selective pulmonary vasodilator therapy in oral, intravenous or
      subcutaneous form for PAH patients who have unrelated concomitant COPD, is known to cause
      worsening gas exchange and intensification of symptoms despite a decrease in pulmonary
      vascular resistance and arterial pressures.

      We hypothesize that an inhaled pulmonary vasodilator may not worsen ventilation-perfusion
      mismatching by selectively vasodilating well ventilated areas in PAH patients with
      concomitant COPD and in fact may improve ventilation perfusion matching leading to
      preservation or improvement of oxygenation.
