    
      This is a randomized, single-center double blinded study.

      The main objective of this study are to determine the ability of rhC1INH to reduce the
      incidence and severity of delayed graft function in comparison to placebo in recipients of
      kidneys after cardio-circulatory determination of death (DCD).

      This trial has specifically been designed to evaluate the protective effect of rhC1INH
      treatment in patients at high risk of developing DGF. The selection of potential donors to be
      part of this study will be limited to the population of DCD donors which have historically
      shown a risk of developing DGF ranging between 40-55%. Participation in each group will be
      randomly assigned. Treatment will be administered by an intra-operative infusion of placebo
      or rhC1INH (100 Units/kg) IV followed by twice a day infusion of 50 Units/Kg IV for the
      following 48 hours.

      A total of 20 subjects will be divided into 2 groups:

      Group 1: Control group: standard recipient management + placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride IV to
      equal volume of investigational arm: intraoperatively, and then every 12 hours x 2 = total of
      3 doses). treatment (n=10) Group 2: Standard recipient management + 100 U/kg intraoperative
      followed by 50 U/kg every 12 hours x 2 = total of 3 doses (200 U/kg).

      Max dose 8400 units for the initial dose and 4200 units maximum for the second and third
      doses.
