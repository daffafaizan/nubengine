      I. Progression free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate.

      II. Overall survival.

      III. Safety and toxicity.

      IV. Exploratory biomarkers will be assessed as potential predictors of response to treatment
      including: expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and secreted protein acidic
      and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in the primary tumor and changes in levels of circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs).

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or stable
      disease after completion of induction therapy will receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      once every 14 or 21 days and erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up per physician discretion.
