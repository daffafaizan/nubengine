      brain scan and may include a liver scan. Other screening measurements will include a
      Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) assessment, measurement of the amount of oxygen in the
      blood, using a non-invasive device most often placed on the finger, lung function tests that
      will require blowing into a machine, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). About 2 teaspoons, or 10
      mL, of blood will be taken for specific laboratory tests, and a pregnancy test will be done
      on the blood of women of childbearing potential.

      All study patients will receive supplemental oxygen and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
      (30 Gy, 3 Gy fractions) every weekday for 2 weeks. Half of the patients will be randomized
      (assigned) to receive RSR13 prior to WBRT, and will need to have a central catheter placed
      for treatment unless one is already in place. Patients who receive RSR13 will also need to
      continue to receive oxygen in the clinic until the amount of oxygen in their blood is near
      normal. This level has returned to near normal in most patients within 1 to 2 hours.

      During treatment and follow-up visits, physical and neurological exam, KPS assessment,
      weight, height, and vital sign measurements, and about 2 teaspoons of blood may be required.
      Patients will need to return for follow-up visits 1 month after completion of treatment, 2
      months later, and every 3 months thereafter until their doctor tells them otherwise.
