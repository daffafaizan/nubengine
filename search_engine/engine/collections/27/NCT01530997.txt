      low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) after de-intensified chemoradiotherapy
      (CRT). Patients will receive 54 to 60 Gy of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) with
      concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatin (30 mg/m2). Diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI) will
      be obtained 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT to assess response. All patients will have
      surgical resection of any clinically apparent residual primary tumor or biopsy of the primary
      site if there is no evidence of residual tumor and will undergo a limited neck dissection to
      encompass at least those nodal level(s) that were positive pre-treatment, 4 to 14 weeks after
      CRT. The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of pathological complete response (pCR)
      after CRT. Longitudinal assessments of quality of life and patient reported outcomes will be
      obtained prior to, during, and after CRT.
