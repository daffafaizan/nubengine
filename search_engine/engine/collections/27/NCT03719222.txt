    
      This is a non-interventional, mono-centric retrospective study to be carried out in Chi Mei
      Medical Center (CMMC) in order to determine the association between the genomic alterations
      and gene expression level of immune-related genes in cancer. Samples in paraffin-embedded
      block of biopsies or surgical pieces (either primary tumor or metastases) will be analyzed.
      For each sample, clinically relevant data associated with treated cancer and needed for
      characterization of tumor microenvironment will be documented. No additional procedures
      besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be applied to the patients.
      Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice.

      This trial is, through accessing to archival tumor materials, to establish the relationship
      between tumor mutation burden and tumor immune microenvironment for future immunotherapy
      strategy.
