      clinical trials. The most recent is the SPRINT Trial demonstrating that lower blood pressure
      goals can be achieved and are associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and
      mortality. The latest NHANES 2012 data reveal that less than 50% of patients that are aware
      of the elevated blood pressure and are being treated achieve blood pressure control.
      Treatment of hypertension in many patients (>70%) require treatment with more than one drug,
      increasing the likelihood of non-compliance and not achieving blood pressure goal. JNC 8
      recommends the utilizing of combination therapy both for Stage I and Stage II Hypertensive
      patients.

      Objectives of the study to assess the efficacy of LVH reduction and 24-hour blood pressure
      control of Valsartan 80mg and Nebivolol/Valsartan 5/80mg, once daily for the treatment of
      currently treated hypertensive patients with LVH.

      The study will evaluate LVH reduction at 4 and 8 weeks as well as change from baseline in
      mean 24 hour ABPM SBP after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with valsartan 80mg or
      nebivolol/valsartan 5/80mg
