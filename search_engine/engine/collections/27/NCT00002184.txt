    
      This protocol is a stratified, randomized, double-blind, dose-comparative study of the safety
      and efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil in combination with nelfinavir and saquinavir soft gel
      capsules (SGC) or adefovir dipivoxil in combination with nelfinavir or saquinavir SGC plus a
      nucleoside analog (zidovudine, lamivudine, or stavudine).

      Patients will be randomized to adefovir dipivoxil with nelfinavir and saquinavir or adefovir
      dipivoxil with nelfinavir or saquinavir plus a nucleoside analog (zidovudine, lamivudine, or
      stavudine). Within each treatment arm, patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 doses of
      adefovir dipivoxil in a blinded manner. Patients randomized to receive a nucleoside analog
      will then be assigned to receive either zidovudine, lamivudine, or stavudine based upon their
      previous RTI therapy. A daily dose of L-carnitine will be administered to all patients.
