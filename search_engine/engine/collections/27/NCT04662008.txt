      for severe COVID-19 illness. This presents incredibly stressful situations for UCs, which can
      result in depression, anxiety, and worse health outcomes both for them and their care
      recipients. Until a vaccine becomes available, these demands will force UCs to provide more
      support, whether in-person or remotely, for persons with MS. The aim of this study is to
      compare 2 modes of supporting UCs of people with MS. We will compare the effectiveness of a
      high resource highly tailored intervention that includes tele-coaching intervention
      (delivered via videoconference or phone) + web site information to a low-resource web-site
      only intervention. Our primary outcomes are UC anxiety, depression, and stress (DASS-42
      scale) and a secondary outcome is COVID specific anxiety (CAS scale). These 2 interventions
      were selected because they will inform administrators and clinicians on whether a
      resource-intensive or a low-resource intervention is needed to yield meaningful outcomes. The
      comparison will also help UC decide how they should spend their limited time. These
      interventions are relevant to UCs of people with MS because of their need for tailored
      information provided in flexible ways to promote learning and support.
