      Service - text message) which will direct then to the first online survey.

      They will then be contacted again in 6 and 12 months' time to complete the online survey
      again.

      The survey answers will be linked to the results of the antibody tests by their mobile and
      Employment Number and also to data held about them by the HR Department.

      The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete and will include questions on the
      following: profession余 work-line type余 demographics and behavioural factors余 ethnicity余 and
      symptoms (if COVID 19 was manifested).

      Participants can also attend for another blood test (SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2) antibody test) to detect any presence of antibodies at 6 and 12
      months (optional) which will again be linked to the survey and HR data.
