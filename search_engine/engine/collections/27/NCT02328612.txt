    
      Medicinal product Suspension of expanded adipose-derived allogeneic adult stem cells (eASCs)
      at a single dose of 250,000 cells/kg, 1 million cells/kg or 4 million cells/kg by intravenous
      infusion after suspension in Ringer's lactate solution.

      Control Placebo (Ringer's lactate solution) Objectives To investigate the effect of eASCs on
      the inflammatory response to intravenous LPS in humans.

      Design Phase I, randomized, parallel group, placebo control, unicentric, interventional
      study. Thirty two healthy male volunteers aged between 18-35 years will be randomized into
      the eASCs or placebo group if they meet all the inclusion criteria at a 3:1 ratio.

      The treatment administration will be infused intravenously to the following groups after
      randomization:

        -  First arm: 250,000 cells/kg

        -  Second arm: 1 million cells/kg

        -  Third arm: 4 million cells/kg

        -  Fourth arm: placebo according to their weight.

      An hour after the end of the eASCs administration, all subjects will be given an intravenous
      dose of LPS. Subjects will be allowed to leave in the evening once deemed clinically stable
      by the investigator.
