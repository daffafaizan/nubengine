      In this prospective, three-armed randomised controlled study, patients admitted to the adult
      medical wards of Chittagong Medical College Hospital with acute onset of reduced
      consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <12 for less than 5 days) will be randomised 1:1:1 to
      one of three arms; standard care (no intervention) or an educational intervention directing
      placement into one of two recovery positions.

      The educational intervention will occur following randomisation and on daily follow-up until
      recovery from deep coma or death. For patients in the intervention arms, the patients'
      relatives will be instructed on how to maintain their patient in the recovery position, and
      an educational poster will be attached to their bed.

      Enrolled subjects will be observed 3 times a day until discharge for body position and vital
      signs including GCS, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.

      The primary outcome will be the risk of (hazard ratio) aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis.
      The secondary outcome measures will include time to hypoxia, death and coma recovery time.
      Pulmonary complications will be defined clinically and radiologically. The primary comparison
      between groups will be the standard care group versus both recovery positions combined.
      Analysis will be by intention to treat.
