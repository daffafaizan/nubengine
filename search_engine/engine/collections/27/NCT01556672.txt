      to severe plaque psoriasis without a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. All patients
      will undergo capsule endoscopy at the beginning of the study to detect the presence of small
      bowel lesions suggestive of CD such as erosions and ulcers. All patients will receive
      adalimumab 80 mg followed by 40 mg at week 1 and 40 mg every other week (EOW) thereafter.
      Patients for whom no small bowel lesions suggestive of CD were detected will remain in the
      study and under adalimumab therapy until week 12. A second capsule endoscopy will be
      performed 24 weeks after initiation of adalimumab for patients who had small bowel lesions
      suggestive of CD to evaluate changes in bowel inflammation.
