      Bifidobacterium infantis vs. placebo orally administered over a period of 3 weeks on clinical
      features, Quality of Life parameters (QoL), intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers
      of patients having serological evidences of CD (positive serological markers). The testing
      period will be approximately three weeks between the results of serological testing and

      ambulatory (non-hospitalized outpatients) patients, with 2 parallel groups. Treatment arms
      will be as follows:

      A). Placebo 2 capsules 3 times daily (morning, evening and night).

      B). Probiotics (Bifidobacterium infantis) 2 capsules 3 times per day (morning, evening and
