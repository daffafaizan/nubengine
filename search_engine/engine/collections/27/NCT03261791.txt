      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There's limited treatment choice for these
      patients. Even for those who underwent curative resection (R0 resection), the recurrence rate
      was extremely high. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor and reduces the
      angiogenesis of tumor efficiently, which had been proven effective in many solid tumors, is a
      Chinese domestic TKI targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Phase 2 study of
      apatinib for patients with advanced HCC had shown signals of clinical efficacy and modest
      safety. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects and safety of adjuvant apatinib therapy
      for the patients who underwent R0 resection for HCC with PVTT.
