    
      Clinically stable CF patients with a history of pancreatic insufficiency (n=6) and matching
      non-CF subjects (n=6) will be recruited in this study. All subjects will be pre-screened for
      25(OH)D status to include those with 25(OH)D levels below 30 ng/mL. The subjects will receive
      a single oral dose (300,000 - 600,000 IU) of vitamin D3, and the dose will be based on study
      participant's baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level. For CF patients, the dose will be
      administered with food and pancreatic enzyme supplement. This dose was chosen as previous
      studies in pediatric CF patients demonstrated that a large single dose of up to 600,000 IU
      vitamin D3 raised and maintained sufficient 25(OH)D concentrations without any signs of
      adverse events.
