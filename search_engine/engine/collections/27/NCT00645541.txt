      that flows to lymph nodes. The dye will travel to the lymph system and will end up in the
      lymph nodes that are draining the arm.

      In this study, lymphazurin will be used to find the drainage routes from your arm, rather
      than your breast.

      AXILLARY REVERSE MAPPING:

      Before axillary lymph node surgery, your surgeon will inject lymphazurin into your arm. Your
      surgeon will watch how the dye flows and find the channels and nodes draining the arm. You
      will then have standard axillary lymph node (lymph nodes found under the arm) surgery. Any
      lymph nodes found that are dyed blue (lymph nodes that have traveled down the drainage
      pathways) that would normally be removed will be removed and sent to the pathology
      department. Pathologists will check the nodes to see if they have breast cancer cells in
      them. Also as part of routine care, all other axillary lymph nodes draining the breast will
      be removed and checked for breast cancer cells.

      This is an investigational study. Lymphazurin is FDA approved and commercially available. The
      use of lymphazurin with axillary reverse mapping is investigational.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
