      allograft losses in kidney transplant recipients. It is due to the occurrence of de novo
      donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA), i.e. antibodies synthetized by the recipient after
      transplantation against its transplant. There is currently to efficient treatment. The
      purpose of our study is to determine the efficacy of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in
      the treatment of chronic active antibody-mediated rejection, in association with steroids,
      plasma exchanges, and polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins. Patients are recipients of a
      first or a second kidney transplant for more than 3 months. They display de novo DSA i.e. DSA
      not detected the day of transplantation and in pre-transplant sera.. They display signs of
      chronic active AMR on kidney biopsy i.e. a glomerulitis (g) + peritubular capillaritis (ptc)
      Banff score g+ptc ≥ 2, with or without severe chronic glomerulopathy (Banff score cg<3).
      Kidney biopsy may have been performed systematically or because of: :

        1. detection of de novo DSA ,

        2. and /or proteinuria (> 0.5 g/24h)

        3. and /or slow graft dysfunction protocol biopsy Primary endpoint is a combined endpoint
           one year after inclusion, consisting of the stabilization of histological lesions on a
           new kidney biopsy (delta g+ptc ≤1 and delta cg < 1) and a decrease in DSA mean
           fluorescence intensity > 50%.
