    
      This study will include dose escalation and dose expansion phases.

      In the dose escalation portion, patients with advanced cancer will be enrolled and treated
      with Durvalumab and Trabectedin. Durvalumab will be administered at the same dose in each
      dose escalation cohort, while the dose of Trabectedin will be progressively increased in
      different cohorts until the safest dose of the combination is determined.

      In the dose expansion portion patients will be treated with the safest dose of the study
      drugs determined during the dose escalation phase. There will be two separate groups of
      patients treated at this dose to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of the combination. One group
      will consist of non-small-cell lung cancer patients previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1
      inhibitors and another group will consist of an immunotherapy naive group of patients. This
      immunotherapy naive group of patients will include sarcoma and another tumor type, this other
      tumor type will be determined based on anti-tumor efficacy seen during the dose escalation.

      The study drugs will be given intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue for up to
      one year or until disease progression.
