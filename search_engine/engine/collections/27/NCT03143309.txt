      Saudi females do not meet a recommended level of physical activity.

      Study Objective: To test the effect of a physical activity intervention on daily walking.

      Study Design: Parallel group randomized controlled design among female university students.

      Methods: Students will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control arm.
      WhatsApp groups (2 per arm) will be formed within each study arm for communications. The
      intervention participants will receive a brief (15-minute) orientation on diet, exercise, and
      benefits of keeping a healthy weight; each will be instructed to wear a pedometer every day
      for 12-weeks with a daily step goal of 8,000. They will receive 2-3 health-promotional
      (walking and diet) messages per week via WhatsApp; group interaction is optional. The control
      group participants will receive 2-3 non-health related messages per week. Average daily steps
      will be assessed in all participants at baseline and 3-month follow-up using a 7-day
      pedometer measurement.
