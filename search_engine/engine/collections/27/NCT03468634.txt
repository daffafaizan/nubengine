      healthy and diseased tissue in the laboratory by looking at the light emitted by tissue when
      illuminated with a low power laser. The investigators intend to use this technique, known as
      "Raman Spectroscopy" to tell if tissue in the oesophagus is cancerous, healthy or at some
      stage before full blown cancer, which is termed pre-cancer. It has been shown in the
      laboratory that this method will be at least as accurate as the conventional methods used
      now, but will provide the surgeon with instant results without the delay and cost of a
      laboratory analysis by pathologists.

      A miniature probe has been developed that slides through a channel in the endoscope
      (telescope) to the surface of the oesophagus to make near instant assessments of its
      condition without the need for expensive and distressing tissue removal (biopsies). This
      project plans to move this technique from the laboratory to the clinic by demonstrating that
      the method is safe and reliable for use in real patients.
