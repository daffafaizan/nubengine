      VICRYL. The primary outcome measures were number of sutures used and the development of
      hematoma, seroma, surgical site infection (SSI) or wound disruption one week after
      episiotomy. Secondary outcome measures were the cost of the treatment with or without
      infection, and scar evaluation (wound complication).
