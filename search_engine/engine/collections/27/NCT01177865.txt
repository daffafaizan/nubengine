      Primary

        -  To evaluate the importance of prostate cancer treatment characteristics to men with
           localized prostate cancer.

        -  To determine to what extent men will choose the strengths and weaknesses of one
           treatment over a different set of strengths and weaknesses of another treatment when
           making a choice between them.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the correlation between attributes that are important to men and baseline
           demographics, functional status, and disease risk characteristics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete a 'discrete choice experiment' questionnaire presenting three treatment
      options based on 8 aspects of treatment. Attributes relevant to men with prostate cancer
      (e.g., sexual health, urinary function, return to normal activities [work, gardening, sports,
      shopping]) that apply to surveillance, radical therapies and new minimally-invasive therapies
      have been selected for consideration. Baseline demographics such as age,
      working/retired/unemployed/household income, prostate cancer characteristics (PSA level,
      Gleason grade, stage), baseline functional status (genitourinary function), and final
      treatment choice will also be collected in order to ascertain whether there is any
      relationship and association between patient preferences for treatment and these baseline
      demographics. Individuals will be asked to choose between the three treatment profiles.
