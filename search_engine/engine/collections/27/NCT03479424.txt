      validation observational cohorts to develop machine learning algorithms from an in-home suite
      of sensors in order to predict 3-month heart failure hospitalization and/or emergency
      department visits. Study population includes adults presenting with a diagnosis of reduced
      ejection fraction (LVEF <= 40%), NYHA class II-IV) who have had a hospitalization for HF in
      the previous 6 months. The study objectives include (1) To collect observational data from
      multiple sensors, patient-reported outcomes, and medical record data to develop (train)
      machine-learning algorithms (2) To validate trained algorithms in a separate validation
      cohort (3) To collect data to inform the design of a future intervention study. The primary
      outcome is Ninety-day heart failure hospitalization/emergency department visit for heart
      failure.
