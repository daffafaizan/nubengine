      heart will be enrolled into the research study. Most of the procedures in the study standard
      care used by cardiologists when treating blocked arteries. Patients enrolled will need
      treated with an IVUS- VH (intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual histology) which is an
      arterial stent procedure, that involves threading a tiny wire into the artery, followed by a
      balloon, a stent, or other device to treat a blocked artery, and often (though not always), a
      special ultrasound catheter to take pictures of the inside of the artery. We will collect all
      the data from the above stated standard medical care procedure.

      Participants in the study, will have an additional procedure performed: a tiny tube will be
      advanced into the heart artery to collect a blood sample for research purposes, and a blood
      sample will be collected from the femoral (thigh) artery through the tube that will be placed
      there as a standard part of having this procedure.

      The blood that is collected will be analyzed for markers of inflammation or irritation in the
      blood (c-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, Monocyte chemotactic protein-1), as well and a
      gene called Matrix Metallopeptidase 3, which is believe to influence the progression of
      plaque on the walls of arteries and the progression of coronary artery disease. .

      Finally, after discharged from the hospital, the research nurses will call you at home to ask
      you questions about how you are doing for approximately 5-10 minutes. Telephone follow-up
      will occur at one month, six months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 36 months.
