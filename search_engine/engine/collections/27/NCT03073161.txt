      and alveolar bone that support the teeth. Bacteria and the body's own immune system mediate
      the severity of periodontitis, where teeth may become loose, fall out or have to be removed.
      Sanative therapy is a non-surgical process invovling mechanical debridement of bacterial
      biofilms on roots of teeth, below the gum line. A previous study found that a diet higher in
      fruits and vegetables, beta-carotene, vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol, and fish oils
      (specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) was positively
      associated with periodontal healing after sanative therapy. There is some evidence that
      higher intakes of flavonoids and thus flavonoid-containing foods may benefit periodontal
      health. These foods include a wide variety of fruits and tea. The relationship of flavonoid
      intake within the overall dietary pattern has not been assessed in relation to recovery from
      sanative therapy and associated markers of improved periodontal health. The overall objective
      is to determine if higher dietary flavonoid intakes are associated with improved clinical
      outcomes after sanative therapy compared to individuals with lower intakes. At baseline and
      the follow-up appointment, the following will be assessed: dietary intakes of macronutrients
      and micronutrients using the Block 2015 food frequency questionnaire; intakes of fruit,
      vegetables and fiber using the Block Dietary Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener; nutritional
      supplement use and tea intake using in specially developed questionnaires and salivary
      markers of inflammation.
