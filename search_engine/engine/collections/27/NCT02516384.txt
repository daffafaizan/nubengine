      morbidity and mortality. Current therapies remain limited by side effects and loss of
      response over time, and there is an ongoing need for new therapies. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT), which has proven to be safe and effective in the management of
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been proposed as a therapy for UC. There have been
      studies examining the role of FMT in UC, but they have shown mixed results, and have not
      examined the underlying immunologic and microbial changes to explain how and why FMT works
      from specific donors and in certain recipients. Furthermore, no studies have examined the
      long-term safety of FMT in patients with UC. This proposal aims to examine: (a) the short-
      and long-term safety of FMT in patients with UC, (b) the efficacy of FMT as a therapy for
      mild-moderate UC, and (c) the microbial and immunologic changes that occur after FMT, to help
      understand how and why it works in this group of patients.
