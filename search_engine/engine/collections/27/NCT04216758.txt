      5%. About 25% of patients have the opportunity for radically surgical resection when
      diagnosis. However, the recurrence rate is up to 85% within 2 years. Data from clinical
      trials indicated that gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy reduced recurrence and enhanced
      overall survival for patients who have undergone surgery to remove their tumor.
      Nab-paclitaxel could significantly increase the concentration of gemcitabine in the tumor;
      recent studies showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved
      progression-free survival and overall survival of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. A
      study in Japan and Taiwan compared the efficacy of gemcitabine in combination with tegafur in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The median progression-free
      survival was significantly better in the gemcitabine combined with the tegafur group than in
      the gemcitabine group. The present study is intended to observe the effect of albumin
      paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine and tegafur combined with gemcitabine on recurrence-free
      survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing radical resection.
