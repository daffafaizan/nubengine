      polyethylene neonatal probe taped to the infant's palm, toe, or dorsum of the foot. The probe
      will be connected to an Massimo Rad97 pulse oximeter that is standardized at the factory. It
      runs through an automatic systems check when turned on and needs no further calibration
      before being used. The oxygen saturation measurements will be considered valid when there
      will be a normal plethysmographic waveform, a fullscale signal strength bar, and a stable
      heart rate closely approximating an independent electrocardiographic (ECG) pulse rate. The
      pulse oximeter works by using the technology of plethsmography which allows the detection of
      an arterial pulse) with oximetry (which measures oxygen saturation at specific wavelengths).
      The pulse oximeter will be placed on each infant as already described. After a stable pulse
      oximeter reading was obtained, the value will be recorded ("before") and then the probe will
      be covered with a standard disposable diaper, shiny side up. When the reading stabilized, the
      value will be recorded ("during") and then the diaper will be removed.
