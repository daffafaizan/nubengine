      pachychoroid treated with combined therapy, consisting in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and 3
      intravitreal therapy (IVT) of Aflibercept monthly. Inclusion criteria are the presence of
      haemorrhagic or exudative PCV diagnosed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Indocyanine
      Green Angiography (ICGA) and the mean central choroidal thickness > 250 µm. Exclusion
      criteria comprehend ocular comorbidity, previous cardiovascular events and different ocular
      surgical procedures form cataract surgery. Participants undergo a thorough ophthalmic
      assessment that included best corrected visual acuity (CDVA), slit lamp biomicroscopy and
      dilated funduscopic examination. OCT, OCT-Angiography (OCT-A), ICGA and Fluoresceine
      Angiography (FA) were performed for all patients. The 12-month follow-up foresee monthly
      revaluations of the above measurements, excluding FA, repeated only on clinical judgement.
      CDVA will be measured using LogMAR. Choroidal and retinal thicknesses will be automatically
      measured by digital software OCT- integrated (IMAGEnet). All patients will be treated with a
      loading dose of Aflibercept combined with PDT within the first 7 days of the first
      intravitreal therapy. The spot size is calculated by adding 1000 μm to the greater linear
      dimension of the lesion. No additional therapy will be performed during follow-up unless
      signs of reactivation.
