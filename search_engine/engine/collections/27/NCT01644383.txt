      However, some may develop psychosocial problems because they have lost family members,
      experienced poverty, social discrimination etc. Being a normal teenager is tough and is the
      most complex period of his/her life. This is the period when most teenagers will find their
      identity and reasons for living. Therefore it is believed that interventions may help
      HIV-infected teenagers better deal with life. For this study, logotherapy, a therapy that
      will help a person to discover his/her purpose in life, live meaningful life, and attain
      self-esteem was used. The success of the intervention was evaluated by using The Purpose in
      Life Test.
