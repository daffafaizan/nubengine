      participants with advanced gastric cancer. Of these 32 participants, 16 will be from sites in
      the Asia Pacific (AP) region and the other 16 will be from sites outside the AP region.

      Protocol Amendment 02 (07 Apr 2014) added a new study arm (Cohort B2) for approximately 110
      participants with advanced head and neck cancer who will receive a lower dose of
      pembrolizumab every three weeks (Q3W). Both programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)- positive
      and PD-L1-negative participants will be enrolled into this cohort.

      Protocol Amendment 03 (26 May 2015) removed the secondary objective of investigating the
      relationship between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition and up-regulation of cytokines
      biomarkers predicting response (e.g. Interleukin-10 [IL-10]) from the protocol.

      Participants who stopped study treatment without progression (e.g. completed 2 years) may
      have been eligible for up to 1 year of retreatment upon subsequently experiencing disease
      progression.

      With Amendment 05 (11 Dec 2017), once study participants have achieved the study objective or
      the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an
      extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.
