      0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of Adacel (Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and
      acellular Pertussis) vaccine, among 55 healthy post partum women. The purpose of the study is
      to examine the immune responses and subsequent decline in serum and breast milk antibody
      titers over two years of observation. The clinical trial will involve women (aged 18 - 45
      years) who have just delivered full-term infants (greater than or equal to 37 completed weeks
      of gestation) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. One particular population at
      Vanderbilt to target will be the "centering prenatal care group" that has breastfeeding rates
      as high as 75 percent at hospital discharge and maintained at 20 percent at 6 months. The
      enrollment period will be fifteen months. The subjects, staff assessing subjects, and
      laboratory personnel will be aware of receipt of the vaccine. Since only a single vaccine
      product is being utilized, there is no blinding needed of the subjects or staff.
