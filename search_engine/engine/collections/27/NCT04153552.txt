      of occasional indigestion and heartburn in 200 adult participants who suffer from occasional
      indigestion and heartburn and 2) the subjective experience of these participants related to
      general health, indigestion and heartburn symptoms, and personal experience with the test
      product.

      While dietary and lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms of indigestion and heartburn,
      HLNatural, Inc. created the test product to reduce occasional indigestion and heartburn. The
      test product is a plant-based remedy formulated with ingredients that have demonstrated
      efficacy reducing symptoms associated with occasional indigestion and heartburn.
