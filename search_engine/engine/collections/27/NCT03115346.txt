    
      This is a cluster randomized trial comparing two ways to better align Veterans' preferences
      and treatments for AAA: (1) a validated decision aid describing AAA repair types with a
      survey measuring Veterans' preference for repair type -- versus (2) the survey alone.
      Enrolled Veterans will be candidates for either endovascular or open repair, and be followed
      at VA hospitals by vascular surgery teams who regularly perform both types of repair. In Aim
      1, the investigators will determine Veterans' preferences for endovascular or open repair and
      identify domains associated with each repair type. In Aim 2, the investigators will compare
      agreement between Veterans' preferences and repair type between the decision aid+survey and
      survey-alone groups. In Aim 3, the investigators will investigate the facilitators and
      barriers of implementing a decision aid in a VA surgical clinic. The investigators will
      identify factors associated with agreement. The investigators' findings will be reported to
      the National Surgery Office Vascular Surgery Advisory Board to help ensure Veterans'
      preferences remain at the center of AAA treatment decisions. The investigators have recruited
      20 VA Medical Centers and their vascular surgery teams to participate in this trial.
