      affects the accuracy of applanation tonometry. A meta-analysis by Doughty and Zaman showed
      that a 10% change in central corneal thickness may result in an approximately 3.4-mmHg change
      in intraocular pressure.1 Accuracy of corneal thickness measurement is also important in
      considering eligibility for refractive surgery, and the amount of correction that can safely
      be performed. Underestimation of corneal thickness may lead to eligible patients being
      excluded for primary or enhancement refractive procedures. Overestimation may lead to
      over-ablation and inadvertent thinning of the stroma, thereby increasing the risk of
      iatrogenic keratectasia. Hence, studies assessing corneal thickness measurements by various
      instruments are of high clinical relevance.2-9 Fourier domain optical coherence tomography
      (FD-OCT, OptoVue, U.S.A), Confoscan 4 (CS-4, Nidek, USA) and ocular response analyzer (ORA,
      Reichert, USA) are non-invasive medical devices that have recently received FDA approval for
      measurement of the cornea thickness. However, the repeatability and reproducibility of these
      instruments remains unproven in the clinical settings. To our knowledge, this is the first
      study to describe agreement, repeatability and reproducibility in corneal pachymetric mapping
      between FD-OCT, ORA, CS-4 and conventional ultrasound (US), which has been the current
      reference corneal pachymetric mapping system for the majority of refractive surgeons.
