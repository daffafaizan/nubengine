      Paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 IV infusion over 1 hour days 1, 8 and 15 of 28 day cycle

      Plus

      Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycle.

        -  1 cycle = 28 days (4 weeks)

        -  Disease assessments will be performed per RECIST every other cycle

        -  After a minimum of 4 cycles or a maximum of 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy,
           bevacizumab monotherapy may continue until disease progression or intolerable side
           effects
