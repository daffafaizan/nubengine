      absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) in the unit of ml/min/g to facilitate
      the early diagnosis of coronary disease (CAD). It can be more beneficial for patients with
      three-vessel disease, microvascular disease or obesity. At present, the diagnostic capability
      of 13N-ammonia PET MPI has been well studied, but its clinical usability is largely limited
      by short half-life. 18F-labeled MPI tracer (18F-FMPP) is a new type of PET tracer for MPI.
      Preclinical studies showed that 18F-FMPP has important characteristics such as high
      myocardial retention and low background uptake of adjacent organs, which may be a more ideal
      drug for PET MPI toward routine clinical utilization. Our study will assess the safety
      profile, image quality and diagnostic performance of 18F-FMPP PET in detection of CAD by
      using invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard. In addition, the investigators
      will further compare the diagnostic performance of 18F-FMPP PET MPI with that of 13N-ammonia
      PET MPI.
