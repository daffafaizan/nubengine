      will be recruited for the experimental arm (no axillary SLNB in cases with breast pCR after
      NAST) exclusively. EUBREAST-01 is an international multicentric trial and designed by
      European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists (EUBREAST). The University
      Medicine Rostock (Germany) will overtake the sponsorship for the trial.

      Duration of recruitment is 2 years among 30 German, 10-15 Italian, 3 Spanish, 3 Swedish, and
      3 Austrian study centres. The total number of patients to be recruited into the trial will be
      267. All participating centres are experienced in conduction of clinical trials and stated at
      least a rate of 50 primary breast cancer diagnosis per year. At least 30% of all primary
      breast cancer are TNBC or HER2-positive tumors. The great majority of these cases will be
      diagnosed in tumor stage T1c-T3 (>1cm). The NAST with chemotherapy (plus anti-HER2 therapy if
      HER2-positive) is standard for this cohort in Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Sweden. If
      each study center will recruit 3 cases per year, the planned recruitment of 267 patients
      (per-protocol analysis) will be reached in 2 years.

      Efficacy analyses will be conducted after a follow-up of 3 years for each patient regarding
      the primary outcome and after 5 years follow-up for the secondary outcomes. No interim
      analysis is planned. Patients will be assessed for disease recurrence according to standard
      national clinical practice over a period of at least 5 years. Longest follow-up is 7 years.
      History and physical examination will be performed every 6 months for the first 36 months and
      yearly thereafter. Annual mammography and sonography will be required; other testing will be
      based on symptoms and investigator preference.
