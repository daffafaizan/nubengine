      factor for pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. The resulting respiratory compromise
      after aspiration is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The risk of
      pulmonary aspiration is especially important in pregnant women, as they may often require
      surgery without having observed appropriate fasting. A bedside ultrasound assessment of the
      status of the gastric content would be of great value for the clinician. This technique has
      recently been shown very promising in non-pregnant patients and it is important to study its
      feasibility in the pregnant population.

      In this study, patients fast overnight and are randomized to the following groups: empty, or
      various volumes of fluid (50, 100, 200, 300 or 400mL of apple juice before scanning). Their
      gastric contents are then assessed by an anesthesiologist, using ultrasound. The
      investigators aim to evaluate a standardized quantitative ultrasound assessment of gastric
      volume in non-labouring pregnant women.
