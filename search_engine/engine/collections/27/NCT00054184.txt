        -  Compare the efficacy of polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) vs docetaxel as second-line
           therapy, in terms of duration of overall survival, in patients with progressive
           non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Compare the safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the disease control (stable disease maintained for at least 12 weeks, partial
           response, or complete response) and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the improvement in lung cancer symptoms in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity, edema, alopecia, and side effects
           related to corticosteroids in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients who receive at least 4 courses of study treatment.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to stage (IV vs other), performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), start of front-line
      chemotherapy from randomization (less than 16 weeks vs at least 16 weeks), gender, and prior
      taxane therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) IV over 10 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. In both arms, courses repeat
           every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 840 patients (420 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
