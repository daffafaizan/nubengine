    
      A group of 20 cognitively intact younger participants (age 21-35), a group of 20 cognitively
      intact older participants (age 55+) and an age-matched group of 20 MCI/mild AD participants
      will be enrolled in the brain stimulation study with behavioral assessments at baseline and
      post-intervention. All participants will perform a laboratory-based memory task and an
      autobiographical memory task, followed by the autobiographical interview after the tACS
      intervention. Each participant will undergo three experimental sessions, applying 20-minute
      gamma tACS stimulation, theta tACS stimulation or an active sham (control) to the left
      angular gyrus. Before, during, and after the brain stimulation scalp high-density
      257-channels EEG will be recorded to characterize and differentiate brain activity and
      regional interactions in the three independent groups.
