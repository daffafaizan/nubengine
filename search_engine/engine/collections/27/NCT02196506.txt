      therapy for MDD, particularly for treatment-resistant MDD. Several atypical antipsychotics
      have been shown to enhance the response to ADT. This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy
      of brexpiprazole (2.0 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy to an assigned open-label ADT in
      depressed subjects with and without anxious distress.
