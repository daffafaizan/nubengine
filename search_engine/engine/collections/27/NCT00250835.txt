      concurrent chemoradiation delivered either pre-operatively or post-operatively for resectable
      rectal cancer is supported by clinical trial data but the impact on overall survival with
      either approach remains controversial. An ideal regimen for preoperative chemoradiation in
      locally advanced rectal cancer would include agents that are both potent radio-sensitizers
      and effective in treating micro-metastatic disease without excessive toxicity. The
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is over expressed in colorectal cancer, but the exact role of
      this over expression in tumorigenesis remains an active area of research. The area with the
      most potential in using cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in cancer treatment may be to use them as
      an adjunct to other modalities of treatment.

      Taking into consideration all the above, a previous pilot trial of neoadjuvant therapy with
      combined oxaliplatin, capecitabine, celecoxib (a COX-2 inhibitor), and radiation was
      conducted in four patients with operable rectal cancer. Promising results, including pain
      relief and downstaging of cancer, were observed.

      Therefore, this single-arm phase II trial of preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for
      patients with T3-4N0-2M0 rectal cancer was initiated to assess patient outcomes and explore
      the relationship between COX-2 expression in surgical specimens and therapeutic endpoints.
