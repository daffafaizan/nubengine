      in the treatment of prolactinomas, but its clinical use is hampered by intolerance and/or
      resistant in some patients. It had been showed that DA inhibit prolactin secretion by binding
      to and activating dopamine D2 receptors.PET-MR combined MR images with PET function images is
      substantial to evaluate the expression of dopamine D2 receptors.The aim is to study the in
      vivo expression of dopamine D2 receptors in prolactinoma and the predictive role of dopamine
      D2 receptors PET-MR imaging in the therapeutic effect of DA.
