      (MMCR) may experience postoperative pain and discomfort related to the suture material on the
      palpebral conjunctiva. This study aims to compare the postoperative subjective complaints,
      such as pain and discomfort, with a visual analog scale (VAS) and objectively evaluate the
      cornea with a tear break-up time (TBUT) test and fluorescein staining following MMCR that was
      managed by either a bandage contact lens (BCL) or eye patching.
