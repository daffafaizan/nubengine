        -  Determine the undertaken oxygen sensitive MRI for the detection of hypoxia in patients
           with Stage III-IV head and neck cancer.

        -  Correlate MRI parameters with histology, gene expression, and plasma osteopontin.

        -  Correlate tumor hypoxia measurements with patient prognosis and treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Pre-therapy MRI: Patients undergo blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) contrast MRI on
           room air breathing over 2 minutes and with oxygen gas over 15 minutes. Patients also
           undergo MR-spectroscopy over 15 minutes to measure choline and lactate markers, and
           dynamic contrast MRI with gadolinium contrast over 8 minutes.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive platinum based chemotherapy every two weeks.
           Patients also undergo radiation therapy for 6 weeks.

        -  Post-radiation MRI: Patients undergo MRI as before chemoradiotherapy. Blood and tumor
           samples are collected at baseline for biomarker analysis associated with tumor
           progression or response.

      After completion of study, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.
