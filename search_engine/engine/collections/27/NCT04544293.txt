    
      This is an interventional, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel groups,
      placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase 3 trial in adult subjects who are diagnosed with
      aPAP.

      160 adult subjects with aPAP will be randomized to receive treatment with inhaled
      molgramostim or placebo.

      Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) diagnosis should be confirmed by an
      anti-GM-CSF auto-antibody test result, and history of PAP based on either high resolution
      computed tomography, lung biopsy, or bronchoalveolar lavage cytology, should be available.

      The trial consists of a 6-week screening period, a 48-week randomized, double-blind treatment
      period, a 48-week open-label treatment period, and a conditional 2-week safety follow-up
      period. The total treatment duration will be 96 weeks. Subjects who complete the double-blind
      treatment period will continue into the open-label treatment period and receive once daily
      treatment with molgramostim. During the trial, whole lung lavage will be allowed as rescue
      treatment in case of worsening of aPAP.
