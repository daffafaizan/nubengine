        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin and probenecid
           in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin (PDX) and
      probenecid.

      Patients receive probenecid IV and PDX IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive sequentially escalating doses of probenecid and PDX until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
