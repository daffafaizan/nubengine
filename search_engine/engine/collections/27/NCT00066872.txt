        -  Compare the rate of local recurrence at 3 years in patients with nodular or superficial
           basal cell skin cancer treated with imiquimod 5% cream vs excisional surgery.

        -  Compare recurrence at 6 months and 1, 2, and 5 years in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the time to first recurrence in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the aesthetic appearance of lesion sites in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare pain in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and lesion type (nodular vs superficial). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive topical imiquimod to a single lesion once daily for 6 weeks for
           a superficial lesion or 12 weeks for a nodular lesion. Patients with early treatment
           failure or recurrence are offered surgical excision.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgical excision. Patients are followed at 6, 12, and 18
           weeks, every 6 months for 1 year, annually for 2 years, and then at 5 years.
