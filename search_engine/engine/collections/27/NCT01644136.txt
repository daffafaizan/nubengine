      I. To determine whether, if applied to the lymph node basins after pelvic lymph node
      dissection, Arista could potentially reduce the formation of lymphoceles and consequently the
      need for secondary interventions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node
      dissection. After lymph node dissection, patients undergo microsphere-mediated lymphocele
      prevention to the lymph node basin on one side of the pelvis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.
