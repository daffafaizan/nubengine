    
      This is an open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment
      participants are receiving), multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of ibrutinib with the
      moderate and the strong CYP3A inhibitors (erythromycin and voriconazole respectively) in
      participants with B-cell malignancies (including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia /Small
      Lymphocytic Lymphoma [CLL/SLL], Follicular Lymphoma [FL], Marginal Zone Lymphoma [MZL],
      Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia [WM] or Mantle Cell Lymphoma [MCL]). The study will consist
      of a Screening Phase (28 days), a Treatment Phase (consisting of six 28-days cycles), and an
      End-of-Treatment (EoT) Visit (within 30 days after the last dose of study drug). The study
      will consist of 2 Parts. In Part 1, extent of the DDI between ibrutinib at dose level of 140
      milligram (mg) and CYP3A inhibitors will be assessed. After completion of Part 1 of the
      study, an interim analysis of all available PK and safety data will be conducted and Part 2
      will only be performed if the observed drug interaction is less than anticipated based on
      current information. In Part 2, safety and PK of ibrutinib at dose level of 560 mg
      administered with CYP3A inhibitors will be assessed. Participants who continue to derive
      clinical benefit from ibrutinib treatment at the end of this study, and who are eligible to
      continue in the PCI-32765CAN3001 study (NCT01804686) will end their participation in this
      trial, have an EoT visit completed, and will continue receiving ibrutinib as a part of the
      PCI-32765CAN3001 protocol. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
