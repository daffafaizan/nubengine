    
      WiNK is a prospective 2-stage, open-label, single arm, multicentre Phase I/IIa trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of oNKord®, an off-the-shelf, ex vivo-cultured allogeneic NK
      cell preparation, in 33 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are in complete
      morphologic remission with residual measurable disease and with no strong indication for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Following informed consent and eligibility procedures, subjects enrolled in the trial will
      receive a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      (Cy/Flu) followed by up to 3 oNKord® infusions 4 days apart.

      Stage A of the trial (dose escalation stage) is designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of up to 3 oNKord® infusions, 4 days apart, in 3 cohorts of 3 subjects, and to
      determine the oNKord® recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) to be used in Stage B.

      Stage B of the trial (expansion stage) will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      oNKord® at the RP2D in 24 subjects.

      All subjects treated with oNKord® will be followed up until 12 months after the start of
      treatment. Eligibility criteria for participation in the trial and follow-up duration are the
      same for subjects in both Stage A and Stage B.
