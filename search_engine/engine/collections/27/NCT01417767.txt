      years as well as a high risk of their disease progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
      The only treatment with a curative potential is allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
      However, in the majority of patients, this treatment is not applicable, mainly due to the age
      of the recipients and comorbid conditions. Low-dose chemotherapy CHG regimen (low-dose
      cytarabine, homoharringtonine with G-CSF priming)has been used to treat higher-risk MDS in
      China and achieve high response rate. Hypomethylating agents 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
      (decitabine) is nucleoside analogs that covalently bind to the DNA methyltransferases,
      irreversibly inhibiting their function, leading to the progressive loss of methylation and
      reversal of gene silencing. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety
      of CHG regimen to Decitabine in higher-risk MDS.
