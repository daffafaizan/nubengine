    
      Avulux™ is intended to decrease the impact of headache and migraine on normal daily life and
      the ability to function, and reduce the frequency and severity of headache, in adult patients
      diagnosed with episodic migraine headache or chronic migraine.

      Avulux™ consists of a pair of optical filters in the form of spectacle lenses, provided in
      standard spectacle frames or as clip-on units, coated with a thin film that effectively
      blocks light at specified wavelength ranges while minimizing distortion of the visible
      spectrum. The optical filters block a portion of the optical spectrum that is suspected to
      stimulate photophobic responses that trigger some, and exacerbate most, migraines.
