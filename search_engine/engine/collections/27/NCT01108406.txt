      deafness (SSD). The Sonitus BCD consists of an Oral Appliance (OA), an external microphone
      component, worn behind the ear (BTE), a calibration interface cable and a PC-controlled
      calibration software for subject calibration. The Sonitus BCD picks up sounds from a
      microphone located within the ear canal of the deaf ear, capitalizing on the acoustics of the
      natural pinna and ear canal. The signal picked up by the microphone is then transmitted
      wirelessly to a removeable bone conduction oral appliance located on the upper molars. The
      oral appliance receives the acoustic signal from the BTE and applies an equivalent vibratory
      signal to the teeth that reaches the skull via bone conduction and routed transcranially to
      the contralateral cochlea.
