      Primary

        -  Compare the rate of remission, severe infections, and side effects in patients with
           relapsed advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine, mitoxantrone
           hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide with vs without filgrastim.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of remission in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days 1-3, mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on day
           1, and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide
           as in arm I and filgrastim (G-CSF) beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts
           recover.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 165 patients will be accrued for this study.
