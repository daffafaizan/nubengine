    
      This study utilises The Heart Hive, an international, online registry of patients with
      self-reported clinically diagnosed cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, and people with a family
      history of cardiomyopathy, enrolled on an on-going basis. Registry participants are invited
      to enter self-reported demographics and health data relevant to their cardiac diagnosis into
      The Heart Hive online database.

      Registry participants with self-reported clinically diagnosed dilated (DCM )or hypertrophic
      (HCM) cardiomyopathy will be recruited to an observational, prospective study entailing
      collection of patient-reported baseline demographic data and clinical risk factors,
      genotyping, and annual collection of follow up data from patients, national registries (NHS
      Digital) and medical records.

      In the pilot phase 100 DCM and 100 HCM patients will be recruited to a validation study.
      Consent will be sought to access medical information from health care providers in order to
      compare against and confirm self-reported health information. DNA will be obtained from
      saliva samples and tested in-house using a panel of clinically validated known Mendelian DCM
      and HCM genes as a second validation of the accuracy of self-reported diagnosis and to
      confirm equivalent genetic architecture of DCM and HCM in direct-to-patient recruited cohorts
      compared to traditional centre of excellence clinic-based recruitments.

      Following validation of the approach and once funding is in place for genomic studies, larger
      numbers of affected DCM and HCM patients will be recruited to this study from the registry of
      research willing participants.
