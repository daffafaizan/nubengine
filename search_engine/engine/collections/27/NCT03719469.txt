    
      1. participants: A total of 100 subjects (aged 18-65 years) who were diagnosed as RA with
           moderate to severe activity at the division of rheumatology and clinical immunology at
           Mansoura University were evaluated in this study.

        2. patients were evaluated for therapeutic response at baseline and 12, and 24 weeks of
           green tea therapy. All patients with RA were subjected for estimation of ESR, CRP,
           disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patient's global assessment (PGA), and
           health assessment questionnaire damage index (HAQ-DI) at each visits (0 week, 12 weeks,
           and 24 weeks).

        3. Pain intensity was assessed by using a standard VAS of 100 mm previously validated to
           chronic and acute pains.

        4. Clinical response to green tea therapy for 24 weeks was calculated from DAS28 scores.

        5. human miR-146a and miR-125ba were isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis
