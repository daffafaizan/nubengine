      Patients will be screened for eligibility prior to liver transplantation. Patients who have
      undergone successful liver transplantation will be initiated on a tacrolimus-based regimen
      that includes MMF and/or Steroids and enter the baseline period (between 3 and 7 days
      post-transplantation). At 30 (Â± 5) days post-transplantation, patients who meet additional
      randomization inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized into 2 groups of this study. In
      the first group, patients will be maintained on a tacrolimus-based (sirolimus-free)
      immunosuppression regimen. The second group will be treated with sirolimus-based
      (tacrolimus-free) immunosuppression regimen. For patients in both groups, mycophenolic acid
      prodrugs like mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids are initiated at the time of liver
      transplantation according to local practice. Steroids reduction is encouraged by 3 months
      post liver transplantation.

      In the first year after randomization all patients will be followed up after month 1, 2, 3,
      4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12. After that, patients are followed every 3 months. Tacrolimus and
      sirolimus trough levels in patients of both groups will be tested and adjusted if need be at
      each follow-up date to achieve the desired steady-state trough levels.

      The primary endpoint is defined as HCC recurrence-free time interval between the date of
      liver transplantation and the date of HCC recurrence or death; patients who are alive and
      recurrence-free at the end of month 36 will be censored at the time of their last follow-up
      date. HCC recurrence can be determined during the entire follow-up period.
