      Despite the fact that colonoscopy is widely available and is performed by many experienced
      colonoscopists there are concerns about the quality of colonoscopy as measured by several
      technical endpoints such as rate of failed caecal intubation and polyp miss rate. A large
      population-based study revealed 13.1% of colonoscopies failed to reach the cecum. In
      addition, one large review of back-to-back colonoscopies showed polyp miss rates of 24% for
      adenoma.

      One potentially promising technique is cap-assisted colonoscopy. A transparent cap (or
      "hood") is a simple plastic device that can be attached to the tip of a colonoscope before
      performing the colonoscopy. Several randomized trials from Japan have mixed results regarding
      improved cecal intubation times and polyp detection rates. A recent large study from Hong
      Kong showed improved time to cecum but a reduced polyp detection rate. To date there is no
      large randomized study using the cap in a western population, in whom the colorectal cancer
      (CRC) incidence is known to be higher. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      investigate the usefulness of cap-assisted colonoscopy in a Western population.
