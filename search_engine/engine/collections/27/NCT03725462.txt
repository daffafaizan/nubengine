      electrophysiological signal monitoring. The Cardioskin monitors electrocardiogram signal. The
      Neuronaute monitors electroencephalogram, electromyogram and electrocardiogram.

      This study will permit to optimize the devices performance.

      To the study, subjects of at least 18 years old will test Cardioskin and or Neuronaute
      device, without randomization.
