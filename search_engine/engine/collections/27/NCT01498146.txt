      attack (TIA), monitoring them with a cardiac loop recorder for up to three years.

      it aims at estimating the amount of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation within our population of
      cryptogenic stroke patients.

      Standard workup for a stroke patient does offer cardiac evaluation, but monitoring is limited
      to the time admitted, often just a few days.
