      patients with GI cancer experience significant emotional distress and disruptions in their
      social relationships as well as multiple physical symptoms and limitations in physical
      activities. There is evidence that cancer patients who are able to confide their feelings and
      concerns about the cancer experience with supportive others, particularly their partners,
      fare better. patients who are able to discuss cancer openly with their partners report fewer
      emotional and physical complaints, and higher levels of self-esteem and perceived control.
      However, there are a number of barriers that often inhibit discussion of cancer-related
      feelings. The proposed study will examine the effect of a new partner-assisted emotional
      disclosure (ED) protocol for patients with GI cancer.

      In this study, 200 patients diagnosed with GI cancer and their partners will be recruited to
      participate. The couples will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1)
      partner-assisted emotional disclosure, or 2) cancer education. Assessment measures will be
      collected at evaluations conducted before and after treatment and at 8 weeks post treatment.
      All evaluations will be conducted over the phone. Information will also be collected from the
      physician and/or the patient's medical record at each of the three evaluations. Audiotapes of
      the partner-assisted emotional disclosure sessions will be transcribed and 10-minute segments
      will be randomly selected and analyzed to assess the extent to which patients express
      emotions and partners verbally reflect the partner's feeling in an empathic manner.
