      pressure(PEEPi) of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) patients with respiratory
      failure.The diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) represents the neural drive to the diaphragm.A
      multi-pair esophageal electrode catheter was used to record the EMGdi.The PEEPi was assessed
      by the by the balloon-catheter in the multi-pair esophageal electrode catheter. In present
      study the PEEPi of COPD patients was increased by increasing the resistance of the
      respiratory system, the change of the neural drive( EMGdi) was obtained from the a multi-pair
      esophageal electrode catheter All the signal recorded in the computer. The relation the
      nreural drive assessed by EMGdi and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEPi) would
      be analysed.
