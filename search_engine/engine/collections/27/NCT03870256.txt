      labor has emerged as a most actual tool in its prevention. The previous study in Egypt
      recorded that 88% of deaths from PPH occur within 4 h of delivery. Tranexamic acid (TA) is an
      antifibrinolytic agent that blocks the lysine-binding site of plasminogen to fibrin.
      Accordingly, clot breaks down, fibrinolysis is inhibited, and excessive bleeding is reduced.
      In previous studies, its safety has been confirmed for use in non-pregnant women, with no
      thromboembolic complications. TA is an inexpensive, widely available medicine that has been
      shown to reduce bleeding in surgery and reduce the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients.
