      acceptability of the OA-PCP will be assessed among n=60 patients with hip and knee OA in two
      primary care clinics. All patients in the trial will participate in the OA-PCP and will
      complete assessments at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Feasibility metrics will include
      rates of recruitment, intervention engagement and retention; acceptability will be assessed
      from both patients and health care providers.
