      head-neck area, with immediate microscopic examination in a frozen slice of the full margin.
      Patients undergoing MOHS surgery are struggled with emotional stress during the day of
      surgery, due to fear of significant damage to the body's appearance and image and anxiety
      about the need for repeated surgeries performed on the same day to remove the tumor. In this
      study we will examine the effect of integrative medicine (including acupuncture,
      touch/manual, and breathing/relaxation modalities) on the reduction of anxiety and pain in
      patients undergoing MOHS surgery. The study was designed on the basis of interdisciplinary
      collaboration of researchers from plastic, integrative and gynecological medicine.
