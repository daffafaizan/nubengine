      Primary Objective:

      To determine the relatedness of cardio toxicity as a side effect in subjects with DM II who
      are treated with RAS 130 who either met, or failed to meet the criteria for diet and
      exercise.

      Hypothesis I: There will be no evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are
      determined to have maintained proper diet and exercise "healthy lifestyle" throughout the
      study.

      Hypothesis II: There may be evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are
      determined to neglect proper diet and exercise "unhealthy lifestyle" throughout the study.

      Secondary Objective:

      To determine the effectiveness of RAS 130 on the reduction of blood glucose levels in
      subjects with DM II.

      Hypothesis III: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose levels as a single agent.

      Hypothesis IV: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose in combination with other
      anti- diabetic agents.
