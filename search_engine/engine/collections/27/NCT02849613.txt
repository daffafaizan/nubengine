    
      RESSTORE European multicentre randomised phase IIb will explore the efficacy (functional
      recovery) and safety of intravenous infusion of allogenic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal
      stem cells (ADSC) in 400 stroke patients. Therapeutic effects of ADSCs will be assessed and
      monitored in patients using clinical rating scales, multimodal MRI and blood biomarkers.

      The European regenerative therapy capacities (France, Spain, Finland, United Kingdom and
      Czech Republic), developed in RESSTORE will cover the full value chain in the field (large
      scale GMP cell production, clinical testing, biomarkers discovery, understanding of the
      restoring mechanisms, biobanking...).
