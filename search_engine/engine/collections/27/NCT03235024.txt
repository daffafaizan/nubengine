      trial, comparing the effect of twice daily B244 application for 28 days vs vehicle
      application on treatment of mild to moderate AD

      At Screening and Baseline, all subjects must have atopic dermatitis, as defined by the
      Hanifin and Rajka criteria, which involves a minimum of 10% and a maximum of 30% body surface
      area, EASI score of 10 to 21 and pruritus visual analogue scale scores of â‰¥ 5 points on the
      VAS scale (at least moderate).

      The total duration of the study will be approximately 9 weeks. Participants will report for a
      Screening visit and if all inclusion criteria are met, subjects will go through a two week
      washout phase before reporting for a Baseline visit.

      Subjects will come in for visits at Day 14 (Week 2), Day 28 (Week 4). A final visit will be
      conducted at Day 42 (Week 6).

      Efficacy will be assessed using Atopic Dermatitis Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS).

      Blood and urine samples will be collected for standard safety laboratory tests and effect of
      the drug on inflammatory biomarkers. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

      Investigators plan to enroll approximately 130 total patients.

      Randomization will be 1:1 so that equal number of patients will be treated in each Arm of the
      study.
