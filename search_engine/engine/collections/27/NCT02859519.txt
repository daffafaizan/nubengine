    
      Male or female subjects aged between 12 and 75 years with confirmed DSO involving 20-60% of
      at least one great toenail will be screened for randomization in this study. The diagnosis of
      DSO will be confirmed prior to randomization through a positive culture of dermatophytes. In
      addition, a central blinded assessment of the clinical disease involvement (i.e., affected
      nail area) will be performed at Screening. Subjects have to meet all eligibility criteria
      before being randomized in to the study.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to the investigational medicinal products (MOB015B or
      vehicle) in a ratio of 2:1. The investigational medicinal products (IMPs) will be applied to
      all affected fingernails and/or toenails for 48 weeks once daily at bedtime. However,
      fingernails will not be assessed for efficacy.

      Since both the IMPs are indistinguishable in appearance and mode of administration, the study
      will be performed as a double-blind study, i.e., both the investigator and the subject will
      remain blinded throughout the entire study.

      After a 4-week follow-up period without IMP treatment the end of study (EoS) Visit will be
      performed at Week 52 (Visit 7). The primary efficacy variable will be assessed at Week 52.
      The end of the clinical study for each individual subject is defined as the EoS Visit at Week
      52 (Visit 7). The end of the clinical study is defined as the last visit of the last subject
      in the study.
