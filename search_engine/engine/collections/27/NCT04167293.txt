    
      A total of 116 HCC patients with portal vein invasion after arterially directed therapy
      (transarterial chemoembolization or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy) will be
      randomized to two treatment arms using a 1:1 ratio: SBRT + PD-1 arm or SBRT alone arm.
      Patients in both arms will receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using volumetric arc
      therapy. The prescribed dose is 30-54 Gy in 3-6 fractions over 1-2 weeks. In the SBRT + PD-1
      arm, sintilimab is administered intravenously at 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 1 year. The
      first course of sintilimab will be given within 4-6 weeks after completion of SBRT.
