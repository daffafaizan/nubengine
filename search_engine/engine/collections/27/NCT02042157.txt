      allows a person to wash their genitalia after elimination) in improving toilet related
      quality of life for functionally impaired individuals as measured by ADLs and caregivers of
      functionally impaired adults. We also want to see if bidet use is effective in lowering the
      incidence of urinary tract infections in this high risk population.

      Functional impairment around toileting has been shown to negatively impact quality of life
      (QOL) for both patients and their caregivers. We hope to learn if the use of bidet will
      improve QOL in this population.

      Urinary tract infections increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in women with impaired
      functional status. Specifically the risk of hospitalization, sepsis, kidney failure and other
      complications. There are not currently effective forms of non-pharmaceutical prevention.
      Bidets are safe, inexpensive and hygienic. Individuals with functional impairment often have
      difficulty maintaining their hygiene due to frailty and functional limitations. It is our
      hope that addressing these issues will lead to a reduced incidence of UTI.

      Constipation is a common problem in elderly adults and in adults with impaired functional
      status. It is our hope that the bidet will reduce the frequency and severity of constipation
      (as measured by self report).
