      obesity (BMI ≥ 30) and high 10-year ASCVD risk (≥20%), 200 participants with obesity (BMI ≥
      30) and low 10-year ASCVD risk (<7.5%), 100 participants with normal weight (BMI 18-25) and
      high 10-year ASCVD risk (≥20%), and 100 participants with normal weight (BMI 18-25) and low
      10-year ASCVD risk (<7.5%). Clinical, behavioral, and molecular characteristics will be
      compared at baseline between the 4 groups to understand heterogeneity between obesity and
      risk for CVD, and participants with obesity will undergo a 6-month weight loss intervention.
      In individuals with obesity, clinical, behavioral, and molecular characteristics will be
      compared between baseline and 6 months to understand (a) predictors of response to the
      intervention and (b) how these factors change with weight loss. Differences in branched-chain
      amino acids will be compared between all groups, both at baseline and at 6 months (for those
      participants undergoing the digital-weight loss intervention). Other clinical, behavioral,
      metabolomic, genetic, and microbiome parameters will also be compared in an exploratory
      fashion. There may be possible risk of loss of confidentiality, but this risk is low and
      measures will be taken to minimize this risk.
