    
      This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, cohort expansion, and efficacy follow-up
      study of enoblituzumab administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule for up to 51
      doses in combination with IV pembrolizumab administered on an every-3-week schedule for up to
      17 doses.

      The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of enoblituzumab and pembrolizumab and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum
      administered dose (MTD/MAD). Patients with methothelioma, urethelial cancer, NSCLC, SCCHN,
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer, triple
      negative breast cancer (TBNC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or
      prostate cancer will be enrolled in this study phase. An additional dose escalation cohort of
      up to 15 patients is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination
      of enoblituzumab and MGA012 in patients with melanoma, SCCHN, NSCLC, urothelial cancer, and
      other cancers, and any dose level not exceeding the MTD may be expanded to further evaluate
      safety and efficacy of this combination.

      During the Cohort Expansion Phase, additional cohorts of patients with B7-H3 expressing
      unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic melanoma (up to n=16), 2 cohorts of NSCLC (n= up
      to 20 in each cohort), 2 cohorts of SCCHN (up to n=20 in each cohort) or urothelial cancer
      (up to n=16) will be enrolled to receive MGA271 in combination with pembrolizumab at the MTD
      (or MAD) established from the Dose Escalation Phase of the study.

      The efficacy follow-up period consists of the 2-year period after the final dose of study
      drug.

      All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).
