      reported in as many as 0.1～0.2% in western countries. But so far，medical literature about
      awareness during general anesthesia is still rare in China, and some small sampled studies in
      China showed a significantly higher incidence (1.5～6%) of intra-operative awareness. We
      believed that this multicenter, large sampled, prospective study would be very necessary for
      us to determine the incidence of intra-operative awareness in China, and analysis of the
      relevant factors would help us to understand why was the incidence of awareness in China much
      higher than that in western countries.

      Methods: This is a prospective, nonrandomized descriptive cohort study that was conducted at
      25 academic medical centers in China. 11,197 patients (age>12, intubation or LMA during
      anesthesia) form 25 medical centers were enrolled to be interviewed by research stuff for
      evaluation of awareness at the 1st and 4th day after their general anesthesia. The structured
      interview questions were:⑴What is the last thing you remembered before you went to sleep?
      ⑵What is the first thing you remembered when you woke up? ⑶Can you remember anything between
      these two periods? ⑷Did you dream during your operation? ⑸What was the worst thing about your
      operation? An evaluation committee independent from the research stuff was constituted to
      verify the data from the medical centers. And then the incidence of intra-operative awareness
      in China was determined. General condition and details of the anesthesia procedure of the
      patients were also recorded during the anesthesia for a binary logistic regression analysis.
