      enrollment goal of 75 subjects at this institution in three cohorts as follows:

        1. Cohort #1 will consist of fifteen healthy control subjects, ten of whom will be
           Caucasian and five of whom will be African-American. Subjects in cohort #1 will be used
           to address the calibration goal of Specific Aim #1.

        2. Cohort #2 will consist of 30 subjects who have advanced-stage melanoma will be recruited
           from the Medical Oncology clinic at UAMS, where advanced stages are defined as Stages
           III or IV. Subjects in cohort #2 will be used to address the validation goal of Specific
           Aim #2. Approximately half of the 30 advanced-stage subjects will be Stage III and the
           other half will be Stage IV.

        3. Cohort #3 will consist of 30 subjects with early-stage melanoma will be recruited from
           the Surgical Oncology clinic at UAMS, where early stages are defined as Stages I or II.

      Subjects in cohort #3 will be used to address the detection goal of Specific Aim #3.
      Approximately 10 of the 30 early-stage subjects will be Stage I and approximately 20 will be
      Stage II.
