      the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder. Participants are randomly assigned to the
      two active intervention conditions; no placebo or sham treatments will be employed.
      Assessments take place at baseline, pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-
      and 12-months follow-up; participants also complete a brief weekly assessment of functioning.
      Treatment is administered individually by trained graduate students in clinical psychology,
      directly trained and supervised by the PI and Co-PI. Participants receive 12 weekly 1-hour
      long sessions. The study design is a 2 (treatment condition) by 5 (assessment occasion) mixed
      factorial design.
