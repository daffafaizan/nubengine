      hemophilia A form a clot and also evaluate if they develop tiny bleeds within the joint and
      subsequently early joint changes when receiving extended half-life factor VIII based
      replacement therapy vs non-FVIII based replacement as part of their hemophilia treatment to
      prevent spontaneous joint bleeds.

      Both therapies are standard of care therapies for patients with hemophilia A. The only
      experimental/research procedures as part of this study include the thrombin generation assay
      and ultrasound. All other procedures are standard of care.
