      I. Evaluate the sensitivity & specificity, predictive positive value (PPV), & predictive
      negative value (PNV) (test characteristics) & cellularity, beta-globin, deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), & protein (quality measures) from nylon-flocked (NF)- &
      Dacron-swab protocols to detect biopsy-detected high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia
      (HG-AIN) & human papillomavirus (HPV)-infections, using randomized-controlled study design.

      II. Evaluate the test characteristics for anal cancer screening algorithms that incorporate
      sequentially or simultaneously performed high-threshold molecular HPV tests, with & without
      cytology, to predict HG-AIN.

      III. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness & relative cost of single- & multiple-test anal cancer
      screening algorithms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo anal cytology collection using 2 NF swabs and 1 Dacron swab for analysis via
      Papanicolaou (Pap) staining, HPV genotyping, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
