      subjects presenting with diabetic foot ulcers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      superiority of Timoptic-XE therapy in conjunction with standard of care (SOC) treatment
      (Group A: Timoptic-XE + SOC) versus SOC (Group B: SOC + plus a non-biologically active gel,
      i.e., hydrogel, as placebo medication) in the clinical effectiveness in promoting wound
      healing and closure.
