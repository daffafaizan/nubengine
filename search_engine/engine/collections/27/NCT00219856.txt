      data are available concerning the potential benefit of a total anaesthesia with propofol in
      partial hepatic surgery. Patients who undergo partial hepatic resection have frequent liver
      insufficiency that could be related in part to the oxidative stress induced by clamping the
      hepatic hilum during the surgical intervention. Our hypothesis is that propofol, by
      increasing liver resistance to ischemic-reperfusion injury, could improve the remaining liver
      function recovery, and therefore could reduce post surgical morbidity.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the anti oxidant effects of propofol compared to another
      widely used anaesthetic agent, inhaled desflurane, during and after partial hepatic resection
      with hepatic hilum clamping.

      The primary endpoint will be the level of malondialdehyde (a plasmatic marker of oxidative
      stress), 30 minutes after the end of hepatic clamping.

      The evolution over time of other markers of oxidative stress will be studied (glutathione,
      myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide), as well as functional and biological markers of liver
      regeneration.
