      females who are not pregnant will be recruited for the study. A maximum of 28 volunteers may
      be enrolled with a reasonable sampling of ethnicities from the Nashville area, and an effort
      will be made to recruit equal numbers of males and females. Additionally, an effort will be
      made to study as old a population as possible and to recruit relatively similar age groups
      for males and females. All volunteers will be admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research
      Center (CRC) as inpatients.

      A complete health history and physical examination will be conducted by a physician.
      Volunteers will be asked to collect and bring their first morning voided urine for baseline
      urinalysis. An EKG, baseline blood analysis, vital signs, and questions about feelings and
      adverse events will be asked prior to supplement administration. All tests will be repeated
      at various intervals throughout the 24-hour study period. A physician will oversee all
      clinical aspects of the study and will be responsible for all trial-related medical
      decisions. Pharmacokinetics will be studied through the blood analyses at intervals
      throughout the study and 24-hour urine collection after administration of the supplement.
