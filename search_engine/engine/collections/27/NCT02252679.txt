      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) or TIMS (thermal ionization mass spectrometry)
      measurement of endogenous stable calcium isotopes in plasma and urine samples in patients
      seen during routine clinical care at the outpatient clinics (incl. Center for Metabolic Bone
      Diseases) of the University Hospitals Leuven.
