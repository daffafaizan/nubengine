      action, 2) predict the development of diabetes in those without diabetes, and 3) are more
      common in people with diabetes. Minority populations (African-Americans and Latinos) are more
      likely to have both low levels of vitamin D and diabetes. This study will identify minority
      individuals who are at increased risk for diabetes (those with central obesity, family
      history of diabetes in first degree relatives and either with hypertension or being treated
      for hypertension), and determine if they have both pre-diabetes, ie, impaired fasting glucose
      and/or impaired glucose tolerance, and low levels of vitamin D. Those that have both will be
      randomized to either high doses of vitamin D or placebo and insulin secretion and action as
      well as changes in the oral glucose tolerance test (reversion to normal, maintenance of
      pre-diabetes or development of diabetes) will be monitored at 3 month intervals for one year.
      This study will test the hypothesis that the increased amount of diabetes in minority
      populations may be due in part to low levels of vitamin D and whether supplementing this
      vitamin may delay the development of diabetes.
