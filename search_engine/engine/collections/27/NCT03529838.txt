      exercise, in turn, is a strategy to reduce cardiovascular stress, by decreasing the blood
      pressure (BP) at rest and several risk factors associated with sedentary lifestyle, thus
      improving the quality and life expectancy of these women. However, different classes of
      antihypertensives may have different responses when associated with exercise. Thus, this
      study aims to compare the responses of the association of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise and
      weightlifting with different classes of medications in 45 postmenopausal hypertensive women.
      The volunteers will do cardiovascular and biochemistry evaluations before and after the
      intervention.
