    
      In this observational trial the investigators want to examine whether clinical or
      echocardiographic parameters of patent ductus arteriosus are related to

        -  cerebral tissue oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin, fractional tissue oxygen extraction
           and HbD

        -  renal tissue oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin, fractional tissue oxygen extraction
           and HbD

      as measured by near infrared spectroscopy

      and to

        -  stroke volume

        -  cardiac output

      as measured by electrical cardiometry.

      The investigators want to examine the impact of surgical and medical treatment for patent
      ductus on these parameters. The investigators want to compare the change of these parameters
      between responders to medical treatment and nonresponders.
