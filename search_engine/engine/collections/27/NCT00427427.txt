      positive breast cancer by FISH diagnosed in 2004 or thereafter. Potential patients will sign
      a written ICF prior to completing a questionnaire designed to determine what factors may
      affect a patient's acceptance of HerceptinÂ® treatment. After answering the questionnaire,
      patients will be given the following options:

        1. to receive one year of trastuzumab treatment and annual follow-up for 5 years

        2. to decline trastuzumab treatment but serve as a comparison group member for monitoring
           safety and effectiveness of trastuzumab and to have annual follow-up for 5 years
