    
      NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common liver disorders that are strongly
      associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. The underlying pathophysiology of
      fatty infiltration of the liver is thought to be related to insulin resistance, which is an
      almost universal finding in patients with NAFLD. It is also possible that fat infiltration
      and inflammation in the liver may impair insulin sensitivity, either locally in the liver, or
      peripherally via the actions of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that insulin
      resistance is a major causal factor leading to fat deposition in the liver and NAFLD, and
      thus interventions aimed at improving insulin sensitivity will result in a reduction of
      hepatic inflammation and steatosis.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine in a cross-sectional study whether NAFLD is associated with
      altered peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity and to study their relationships with
      hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, inflammatory cytokines, glucose metabolism, beta-cell
      function and body fat distribution. Specific Aim 2: To determine in a 6 month
      placebo-controlled double-blinded treatment study if treatment with pioglitazone, an insulin
      sensitizer, or fenofibrate, a triglyceride lowering agent, will improve both hepatic as well
      as peripheral insulin sensitivity and thereby improve hepatic steatosis and inflammation in
      subjects with NAFLD.

      The results of the proposed study will have important implications for our understanding of
      the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and abnormalities in lipid and glucose
      metabolism in subjects with NAFLD and for the design of future studies aimed at the
      prevention and treatment of this condition.
