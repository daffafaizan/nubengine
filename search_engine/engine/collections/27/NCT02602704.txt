           loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS), and any fractures in
           postmenopausal rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving long-term GCs.

        -  This was a randomized, controlled, open-label study conducted for 56 weeks. Four trial
           visits occurred over the course of the 56 weeks. At study entry, all patients who took
           elemental calcium (1200 mg daily) and vitamin D (800 IU daily) were assigned by blocks
           of two to receive either bazedoxifene (20 mg/day) (bazedoxifene group) or not (control
           group).

        -  Randomization was performed by an independent coordinator. Participants were followed-up
           at 24 weeks and 48 weeks with special attention to RA flares and occurrence of AEs.

        -  Demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and medications related to RA, as well as
           laboratory result such as complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, and levels of
           inflammatory markers were collected at enrollment. BMD and trabecular bone score (TBS)
           were assessed at 0 and 48 weeks, and levels of bone turnover markers were assessed at 0,
           24, and 48 weeks. At 56 weeks, the occurrence of AEs was assessed.
