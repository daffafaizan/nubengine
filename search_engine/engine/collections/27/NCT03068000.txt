      games. According to the sample calculation based on the study of Bala and Drid (2010) title
      "Anthropometric and Motor Features of Young Judoists in Vojvodina", who analyzed motor skills
      in young judokas and untrained control, using the variable slalom with 3 balls (functional
      coordination and the age group from 11 to 13 years. In which the difference between the means
      was of 36.86 and the standard deviation of 53.78, with the power of the 80% test and
      significance of 5% in boys. In girls the sample calculation was the same number (33 for
      group) using the same variable slalom with 3 balls (functional coordination and the some age
      group from 11 to 13 years, the difference between the means was 10.45 and the standard
      deviation of 15.05, with the power of the 80% test and significance of 5%

      The present study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of FCT/UNESP (CAAE:
