      continuously rotates around the patient, and this technique can deliver low dose radiation to
      lungs that is associated with an occurrence of radiation pneumonitis. To avoid this
      inefficiency of beam usage, a TomoDirect option using static gantry positions combined with
      simultaneous couch translation and dynamic collimator modulation has been developed. In a
      pilot study, TomoDirect seemed particularly well suited for postoperative irradiation in
      breast cancer patients. TomoDirect achieved an optimal target volume coverage and coincident
      adequate normal tissue sparing in a dosimetric study. Clinical studies of TomoDirect in
      breast cancer patients are scarce and have been assessed only in small and retrospective
      series. Thus, we undertook a prospective study on the technical feasibility and toxicity of
      TomoDirect in breast cancer patients who received postoperative radiotherapy.
