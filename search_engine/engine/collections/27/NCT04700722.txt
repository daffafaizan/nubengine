      qualitative and quantitative measurements of cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein in patients
      with Parkinson's disease, Multiple System Atrophy, Dementia with Lewy bodies and Pure
      Autonomic Failure. An effective tissue biomarker will provide an accurate diagnosis of
      α-synuclein in clinical practice, will differentiate between synucleinopathies, enable
      assessment of target engagement in the development of disease modifying and neuroprotective
      therapies and accelerate the development of neuroprotective and disease modifying therapies.
