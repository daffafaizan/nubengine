    
      An open-label phase IV clinical trial of miltefosine, designed to evaluate intracellular and
      plasma drug pharmacokinetics in children and adults using a population pharmacokinetics
      design. Two study groups have been defined: 1) children 2-12 years of age (n=30) and 2)
      adults 18-60 years of age (n=30) with confirmed parasitological diagnosis of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis. The participants will receive supervised standard treatment with miltefosine:
      1.8 - 2.5 mg/Kg of weight for 28 days.

      Miltefosine concentration will be determined in plasma and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell
      (PBMCs), from 3 or 10ml peripheral blood samples in children and adults respectively.
      Sampling will be conducted pre-dosing at days 0,1,15 and 29 during treatment, and at months
      1, 2, 3 and 6 post-treatment.

      A population pharmacokinetics analysis will be performed using a non-linear model of mixed
      effects with the software Nonlinear Mixed-effects Model (NONMEM), R and Piranha. Parasite
      burden will be determined by 7SLRNA Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) of
      Leishmania from swab samples of lesions and extralesional tissues before and at the end of
      treatment. The relationship between pharmacokinetics and parasite persistence/burden will be
      determined by correlation analysis and pharmacodynamic modeling.
