      Some medical providers inject a numbing medication underneath the skin prior to the IV
      placement. This requires an additional needle stick. Some medical providers place a device
      called Buzzy速 on a patient's arm prior to the IV placement. The Buzzy速 device is the
      combination of an ice pack and a vibrator in the shape of a bumble bee. Literature shows that
      the Buzzy速 device makes IV placement more comfortable for children, but there is minimal data
      in regard to whether it is helpful for adult patients.

      The investigators are conducting this study to compare the effectiveness of the Buzzy速 device
      with that of the injection of numbing medication underneath the skin for IV placement in
      adults. This device has been FDA approved for use.
