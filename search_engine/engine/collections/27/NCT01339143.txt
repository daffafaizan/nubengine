      of diabetic complication. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), such as vildagliptin, enhances
      glucose-induced insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion, and reduces postprandial
      hyperglycemia and may also improve acute fluctuations of glucose. We believe that
      vildagliptin may exert an effect of decreasing oxidative stress by reducing glucose
      excursion.
