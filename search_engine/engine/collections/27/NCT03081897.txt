      regional anesthesia, can have a benefit for patients undergoing tumor surgery.The
      perioperative regional anesthesia might reduce the immunological response and therefore lower
      the risk of tumor relapse. Factors that might play a role in tumor relapse are various, so
      more prospective and randomised trials are necessary to investigate the underlying
      mechanisms.

      In a retrospective analysis by Merquiol et al. it was shown that an cervical epidural
      anesthesia was associated with an extended tumorfree timeline of larynx and hypopharynx
      carcinoma.

      Supporting results could be seen in a study by Munoz et al. performing regional anaesthesia
      in breast cancer patients.

      Taking all these facts into consideration the investigators believe that performing regional
      aneasthesia could reduce the relapse of larynx carcinoma. The relapse of carcinoma is
      believed to be linked to substance P and the neurokinin 1 (NK-1) receptor .

      It is accepted that an additional regional anesthesia could reduce the impact of substance P
      to gain a normal immune response in the perioperative setting and to reduce the rate of tumor
      relapse.
