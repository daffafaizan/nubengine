      obese people, that leads to high carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen levels in the blood.
      OHS is associated with respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, hospital admissions, and
      death. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for OHS besides massive weight loss which often
      requires bariatric surgery.

      In this study, the investigators are examining whether switching from a regular diet to a
      ketogenic diet will improve breathing, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels in OHS patients.
      After a few days-weeks on KD, hormone changes are known to occur and the investigators are
      examining whether these hormonal changes could stimulate breathing.

      This is a pilot study to examine the effects of a 12 day KD on OHS. The outcomes of the study
      include blood oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, plasma levels of hormones such as insulin,
      leptin, sleep studies, body composition a, weight, and metabolic rate.
