    
      Injection drug use (IDU) is a major public health problem that is associated with a host of
      medical complications, including blood-borne viral disease (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C) and
      bacterial infections (e.g., skin abscesses, endocarditis), that often result from high-risk
      drug injection practices. There are no current interventions designed to reduce bacterial
      infections among IDUs, despite high rates of infection.

      The objective of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of a skin and needle hygiene
      intervention for IDUs to reduce practices associated with bacterial and viral infections. In
      the first phase of the study, focus group interviews were conducted to determine key areas of
      emphasis for an intervention with this population. An initial intervention was developed,
      pilot tested, and refined. The final 2-session intervention combines psychoeducation,
      skill-building, and motivational interviewing.

      Following refinement of the intervention, a small randomized controlled trial (n = 60; 30 in
      each group) to examine the efficacy of the intervention compared to an assessment-only
      condition will be conducted. The goals of this two-year study are to: 1) reduce high-risk
      injection practices among active IDUs that lead to bacterial and viral infections, 2) improve
      skin and needle cleaning behavioral skills, and 3) increase skin cleaning prior to injection
      and reduce subcutaneous/intramuscular injection.

      In addition to examining these goals over a six-month period, the acceptability and
      feasibility of the intervention will be examined.
