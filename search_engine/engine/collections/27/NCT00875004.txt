      Primary

        -  Identify factors predictive of treatment failure in patients with solid tumors treated
           with epoetin beta while undergoing chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the impact of achieving target hemoglobin levels (i.e., hemoglobin > 11 g/dL)
           after 8 weeks of treatment with epoetin beta.

        -  Evaluate changes in hemoglobin levels from baseline to after 8 weeks of treatment with
           epoetin beta.

        -  Evaluate the tolerability of epoetin beta in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive epoetin beta subcutaneously once a week for â‰¥ 8 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete a quality-of-life questionnaire (FACT-An) at baseline and after 8 weeks of
      treatment.
