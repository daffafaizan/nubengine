      of endometrial cells; and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of subgroups of
      endometrial cancers, their biologic behaviour and responses to therapeutic agents.
      Furthermore, mutational inactivation of the PTEN gene can serve as an independent molecular
      marker that can predict relapse and survival in endometrial cancer. The prognostic effects of
      PTEN may also be modulated by other tumour suppressor gene losses including P53 mutations, by
      hormone receptor status, and microsatellite instability.
