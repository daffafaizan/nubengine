      healthy lifestyle among the medical staff in a maternity ward in order to develop a
      specifically-tailored intervention to help improve the health behaviors of hospital shift
      workers. Shift-work has been associated with unhealthy lifestyles and increased risk of
      digestive disorders, heart conditions, various kinds of cancer, reproductive dysfunction, and
      mental conditions. Thus, the findings will be used to establish a community-based
      participatory health-promoting program in the ward, engaging the staff in its development and
      implementation. Community Based Participatory (CBP) approach will be used to build an
      evaluation and intervention. Baseline/needs assessment will be performed by mixed methods
      approach, combining in depth interviews with key personnel, focus groups and questionnaires
      that ask about demographics, physical activity and nutrition behaviors, stress, burnout, BMI,
      and cardiac risk factors.
