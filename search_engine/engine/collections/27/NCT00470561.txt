      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) vs placebo on mammographic density
           in healthy postmenopausal women with a moderate or high level of breast density.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether there is a differential response in mammogram density to aspirin
           treatments in individual homozygous wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous variant for
           several UGT gene polymorphisms.

        -  Determine the effect of aspirin therapy on potential adverse events, including
           gastrointestinal symptoms and signs, bleeding events, blood pressure, and other major
           comorbidities and hospitalizations, as well as generalized symptoms, in these
           participants.

        -  Determine the effects of aspirin therapy on putative biomarkers of breast and ovarian
           cancer that are currently being validated as part of ongoing Fred Hutchinson Cancer
           Research Center Ovarian SPORE activities.

        -  Determine the effects of aspirin therapy on levels of serum estradiol, estrone and sex
           hormone binding globulin (SHBG) as measured by radioimmunoassay at baseline and 6 month
           timepoints

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Participants are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral placebo daily for 6 months. In both arms, participants
           undergo a repeat mammogram at 6 months.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and at 6 months. Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms in the UGT genes and variable number of tandem repeat-type polymorphisms are
      genotyped.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 144 participants will be accrued for this study.
