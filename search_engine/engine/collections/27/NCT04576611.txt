        1. To assess the influence of a 4-week (8 sessions) intervention based on education (about
           pain neurophysiology and healthy lifestyle habits) and physical exercise (strength,
           flexibility, joint mobility, and self-massage) on pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and
           cognitive functioning (selective attention), as primary variable outcomes, and on
           physical condition (balance and range of movement), affective and cognitive symptoms
           (mood, anxiety, catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs and kinesiophobia), pain
           interference and self-reported clinical pain, as secondary variable outcomes, in
           patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health application developed by researchers
           (BackFit App) to carry out the intervention, in comparison with a supervised
           intervention by a health professional.

      The hypotheses of the study are:

        1. This intervention based on education and physical exercise will increase PPT and improve
           selective attention.

        2. This intervention will also improve physical condition, self-reported clinical pain,
           affective and cognitive symptoms and pain interference presented by patients with
           chronic low back pain.

        3. The intervention performed with BackFit App will be as effective as that supervised by a
           health professional.
