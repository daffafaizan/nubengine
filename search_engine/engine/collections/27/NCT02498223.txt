      aerobic capacity will be measured for each participant: Physiological evaluation: the
      participants will perform physical stress on a treadmill with changing slope and speed, once
      carrying 40% of their body weight (as the current instructions) and a second time with weight
      that is calculated by the examined body composition and aerobic capacity based index (LCI).
      The physiological response will be assessed based on heart rate, lactic acid in the blood and
      oxygen consumption.

      Biomechanical evaluation: the biomechanical response will be measured in the biomechanical
      lab: pressure on the shoulder and waist from the load and straps, walk analysis and stress
      scatter in the foot.

      By this experiment the investigators want to examine if the new index, the LCI, is
      physiologically and biomechanically better than the current load distribution instructions.
