      individuals or 4% of the US population. High resolution esophageal manometry is currently
      considered the gold standard test for evaluation and diagnosis of esophageal motility
      disorders, but given that it requires trans-nasal placement in a conscious patient, this test
      is highly uncomfortable and associated with significant patient dissatisfaction. There are
      currently no noninvasive tests or markers available to test esophageal function and motility.

      In the upper gastrointestinal system, as in the heart, disruption of the electrical syncytium
      in disease produces measurable dysrhythmia. Recent modifications of the standard
      electrogastrogram (EGG) that have increased the number of leads to 25 (termed high-resolution
      EGG) have allowed enhanced spatio-temporal resolution of electric slow wave activity, and
      newer analytic techniques. Additionally, the magnetogastrogram (MGG) overcomes many of the
      inherent limitations of the standard EGG. The goal of this proposal is to harness similar
      technologies applied to the esophagus to develop high-resolution electroesophagogram (EESG)
      and magnetoesophagogram (MESG) as noninvasive clinical methods to quantify esophageal
      function and motility disorders, which could guide intervention for a large number of adult
      patients.

      The main aims in this proposal are to develop a mathematical model of esophageal function and
      characterize phenotypes of esophageal motility disorders using EESG/MESG in healthy controls
      and esophageal dysmotility patients and determine how EESG/MESG rhythm and pattern
      abnormalities relate to physiologic function.
