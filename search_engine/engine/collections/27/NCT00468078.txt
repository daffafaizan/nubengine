      terminals in the striatum. Essential tremor is one of the conditions most commonly
      misdiagnosed as parkinsonism, and early clinical differentiation between these conditions can
      be difficult. F-18 FPCIT is a promising radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging to assess the
      dopamine transporter in the striatum.
