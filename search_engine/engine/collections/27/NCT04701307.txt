      I. To determine objective response rate (ORR) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS) in
      response to combined niraparib plus dostarlimab in patients with recurrent small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC) and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity of combined niraparib plus dostarlimab (PARP inhibition plus
      anti-PD-1) in patients with recurrent SCLC and other high-grade NECs.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS), PFS, disease control rate (response plus stable
      disease > 12 weeks) to combined niraparib plus dostarlimab in patients with recurrent SCLC
      and other high-grade NECs.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine treatment-related changes in immune profiles or other biomarker in response
      to combined niraparib plus dostarlimab in patients with recurrent SCLC and other high-grade
      NECs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-4, and on
      days 1-42 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive dostarlimab intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for cycles 1-4 and every 42 days for subsequent
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days, every 6 months
      for 2 years, then annually for 3 years.
