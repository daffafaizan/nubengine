      of herpes zoster (shingles).

      Treatment for PHN is often suboptimal. More than 50% of the subjects fail to respond to
      pharmacological treatments or experience intolerable side effects.

      The clinical development of ESL to treat neuropathic pain is based on its chemical and
      pharmacodynamic relationship to sodium channel blockers, including carbamazepine, which is
      effective for treating some neuropathic pain conditions. Preclinical data supports the
      theoretical background.

      This study will examine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      Eslicarbazepine acetate for the treatment of post herpetic neuralgia.
