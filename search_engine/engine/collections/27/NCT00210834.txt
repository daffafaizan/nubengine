    
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center study to compare end of study hemoglobin level
      between Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) at 40,000 units administered subcutaneously once every week
      (qw) and at 80,000 units subcutaneously every two weeks (q2w) in approximately 280 anemic
      patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The study hypothesis is that a dosing regimen of
      PROCRIT 80,000 Units q2w subcutaneously (sc) is non-inferior to a dosing regimen of PROCRIT
      40,000 Units qw sc with respect to the change in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to Study Week
      13 for patients with chemotherapy associated anemia and this respective dosing regimen is
      generally well-tolerated. The patients will receive subcutaneous (under the skin) injections
      of Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) at one of the following dosing regimens: 1- Starting dose of 40,000
      units sc qw (once every week) OR 2- Starting dose of 80,000 units sc q2w (every two weeks)
