      experimental arms. This study was performed to evaluate the effect on saciety and
      dyslipidemia of subjects with overweight/obesity after a long consumption (3 months) of a
      modified honey with soluble fiber and polyphenols. Additionally, a short-term randomized,
      cross-over, doble-blind and controlled trial was also performed to evaluate immediate saciety
      effect on the same subjects.

      For the middle-term study, investigators included 67 participants (8 men and 59 women)
      between 18 and 65 years (BMI ≥25 and <40 kg / m2). All volunteers were randomized into 2
      study groups, and participants received the 2 different study products during the 3 months.
      On the other hand, the associated short-term trial included 10 participants (5 men and 5
      women) between 18 and 65 years (BMI ≥25 and <40 kg / m2). All volunteers were randomized into
      2 study groups, and participants took the 2 different study products in two non-consecutive
      days.
