      polyps, and 150 patients with no colon premalignant or malignant pathology. These samples
      will be used to refine a handheld biosensor. This handheld biosensor is intended to be a
      cost-effective POC diagnostic test highly sensitive for CRC in Nigerian patients.

      In Phase 2, the biosensor device will be piloted in Nigeria with 75 patients that are
      high-risk for CRC.. After the pilot, POC test in real-time analysis on urine from 645
      patients who are in one of three groups: 1.> 40 years of age with rectal bleeding; 2.a family
      history of CRC; 3. have a diagnosis of CRC. All patients will receive a colonoscopy. Beliefs
      and barriers related to urine testing for CRC will be investigated. Study will be completed
      within 5 years.
