      therapy promoting patient autonomy, and is associated with lower societal costs compared to
      hemodialysis. However, in light of the growing number of diabetic patients on PD, the
      unwanted glucose absorption during APD is problematic. Recent results (Ã–berg CM, Rippe B,
      2017, see references), using a theoretical model of APD, indicate that large reductions in
      glucose absorption are possible by using specialized so-called optimized bi-modal treatment
      regimes having "UF cycles" using a higher glucose concentration (e.g. 2.27% glucose) and
      "Clearance cycles" using a low glucose concentration (e.g. 0.1% glucose).
