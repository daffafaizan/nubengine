      detecting lung cancer in current or former smokers at high risk for lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study of lung cancer screening. Patients are
      randomized to one of two screening arms. Arm I: Patients undergo one spiral CT scan. Arm II:
      Patients undergo one chest x-ray. Patients and their primary care physicians are notified of
      test results within 3 weeks of the exam.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 participants (1,500 per screening arm) will be accrued
      for this study at six screening centers (500 per center) by October 31, 2000.
