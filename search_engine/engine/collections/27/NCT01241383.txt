      deposition, autoimmunity and by vascular hyper-reactivity and obliterative microvascular
      phenomena that involves multiple organs. Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) occurs in 5% of
      patients and mainly with diffuse cutaneous SSc. The routine use of angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has been reported to dramatically improve outcome, with a fall of
      the 12-month mortality from 76% to less than 15% in the United-States. Despite prognostic
      improvement, SRC remains a severe manifestation of SSc and functional outcome and survival
      remains poor. Bosentan is a specific, orally active, dual endothelin receptor antagonist that
      has recently been approved for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension and
      for the prevention of ischemic digital ulcers. Bosentan could have therapeutic benefits on
      others vascular injuries and particularly in SRC.
