    
      Phase II Clinical Study From March 2008 to December 2010 Safety and efficacy of intratumoral
      injections of E10A to cisplatin and paclitaxel was evaluated a multicenter, open-label,
      randomized clinical study in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      136 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned. Patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma not suitable for
      operation or radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive E10A plus chemotherapy every 21
      for a maximum of six cycles or to receive chemotherapy only.

      The primary end point was the objective response rate (RR), defined as the proportion of
      patients who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the target tumor
      lesion. The secondary end points were the objective disease control rate (DCR, or stable
      disease (SD) + PR + CR at the target tumor lesion), the overall RR, the overall DCR, OS, and
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      The administration of E10A benefited some subgroups of patients. In the HNSCC patients, the
      objective RR was 36.5% (15/41) with E10A administration, exhibiting a trend of exceeding the
      rate of 20.0% (7/35) in the control group (P = 0.090; OR: 0.43), whereas the objective RR was
      44.4% (12/27) versus 40.6% (13/32) in the NPC patients (P = 0.487; OR: 0.86). Patients who
      had previously received chemotherapy in the E10A group had a 44.8% (12/29) objective RR,
      whereas patients in the control group had only a 22.6% objective RR (7/31; P = 0.06, OR:
      0.36). In contrast, patients without previous chemotherapy had a similar RR in both groups
      (34.3 versus 39.4%; P = 0.426, OR: 1.25).

      The difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS favored chemotherapy plus E10A, which
      resulted in a 3.43-month improvement. With a median follow-up of 10.47 months, the median PFS
      was 3.60 months (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03 months
      (interquartile range: 3.27-13.73) in the E10A group. As The median PFS was 3.60 months
      (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03months (interquartile range:
      3.27-13.73) in the E10A group.

      The OS of the E10A group was relatively prolonged in different subgroups compared with the
      controls (e.g., 13.37 months versus 9.67 months in the HNSCC patients, 13.03 months versus
      10.50 months in those who had received prior treatment; Figure 1), but these results did not
      translate into significantly superior survival.
