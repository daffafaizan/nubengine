      vascular physicians of the Saint Etienne region, i.e. 276 general practitioners, 27 vascular
      physicians and 341,822 inhabitants. Any new case of symptomatic SVT in the legs suspected by
      the general practitioner and confirmed by compression ultrasonography by the vascular
      physician would be listed over one year. The confirmed SVTs, directly seen by the vascular
      physicians would also be listed. The incidence would be calculated by relating the total
      number of SVTs observed to the number of inhabitants of the Saint Etienne region. Information
      on whether concomitant DVT exists or not at the time of the compression ultrasonography would
      also be collected.
