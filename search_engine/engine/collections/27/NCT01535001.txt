    
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the degenerative joint disease that most often requires treatment
      and at the same time the one associated with the greatest social costs. In addition, the
      disease has many personal costs and is greatly contributing to reduced functionality and
      autonomy of older adults.

      It is recommended both nationally and internationally that the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis should include multiple treatment modalities. Clinical guidelines recommend
      that exercise, weight loss and patient education is the first step in treatment and that
      insoles and pharmacological treatment can be included as a supplement.

      However if the patient is not a candidate for total knee replacement, the patient most often
      receives only information on knee osteoarthritis, and on what they can do to treat the
      disorder and prevent it from being worse. This postponement of treatment can lead to a
      worsening of pain and function and a worse outcome after treatment. Therefore, the current
      treatment strategy for the patient group is problematic.

      The current practice may be due to the lack of studies with high level of evidence that have
      examined the optimal non-operative treatment approach and compared it with the current
      standard treatment for this group of patients.
