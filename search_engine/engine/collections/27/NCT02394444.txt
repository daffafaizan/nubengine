      and owing to the concerns it generates, preterm birth exposes the parent-child attachment
      link to disturbances, especially the mother-child attachment after discharge. Several
      psychological factors affect infant (distress, dysmaturity ) and parents (psychological
      pain). These can cause lasting parent-child interactions disruption and jeopardize the
      attachment process. These early link distortions may hinder the infant's behavioral-emotional
      and cognitive development. Prematurity psychological consequences may negatively influence
      biomedical risks. Understanding these premature infants' future development modalities and
      support involves taking into account intricate organic and psychological factors - which may
      be combined as well.

      Post-hospital psychological intervention with the family, focusing on parental mental health
      and triadic parent-infant relationship, proves an essential element in these children care,
      whose birth conditions were painful.
