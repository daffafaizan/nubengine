    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between
      ofatumumab and bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated or relapsed indolent B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Ofatumumab and bendamustine will be administered alone and in
      combination in a two-arm, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of ofatumumab and bendamustine.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of ofatumumab
      and bendamustine alone and in combination. Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy.
