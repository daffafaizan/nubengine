    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      the following combinations in participants with advanced solid tumors: Arm A: BMN 673 (PARP
      inhibitor BMN-673) and temozolomide; Arm B: BMN 673 and irinotecan (irinotecan
      hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BMN 673, temozolomide, and irinotecan when BMN 673 is
      given in combination with temozolomide (Arm A) or irinotecan (Arm B). To assess the effects
      of temozolomide and irinotecan in Arms A and B respectively on the pharmacokinetics of BMN
      673.

      II. To evaluate biomarkers that correlate with effect of BMN 673 in combination with
      temozolomide or irinotecan.

      III. To document any anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PARP inhibitor BMN-673. Patients are assigned to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive PARP inhibitor BMN-673 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and
      temozolomide PO daily on days1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive PARP inhibitor BNM-673 as in Arm A and irinotecan hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12
      months.
