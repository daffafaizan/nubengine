      clinically available and for which pharmacology and pharmacokinetics are known and
      preclinical data can be generated rapidly without the subsequent need for GMP (good
      manufacturing practice) new drug production. Small GTPases, including members of the Rab, Ras
      and Rho families, are attractive targets for the development of cancer therapeutics based on
      their pivotal roles in protein trafficking, proliferation/survival and cytoskeletal
      organization, respectively. Ketorolac tromethamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      that was identified in previous in-silico drug screens to be an inhibitor of GTPases. In a
      previous phase 0 clinical study, ketorolac was administered intravenously to ovarian cancer
      patients following optimal cytoreductive surgery. Ovarian cancer cells were obtained at the
      time of surgery, prior to ketorolac administration, and at various times after ketorolac
      dosing. Analysis of GTPase activity in these specimens showed a time-dependent inhibition of
      Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activity. The purpose of this study is to confirm that the effect is
      ketorolac driven and not a specific effect of the post-operative peritoneal compartment.
