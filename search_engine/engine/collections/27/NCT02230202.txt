      with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are each associated with the release of endothelial
      microparticles into the plasma. These injury-associated microparticles have a different
      molecular/protein composition than those released from endothelial cells in healthy patients,
      and their abundance correlates with vascular injury. To test this hypothesis the
      investigators propose a 3 arm case-controlled study including normal controls, individuals
      with stage III and IV CKD not receiving CNI therapy, and individuals with stage III and IV
      CKD post kidney transplantation receiving a CNI. The goal of this study is to measure the
      amount of microparticles in patients with kidney disease who have had a kidney transplant.
      Another goal of this study is to see if the measurements of microparticles are related to
      poor function of the vessels (endothelial dysfunction).
