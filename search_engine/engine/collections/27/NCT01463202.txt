      delivery and before hospital discharge with the belief that women who delay starting DMPA may
      be more likely to become pregnant when they are not yet ready to be pregnant and that giving
      DMPA before discharge has little to no negative effect on breastfeeding. Administering DMPA
      to breastfeeding women has not been widely questioned because the limited existing studies do
      not show any adverse impact of DMPA on breastfeeding. However, these studies used
      inappropriate control groups and did not control for prior lactation experience.

      The investigators plan to enroll 184 women who are planning to breastfeed and use DMPA after
      delivery to find out whether the timing of postpartum administration of DMPA (prior to
      hospital discharge or 4-6 weeks after delivery) affects the duration or exclusivity of
      breastfeeding among women who plan to breastfeed their infants. The investigators will also
      look at rates of use of highly effective contraception (defined as DMPA, intrauterine device,
      implant, sterilization, or lactational amenorrhea) and postpartum depression.
