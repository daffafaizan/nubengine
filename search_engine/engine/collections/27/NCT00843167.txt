        -  To determine the correlation between supplemental sulforaphane (broccoli sprout extract)
           dose and concentrations of sulforaphane and its metabolites in blood and urine samples
           from women positive for cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ and/or atypical ductal
           hyperplasia.

        -  To determine the effect of this supplement on biomarkers of prognosis in these patients.

        -  To determine the effect of this supplement on HDAC inhibition in peripheral blood cell
           and normal and cancerous breast tissue samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Sulforaphane Supplement: Patients receive oral broccoli sprout extract supplementation
           three times daily for 2-8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Placebo: Patients receive oral placebo supplementation three times daily for 2-8 weeks
           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and after completion of study treatment for
      laboratory biomarker studies. Patients scheduled to undergo surgery (mastectomy or
      lumpectomy) also undergo breast tissue sample collection at baseline and at the time of
      surgery. Samples are analyzed for sulforaphane metabolism (isothiocyanate levels), HDAC
      activity (acetylated histone expression), cell proliferation (Ki-67 index by IHC), and
      apoptosis (TUNEL assay).

      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study about their
      dietary history, family history, cruciferous vegetable intake, adverse events, and dietary
      and medication changes.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at/around 30 days.
