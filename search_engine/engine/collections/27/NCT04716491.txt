      cardiac disorders admitted to the ICU will be the use of ear protectors and eye masks. The
      purpose of the intervention is to promote sleep in this population by reducing noise and
      light in the Intensive Care Unit environment. The devices used will be the use of black silk
      masks with elastic for protection of the eyes against light and a silicone ear protector to
      reduce environmental noise. The procedure will consist of the following steps: application of
      the free and informed consent form, sleep assessment instruments, trait and state anxiety and
      collection of sociodemographic and clinical data and randomization in the arms of the study
      at the patient's admission to the ICU, guidance on the use of devices from 21 hours and until
      awakening, measurement of noise and brightness at the time of placing the devices,
      application of the visual sleep scale in the morning during the physical examination, note
      every two hours on a specific form whether the patient remains with the devices. These steps
      will be performed by the interventionist nurses who will be trained by the main researcher
      and will approach the patients in the inpatient unit or in the Intensive Care Unit after
      admission.

      The intervention will be applied only in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, and after discharge
      from the ICU, patients will be able to use it if they want the devices to sleep.
