    
      A total of 180 patients with coronary atheroslerotc lesions confirmed in coronary computed
      tomography (CCT) will be analyzed in a 12-month observation time. Patients will be randomized
      to two groups in a 1:1 fashion. 1 - optimal medical treatment, 2 - strict dietary
      intervention with implementation of the DASH diet atop of optimal medical treatment. CCT
      scans will be performed at screening and at 12 months after randomization. Computed
      tomography imaging data describing atheroslerotic lesions will be assessed.
