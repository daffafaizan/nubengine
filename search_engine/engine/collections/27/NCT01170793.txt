      appointment. This clinical trial is monocentric, open, randomised. In the first arm, the
      patients will receive educative telephone coaching at Month 2 by the nurses, over the phone.
      In the second arm, the patients will not receive any educative telephone coaching before the
      appointment with the neurologist.

      All patients will complete "Quality of life" questionnaires at Month 1 and Months 6, complete
      a migraine agenda during the length of the study and have a medical appointment around Month
      6.

      The primary outcome will be the efficacy of such educative telephone coaching, administered
      before the medical appointment in the Chronic Pain Center, in Bordeaux. It will be measured
      by the number of days with headache over the month preceding the appointment.
