    
      A questionnaire survey was designed for online completion by people with diabetes and
      caregivers of people with diabetes and parents of children and young people with diabetes in
      Denmark in order to assess their perceived diabetes related health and wellbeing and
      perceived access to and gaps in medical care, support and other financial and support
      services. The aim is for the survey to provide a cross-sectional assessment of present access
      to health, wellbeing and care for people with diabetes and caregivers in Denmark and to
      establish a survey tool suitable for ongoing long-term monitoring of well-being, care and
      support to people with diabetes and caregivers in Denmark.
