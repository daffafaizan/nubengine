    
      Within this study, a maximum of 30 patients with recurrent WHO grade III and IV malignant
      glioma will receive D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 to determine the impact of the combination of
      D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 on safety. D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 will be delivered sequentially directly
      into the tumor by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed
      within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Based on phase 1 studies of D2C7-IT alone and
      D2C7-IT in combination with atezolizumab in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM),
      the amount of D2C7-IT to be delivered will be 4613.2 ng/mL (36 mL). 2141-V11 will be dose
      escalated during the study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when used in
      combination with D2C7-IT.
