      about genetic risk/status, how it is communicated, and how it influences wellbeing and family
      relationships. This understanding is vital in order for genetic counselors and other health
      care professionals to provide the best guidance possible to families. However, little
      research has been conducted on the impact of genetic risk information or testing on children
      from the perspective of the child. The research proposed here is uniquely positioned to help
      fill this gap.

      For this study, the investigators will interview 15-20 parent/child pairs who are at risk for
      Huntington's Disease (HD), 15-20 parent/child pairs who are at risk for hereditary cancer,
      and 15-20 certified genetic counselors. Interviews will last no more than one hour and will
      be conducted at a time and place that is convenient for the participant. The investigators
      will offer participants a choice of conducting the interview in a private conference room at
      the Berman Institute of Bioethics, or remotely by Skype or telephone. Parents and children
      will be interviewed separately. Parents will be asked about the decision process behind how
      and when they disclosed genetic information to their child, style of family communication,
      advice for other parents in similar situations, and other questions related to the subject of
      communication of genetic information to minors. Children will be asked about their experience
      learning genetic risk information, style of family communication, how they felt, advice for
      other kids in similar situations, and other questions related to the subject of communication
      of genetic information to minors.
