      life, patients may make many errors using their own inhaler device, which may alter the
      positive effects observed in clinical trials.

      The main objective of this study is to describe the handling of inhaler devices
      (indacaterol-glycopyrronium Breezhaler®, tiotropium Respimat® and salmeterol-fluticasone
      Diskus®) in patients with COPD.

      All participants will receive each of the three treatments (Seretide® Diskus® 500/550 μg,
      Ultibro® Breezhaler® 110/50 μg and Spiriva® Respimat® 2,5 μg). Each treatment will be given
      daily for one week, followed by a 7-day washout period.

      On day 1 of each treatment period, the patient will have clinical examination, lung function
      testing (FEV1) and 2 video recordings:

        -  Video recording #1: inhalation (one puff) without any instruction of use,

        -  Video recording #2: inhalation (one puff) after reading the patient information leaflet.

      At the end of the visit, the patient will watch a standardized video demonstrating correct
      inhaler technique.

      On day 7 of each treatment period, the patient will have clinical examination, lung function
      testing (FEV1) and 1 video recording of inhaler device use (one puff).

      30 days after the last visit, the patient will have a phone contact to collect the adverse
      events.
