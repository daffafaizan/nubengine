    
      This is a cross sectional survey. 200 subjects were selected among people having consulted an
      occupational doctor to validate the scale in the general population (study 1), and 50
      subjects among a psychiatric population for the ancillary study (study 2).

      The Serenat Scale is a self-report questionnaire composed of 20 items. All items are scored
      on a four point Likert scale ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree)
      resulting in a range of 0 to 60. The 20 items are related to different domains. 10 items
      explore psychological balance at work: relaxation (item 1), sleep quality (item 2),
      concentration (item 3), form (item 4), sense of security (item 5), satisfaction (item 6),
      quality of relationships and contacts at work (item 7), voltage or aggressiveness (item 8),
      optimism for the future from a professional point of view (item 9), life balance (item 10).
      10 items are related to working conditions and organization of work: comfort of the working
      environment (item 11), time constraint (item 12), sense of competence (item 13), decision
      latitude (item 14), interest at work and variety of tasks (item 15), recognition (item 16),
      professional support (item 17), communication and transfer of information (item 18), human
      conflict (item 19), satisfactory work schedules (item 20).
