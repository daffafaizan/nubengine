      women with regular, ovulatory cycles who are protected from unintended pregnancy via the
      concurrent use of non-hormonal methods of contraception. Participants will have a mid-luteal
      screening visit, which will include: informed consent, history, physical, vitals, and
      assessment of mid-luteal serum progesterone to confirm ovulatory status. Each participant
      will be assigned to one of three groups according the size of the leading follicle (12-14mm,
      15-17mm, â‰¥18mm), which will determine the timing of the placement of the ENG/EE CVR.
      Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) will be performed three times per week, starting on day 8 of
      the menstrual cycle, until the leading follicle is within the assigned group. On that day the
      CVR will be placed and, including day of placement, there will be 6 daily visits with
      hormonal assays (progesterone, luteinizing hormone) and TVUS to assess for signs of
      ovulation. Compliance with CVR placement will be assessed through the measurement of serum
      ENG. After 7 days, participants will remove the CVR at home. Participants will then have
      biweekly visits until onset of menses to obtain serum progesterone levels and TVUS to assess
      for signs of delayed ovulation.
