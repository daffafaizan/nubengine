      The investigators wish to enroll a total of 70 patients aged newborn to 17 years old. The
      patients will be divided into three groups: (1) 0-2 years (2) 2-10 years (3) 10-17 years of
      age. 59 of the patients will be normal volunteers - siblings of patients receiving routine
      echoes or siblings of patient caregivers at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The
      investigators will age-match those patients with twenty patients with known or suspected
      heart muscle dysfunction (not working properly) already scheduled for a routine echo. For the
      patients scheduled for a routine echo, the patient and parent/guardian will be approached
      prior to the routine echo being performed. If they consent/assent, it will take an additional
      10-15 minutes to obtain the research images after their routine images have been obtained.
      The healthy volunteers will be screened from the siblings of the patients receiving a routine
      echo or from siblings of patient caregivers, the study explained and informed consent/assent
      obtained. It will take approximately 30 minutes to obtain the research images.

      By studying this new technology, the investigators will be able to find out whether it will
      be able to give us useful information on how the heart muscle contracts, the coordination of
      these contractions and if it may indicate new areas for treatment.
