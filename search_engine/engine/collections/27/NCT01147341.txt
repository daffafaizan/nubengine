    
      This is a Phase IV, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group 12-week study of
      Cimzia with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) or other DMARD compared to MTX or other DMARD
      alone in patients with an inadequate secondary therapeutic response to a TNF-alpha inhibitor
      as defined above and active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) followed by a 12-week open-label phase
      with concomitant MTX or other DMARD and Cimzia.

      Subjects must washout from the previous TNF inhibitor for at least 4 weeks prior to the
      baseline visit. Subjects unable to tolerate MTX must have been on a stable dose of another
      non-biologic DMARD for at least 3 months. Subjects' diagnosis of RA must be based on the 1987
      Revised American Rheumatism Association Criteria for the Classification of Rheumatoid
      Arthritis.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and, up to 28 days later, at the baseline visit,
      randomized to one of two treatment groups (2:1): Cimzia or placebo (in addition to
      concomitant MTX or other DMARD). All subjects will continue MTX/other DMARD at the same dose
      utilized prior to study entry.

      After the Week 12 study visit, all subjects will have the opportunity to continue in the
      study on open-label Cimzia treatment (using an induction regimen for all subjects, regardless
      of their treatment in the blinded phase).
