      reserve, etc.) may impact early healing, recovery following neoadjuvant therapy and surgery,
      and long-term cancer-free survival. It is well-recognized that resilience is enhanced in
      individuals with proper diet, sleep habits, and exercise. However, it is unknown whether such
      resilience can be enhanced by training programs initiated at the time of cancer diagnosis.
      Although exercise interventions may contribute to these improvements, it is unknown how
      willing and able these patients are to comply with an exercise regimen during the neoadjuvant
      therapy period. The aim of this study, therefore, is to evaluate compliance with and the
      efficacy of Band Together, an exercise program combining strength-training and aerobic
      exercise, in patients with aggressive GI malignancies undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.
