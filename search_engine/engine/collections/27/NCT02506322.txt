      psychotherapy in Bipolar Disorder. By treating older subjects having suffered of multiple
      affective episodes, the potential benefit of psychotherapy to prevent relapse and help to
      adjust to this chronic illness might be underestimated. In addition, the investigators have
      no knowledge of mechanism (mediators) of positive changes by successful psychotherapy and of
      subjects with good outcome of adjuvant psychotherapy (moderators, indicators, predictors).
      Possible mediators and moderators can be sociodemographic, psychological (cognitive,
      interactional), and/or biological (neuronal, genetic). The planned study will address all
      three areas of questions. In a multi-center study, 300 younger subjects suffering of a
      Bipolar Disorder will be included and provide with one of two treatments in addition to
      stable medication. Moderators and mediators are selected on promising preliminary results and
      based on a psycho-biological understanding of Bipolar Disorder.
