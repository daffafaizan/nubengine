      study (Treatment vs. Comparison) utilizing 24 RI worksites with randomization by site. The
      specific impact and outcome evaluation measures (BMI, DHQ-FFQ, and 7-day PAR) will be
      collected at Baseline, 12, and 24 months on a longitudinal cohort selected at random from the
      employee lists of each participating worksite. Extensive process evaluation and a mediating
      variable framework are also included to identify the mechanisms in successful change at both
      the worksite and individual level, which will maximize the potential for dissemination and
      generalization of the intervention as well as advance theory and improve intervention
      practice and policy.

      Primary outcome measure will be weight (BMI).
