      Associates Clinical Research, Inc., clinical trials unit (CTU), according to a randomized,
      double-blinded (except for the use of moxifloxacin), placebo-controlled, four-period,
      four-treatment, crossover design balanced with respect to first-order carryover effect in 72
      healthy male or female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive, to evaluate the effect of
      zoliflodacin on the corrected QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) using Fridericia's
      Formula (QTcF) and other ECG parameters; the correlation of the drug concentrations (and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile) with time-matched, placebo-corrected, baseline-adjusted
      difference in QTcF interval (delta delta QTcF); and the PK and safety profiles of the new
      zoliflodacin formulation. Each subject will receive one dose of each of four treatments:
      zoliflodacin 2 g orally, zoliflodacin 4 g orally, placebo for zoliflodacin 4 g orally, and
      moxifloxacin 400 mg orally. The study will last approximately 12 weeks with a subject
      participation duration of up to 55 days. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that
      following administration of zoliflodacin 2 g and 4 g, the upper bound of the one-sided 95%
      confidence interval (CI) of treatment effect on delta delta QTcF is > / = 10 msec for at
      least one of the ECG assessments, against the alternative hypothesis that all mean effects
      are < 10 msec. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of zoliflodacin on the
      corrected QT interval of the ECG using Fridericia's formula (QTcF). The secondary objectives
      are: 1) to evaluate the effects of zoliflodacin on other ECG parameters (PR, QRS, and RR
      intervals, and heart rate (HR)); 2) to evaluate the sensitivity of QTcF measurement using
      moxifloxacin; 3) to evaluate the effect of zoliflodacin on T-wave morphology; 4) to evaluate
      the PK of 2 g and 4 g oral zoliflodacin under fasting state; 5) to evaluate the relationship
      between zoliflodacin PK and time-matched QTcF pharmacodynamics (PD); 6) to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of 2 g and 4 g oral zoliflodacin.
