      pre-clinical studies have been shown to prevent age-related bone loss. Based on these
      findings, this pilot study was designed to investigate the effects of three months of tart
      cherry juice supplementation on improving markers of oxidative stress and bone metabolism in
      older women. Women (n=30), aged 65-80 yrs, will be recruited for the study and randomly
      assigned to one of two doses of tart cherry juice (8 or 16 fl oz) per day prepared from a
      Montmorency cherry concentrate (King Orchards, Central Lake, MI). Study participants will
      complete two study visits to the Nutritional Sciences Clinical Research Center. At the first
      visit, informed consent will be obtained and relevant medical history and anthropometric
      measures will be taken by the research team. A blood draw will be performed to assess
      baseline, biochemical markers of bone metabolism and inflammation as well as indicators of
      oxidative status. A physical activity and food frequency questionnaire will be completed by
      each study participant. Whole body, hip and spine bone density (DXA) scan will be performed
      by certified bone densitometrist. A 3-month final visit will be scheduled for all study
      participants in which most of the procedures described at baseline (except DXA) will be
      repeated. Change in primary and secondary outcome measures (i.e., bone, inflammation and
      oxidative stress biomarkers) will be assessed.
