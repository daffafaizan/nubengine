      measure for the restrictive left ventricular function. Any patient with known cardiovascular
      disease should undergo assessment of left ventricular function by measuring the ejection
      fraction. Several studies have shown that when the ejection fraction (LVEF), which measures
      the heart's ability to eject blood to the aorta does not exceed 40% (natural price ^ 50%)
      increased dramatically in the post-infarction mortality. The ejection fraction as a reliable
      predictor, can be measured by ultrasonography. The reduced ejection fraction is associated
      with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, heart failure and death. The low
      ejection fraction, especially after myocardial infarction is a strong indication for
      beta-blockers, as many studies indicate that administration of these drugs substantially
      reduces cardiovascular mortality.
