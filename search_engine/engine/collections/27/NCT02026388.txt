      hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, APRT deficiency, and Dent disease, and from their family members,
      for use in future research. This will help to advance our understanding of disease expression
      and the factors associated with kidney injury in these four diseases with the overall goal of
      developing new treatments to preserve kidney function and reduce nephrocalcinosis and stone
      formation.
