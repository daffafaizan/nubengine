    
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide ongoing data collection and review of long-term
      outcome and late effects in a large cohort of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
      autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients. Central coordination of
      clinical and psychosocial late effects monitoring and reporting can facilitate timely
      communication about life-threatening or unanticipated clinical outcomes as well as
      significant psychological, social and behavioral sequelae effects on the recipient and their
      family members. The resultant data may enable researchers in their development of current
      clinical and psychosocial studies, as well as monitoring predisposed survivors who may
      benefit from preventive or corrective interventions. Physicians and researchers may be able
      to learn how to identify these problems earlier, to take better care of these problems, or to
      implement preventive measures for future transplant recipients
