    
      This will be a non-blinded randomized clinical trial with 150 participants randomized at a
      1:1:1 allocation ratio to one of three treatment arms.

      Arm 1: Sofosbuvir (400mg/daily) + Daclatasvir (60mg/daily) + Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a
      (180Âµg/weekly) for 4 weeks with a field-based DOT approach

      Arm 2: Sofosbuvir (400mg/daily) + Daclatasvir (60mg/daily) for 12 weeks with a field-based
      DOT approach

      Arm 3: Sofosbuvir (400mg/daily) + Daclatasvir (60mg/daily) for 12 weeks with standard of care
      dispensation (4 monthly doses)

      Pegylated-interferon alfa-2a (PEG) will be delivered subcutaneously once weekly. Sofosbuvir
      (SOF) and Daclatasvir (DAC) will be taken orally once daily for the entire study period.

      The study will take place at the YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Education (YRG) and Johns
      Hopkins University (JHU) Collaborative Integrated Care Center (YRG-JHU ICC) located within
      the premises of the Chattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS) in Bilaspur in the state
      of Chattisgarh, India.

      Participants will be recruited from the YRG-JHU ICC in Bilaspur, which currently has 514
      registered HCV antibody positive clients. The Bilaspur ICC is in the Chattisgarh Institute
      for Medical Sciences (CIMS).

      The primary outcome will be sustained virologic response (SVR12). Secondary outcomes include
      cost per SVR12, adherence, safety and tolerability.
