      gestation at â‰¥ 34 weeks gestation who require an induction of labor after diagnosis of PROM
      with an unfavorable cervix. PROM will be diagnosed and confirmed with sterile speculum
      examination demonstrating pooling and/or positive ferning or nitrazine. Cervical status will
      be assessed by visual exam, digital exam or transvaginal ultrasound to assign a Bishop score
      (dilation, effacement, station, consistency & position). Determination of patient eligibility
      will be based on the clinical exam and confirmation of PROM. Upon diagnosis, if the patient
      meets inclusion criteria and accepts to participate in the study, they will be consented by
      the study investigator and then be randomized to prostaglandin followed by oxytocin or
      oxytocin alone group. Allocation concealment will be performed via the utilization of
      pre-sequentially numbered, manila sealed envelopes stapled closed.

      There are two treatment groups and will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.
      Randomization will be performed using a computer generated simple randomization sequence.
      Data safety monitoring will be instituted (see data safety monitoring plan below). Once
      randomization is completed, the labor and delivery providers will be informed of the
      treatment arm and this will be placed on the chart. Those randomized to the prostaglandin arm
      will receive PGE1 (misoprostol) in a dose of 25mcg placed vaginally every 4 hours as per
      hospital protocol. Those randomized to the oxytocin arm will receive infusion of oxytocin,
      which will then be titrated per hospital protocol until adequate contractions. Further
      management after the start of the respective arm will be based on clinical judgment of the
      provider.
