      the treatment of mild to moderate obesity and test the safety (good and bad effects) of this
      procedure. The vagus nerve transmits hunger signals from the stomach to the brain, and in
      response transmits stomach expansion signals from the brain to the stomach.Investigators
      believe that by interrupting this communication, participants could experience less hunger
      and in turn lose weight.

      The rationale for using cryoablation to treat obesity is based on this investigator's
      experience safely targeting peripheral nerves via CT guidance and treated with thermal
      ablation in daily clinical practice. the primary objective of this research is to evaluate
      the feasibility and safety (over time) of percutaneous image guided cryoablation of the
      posterior vagus nerve in obese patients. The secondary objective consist of temporal
      evaluation of weight loss and appetite before and after the procedure. This will be analyzed
      through documentation of weight, and through the implementation of validated outcome
      instruments.
