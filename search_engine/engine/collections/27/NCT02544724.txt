    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study with NM-IL-12 dosed in
      combination with salvage chemotherapy regimens (R-ICE = rituximab plus
      ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide, R-DHAP = rituximab plus cytosine
      arabinoside-cisplatin-dexamethasone) for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory
      DLBCL.

      NM-IL-12 (150 ng/kg) will be administered subcutaneously. Patients will be monitored as
      routinely practiced; in addition, approximately 1 day after NM-IL-12 injection, patients will
      have a home visit by a nurse for blood sampling related to pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) evaluation.

      Twelve patients are planned to be enrolled into the study; initially 6 patients will be
      enrolled. The decision to continue and recruit the remaining six patients will be made by
      Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after review of relevant safety data, clinical laboratory
      evaluations, and vital signs collected up to 21 days post enrollment of the last patient in
      the first treated group. Common Terminology Grades for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines will
      be used to determine dose-modifying criteria (DMC).
