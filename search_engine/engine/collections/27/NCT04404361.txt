    
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of pacritinib in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 with or
      without cancer. Severe COVID-19 is defined as confirmed disease in patients who are
      hospitalized with hypoxia (blood oxygen saturation [SpO2] â‰¤93% on room air at sea level),
      respiratory rate >30, arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2]/ fraction of inspired oxygen
      [FiO2] <300, or lung infiltrates >50% but do not require IMV.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive pacritinib (400 mg once daily [QD] on Day 1, then
      200 mg twice daily [BID] from Day 2 to Day 14) + SOC or placebo + SOC.

      Assigned treatment will continue for up to Day 14 or until the patient experiences
      intolerable adverse events (AEs), withdraws consent, or initiates another investigational
      therapy or until the study is terminated. Assigned therapy may be given for an additional 7
      days (for a total of 21 days) with the approval of the Medical Monitor if, in the opinion of
      the investigator, the patient's clinical signs and symptoms are improving and the potential
      benefit outweighs the potential risk.In the event of hospital discharge, patients will
      complete treatment with the assigned therapy as an outpatient.
