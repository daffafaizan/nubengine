      given in combination with vinorelbine/cisplatin, will be determined. Cohorts of 3 patients
      will be recruited into three dosing cohorts (6, 9 and 12 Âµg/kg). All patients at a given dose
      level must complete the first treatment cycle (3 week period) before escalation in subsequent
      patients can proceed. The decision for escalation to the next dose level will be made after
      the safety data have been reviewed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). If a patient in any
      cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled, for a
      maximum of up to 18 patients in this initial dose escalation part of the study.

      In part II, after the maximum tolerated dose of L-DOS47 in combination with
      vinorelbine/cisplatin has been determined, a further 118 patients will be randomized (1:1) to
      receive L-DOS47 in combination with vinorelbine/cisplatin, or vinorelbine/cisplatin alone.
      Efficacy will be assessed by time to progression (time from first day of study drug
      administration to documented disease progression), response rate (proportion of patients with
      a best overall response of complete response and partial response using the Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] version 1.1 criteria), and overall survival
      (time from first day of study drug administration to death due to any cause). Monitoring will
      include radiological evaluations every second cycle. Safety and tolerability of L-DOS47 in
      combination will also continue to be evaluated.

      For all patients, treatment will continue either until the patient experiences disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, the patient withdraws consent or has completed four
      treatment cycles.
