    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of lamivudine in combination
      with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 12-month survival and overall survival (OS) of patients with extensive
      stage SCLC receiving study treatment.

      II. To assess the toxicity of the combination of lamivudine with platinum-based chemotherapy
      in this population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To study tissue and blood-based biomarkers as potential predictors of treatment efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive lamivudine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients
      also receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and atezolizumab IV on day 1,
      and etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive lamivudine PO QD on days 1-28 and atezolizumab IV on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Patients who are not eligible for atezolizumab as outlined in exclusion criteria or who
      refuse to receive atezolizumab may still be treated in this study with carboplatin and
      etoposide as the IV drug component, in addition to lamivudine orally administered.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 60
      days thereafter.
