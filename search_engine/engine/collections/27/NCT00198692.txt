      reduced function and disability are common conditions following limb loss and are related to
      reduced quality of life. Our own work has identified depression, anxiety, and pain as
      significant problems for community dwelling persons with limb loss. Traditionally,
      interventions for disabling impairments and related secondary conditions focus on standard
      medical treatments such as medication, surgery or rehabilitative therapies. Self-management
      (SM) interventions, on the other hand, have been found to be effective in reducing secondary
      conditions and disability associated with some chronic conditions using individual and
      group-based delivery methods. To date, no SM intervention has been developed for, and
      evaluated in, persons with limb loss. The goal of the project is to develop and test the
      efficacy of a community-based self-management intervention for reducing pain, depression, and
      anxiety and improving positive mood, self-efficacy and function in persons with limb loss.
      The intervention will build on the already exisitng national network of community-based peer
      support groups developed by the Amputee Coalition of America (ACA). Establishing the efficacy
      of commmunity-based SM interventions for persons with limb loss has the potential to improve
      the health and quality of life for this population
