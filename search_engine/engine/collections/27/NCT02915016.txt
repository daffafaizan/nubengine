    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response of the
      DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine when used in combination with one of two protein vaccines: Bivalent
      Subtype C gp120/MF59 (Protein/MF59) or Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01B (Protein/AS01B). These
      protein vaccines may boost the immune response to the DNA vaccine.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of eight groups, and each group will receive a different sequence of vaccines during
      the study. Groups 1 and 4 will receive the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine, the Protein/MF59 vaccine,
      and placebo. Groups 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 will receive the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine, the
      Protein/AS01B vaccine, and placebo. Group 8 will only receive placebo.

      All participants will receive their assigned vaccines at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Each of these
      visits will include three injections. Follow-up visits will occur at Week 2 and Months 1.5,
      3.5, 6.25, 6.5, 9, and 12.

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may
      optionally choose to provide stool, rectal fluid, cervical fluid, or semen samples.
      Participants will be contacted 6 months after the last scheduled visit by phone, text
      message, or e-mail for information about their health.
