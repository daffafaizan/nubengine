      hydrogen ions fails, leading to progressive metabolic acidosis (arterial pH < 7.35 and a
      serum bicarbonate concentration < 22 meq/L). Metabolic acidosis enhances further progression
      of CKD. It is known that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is stimulated during
      metabolic acidosis, but it's specific role in the renal response on changes in the acid-base
      balance is unknown. Correction of metabolic acidosis by administration of bicarbonate is a
      common intervention in patients with metabolic acidosis due to chronic kidney disease. It is
      proven to slow down progression of CKD. There is no knowledge on the effect this therapy has
      on the intrarenal RAS. Since acidosis does not change serum renin levels, and bicarbonate
      therapy has no effect on blood pressure, it seems to have no effect on the systemic RAS. The
      investigators hypothesize that bicarbonate therapy diminishes intrarenal RAS activity without
      affecting the systemic RAS.
