      optimal therapies for various situations in population at a given time based on their
      demographic, physiological and pathological characteristics. Chinese proprietary herbal
      medicines, as a kind of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), are usually developed
      from some well-established and long-standing recipes and formulated as tablets or capsules
      for commerce, convenience or palatability. Although these advantage mentioned, a good
      quantification and a strict standardization in detail are still need to be improved for
      individualized implementation in therapeutic strategies. Based on the YQHY decoction (Yi-Qi
      Hua-Yu Decoction, tonify Qi and promoting circulation and removing stasis), Qishe Pill
      (Shanghai Sundise Traditional Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd, China) has been developed and spread
      in use into clinical settings in 2009. As individualization has become the trend of modern
      medicine, a personalized medicine of Qishe Pill should be documented and practiced with
      various patients according to the ancient TCM system, a classification of personalized
      constitution type, which has been established to determine predisposition and prognosis to
      diseases as well as therapy and life-style administration. Therefore, we describe the
      population pharmacokinetic profile of Qishe Pill and compare its extent of metabolism in the
      3 major Constitution Type (Qi-Deficiency, Yin-Deficiency and Blood-Stasis) to address major
      challenges of individualized and standardized Traditional Chinese Medicine into clinical
      practice.
