      nose or mouth. Subglottic suctioning, during endotracheal tube securement, is important for
      mechanically-ventilated patients to allow for the clearance of secretions that may accumulate
      during intubation. This protocol examines an enhancement to the current AnchorFast Guard
      device in order for the device to hold a subglottic suctioning lumen in addition to the
      intubation tube.
