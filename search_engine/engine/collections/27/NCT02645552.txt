      and one of the unmet needs in medical care. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce
      blood loss after elective surgery and improve outcomes after traumatic injury due to bleeding
      without obvious adverse events. In the CRASH-2 Intracranial Bleeding Study, with the nested
      randomized trial design, the study showed that treatment with TXA within 8 hours of injury
      was associated with a reduction in haemorrhage growth [adjusted difference, -3.8 ml, 95%
      confidence interval (CI), -11.5 ml to 3.9 ml], fewer focal ischaemic lesions [adjusted odds
      ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.46] and fewer death (adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.06)
      for patients with TBI (Glasgow coma score â‰¤ 14). The study also provided direction for future
      research of TXA in TBI, especially for the patients with moderate and severe TBI in whom an
      intracranial intracranial bleed (defined as the presence of parenchymal, subdural or epidural
      haemorrhage) is common.

      Furtherly, results of the CRASH-2 trial stressed the importance of early adminstration with
      TXA for trauma patients, with the evidence showing that treatment of TXA within 1 hour post
      injury could significantly reduce the risk of death, while the benefit did not exist when TXA
      was administered more than 3 hours after injury. If the use of TXA could be incorporated into
      the pre-hospital management of TBI, the outcome of traumatically injured patients would be
      improved in an early stage. Thus, our study sets out to employ a randomized controlled study
      design, with a sample of 400 patients, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early use of
      TXA in the pre-hospital management for moderate and severe TBI.
