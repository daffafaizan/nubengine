      evidence-based practice for substance abuse, specifically Contingency Management (CM). This
      randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of using juvenile probation
      officers (JPOs) to deliver CM to youth (aged 12-17 years) on their caseloads. CM is an
      evidence-based practice for substance abuse. The Investigators posit that JPOs are in an
      ideal position to deliver an evidence-based practice such as CM to youth because of their
      intensive involvement and frequent contact with the youth offenders under their supervision.
      The study randomizes 36 JPOs to 2 conditions: CM versus control (usual JPO services), and
      then randomizes 504 drug-abusing adolescent probationers across those 2 conditions. The
      research team will work with JPOs employed by the Department of Youth Services (DYS) in
      various counties in Oregon. JPOs will participate in focus groups and research interviews and
      will submit monthly audio-tapes of sessions with participating youth. JPOs randomized to the
      CM condition will receive training in how to deliver CM. As stated, participating youth will
      also be randomized to CM or control and assigned to a JPO in the same condition. For those in
      the CM group, the delivery of CM will be added to their regular meetings with their JPO.
      Research data will be collected from families via audio-taped interviews and questionnaires
      from youth and one caretaker. Urine samples for drug testing will also be collected from
      youth. Lastly, arrest records will be collected on youth for the 18 months pre- and
      post-entry into the study. The study involves 2 types of participants: youth (n=504) and
      juvenile probation officers (n=36), for a total of 540 anticipated participants.
