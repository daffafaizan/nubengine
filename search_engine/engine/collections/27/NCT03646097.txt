    
      In this randomized blinded pilot-study the effect of pre-PCI planning by
      angiographic-co-registered OCT (ACR) compared to OCT or angiographic evaluation alone with
      respect to the entire result after PCI will be investigated. A special focus (primary
      endpoint) will be on the incidence of geographical mismatch (GM) and/or major edge
      dissections. Eligible patients will be randomized in three groups.

      Group 1 Pre-PCI-OCT: Patients underwent OCT-imaging before PCI. Lesion assessment, selection
      of PCI landing zone as well as stent selection will be performed by investigators based on
      OCT findings.

      Group 2: Pre-PCI-ACR: Patients underwent ACR-imaging before PCI. Lesion assessment, selection
      of PCI landing zone as well as stent selection will be performed by investigators based on
      ACR-findings.

      Group 3:OCT-Blinded/Angiographic guided PCI: Lesion assessment, selection of PCI landing zone
      as well as stent selection will be performed by investigators only based on angiographic
      lesion evaluation (standard care).

      For outcome analysis all study groups underwent post-PCI-OCT imaging as soon as investigators
      assume angiographic justiciable PCI-results (TIMI III, no residual stenosis > 50%; no
      angiographic definable or suspicious edge dissections, angiographic acceptable stent
      expansion without evidence for malapposition). OCT imaging analysis will be performed within
      a OCT core-lab by two investigators blinded for the randomization group.
