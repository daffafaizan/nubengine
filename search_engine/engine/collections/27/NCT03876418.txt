      common in all intensive care unit (ICU) patients (upwards of 50%) and has been suggested as
      the missing link in multi-organ dysfunction, and subsequently ICU mortality. Despite
      guidelines advocating prevention and surveillance of IAH, adherence remains low in most ICUs
      across North America and Europe.

      The creation of the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) in 2004
      improved the recognition of IAH/ACS by intensivists. The first consensus guidelines from the
      WSACS were released in 2006, followed by a 2013 update. Additionally, clinical practice
      guidelines and recommendations for research were released in 2007 and 2009 respectively,
      which attempted to standardize research methods and reporting. Unfortunately, even in the
      2013 guidelines only WEAK recommendations (by GRADE methodology) could be made regarding the
      efficacy of surveillance and treatment of IAH/ACS, citing a lack of high quality
      interventional trials.

      The investigator's study aims to assess the feasibility of a larger multi-center
      interventional trial to investigate the efficacy of aggressive screening, prevention and
      treatment of IAH in ICU patients.
