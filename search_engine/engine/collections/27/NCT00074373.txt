      and/or SSB/La proteins. The mother may have systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome,
      or be otherwise healthy. Heart block and a characteristic skin rash are the primary
      manifestations of neonatal lupus.

      The Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus was initiated in 1994 to help basic scientists and
      clinicians better understand the cause of neonatal lupus and discover a cure. The Research
      Registry is a central repository of patient information, sera, and DNA. The Registry provides
      blood samples (kept anonymous) to scientists studying neonatal lupus. Information from the
      registry forms the basis of family counseling and tracks important data such as recurrence
      rates in subsequent pregnancies and the effects of treatments. The Research Registry also
      serves as an educational resource for women who are eager to learn about this disease.

      Women with a child affected by neonatal lupus may enroll in the Registry. Women can be self
      referred or referred by their doctors. Siblings of women with a child affected by neonatal
      lupus, fathers and maternal grandparents of children with neonatal lupus, and unaffected
      siblings of a child with neonatal lupus are also invited to participate in this study. All
      information on the mother and her family is confidential; only nonidentifying information
      will be provided to researchers. Women interested in the registry will be sent articles and
      educational materials about neonatal lupus, a consent form for the Registry, and an
      enrollment questionnaire. Participants will be asked to sign a medical records release form.
      Participants will also be asked to donate a blood sample for antibody testing and DNA
      isolation.
