      analyze biological specimens to predict and validate outcomes after treatment for prostate
      cancer. The study population will consist of patients scheduled to receive standard of care
      therapy for localized prostate cancer, either radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy
      (XRT; includes external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or both). Seven hundred (700) patients
      (350 RP, 350 XRT) will be recruited from 11 SPORE sites over a two-year interval. We will
      collect serum, plasma, lymphocytes, and prostate tissue samples for distribution to
      collaborating biomarker validation sites at other prostate SPOREs, along with clinical and
      epidemiologic data.
