      though data to support this is lacking. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at
      increased risk for pulmonary compromise as they are obese and undergoing foregut surgery.

      This study aims to examine the effect of incentive spirometry after bariatric surgery by
      performing a prospective randomized trial. Subjects will be randomized to either receive an
      incentive spirometer or not. The primary outcome measure of oxygen saturation off of
      supplemental oxygen will be taken preoperatively and at 6,12, and 24 hours postoperatively.
      Secondary outcome measures include rate of pulmonary complications, and time to wean off of
      supplemental oxygen.
