      induce beneficial changes in the specific immune response, including: 1) anergy of IgE
      effector immune cells (e.g., mast cells, basophils) resulting in clinical desensitization; 2)
      induction of de novo, long lived (memory) B cell responses that antagonize specific IgE and
      confer immune tolerance. The investigators will test this hypothesis in the following
      specific aims:

        1. Induce desensitization in peanut allergic subjects with peanut OIT and evaluate the
           safety of the peanut OIT desensitization protocol.

        2. Induce long-standing tolerance in peanut allergic subjects with maintenance peanut OIT
           and evaluate the efficacy of allergen-specific testing to predict tolerance.

        3. Longitudinally evaluate basophil and mast cell reactivity in subjects receiving peanut
           OIT and their relationship to the induction of desensitization.

        4. Longitudinally evaluate the allergen-specific B-cell repertoire in subjects receiving
           peanut OIT and its relationship to the induction of tolerance.
