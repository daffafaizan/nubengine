    
      Hydatid disease is a parasitic induced disease caused by either Echinococcus granulosus or
      Echinococcus multilocularis during the larval stage of these tapeworms. Hydatid cysts are
      endemic in many countries, such as Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and
      Uruguay); followed by Europe (France, Italy, and Greece), the Middle East (Turkey, Lebanon,
      Syria, and Jordan), Southeast Asia (China, Iran, and India) and Africa (Tunisia and less
      commonly, Egypt)
