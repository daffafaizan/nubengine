      idea for treating deep caries is to enhance calcific reparative capacity.Calcium hydroxide
      has been the gold standard as a capping material but there are some drawbacks like
      solubility,gaps formation and mechanical instability so a need for a capping material such as
      calcium silicate has shown several advantages.

      Sixty participants will be divided in to two groups (n=30) of patient treated by partial
      caries removal.The first group(A1) will be treated by light activated calcium silicate and
      the second group(A2) will be treated by light activated calcium hydroxide after partial
      caries removal of deep occlusal caries then restore by composite restoration.Paralleling
      technique using film holders and custom made bite blocks will be used to standardize the
      serial radiographs and to prevent the distortion of the radiographic image.An increase in
      dentin thickness will be measured through sequential imaging by soft ware named Digora
      (Digora Optime,Soredex,Helsinki,Finland) will be used for measurements by digitalizing the
      scanned image.All images will be studied carefully for an increase in dentin thickness
      keeping the reference point constant from the furcation area.
