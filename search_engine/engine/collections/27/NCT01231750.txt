    
      Patients with stable angina on medical therapy who are capable of exercising on a treadmill
      and have an interpretable ECG for ischemia will be enrolled in the study, which entails
      performing two treadmill tests approximately one week apart following topical treatment with
      placebo cream or topical capsaicin (randomized in crossover fashion). Patients will be
      monitored for exercise tolerance, anginal symptoms, ECG for ischemia/arrhythmia, and
      hemodynamic responses.
