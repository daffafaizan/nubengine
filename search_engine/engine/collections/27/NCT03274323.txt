    
      This will be a prospective randomized controlled study.

      20 phakic or pseudophakic open angle glaucoma patients with an IOP in the range of 18-30 mmHg
      on 2 or more topical glaucoma medications will be randomly selected to undergo either (1)
      mitomycin-augmented trabeculectomy or (2) placement of 2 iStent devices and initiation of a
      daily prostaglandin analog. This study is looking at the combined effects of the 2 iStents
      and a prostaglandin analog as a method to achieve low IOP. At 3 months (+/- 2 weeks)
      postoperatively, the iStent patients will be left only on the prostaglandin analog with a
      washout performed for any other hypotensive medication used. Patients who had a
      trabeculectomy will be have a terminal washout of all IOP-lowering medications at 3 months
      (+/- 2 weeks) post-surgery. The IOP will then be measured for both groups at 4 months (+/- 3
      weeks) postoperatively.
