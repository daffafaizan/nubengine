      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-agent ibrutinib in combination with
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) specifically with respect to ibrutinib metabolism in
      HIV-infected patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell neoplasms.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib in this setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize ibrutinib pharmacokinetics in relation to ART-cytochrome P450, family 3,
      subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) interactions.

      II. To describe toxicity in relation to plasma concentrations of ibrutinib and its main
      metabolite.

      III. To estimate objective response rate, clinical benefit, times to tumor response and
      progression, and 6-month and 1-year progression-free and overall survival.

      IV. To describe changes in HIV viral load, immunologic parameters, and Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy numbers in plasma and
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in relation to ibrutinib therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
