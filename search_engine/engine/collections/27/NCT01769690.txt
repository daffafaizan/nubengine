      objective changes in sleep architecture with DBS "on" and to compare effects of different DBS
      stimulation parameters on sleep architecture as measured by sleep studies. The study design
      will allow us to address our hypothesis that low frequency deep brain stimulation parameters
      are more effective than the conventional settings at improving sleep architecture and
      wake-time vigilance. If our hypothesis is correct, low frequency settings could be used
      during sleep and this would prolong stimulator battery life, therefore decreasing the
      frequency of required surgical battery changes for DBS. These data will be valuable in
      considering clinical treatment strategies and provide insight into the basic mechanisms of
      sleep dysfunction in PD. The study may also contribute to understanding how to achieve
      maximum clinical benefit from DBS while minimizing morbidity and cost.
