      of chronic oral anticoagulation, often with no end in sight. This strategy, however, is
      associate with a high incidence of bleeding complications, especially when anticoagulation is
      associated with antiplatelet agents, as it occurs in patients with coronary artery disease
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Known as intermittent, on demand, or 'pill in the pocket' anticoagulation, the strategy of
      prescribing oral anticoagulation only when is actually needed, has gotten a feasibility boost
      from recent advancements in both medical therapy and rhythm monitoring technology.

      Preliminary experiences suggest that intermittent anticoagulation guided by continuous
      electrocardiographic monitoring can reduce the incidence of bleeding in patients with
      episodes of atrial fibrillation.

      Uncertainty about the potential implications of a strategy of intermittent anticoagulation
      after percutaneous coronary intervention exists.

      The investigators will perform a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of anticoagulation on demand in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after
      percutaneous coronary intervention.
