      patients planning to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting or heart valve surgery via
      median sternotomy were randomly assigned 1:1 to the experimental group or control group.
      After general anesthesia, all subjects were injected with 0.3% ropivacaine (experimental
      group) or 0.9% normal saline (control group) 15ml and 10ml respectively after insertion of a
      needle into bilateral transverse thoracic muscle plane and rectus sheath guided by
      B-ultrasound by anesthesiologist. The main outcome indicators were the threshold of incision
      pain and the total amount of analgesics used during the operation and 48h after the
      operation. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: postoperative VAS score, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, days in ICU, total days of hospitalization, and hospitalization cost.
      This study will provide evidence-based medical evidence and clinical data support for the
      application of TTP block in cardiac surgery.
