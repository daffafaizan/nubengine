      I. Compare the rate of new adenomatous polyp formation in patients with a history of
      adenomatous polyps of the colon treated with eflornithine and sulindac vs placebo.

      II. Correlate the effects of eflornithine and sulindac on polyamine and prostaglandin content
      in the flat mucosa with the rate of new adenoma formation in these patients.

      III. Compare the rate of side effects in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center and aspirin use (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral double placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Patients who are more than 70%
      compliant by pill measurement or self reporting are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral double placebo once daily.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral eflornithine (DFMO) and oral sulindac once daily.

      In both arms, treatment continues for 36 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      the development of an invasive malignancy.
