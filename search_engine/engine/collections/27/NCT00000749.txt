      VEU 007A indicate that a gp120 dose of potentially greater immunogenicity may be of interest.

      Ten healthy volunteers receive 200 mcg gp120 in MF59 emulsion, and four volunteers receive
      placebo consisting of MF59 emulsion in PBS vehicle. Injections are given at months 0, 1, and
      6. Patients are followed for 12 months following the third injection.
