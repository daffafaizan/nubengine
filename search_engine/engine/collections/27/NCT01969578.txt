      bicalutamide 50 mg) or standard chemotherapy. Patients of Cohort A randomized to the control
      arm (chemotherapy arm) will be given the option to enter Cohort B at the time of disease
      progression. As long as Cohort A is open to recruitment, patients who will be treated by
      chemotherapy will be simultaneously enrolled in Cohort B. Accrual in Cohort B will be stopped
      when recruitment of 76 eligible patients in Cohort A is reached.
