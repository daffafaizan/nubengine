      content but different structures and textures affect lipid absorption kinetics in the acute
      postprandial period via blood lipid biochemistry, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
      and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based metabolomics.

      The study will be conducted as a randomized acute cross-over meal study. On four different
      test days (with a minimum of 2 weeks washout period) four dairy products with similar
      nutrient composition but different structures or textures will be tested. During each meal
      test a single dairy product (+ bread and water) is served and postprandial blood samples are
      collected the following 8 hours. Subjective appetite measurements (VAS) are filled in during
      the 8-hour period and an ad libitum meal is served in the end of the day.

      25 apparently healthy men (weight stable, 18-40 years, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) will be recruited.
