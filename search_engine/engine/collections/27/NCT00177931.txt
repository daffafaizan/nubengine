      populations leads to non-optimal drug exposure among liver transplant patients. Furthermore,
      using serum creatinine as a method of estimating creatinine clearance is not the optimal way
      to determine the best cefepime dose. The consequence of this non-optimal exposure is the
      unattainability of therapeutic targets. These therapeutic targets are correlated with
      positive microbiologic outcome and clinical cure.
