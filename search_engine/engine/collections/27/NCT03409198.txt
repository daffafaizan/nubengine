      chemotherapeutic agents are immunogenic. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide have been shown to
      be particularly powerful inducers of immunogenic cell death. Both agents fulfil 5/5 criteria
      established for assessing the immunogenicity of different chemotherapeutic drugs. There is
      also strong evidence from humans, particularly in breast cancer, indicating that the clinical
      effect of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide depends on the host immune response. Further,
      these agents have been shown to induce a Type I interferon immune response in breast cancer.
      Taken together, there is a strong rationale for synergy between doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
      and PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade. The trial combines nivolumab and ipilimumab with established 1st
      choice chemotherapy in patients with metastatic hormone reseptor positive breast cancer.
      Nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) may i) potentiate the patientÂ´s spontaneous anti-tumor immune
      response ii) synergize with chemotherapeutic agents that induce immunological cell death
