      unfit or unwilling to receive intensive treatment. CAG regimen, which is a combination of
      aclacinomycin，low dose cytarabine±G-CSF is used often in elderly AML patients in China. It is
      proved effective and safety in some pilot studies，while there is no prospective，randomized
      study yet.
