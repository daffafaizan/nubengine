      minutes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation will be enrolled. Basic demographic information,
      clinical events throughout hospitalization, and laboratory examination results will be
      recorded. Patients will be assessed for their neurological outcome using Glasgow coma score
      (GCS) and cerebral performance categories (CPC) upon hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, and 12
      months after discharge.

      Post-cardiac arrest care is clinically challenging and this study aims to evaluate not just
      the physical well-being but also the psychological well-being of these patients on the
      short-term and long-term survival. Patients and their families will be assessed on their
      health-related quality of life and psychological well-being upon hospital discharge using the
      following scales: Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4), World Health Organization
      Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF), Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), and Family
      Resilience Framework. They will also be followed for one year after discharge at 1, 3, 6, and
      12 months.

      Data will be analyzed using the SPSS and SAS package. Odds ratios and hazards ratios will be
      determined for the factors that affect survival after cardiac arrest. The findings will help
      clinicians provide timely support to the patients and their families to promote physical and
      psychological well-being, and integrate them back to society as soon as possible.
