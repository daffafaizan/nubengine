      I. Determine the median progression free survival (PFS) benefit of leucovorin calcium,
      5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) naive patients treated with trifluridine and
      tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) + irinotecan + bevacizumab as compared to historic control
      groups treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate the objective response rate (ORR), median overall survival (OS), and adverse
      event (AE) profile.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2-6 and 16-20. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 2 years.
