      multiple drug resistant HIV strains have emerged, demonstrating the need for improved patient
      adherence to complex drug regimens. Individual computerized adherence systems have been
      proposed as a mechanism for improving patient adherence. This study will utilize advanced
      computer and communication technologies to produce a handheld (PDA) product for HIV/AIDS
      patients. The system serves as a patient reminder system, addresses problems of missed
      medications, and monitors severity of side effects. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      the system as an adherence intervention.

      Participants in the study will be randomized to either the intervention or a control group.
      Participants will use the PDA daily for medication reminders, alarms, adherence tracking, and
      as a source of information on HIV/AIDS. The study will last 15 weeks. Each participant will
      have 6 study interviews and 2 quality control interviews. Study interviews will include
      adherence questionnaires, blood tests for viral load and CD4 data, and quality of life
      assessments.
