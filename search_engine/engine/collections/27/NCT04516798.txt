      The subjects were vibrated while standing upright with the WBV device (PowerPlate® Pro5). The
      30, 35 and 40 Hz WBVs were applied for thirty seconds for each frequency with an amplitude of
      2 mm. In the same session, 100, 135 and 150 Hz local vibrations were applied to the right
      Achilles tendon for thirty seconds for each frequency. 100, 135 and 150 Hz local vibrations
      were then applied to the right heel for thirty seconds for each frequency with an interval of
      five seconds. Vibration stimuli were recorded accelerometers. Reflex muscle responses were
      recorded from the right soleus muscle at a sampling rate of 40 KHz. Recording electrodes were
      placed on the belly of the right soleus muscle and the ground electrode was placed on the
      right medial malleolus.

      The data were recorded with the PowerLab device, the records were processed and analyzed
      offline from the LabChart program. After the EMG records are filtered and rectified, reflex
      latencies were measured by cumulative averaging method using the accelerometer records as
      triggers (Karacan I, Cakar HI, Sebik O, Yilmaz G, Cidem M, Kara S, Türker KS.A new method to
      determine reflex latency induced by high rate stimulation of the nervous system.Front Hum
      Neurosci.2014 Jul 18; 8: 536.doi: 10.3389 / fnhum.2014.00536). After determining the Achilles
      tendon vibration reflex latency and the reflex latency induced by WBV, it was compared with
      statistical methods.
