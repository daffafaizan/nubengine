      involve splinting, steroid injections, oral steroids and ultrasounds .

      However, the results of some research studies have showed the beneficial effect of
      photobiomodulation as well as nerve and tendon gliding exercises in non-operative treatment .

      Patients were divided into two groups. The one group received low-level laser therapy (LLLT);
      the other group underwent ultrasound treatment. Additionally, nerve and gliding exercises
      were administered in both groups.

      The purpose of this trial is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ultrasound treatment and
      low-level laser therapy combined with nerve and tendon gliding exercises and to compare the
      two regimens.
