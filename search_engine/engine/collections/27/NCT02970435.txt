    
      The Primary Objective of this study is to determine if video discharge instructions, when
      added to standard of care written and verbal instructions, lead to a decrease in unnecessary
      phone calls from patients in a Mohs dermatology clinic.

      The Secondary Objectives of this study are to determine if video discharge instructions, when
      added to standard of care written and verbal instructions, help to improve patients'
      satisfaction with education materials provided by the clinic, improve patients' knowledge of
      post-operative management, improve patients' confidence in taking care of their suture site
      post-operatively, and reduce post-operative anxiety about their suture site.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial in which the impact of video discharge
      instructions on patient calls, anxiety, and confidence will be evaluated. Patients will be
      randomized using a permuted block model generated through SAS.
