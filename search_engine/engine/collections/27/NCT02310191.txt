      to CAS, 3) with signed informed consent were enrolled to the prospective study during 16
      months. All patients used dual antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] 100 mg +
      clopidogrel 75 mg per day) at least 7 days before CAS. Neurological examination and brain
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before and 24 hours after CAS in all
      patients. Venous blood samples were collected within 24 hours before CAS in all patients:
      hematology + reticulocytes, coagulation markers (PT, APTT, INR, Fbg, Clauss), vWF antigen,
      PAI-1 activity, PAI-1 polymorphism 4G/g, Multiplate (ASA and clopidogrel resistance test).
      Blood samples for the assessment of anti Xa activity were collected during CAS. T-test was
      used for statistical evaluation.
