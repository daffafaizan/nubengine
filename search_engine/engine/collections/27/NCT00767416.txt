    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, Phase 1/2a multi-center
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, viral shedding, immunogenicity, and genotypic and
      phenotypic stability of MEDI-559 in RSV seronegative infants 5 to <24 months of age and in
      infants 1 to <3 months of age regardless of baseline serostatus. The primary objective of
      this study is to describe the 28-day post-final dose safety and tolerability of three doses
      of MEDI-559 at 10^5 FFU when administered to healthy RSV seronegative children 5 to <24
      months of age and to healthy infants 1 to <3 months of age regardless of baseline serostatus.

      MEDI-559 will be administered at a dose of 10^5 fluorescent focus units (FFU) on a 0, 2, and
      4 month schedule to two cohorts of subjects in a step-wise fashion. The target sample size
      for this study is 320 subjects, with 160 subjects 5 to <24 months of age enrolled into Cohort
      1 and 160 subjects 1 to <3 months of age enrolled into Cohort 2. Each cohort will be
      randomized 1:1 (MEDI-559 to placebo) and stratified by site. Cohort 1 will initiate dosing at
      10^5 FFU MEDI-559. Blinded safety data from the first 40 subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 for
      the 28 days following administration of the first dose of vaccine will be reviewed. If no
      safety concerns are noted, Cohort 2 will initiate dosing at 10^5 FFU. Enrollment into Cohort
      2 will be halted after approximately 40 subjects have been randomized, and blinded safety
      data will be reviewed through 28 days post Dose 1. If no safety concerns are noted, the
      remainder of Cohort 2 will be enrolled. All subjects will be followed through 365 days after
      randomization to ensure that each subject has been followed through an RSV season.
