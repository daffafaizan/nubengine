    
      This is a phase II/III, non-inferiority double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of
      immunogenicity and safety with two groups of participants who will received a seasonal
      trivalent split, inactivated influenza vaccine (A/H1N1; A/H3N2 and B) or an active comparator
      (licensed influenza vaccine).

      A total of about 945 healthy Thai male and female adult volunteers 18 through 49 years of
      age; 630 participants will be randomized to receive the GPO Tri Fluvac and 315 will receive
      an active comparator (a 2:1 ratio) (inclusion of ~7% lost to follow-up).

      Safety will be assessed for all participants through Day 90 after vaccination. Immunogenicity
      will be assessed in serum samples obtained at baseline and 21 days after vaccination in a
      subset of at least 586 individuals randomized to study vaccine and 293 active comparator
      vaccine recipients.
