      recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients. Patients will receive up to 12 cycles of
      Avastin and temozolomide and cycles are continuous 28 days. Patients will receive daily
      temozolomide at a dose of 50mg/m2 and will receive Avastin every other week at a dose of
      10mg/kg. Patients will be required to have a baseline MRI within 2 weeks of starting
      treatment and a repeat MRI every 8 weeks. A total of 32 patients will be enrolled at Duke.

      Patients with recurrent malignant gliomas have a very poor prognosis, so new therapies are
      needed. Given the activity of metronomic temozolomide and the safety and activity of Avastin
      against malignant glioma, it is reasonable to study the combination in recurrent malignant
      glioma patients.
