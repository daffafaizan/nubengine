      devastating consequences. A systematic review of lower-extremity (LE) re-vascularization
      cases using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
      (ACS-NSQIP) found that 11.1% of patients were diagnosed with surgical site infections (SSI).
      Another main issue in LEB is swelling, which occurs in about 70% of these patients and leads
      to increased pressure along the leading edges of often-long wounds.

      A wide variety of methods to decrease these post-operative consequences are currently part of
      standard practice. These techniques include covering incision sites with sterile gauze
      dressing, elevating the leg, and wrapping with pressure dressings. Patients are then
      instructed to change dressings themselves at home. However, SSI rates demonstrate that these
      are only partially effective measures, and there remains room to improve post-operative
      management of infection and swelling.

      Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), over the past several years, has provided a way to
      post-operatively manage complex wounds (see device description). PICO single-use negative
      pressure dressings have been examined in previous studies. However, these were either case
      series, for chronic wounds, or for non-vascular procedures. The effectiveness of PICO versus
      standard dressings in LEB has yet to be determined in a prospective, comparative study.
      Results will indicate whether PICO should be included standard post-operative care of
      lower-extremity bypass patients. This study is designed to compare PICO and standard care,
      and determine which offers the best outcomes of decreased days to ambulation and
      post-operative wound complications.
