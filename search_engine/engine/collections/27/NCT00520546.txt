      and is - after bronchial carcinoma - their second most frequent cause of cancer-related
      death. Around 22% of all new cancer diagnoses among males are prostate-related. This
      corresponds to an age-adjusted incidence rate of nearly 100 per 100,000 males in the
      population, and to well above 40,000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer per year
      [Robert-Koch-Institut, 2010]. The dramatic increase in recent decades is attributable more to
      improved diagnostic methods and a generally increased life expectancy than to an actual
      increase in the incidence of disease [Robert-Koch-Institut, 2010].

      The total annual mortality rate is around 11,000 [Statistisches Bundesamt, 1994]. Prostate
      carcinoma is virtually unknown among men under 40 years of age. The annual prevalence rises
      with increasing age - between the 40th and 80th years of life by a factor of more than 1000.
      Autopsies have shown that among men over 70 up to 80% have a latent prostate carcinoma,
      without it being fatal [Breslow 1977; Börgemann, 2006]. The patients' average age at
      diagnosis is 71 years.

      The five-year prostate-cancer-specific survival rate after diagnosis is about 80-99% for
      tumours that are restricted to the gland itself [Porter, 2006]. For disseminated tumours this
      figure is considerably smaller, not more than 35% [von Eschenbach, 1996]. A prospect of
      complete regression exists only for non-metastasing carcinomas, but there it is quite good:
      under aggressive treatment, 90% of cancers restricted to the prostate itself can be
      completely cured, as can 50% of those that have crossed the gland's capsule [Deutsche
      Gesellschaft für Urologie, 2009].

      At present, there is a lack of adequate pre-therapeutic staging methods. This in turn often
      prevents the reliable choice of a stage-adapted therapeutic regimen, which could possibly
      offer a better prognosis even for carcinomas extending into neighbouring organs. A
      consequence of this uncertainty is that in individual cases the therapy is not ideally suited
      to the stage of disease, and the success of radiation treatment, hormonal therapy and
      chemotherapy can only approximately be matched with the stage of dissemination. Until now,
      the only reliable method for lymph-node diagnosis is operative staging by lymphadenectomy. No
      reliable diagnostic method is available by which the degree of spreading of the tumour within
      the prostate can be established.

      In this context, Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) examination with radioactively labelled
      choline appears to offer a promising primary imaging-diagnostic staging method, as indicated
      by the studies reviewed below. This diagnostic method as applied to humans was first
      described by Gauthier et al. [1985]. This was followed by two detailed reports from a
      Japanese group: Hara et al. [1997] first investigated the potential of [11C]choline in brain
      tumours and found a clear enrichment of this marker in the tumours of 24 patients, while
      normal brain tissue was not enriched with it. In a subsequent study by the same group [Hara,
      1998], the enrichment of fluorodeoxyglucose was compared with the choline uptake in the
      lesions of ten prostate-cancer patients. Thus, the choline enrichment (SUV, standardised
      uptake value) was 3.48 ± 1.31 in 43 lesions, while in the normal environment of the lesser
      pelvis the corresponding value was below 1.0. De Jong et al. [2003] investigated 67 patients,
      of whom 15 had histologically confirmed lymph-node metastases: the [11C]choline test gave a
      'true positive' result in 12 of 15 patients and a 'false negative' in 3 patients, thus
      indicating that [11C]choline PET is sufficiently sensitive and specific for the pre-operative
      staging of lymph-node metastases of prostate carcinoma. In a pre-operative staging using
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with a combined endorectal and body-phased-array coil,
      Pegios et al. [2003] investigated 42 patients with strong clinical suspicion, or with
      needle-biopsy confirmation, of prostate cancer and were able to differentiate between stages
      of extracapsular growth and seminal-vesicle infiltration (tumor stage T2 versus T3 [T2=tumor
      restricted to the gland itself; T3a=extracapsule growing of the tumor; T3b= tumor
      infiltration into the seminal-vesicles]) with an accuracy of 94-97% (sensitivity 100%,
      specificity between 87% and 93% for observers 1 and 2). The exact, local tumour stage was
      identified with an accuracy of 75%. However, for lymph-node infiltration a sensitivity of
      only 25% was achieved: one of four lymph-node-positive patients was correctly identified. In
      a more recent study, a Japanese group [Yamaguchi, 2005] investigated the application of
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      choline-PET in 20 patients with needle-biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. The PET imaging
      achieved a sensitivity of 100%, NMR (quotient [(creatine + choline) / citrate]) 65% and
      unsupported MRI 60%. For 16 patients radical prostatectomy was performed; results correlated
      with those of pre-operative local staging with PET by 81%, and with MRI by 50%. The site of
      choline uptakes in PET was visualised by MRI using the distance of the prostate from the
      femoral head and the pubic symphysis.At present, no data relevant for the present study
      indication are available on the software-fused imaging by combined PET/MRI. The combination
      of high-resolution endorectal MRI with functional PET imaging could come to offer a decisive
      advantage in the staging of prostate carcinoma. The present study was designed to test this
      in an appropriate patient population.

      A system combining PET and MRI was recently granted approval in the U.S.A. by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration [FDA, 2011].
