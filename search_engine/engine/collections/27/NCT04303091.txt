      multiple myeloma (MM), the aggressive nature of the disease and these corresponding agents
      can have a debilitating impact on quality of life (QOL). Exercise can help manage symptoms
      and enhance QOL in cancer survivors, however relatively little is known regarding the
      feasibility or benefits of exercise in MM. The purpose of this study was to examine the
      feasibility of a group- and home-based exercise intervention for individuals with advanced
      MM. In this single arm study, advanced MM patients (DS stage II-III) participated in a
      12-week aerobic and resistance training intervention, with the option of palliative care
      consultation. Participants attended once weekly supervised group exercise classes and
      received individually tailored home exercise booklets. Validated measures of physical
      functioning and patient-reported outcomes, including QOL, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and
      self-compassion were obtained at baseline and 12-weeks (post-intervention). Optional
      semi-structured interviews were conducted halfway (week 6) and at the end of the intervention
      (week 12)
