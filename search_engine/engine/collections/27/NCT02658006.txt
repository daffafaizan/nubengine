        1. To determine if right ventricular pressure tracings correlate with other indices of
           right ventricular failure and with positive fluid balance, renal failure and increased
           length of stay in the intensive care unit.

        2. To determine the prevalence of portal vein pulsatility in the perioperative period and
           its association with right ventricular failure and positive fluid balance.

        3. To determine if Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) values correlate with mixed venous
           oxygen saturation (SvO2) and with poorer post-operative prognosis.

        4. To determine the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of respiratory complications of
           cardiac surgery using transthoracic ultrasonography.
