      women experiencing some type of residual pain and even 13% characterizing it as severe. Poor
      acute postoperative pain control is not only associated with development of chronic pain, but
      has also been shown to be associated with delayed wound healing. Therefore, optimization of
      postoperative pain control is paramount not just for patient comfort, but to decrease
      immediate and long-term postoperative complications.

      There are two adjunctive modes of perioperative pain control currently in use at Columbia
      University Medical Center (CUMC). The first mode uses pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF)
      and consists of a noninvasive device placed over dressings around the surgical site. The
      second is a regional anesthetic and -the pectoral interfascial block (PIB) in which a
      long-lasting local anesthetic (bupivacaine/ropivacaine) is injected into the surgical
      dissection area. Both of these techniques for postoperative analgesia have been shown to be
      effective in different types of breast surgery, but there is no current literature comparing
      the two modalities in their efficacy in reducing postoperative pain. There is also no current
      literature in their efficacy in the mastectomy and tissue expander patient population. The
      proposed trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of these two modalities of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing mastectomy
      and tissue expander reconstruction.
