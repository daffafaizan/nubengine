    
      JNJ-73763989 is a liver-targeted antiviral therapeutic for subcutaneous injection designed to
      treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection via ribonucleic acid interference mechanism.
      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of JNJ-73763989 in HBV
      infected patients who are co-infected with HDV. The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 will
      evaluate safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of JNJ-73763989 + NA while Part 2 will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the JNJ-73763989 + NA regimen in the treatment of HBV/HDV
      co-infection. Each part includes 3 phases: Screening phase (from 4 Week up to maximum of 8
      weeks), Intervention phase (144 Week for Arm A and 148 Week for Arm B) and Follow-up phase
      (48 Week). The duration of individual study participation will be between 196 and 204 weeks.
      Safety and tolerability (including adverse events [AEs] and Serious AEs, laboratory
      assessments, electrocardiogram [ECG], vital signs, physical examination), efficacy (including
      HDV ribonucleic acid [RNA], HBV deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and antigens) , and
      pharmacokinetics will be assessed throughout the study.
