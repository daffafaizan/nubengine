    
      Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)is a severe early onset retinal degeneration. Diagnosis is
      usually made during the first few months of life in infants who present with severely
      impaired vision, abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) and abnormal electroretinograms (ERG)
      indicating decreased retinal function. There is an inevitable progression to total blindness
      in these individuals due to death of photoreceptor cells. There is presently no treatment for
      this disease. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability
      of subretinal administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2 to subjects with LCA due to confirmed biallelic
      RPE65 mutations. The secondary objective is to assess the objective clinical measures of
      efficacy in human subjects.
