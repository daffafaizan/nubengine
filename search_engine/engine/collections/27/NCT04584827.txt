      craniotomy, their medical histories, demographic features, comorbidities, preoperative
      radiotherapy treatment, the parameters examined in the preoperative routine will be collected
      as a file scan (previous operations, GKS, laboratory values). The classification of patients
      according to the 2016 World Health Organization Central Classification of Nervous System
      Tumors (WHO-CNS classification) and whether it is glial or non glial will be recorded from
      the clinical file. Intraoperative; hemodynamic data of patients; heart rate, diastolic,
      systolic and mean arterial pressures, fluid and blood products delivered, anesthetic and
      other medications, and blood gas samples will be written from the anesthesia document after
      the operation is finished. For the study, the application of the anesthesiologist for the
      patient will not be interfered. If postoperative patients are sent to the intensive care
      unit, their laboratory values and clinical observations (mortality, morbidity, neurological
      sequelae, imaging techniques, GOSE (Glasgow outcome skale)) will be recorded. In our study,
      mortality and morbidity will be evaluated 30 days postoperatively, and if the patient was
      sent to the service from the intensive care unit in this process, the values in the
      postoperative clinic (mortality, morbidity, neurological evaluation, imaging techniques,
      pathology results) will be recorded from the patient document. If the patient was discharged
      30 days before, outpatient data will be recorded. The patients will be classified by
      evaluating the collected data (intraoperative hemodynamic data, blood transfusions,
      postoperative neurological sequel, postoperative complications and mortality).

      In our study; the effects of lactate level on mortality and morbidity will be investigated in
      patients undergoing an intracranial mass operation with general anesthesia.
