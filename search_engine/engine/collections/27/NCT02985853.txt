      improvements of glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) following gastric bypass
      Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery (GBP). The central hypotheses are: 1) that surgical changes in
      the anatomy of nutrient absorption achieved by GBP change incretin hormone secretion which in
      turn improves pancreatic islet function; and 2) that improvement in insulin secretion induced
      by the changes in incretin function, together with improvement in insulin resistance induced
      by weight loss, normalize glucose homeostasis in type 2 DM.

      Funds are not available to pay for the surgery for patients, only to address research
      questions.
