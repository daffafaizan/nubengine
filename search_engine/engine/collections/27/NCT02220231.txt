      excision of mediastinal mass instead of open thymectomy. The iatrogenic capnothorax with
      one-lung ventilation during VATET may cause hemodynamic instability due to the compression of
      intrathoracic structures. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of capnothorax
      on the pulmonary blood flow and cardiac function during the VATET by using the
      transesophageal echocardiography
