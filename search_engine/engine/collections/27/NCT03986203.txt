      bones. Bone cells have been shown to be responsive to different forms of applied energy,
      which can be used to reduce the progression of age-related declines in bone properties. The
      purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Spry Belt
      when used regularly over one year. The Spry Belt, a medical device that is worn around the
      hips like a belt, provides energy to the user's skeleton with the goal of improving bone
      quality in postmenopausal women with osteopenia, or low bone mass.

      In this randomized, controlled study, all participants will receive the Spry Belt for at-home
      use over the 12 month study. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the active or
      sham/placebo treatment group and give a Spry Belt that is pre-programmed to deliver the
      corresponding therapy. Participants will self-administer treatment sessions at least 5 times
      per week for 12 months. The effectiveness of the Spry Belt treatment will be assessed via CT
      and DXA scans of the user's bones to evaluate changes in bone density and strength over the
      study duration.
