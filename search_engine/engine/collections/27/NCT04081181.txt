      patients are either diagnosed at an advanced stage or are unfit for surgery due to medical
      co_morbidities or poor underlying lung reserve , less than a third of all lung cancer
      patients can undergo surgical resection .

      Lung metastasectomy is considered a therapeutic option increasing the survival rate for
      patients of pulmonary metastases but only 25%_30% of patients benefits from lung
      metastasectomy due to multiplicity of pulmonary nodules or medical co_ morbidities .

      In spite of a significant improvement of lung cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy in recent
      years , the overall clinical outcome is less than satisfactory compared with that brought by
      surgical resection .Thus , it is urgent to provide a method which is more effective than
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy and nearly effective as the surgical treatment for the patients
      who are not eligible for surgery.

      Local thermal ablation therapy of the tumor is the focus of recent research in the past
      decades .This method is to deliver specific energy into the tumor tissue under the guidance
      of image technology , which make the local tissue quickly reach 60Â°C where an irreversible
      coagulative necrosis happens leading to necrosis of tumor cells .

      CT_guided Microwave ablation is a minimally invasive technique that may be an alternative
      treatment option for management of lung cancer in patients who are not candidate for surgery
      .This method not only kill the insitu lung cancer cells , but also protect lung cancer tissue
      .It can produce large volumes of cellular necrosis with reduced procedure time , can use
      multiple antennae and can be used in lesions with cystic component and/or in proximity to
      vascular structures.

      Thus, CT guided microwave ablation is a promising new technique that is convenient ,easy
      ,causing less trauma ,associated with no need for general anaesthesia , fast recovery and
      less complications.
