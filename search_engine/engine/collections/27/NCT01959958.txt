      nocturnal enuresis in regard to health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral
      functioning, family functioning, stressful life events, sociodemographic factors and medical
      factors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to intervention implementation for nocturnal
      enuresis.

      In this study, children and adolescents with sickle cell disease ages 6-18 years and their
      parents/guardians will each complete an interview with questionnaires assessing nocturnal
      enuresis, health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral functioning, family
      functioning, and stressful life events. Participants who report nocturnal enuresis will
      identify interventions they have used in the past, along with barriers to intervention
      implementation.

      The future goal will be to use this information to develop an effective intervention strategy
      for nocturnal enuresis specific to the needs of children and adolescents with sickle cell
      disease.
