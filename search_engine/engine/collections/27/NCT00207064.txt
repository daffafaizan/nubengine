      have been treated for 6 months with a combined 5-HT2A- and dopamine D2- receptor blocker. We
      have chosen the atypical antipsychotic compound, quetiapine, for the present study since this
      drug is characterized by a fast koff/low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors. The purpose
      of the study is to examine pathophysiological and neuropsychological mechanisms - not
      treatment effects. We want to characterize neurobiological and functional endophenotypes or
      vulnerability indicators and to study their stability over time and their relation to
      treatment and contemporary psychopathology. To the extent that candidate endophenotypes can
      be characterized as stable and independent of treatment and contemporary psychopathology they
      will be analysed together with similar findings from previous (identical)cohorts of
      schizophrenic patients. Specific disturbances will also be related to candidate genes for
      schizophrenia.
