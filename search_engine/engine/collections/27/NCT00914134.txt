      increasing prevalence because of aging population. The main symptoms include rigidity,
      hypokinesia, tremor and impaired balance, but the disease also causes autonomic dysfunction.
      Motor fluctuations are common treatment related problems in PD, around 50-70% of patients
      treated with levodopa finally develop motor fluctuations. Continuous duodenal levodopa
      infusion has been effective in the treatment of motor dysfunction in advanced PD. However,
      little is known of its effects on autonomic nervous system.
