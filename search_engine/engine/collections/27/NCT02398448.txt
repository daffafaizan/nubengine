    
      In this study, a single oral dose of ZyloprimÂ® (300 mg tablet) and 3 separate single oral
      doses of 300 mg allopurinol test formulations (Regimens B, C and D) will be administered
      sequentially to each subject on separate occasions. Following the administration of Regimens
      B and C, there will be a period of interim analysis during which the PK data will be reviewed
      to determine the formulation within the process design space that provides the desired in
      vitro dissolution variant for dosing in the subsequent study period.
