      document benefits this program may have for older adults and also provide additional evidence
      that further confirms the importance of exercise for the older adult population. Exercise has
      the potential to reduce falls, injuries, emergency room visits, surgeries, insurance costs,
      and improve the overall quality of life in the older adult population. If the RSVP Bone
      Builders proves to be beneficial for older adults, the program could be recommended by
      healthcare and exercise professionals for their patients and clients who are at risk for
      falls.
