    
      In a 24-week randomized controlled trial based in a primary care outpatient clinic, the study
      will recruit 60 patients on moderate to high dose chronic opioid therapy for whom providers
      recommend opioid tapering and randomize 1:1 to an opioid tapering protocolized intervention
      (TapPro) or to usual care. Over six months, participants in the TapPro arm will visit with a
      clinician in the clinic and on the telephone on a biweekly basis in order to facilitate
      opioid prescribing and tapering and a pain self-care and coping curriculum. In the control
      arm, participants will see their primary care providers as per usual and decisions on opioid
      prescribing and tapering will be made by the primary care providers. Participants will be
      assessed throughout the study with questionnaires, urine drug screens, prescription database
      review, and medical record review.
