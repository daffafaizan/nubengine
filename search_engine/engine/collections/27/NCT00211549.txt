      safety of and to identify the dose(s) of IDEA-033 that will provide a minimum clinically
      meaningful effect for treating the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. This
      study will also compare the safety profile of the three doses of IDEA-033 in treating the
      signs and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis for 12 weeks. The primary hypothesis is
      that at least one of the three doses of IDEA-033 is superior to placebo with respect to three
      primary efficacy endpoints of WOMAC Pain, WOMAC Physical Function, and Subject Global
      Assessment of Response to Therapy. A second hypothesis is that there is an increase in
      efficacy with increasing doses of IDEA-033.

      Patients will receive one of five treatments for 12 weeks:Three doses of IDEA-033, or
      naproxen 1 g over-encapsulated tablet + placebo or placebo
