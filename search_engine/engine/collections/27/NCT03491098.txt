      comparing its results with that of oral steroids and that of nasal saline spray.

      Sixty patients (4-12) years aged children with OME over a period for two months will be
      included in this study. Informed written consent will obtained from the parents of patient
      studied after explanation of the research purpose.

      Patient diagnosed clinically to have OME with type B tympanogram and conductive hearing loss
      will be enrolled in our study.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patients previously managed by ventilation tube.

        2. Those who had cleft palate. The patients were divided into three equal groups. In group
           1, 20 patients will be received steroids spray, for. 2 months In group 2, 20 patients
           will be received steroids for 1 month In group 3, 20 patients will be receive hypertonic
           sea water solution Otoscopic examination, basic audiological evaluation including pure
           tone audiometry, and immittancemetry will be performed before treatment and repeated at
           3 and 6 months after treatment. The evaluation was performed using ORBITR 922 VERSION2 .
           Examiners will be blinded to the type of treatment.

      Tympanometry results were distinguished into four grades as classified by El-Anwar et al12:
      type A, normal curve (pressure 50/_99 H2O); type C1 (negative pressure _100/_199 mm H2O);
      type C2 (negative pressure _200/_394 mm H2O); type B (flat curve).2,3,11 The average hearing
      thresholds at 500 Hz and 1, 2, and 4 kHz were used in the statistical comparison.

      Follow-up clinical examinations were done once per week for 3 weeks, at the end of treatment.
      The efficacy of nasal steroid for management of OME was compared with that of oral steroid
      and that of nasal sinomarin spray as placebo.
