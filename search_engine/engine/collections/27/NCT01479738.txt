      distal articulation was mainly with the base of the third metacarpal and partially with the
      base of the second metacarpal. The articulation was slightly flattened with a convex and
      concave dorsal articular surface. The contour stimulates our imagination and creativity to
      use a portion of the articular surface for PIP arthroplasty.
