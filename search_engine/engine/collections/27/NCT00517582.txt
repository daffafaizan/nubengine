      painful swelling beneath the skin around the eyes, lips, tongue, throat, hands, or feet. In
      severe cases, the throat may swell, obstructing the airway and leading to breathing
      difficulty. ACE inhibitors prevent the breakdown of a natural chemical in the body called
      bradykinin. Increased levels of bradykinin, which can cause swelling, may contribute to the
      development of angioedema. Blocking bradykinin receptor cells prevents bradykinin from
      initiating swelling and may lead to a possible decrease in angioedema symptoms. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of HOE-140, a bradykinin receptor blocker, at
      reducing symptoms in people with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.

      This study will enroll people admitted to the emergency room or hospital who have a severe
      case of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive an injection of either HOE-140 or placebo. Initially, participants will undergo an
      electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart. Then blood pressure
      measurements, blood collection, a physical exam to determine the extent and duration of
      swelling, and photographs of the swelling will occur at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours following
      the start of treatment. Questionnaires will be completed by study staff and participants to
      assess changes in angioedema symptoms and the extent of swelling. Participants will remain in
      the hospital for 24 to 48 hours, depending on the severity of their symptoms. Blood will be
      collected at a follow-up visit that will occur 7 days after the resolution of angioedema
      symptoms.
