      recommended, though rarely investigated. In recent years, multidisciplinary memory clinics
      (MCs) for patients with dementia have been established in many places over the world. These
      services have recently also been criticised for being principally hospital-based, for their
      apparently limited focus that entails only medical diagnostics and pharmacotherapy and for
      thus diverting resources from community mental health teams(CMHTs) .On the other hand, CMHTs
      are mainly concerned with the provision and organisation of integrated care, and unlike MCs,
      CMHTs generally have limited access to hospital-based diagnostics such as brain-imaging.

      In April 2002, an outpatient diagnostic facility, the Diagnostic Observation Centre for
      PsychoGeriatric patients (DOC-PG) was established in Maastricht, the Netherlands. DOC-PG
      combines the hospital-based approach of the MC with the care-oriented approach of the
      regional CMHT and aims to provide the general practitioner (GP) with elaborate diagnostic and
      therapeutic advice for patients with cognitive disorders.

      Comparison: DOC-PG is compared with usual care i.e. the GP took care of the diagnosis, or he
      or she referred the patient to one of the separate regional services, e.g. the Maastricht
      Memory Clinic (MMC), geriatric medicine, or the department of mental health for the elderly
      of the mental health community service (CMHT).
