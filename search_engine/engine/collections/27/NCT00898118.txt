      Primary

        -  To study hematopoietic chimerism in whole blood and different cell populations (i.e.,
           CD14, CD15, CD 56, CD3, and CD19) as well as in dendritic cells and regulatory T cells
           after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity
           conditioning in patients with refractory cytopenia.

        -  To compare the results of chimerism obtained with standard short tandem nucleotide
           polymorphism PCR (sensitivity 1%) with those obtained with single nucleotide
           polymorphisms PCR (sensitivity 0.1- 0.01%).

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the relationship between mixed chimerism and hematological engraftment,
           overall survival, and event-free survival.

        -  To study the impact of mixed chimerism in plasmacytoid dendritic and regulatory T cells
           on the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Peripheral blood is collected from patients and donors prior to hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). Patients also undergo blood sample collection on days 30, 60, 100,
      and 180 after transplantation. Peripheral blood cells are enriched and separated into
      lineage-specific subpopulations (i.e., CD3, CD14, CD15, CD19, and CD56) which are then
      divided equally for either DNA isolation via PCR or for flow cytometry. DNA concentrations in
      pre-HSCT donor and patient samples and in post-HSCT subpopulation samples are determined
      using quantitative real-time PCR. Samples are also analyzed for quantification of chimerism
      and detection of genetic markers via short tandem repeats- and sequence nucleotide
      polymorphism-based chimerism analyses.
