      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and associated nail toxicities. The
      therapeutic intervention will involve patients wearing an Elasto-Gel cold glove and sock on
      one hand and one foot (both on the right side or both on the left side). The patients will
      wear the glove and sock during each infusion of taxane chemotherapy.
