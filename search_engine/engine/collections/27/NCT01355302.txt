      Phase Ib: a safety run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with fixed
      doses of Cisplatin and Capecitabine. This phase will enroll approximately 10 to 15 patients.

        -  Phase II: a randomized 2-arm design which will enroll 80 patients.

      In the phase II portion, Patients will receive study treatment , E7050 in combination with
      Cisplatin and Capecitabine versus Cisplatin and Capecitabine Alone) for approximately six
      21-day cycles (18 weeks). Beyond 18 weeks, patients who are experiencing clinical benefit may
      continue E7050, with or without Capecitabine (Arm 1), or may continue Capecitabine alone (Arm
      2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm. Patients will continue treatment
      for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated, until the
      occurrence of progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or
      withdrawal by investigator, whichever occurs first. Patients will participate in either phase
      Ib or phase II.
