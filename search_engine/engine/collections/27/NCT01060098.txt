      ankylosing spondylitis are potentially disabling conditions which cause joint pain, swelling
      and deformity and treatments are aimed at preventing these complications. Although treatment
      has improved with the advent of anti TNF alpha therapies, up to 30% of patients fail to
      respond to this treatment and in others, treatment is associated with significant side
      effects. The precise mechanisms of this remain unclear. In addition, there are no sensitive
      methods available to monitor or predict disease response to treatment aside from testing
      inflammatory markers in the blood. Understanding the mechanism of action and what governs
      response to anti TNF therapy will allow development of more specific therapies for
      inflammatory arthritis. Work in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis has characterised a
      novel cell type, Th17 cells, important in the inflammatory cascade which are affected in a
      particular way by anti TNF therapies and may underpin their mechanism of action and side
      effects.
