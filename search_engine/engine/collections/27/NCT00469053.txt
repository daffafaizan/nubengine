      transdermal patch (Reference) after multiple patch application. Pharmacokinetic target
      parameters are AUCss, and Css,max.

      Further: To assess the safety, tolerability, skin tolerability and adhesiveness of the patch
      applications. To evaluate the following further Pharmacokinetic parameters: Css,min, Css,ave,
      PTF, Swing, tss,max, and t1/2,z
