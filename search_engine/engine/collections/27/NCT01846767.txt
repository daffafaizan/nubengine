      - Non diabetic participants will be recruited from within the National University of Ireland,
      Galway student and staff community. Diabetic patients will be recruited from University
      College Hospital, Galway in collaboration with their hospital consultant.

      Test- day

      - They will undergo two separate, identical and simultaneous Oral Glucose Tolerance test and
      13C-glucose breath tests on two separate occasions after an overnight fast of 12 hours
      starting at 8pm. On arrival their heart rate, blood pressure, height and weight will be
      recorded. Following a resting period of 10 minutes, samples will be obtained for fasting
      glucose and breath enrichment values (at t = -20 and -10mins). At t = 0 min, participants
      will consume a standard glucose solution. This glucose solution will consist of 150mg of
      13C-glucose, 74.85g of glucose and 200ml of water and 25ml of orange flavoring. Breath
      samples will be obtained immediately after consumption of test solution and repeated every 15
      min over a 4-h interval. Blood glucose concentrations will be taken every 15 min starting at
      t = 15 min, over a 2-h interval and every 30 min for another 2-h interval. Participants will
      remain at rest throughout the study.

      Sample size assessment

      - Target recruitment is 40 non-diabetics and 40 diabetic participants. This study will use a
      Student's t-test to determine difference, or otherwise, in glucose oxidation in breath 13CO2,
      in 2 different groups of individuals. With power arbitrarily set at 0.8, effect size of 1.21
      reduction in breath, and Alpha set at 0.01 a final number of 35 participants is required for
      each group. The n=40 for each group is set to allow a 5 participant drop out in each group
      Dillon et al (2009).
