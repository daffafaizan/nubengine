      simultaneous implant placement. While, study group undergo for graftless sinus lift using
      AMBE through small antrostomy with simultaneous implant placement. the aim of the study is
      assessment the effect of antrostomy size on bone formation in graftless sinus lift with
      simultaneous implant placement.

      CBCT will be done before and after the surgery and after 6 months to assess of amount bone
      gain in mm.

      implant stability after 6 months will be determined by using Osstell. Primary outcome: amount
      of bone gain which will be measured by using linear measurement from CBCT.

      secondary outcome: stability of implant by using osstell
