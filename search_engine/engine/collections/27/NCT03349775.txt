      condition called pulmonary hypertension, Pulmonary hypertension in turn, can lead to
      shortness of breath and other health complications such as heart failure. In this study, we
      seek to identify individuals at risk for the development of high pressures inside lung
      vessels based on BMI and dyspnea grade 1.

      Participants will be screened by echocardiography to estimate pulmonary pressures. Potential
      participants will undergo invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing with hemodynamic
      monitoring, in order to identify individuals with abnormal pulmonary vascular function either
      at rest or during exercise. Patients who have undergone clinically-indicated cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will also be recruited. Those with
      abnormal pulmonary vascular function will be randomized to receive Metformin or placebo for a
      total of 3 months under an IND exemption. The primary outcomes include the effect on
      pulmonary vascular function at rest and during exercise. Secondary outcomes include change in
      pulmonary artery endothelial cell phenotypes.
