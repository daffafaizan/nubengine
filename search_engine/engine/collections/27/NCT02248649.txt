      Progressive cognitive impairment leading to dementia is an important component of Parkinson's
      disease (PD), contributing to significant levels of disability. The number of Veterans who
      will develop PD and, in turn, the number of Veterans with PD who develop dementia is likely
      to increase substantially. Given the profound negative health and social consequences
      associated with the development of dementia, it is critical to identify interventions that
      effectively slow the decline of cognitive function to prolong the time to onset of dementia.
      Based on the results of prior studies, physical activity is one of the few nonpharmacological
      interventions that holds promise in slowing cognitive decline.

      Objective:

      The investigators hypothesize that a home-based physical activity intervention to promote
      walking will reduce cognitive decline in Veterans with mild cognitive impairment in PD
      (PD-MCI).

      Methods:

      The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial of a home-based walking intervention,
      evaluating effects on cognitive function. Community-dwelling Veterans with PD-MCI will be
      randomized to a walking intervention or a health education control intervention. Subjects
      will be male and female Veterans with a physician diagnosis of idiopathic, typical PD, with
      at least 2 of 3 cardinal signs of PD, response to dopaminergic medication, and MCI. The
      interventions will last 18 months.
