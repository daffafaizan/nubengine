      in compare to placebo.

      Plenty of women suffer from SUI. It is a condition in which involuntary urine leakage occurs
      during exercise. This condition affects about 40% of all women and causes huge disturbance to
      daily life. There are plenty of risk factors, such as age, obesity and parity. We assume that
      the pathophysiology is related to hypermobility of the urethra due to damage to the
      surrounding tissue.

      The treatment options vary from surgical interventional to conservative, each treatment has
      its own success rate and risk factors. An attempt to find effective treatment option has been
      made.

      The use of laser for various gynecologic conditions are at rise. ERBIUM type laser works on
      the lamina propria layer and causes rejuvenation probably by strengthening collagen
      structures and creating new ones.

      The efficacy and safety of vaginal laser therapy has been proven already, but in the field of
      SUI the numbers in each study were low and there was no control group.

      In this study we desire to examine the effect of vaginal ERBIUM treatment on SUI in compare
      to placebo.

      this is a randomized single blind control trial. 40 women will be included in the research
      group and 40 in the placebo group. Women will be assigned randomly to each group. They will
      be treated with vaginal laser probe, three treatments 4 weeks apart. Follow up visits will be
      performed 3, 6, and 12 months after the first treatment.

      Effectiveness evaluation will be done by physical urodynamic examination before treatment and
      6 month after finishing, by 24 hours pad test' cough test and by fulfilling questionnaires-
