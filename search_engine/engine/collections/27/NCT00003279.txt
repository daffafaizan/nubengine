      of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the safety of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine progression-free survival and quality of life of
      these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%), and response to first-line combined
      modality treatment (complete vs partial). Within 3-7 weeks after completion of prior
      induction chemoradiotherapy, responding patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm
      I: Patients receive best supportive care and are observed until disease progression is
      documented. Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant monoclonal antibody BEC2 and BCG intradermally
      on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10. Treatment consists of 5 vaccinations over a period of
      10 to 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of
      life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 6, 12, and 24, and then every 6 months thereafter.
      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
