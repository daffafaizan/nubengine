      parallel with standard of care treatment, can improve overall quality of life (QoL) for MM
      patients. This program will be delivered to the study participants by multiple modes of
      communication including written material in a boxed pack, online tutorials, telephone and
      text message follow up. If they do not have online access at home, the study coordinators
      will arrange access for the participants at the Clinic. A health advisor will work with the
      physicians to coordinate their participation in the program while they are on active
      treatment for myeloma. The Pack Health Advisors will only give them guidance about the study
      and they will not provide any kind of clinical advice to the participants.
