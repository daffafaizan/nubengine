      exact number of days of use to be consumed orally. Collection of total non-stimulated saliva
      and dental biofilm will be performed at the beginning of the study (before tablet
      consumption) and 7 days after the intervention. Saliva samples from each individual will be
      collected in separate containers as well as the biofilm samples, both at baseline and after 7
      days, for both types of pellets and both tests. All individuals (n=300) will use the tablet
      with and without propolis, respecting interval of 30 days without consumption of any other
      tablet or substance containing propolis and/or xylitol.
