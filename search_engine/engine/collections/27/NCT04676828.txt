      with lung cancer in a clinical setting. Functional avoidance radiotherapy is a new method
      that protect highly functional lung tissue from radiation, while delivering high dose
      radiotherapy to the lung tumour. Radiotherapy is usually based on a CT scan that does not
      account for functional variations in the lungs. Therefore, I hypothesize that using
      functional distribution in the lungs and avoiding irradiation of highly functional lung will
      improve treatment outcome for individual patients with lung cancer.

      The objective of my project is to determine if functional image guided radiotherapy
      (functional avoidance radiotherapy) improves toxicity outcomes for patients with lung cancer
      undergoing curative chemo-radiotherapy in a prospective clinical trial.

      To reach this objective, the impact of functional avoidance radiotherapy on pulmonary
      toxicity measured by the incidence and severity of radiation-induced lung disease shall be
      assessed. Additionally, loco-regional control, time to progression, overall survival, quality
      of life and radiation-induced molecular response in patients treated with functional
      avoidance radiotherapy shall be assessed and compared to patients receiving standard
      treatment.
