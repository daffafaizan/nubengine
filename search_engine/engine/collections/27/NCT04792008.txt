    
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of an investigational product, YQ23, in patients with
      Critical Limb Ischaemia (CLI) during a follow-up period of 12 months.

      Fifty-one patients are planned for enrolment. The study consists of a screening period (up to
      28 days), a double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up (12 months). Prior to
      randomisation, patients diagnosed with CLI will be stratified into:

        -  Group of patients in whom revascularisation is not planned

        -  Group of patients with planned revascularisation

      Within each group, patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive single intravenous
      infusion of YQ23 120 mg/kg and normal saline, respectively at the study site.

      On the day of YQ23 administration, the patient will be admitted to the study site on Day 1
      and will be discharged on Day 3. The total duration of participation in the study for each
      patient is approximately 13 months. Data on the study endpoints will be collected from
      baseline (pre-dose on Day 1), Day 3, Month 1, 6 and up to 12 months after study treatment
      infusion.
