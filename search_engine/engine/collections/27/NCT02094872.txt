      I. To determine the difference in best overall response rate (BORR) between patients treated
      with MEK162 following personalized molecularly guided assignment vs. a historical BORR of 7%
      in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of performing individualized drug therapy (including novel agents
      and commercially-available agents) in the context of a personalized medicine clinical trial.

      II. To define the difference in progression free survival (PFS) between patients treated with
      MEK162 following personalized molecularly guided assignment vs. a historical PFS rate of 2
      months in this patient population.

      III. To continually assess data in real time so as to iteratively refine and standardize a
      set of statistical and informatics methodologies for matching treatments to the patient's
      tumor, based on the molecular profile.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis via sequencing. Based on the results of the DNA and RNA
      analysis, patients receive molecularly targeted therapy. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
