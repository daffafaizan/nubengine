      randomize them to 12 weeks of either Behavioral Activation Treatment for Cardiac Smokers
      (BAT-CS) or control condition (including contact match). BAT-CS interventions will focus on
      smoking cessation and mood management, while the control condition will focus on smoking
      cessation and general health education. Both groups will be offered the nicotine patch if
      medically safe. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at end-of-treatment (12 weeks
      post-discharge for index event), and 6, 9, and 12 months after hospital discharge. The
      occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality will be tracked for up to
      60 months post discharge.
