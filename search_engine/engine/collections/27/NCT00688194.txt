      Primary

        -  To compare the progression-free survival of postmenopausal women with progressive
           metastatic breast cancer treated with fulvestrant with or without lapatinib tosylate
           and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To compare time to progression in these patients.

        -  To compare overall survival of these patients.

        -  To compare response rates in these patients.

        -  To compare clinical benefit rates in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to timing of
      progressive disease (during adjuvant therapy vs > 12 months after completion of adjuvant
      therapy vs during treatment for metastatic disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 0, 14, and 28 of course
           1 and on day 1 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive oral placebo once daily
           on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fulvestrant and placebo as in arm I. Patients also receive
           aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy (e.g., exemestane, anastrozole, or letrozole) according
           to standard treatment regulations.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I and oral lapatinib tosylate once daily
           on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I and lapatinib as in arm III. Patients
           also receive AI therapy according to standard treatment regulations.
