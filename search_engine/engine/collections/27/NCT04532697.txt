      of MCI. However, up to now, there exists no clinical data to support the use of
      U.rhynchophylla for MCI. To evaluate the efficacy of U. rhynchophylla for MCI, the
      investigator will use a fully automatic retinal image analysis (ARIA) method to estimate the
      WMH and use this as one of the outcome measures.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a Chinese herbal
      preparation U. rhynchophylla for subjects with mild cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized
      that treatment with U. rhynchophylla is able to significantly improve the cognitive function
      of subjects with MCI and reduce the white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the brain of these
      subjects.

      All eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a treatment of either Uncaria
      rhynchophylla or placebo for 16 weeks followed by 8 weeks observation. All subjects, both of
      the intervention and control group, will receive standard routine care from the conventional
      healthcare system.
