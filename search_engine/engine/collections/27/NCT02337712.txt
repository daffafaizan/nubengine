    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine whether once-daily (qd)simultaneous modulated
      accelerated thoracic radiotherapy resulted in better survival than twice-daily(bid) RT for
      patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC).

      All patients receive four to six cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) every 3 weeks.
      Thoracic RT is initiated with cycle 1-3 of chemotherapy. Qd RT includes the delivery of 65 Gy
      in 26 fractions delivered on weekdays for a total of 33 days. Bid RT includes the delivery of
      45 Gy in 30 fractions delivered on weekdays for a total of 19 days. After the chest RT and
      the last cycle of EP, prophylactic cranial irradiation is administered to those patients with
      a complete or partial remission.
