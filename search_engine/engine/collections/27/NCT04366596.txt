      with open surgery or endovascular intervention. Open surgery has relatively high complication
      rate. Endovascular intervention is micro-invasive but with high restenosis rate. Drug eluting
      balloon(DEB) has been demonstrated to be effective for preventing restenosis in peripheral
      arteries. This study aims to test the efficacy of drug eluting balloon for
      non-atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. The intervention group will be treated with
      paclitaxel eluting balloon. The control group will be treated with plain old balloon. The
      primary endpoint is efficacy of blood pressure control.
