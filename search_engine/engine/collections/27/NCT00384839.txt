      (Days 1- 5) of each 28-day cycle. Complete androgen ablation will be continued. Response will
      be assessed after a minimum of 2 cycles (evaluable patients). PSA response will be evaluated
      prior to each cycle and % fetal hemoglobin will be evaluated prior to each odd cycle
      (excluding Cycle 1). Patients will be treated until clinical progression up to a maximum of
      12 cycles. A total of 35 patients with advanced metastatic HRPC will be enrolled in this
      trial.
