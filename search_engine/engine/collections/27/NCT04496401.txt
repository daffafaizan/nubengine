      Tacrolimus will be started on the day of surgery (or on the day after) according to Nantes
      local standard doses and practices. After a stable trough level is achieved (on postoperative
      day 7-10) the first PK profile will be measured. Subsequently, the switch to ENVARSUS® will
      be performed (initial dose of 0.17 mg/kg/day) on a single morning oral dosage regimen. A
      second PK profile will be measured, 7 days after initiation of ENVARSUS®. All these PK
      measurements will take place during the post-operative recovery in the hospital (typically
      2-3 weeks). All patients will receive Thymoglobulin or Alemtuzumab induction, Myfortic or
      Cellcept (or generics), with or without prednisone according to local practices.
      Anti-infectious prophylaxis will be given according to Nantes local practices.
