      PARADIGM-HF.

      A T wave alternans (TWA) is an electrophysiological phenomenon that acts as an independent
      predictor of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias in postinfarct myocardial.

      TWA is measured by using a special software and electrodes during a treadmill test, that
      analyse small changes in the microvolt of the T wave consecutive with a complex algorithm in
      three dimensions. The TWA could be negative (normal), positive (pathological) or
      indeterminate. If a TWA is pathological it reflects an electric instability in
      depolarization.

      Our hypothesis is that the treatment with Sacubitril-Valsartan in heart failure patients with
      reduced ejection fraction, could improved the TWA.
