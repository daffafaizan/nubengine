      self-developed manual technique for treating injuries of the musculoskeletal system
      especially of the knee by applying high pressure to the skin in the area of the injury. This
      pressure is applied in various amplitudes and frequencies.

      International top athletes from various disciplines reported a rapid pain relief, and even
      full recovery, immediately after his one hour treatment.

      Prior to the investigators' study, the investigators evaluated one pilot patient with a
      complete ACL rupture after a soccer game with Magnet-Resonance-Imaging (MRI) and clinical
      tests. This patient was physically immobile and reported pain especially when stretching and
      bending the knee. After one hour of treatment from Khalifa the signs of the injury like the
      stretching / bending inhibition and pain were gone immediately. Three months after the
      treatment, an evaluation of the knee with MRI showed an end-to-end continuous ACL with
      homogeneous signal and the clinical tests confirmed the stability of the knee.

      With this study the investigators will evaluate the possibility of influencing the healing of
      a completely ruptured ACL of the knee by one single special local pressure treatment to the
      skin for 60 min.
