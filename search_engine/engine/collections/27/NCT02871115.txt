      delivering PRIME (Pharmacist Reconciliation to Improve Medication Management in the Elderly)
      to older patients with breast, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers; and (2) to estimate the
      effect size (i.e. the magnitude of the difference between groups) of PRIME for improving
      medication management (e.g. accurate medication list, less polypharmacy, fewer potentially
      inappropriate medications) and achieving up-to-date vaccinations.
