      eligible. Enrolled subjects will undergo one research PET/MR scan at the Center for
      Biomedical Imaging (660 First Avenue) within one week prior to the planned surgery. During
      the dissection, the locations of removed lymph nodes will be noted in terms of conventional
      neck lymph node levels. PET/MR data will be used for development of a combined kinetic model
      analysis of PET and MRI data (Aim 1). The final PET/MR findings will be compared with
      pathological evaluation results in order to assess the accuracy of PET/MR for detection of
      nodal metastases (Aim 2).
