    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open label study of AB-106 in the Chinese
      patients of NSCLC harboring with ROS1 fusion gene.

      The study will consist of 2 parts. The Part 1 portion will evaluate the safety and PK profile
      of AB-106 by using two doses of 400mg QD and 600mg QD in order to confirm 600mg QD as the
      most optimal dose.

      The Part 2 portion will evaluate the efficacy and safety of AB-106 by using the most optimal
      dose of 600mg QD.

      It is expected to enroll 6 patients in Part 1 and 100 patients in Part 2. The study period of
      each patient will be comprised of screening, treatment, safety follow-up and survival
      follow-up.

      In the Part 1 portion, 3 patients will receive AB-106 400mg QD and 3 patients will receive
      AB-106 600mg QD in 21-cycles to evaluate the safety and PK profiles.

      In the Part 2 portion, 100 patients will be enrolled and divided into 2 cohorts. 60
      crizotinib-na√Øve patients will be enrolled in Cohort A and 40 crizotinib-pretreated patients
      will be enrolled in Cohort B.

      AB-106 will be administered 600mg once daily in 21-day cycles. Patients will continue with
      the study treatment until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.

      The tumor response evaluation will be conducted in every two cycles in the first 8 cycles,
      and then every four cycles until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.
      The long-term survival follow up will be conducted every 12 weeks.
