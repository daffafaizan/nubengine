      replication to switch to an easier-to-take antiretroviral system to promote long-term
      adherence and thus maintain controlled viral load for longer, delaying the evolution of the
      HIV infection.

      The combination of ABC+3TC+EFV is a potent and easy-to-take regimen (2 tablets once a day)
      that could be suitable for the simplification of antiretroviral treatment in patients with
      controlled viral load with a regimen that includes 2 NRTI taken twice daily.
