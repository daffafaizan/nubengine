      procedure in bariatric surgery that has a good safety record. Despite these advantages,
      success rates following LAGB are quite variable across individuals. Recent data suggest that
      complementing LAGB with interventions targeting factors along the brain-behavior spectrum
      could enhance weight loss results following this procedure.

      The study will have the following three aims:

      Aim #1: To evaluate whether enhancement of the right inferior frontal gyrus with tDCS in
      patients undergoing LAGB can improve inhibitory control capacity. For this aim the
      investigators will evaluate participants' performance in a computerized test of inhibitory
      control. Results from this aim will provide evidence for target engagement, and thus confirm
      that the brain circuit of interest was affected as a result of the intervention.

      Aim #2: To examine whether enhancement of the right inferior frontal gyrus with tDCS in
      patients undergoing LAGB can lead to improvements in a self-reported measure of eating
      control (disinhibition subscale of the three-factor eating questionnaire). Results form this
      aim will provide evidence for an effect of the intervention on an intermediate, behavioral
      variable.

      Aim #3: To preliminary evaluate whether enhancement of the right inferior frontal gyrus with
      tDCS in patients undergoing LAGB can improve postoperative weight loss outcomes. This aim
      will provide preliminary evidence for the clinical efficacy of the intervention over a time
      window period of 12 months. Weight loss at 12 months will be the primary outcome of the
      study.
