      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass. There is
      evidence of an association between elevations in free heme levels and risk of developing
      acute kidney injury. The degree of alterations in free heme levels and the heme metabolism
      pathway in patients undergoing valvular repair or replacement, durable mechanical ventricular
      assist device placement, or aortic aneurysm repair has not been well characterized.
      Furthermore, free heme levels after coronary artery bypass grafting without utilization of
      cardiopulmonary bypass have not been described previously. Cell salvage techniques
      independent of cardiopulmonary bypass are known to be potentially traumatic to the cellular
      components of blood and this relationship has not been thoroughly explored in the cardiac
      surgery population. Lastly, there is scarce prior work attempting to assess the interplay
      between free heme levels and novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury.
