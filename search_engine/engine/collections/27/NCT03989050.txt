      study, in particular eligibility criteria. Patients currently receiving Immune Checkpoint
      Inhibitors will be approached by their treating physicians in case of an already scheduled
      vaccination against S. pneumonia. If a patient agrees to participate in the study and to sign
      an informed consent form, basic data on demographics, underlying disease, comorbidities, and
      irAE will be obtained from the electronic health record and entered into the eCRF.

      Pneumococcal antibody titers will be drawn at baseline and after 30 days. We will actively
      follow-up on study patients for four months after enrolment and screen health records of the
      enrolled patients after four months to record occurrence of irAE.

      A blood sample (9 ml) will be drawn before vaccination. Vaccination will either be performed
      by the treating physician or by a general practitioner. After 30 days, a second blood sample
      will be taken during an already planned visit at the (outpatient) clinic. Titer assessment
      will be performed along STIKO recommendations for immunocompromised patients.

      All samples for ELISA and OPA titer determination will be stored frozen at Department I for
      Internal Medicine and titers will be analyzed in batch at the end of this study. All
      therapies and diagnostics including vaccinations will be administered solely as part of
      clinical routine and as recommended by appropriate guidelines (RKI STIKO recommendations).
