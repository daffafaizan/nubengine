      concomitant use of strong inducers as co-administration of rifampin decreased the
      area-under-the concentration time curve (AUC) of IVA by 89%, creating a therapeutic challenge
      to the treatment of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) infection in people with cystic
      fibrosis (CF). While rifabutin also induces CYP3A4 activity, its effects appear to be more
      moderate when compared with rifampin. Therefore, we hypothesize that rifabutin can be
      co-administered with an adjusted dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients being treated for NTM
      pulmonary disease.
