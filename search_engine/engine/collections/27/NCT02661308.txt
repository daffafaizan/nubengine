    
      Two independent but similar RCTs with a total of 144 breast cancer patients (Group 1 = 72
      high risk patients; Group 2 = 72 low risk breast cancer patients) post-treatment screened for
      fatigue will be randomized to BWL (36 in each of the two groups) or dim light(DL) (36 in each
      of the two groups) exposure for 30 minutes/morning for 4 weeks, and assessed before, during,
      immediately and 3 months after the intervention. Measures include questionnaires, cognitive
      assessment, actigraphy, blood samples, saliva samples, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      1.1 Aims and hypotheses. Aim 1: To test the efficacy of BWL on fatigue (primary outcome) in
      breast cancer patients.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared with control participants exposed to DL, participants randomized to
      BWL will report less fatigue immediately and 3 months after the intervention.

      Aim 2: To test the efficacy of BWL on cognitive functioning (secondary outcome).

      Hypothesis 2: Compared with controls, BWL recipients will show improved cognitive functioning
      immediately and 3 months after the intervention.

      Aim 3: To explore the effects of BWL on chronobiological, biological, and neurophysiological
      markers.

      Hypothesis 3: BWL will be associated with normalized circadian activity rhythms (3a);
      improved sleep (3b); decreased inflammation (3c); increased cortical and subcortical grey
      matter density (3d); and increased cortical and subcortical white matter integrity (3e). If
      hypotheses 1 and/or 2 are confirmed, the mediating effects of the markers will be explored.
