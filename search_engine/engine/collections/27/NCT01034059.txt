      the serum level of sTREM-1 in patients with neutropenic fever. Those patients were classified
      to 2 groups: documented infection or low likelihood of infection. Their sTREM-1 level was
      measured and was compared with other biomarker such as CRP and procalcitonin. The value of
      sTREM-1 for diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever was thus evaluated.
