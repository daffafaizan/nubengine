    
      This is a randomized trial where physician investigators will perform clinically indicated
      vaginal speculum examinations using either a sheathed or a standard plastic speculum, to
      determine which speculum provides the best visualization of the cervix. As a secondary
      outcome, study participants will record their pain level on a 10-cm visual analogue scale.
