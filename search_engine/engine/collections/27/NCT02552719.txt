      A paper version of the German translation of the Injustice Experience Questionnaire was
      completed in presence of the interviewer. The structure of the standardized interview
      followed the recommendations for pretesting transcultural translations of questionnaires.
      Patients were asked if there were any items difficult to understand, unacceptable or
      offending them. Subsequently they had to answer questions about the content and meaning of
      the IEQ-items. The interviewer asked all questions and entered the responses. All data were
      directly stored in a MySQL database at a Swiss commercial web-server
      (www.scientific-affairs.ch).
