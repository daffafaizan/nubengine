    
      first step: The investigators will review the operating room reports, identify participants
      who underwent trans-oral robotic surgery for base of tongue and/ or soft palate surgery more
      than six months ago.

      second step:

        1. The investigators will locate and conclude data of participants who already underwent
           assessment of postoperative swallowing function (FEES test and SDQ).The investigators
           will review the summary of their meeting.

        2. The investigators will Call participants who have not yet done swallowing assessment and
           invite them to a clinic appointment.

      third step- participants come to the clinic. Receive an explanation, sign a consent form.
      Then the participants fulfill the SDQ questionnaire (patient self- filling questionnaire) in
      which the participants assess the quality swallowing.

      Then the investigators will conduct the swallowing test - FEES test. During This test fiber
      optic fiber is inserted through the participants nose for the purpose of observing the
      pharyngeal and laryngeal areas.The participants eat and drink food and with different
      textures while looking for their swallowing mechanism via the optical fiber in order to
      identify swallowing problems.

      forth step- Two laryngologists and a speech therapists will go over the recorded swallowing
      tests, filling out the two questionnaires:Swallowing performance status scale (SPSS) and
      Penetration- aspiration scale (PAS).

      With these scales every participant receives a score that reflects the quality of swallowing.
      A higher score indicates a more severe swallowing disorder.
