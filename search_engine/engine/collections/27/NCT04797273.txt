      disorder or exhaustion disorder, is highly prevalent in the general population and associated
      with high societal costs relating to productivity loss. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is
      the most well-studied psychological treatment and has demonstrated promising effects in terms
      of symptom reduction. The overall evidence-base for CBT for these disorders is however fairly
      week and access to treatment is low. In a previously published randomized controlled trial we
      found that internet-based CBT can yield large effects on core symptoms of stress for these
      disorders. Delivering CBT via the internet has the large advantage of enabling increased
      accessibility as each therapist can have up to 80 patients in ongoing treatment. In the
      previously conducted trial we compared the treatment to a waitlist control and between-group
      comparisons of treatment effects were only done at post-treatment as the waitlist condition
      was crossed over to treatment after this time point. It is now therefore important to take
      the next step and investigate the effects of internet-based CBT in comparison to an active
      control condition. The primary aim of this study was to compare two internet-based
      treatments, CBT vs. structured treatment-as-usual, for adjustment disorder and exhaustion
      disorder.
