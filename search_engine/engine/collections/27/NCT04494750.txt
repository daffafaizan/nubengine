      with angina and/or positive exercise testing during follow-up. With recurring or persistent
      symptoms, a number of those patients will be referred for control angiography. This might
      create a significant burden for health systems as well as putting patients to undergo further
      interventions without clear demonstration of ischemia.

      Assessing physiology and fractional flow reserve in particular after PCI could represent a
      further step to determine whether stent implantation and stenosis removal will be effective
      to relieve subjective and objective signs of ischemia.

      Hypothesis:

      Resting gradients such as whole cycle Pd/Pa and diastolic dPR and FFR will be abnormal (below
      ischemic threshold) in > 20% of cases despite optimal stent implantation and angiographic
      result.

      The use of physiology assessment in previously intervened vessels in patients referred for
      persisting or recurring angina might help operators to decide upon further intervention.
