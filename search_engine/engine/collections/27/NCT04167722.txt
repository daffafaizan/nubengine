      in 8 men respectively. Moreover, obesity increases the risk of developing aggressive disease
      and the risk of prostate cancer spreading. How this happens is not known. The investigators
      want to understand how fat cells communicate with prostate cancer cells. Investigators will
      be collecting prostate and fat tissue from radical prostatectomy participants for culture, in
      particular to look at exosome communication.
