      is expressed as an index of sympathovagal balance. Patients with chronic renal disease
      participate in the study. Blood pressure and power spectrum of heart rate variability for 24
      hours are measured when they receive no medication for at least 1 week. The mean waking and
      sleeping time systolic and diastolic blood pressure are calculated. LF/HF ratios in the
      chronic renal disease are evaluated to calculate the waking/sleeping ratio for LF/HF.
