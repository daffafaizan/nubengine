      eligibility screening. A data manager, identified by the Principal Investigator at each
      participating center, will screen all patients for eligibility. Appointment, diagnosis and
      treatment data will be reviewed using information such as clinic records, appointment lists,
      pathology department records, OR schedule and/or tumor registries. Patients meeting inclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in the 3-year registry which will comprise retrospective and
      prospective parts. Patients will be accrued retrospectively for the first 12-month period of
      the registry. The retrospective part will include patients who received PDT with PhotofrinÂ®
      from 2007 up to 2012. Patients who are eligible but die prior to enrollment will also be
      included to minimize bias resulting from non-inclusion of advanced stage patients. The
      prospective recruitment parts will be three years. The estimated length of follow-up for each
      patient will be 3 years. Follow-up will be conducted by research study staff at each
      institution via medical record review, under the direction of the Principal Investigator at
      that site. No patients will be contacted at any point to obtain study data or for follow-up.
