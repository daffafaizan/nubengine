    
      PHASE I: Participants will be enrolled sequentially and treated at Dose Level 1, or Dose
      Level -1, every 2 weeks for 12 cycles or until discontinuation.

      Each cycle is 4 weeks. Cetuximab is given alone in lead-in period at Day -14 before Cycle 1
      only. In all subsequent doses starting Cycle 1 Day 1, nivolumab and cetuximab will be given
      concurrently. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment will be performed during Cycle 1 and
      will start with the initiation of the combination of cetuximab and nivolumab (4 weeks).

      PHASE II: Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase II dose of cetuximab
      is determined in Phase I, accrual to the phase II will begin.

      FOLLOW-UP: Participants will be followed for 2 years from End of Treatment. The imaging
      studies will be performed every 8 weeks (2 cycles) of the treatments during Cycle 1-6 and
      then every 12 weeks during Cycle 7-12 as per standard of care. Patient will be followed by
      treating physicians as per standard of care.
