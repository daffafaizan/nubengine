      enrolled with a diagnosis of oligometastatic Colorectal Cancer (omCRC) with two-three nodules
      lung-limited disease and treated with SBRT technique. SBRT will be delivered according to a
      risk-adapted protocol.

      Tumor genetic background will be assessed on primary FFPE (Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded)
      tissues. Liquid biopsy will be done on blood samples collected before radiotherapy (RT) start
      and after 40 days to monitor tumor DNA evolution. The most direct method to assess cancer
      genetics relies on sampling of tumor DNA and its characterization through whole genome
      sequencing techniques (NGS, Next Generation Sequencing).

      The study will last 48 months, divides as follow: 24 months of enrollment phase and up to 24
      months of follow-up. Follow-up will be performed on the 40th day after the end of radiation
      treatment and then every 3 months until progression.
