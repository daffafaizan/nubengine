      Primary

        -  Estimate the incidence of detectable donor-derived collagen type VII at day 100 in
           patients with epidermolysis bullosa by donor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality at day 180

        -  Determine the incidence of blood chimerism at days 21, 100, 180, 365, and 730

        -  Determine the incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 42 and platelet recovery at day
           180

        -  Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade
           III-IV at day 100

        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year

        -  Determine the probability of survival at 1 and 2 years

        -  Determine the incidence of donor derived cells in the skin

        -  Determine resistance to blister formation OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Busulfan intravenously (IV) over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -9
           to -4, fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -3, and high-dose
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2.

        -  Stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients
