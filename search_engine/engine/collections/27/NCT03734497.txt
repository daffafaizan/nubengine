    
      Patients will be randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group C (Control) will receive spinal
      anesthesia after initiation of intravenous (iv) access without fluid preloading and will
      receive 2 ml/kg Ringer's lactate during anesthesia..

      Group P (preloading) will receive 10 ml/kg Ringer's lactate before spinal block.

      In Group FTc, ultrasonographic measurement of corrected flow time in carotid artery will be
      measured using 10-5 megahertz linear probe. On the two-dimensional image, the optimal image
      of the long-axis view will be obtained at the left common carotid artery. The sample volume
      will be placed on the center of the lumen, 2 cm proximal to the bulb, and a pulsed wave
      Doppler examination will be performed. Cardiac cycle time and carotid flow time will be
      measured. Carotid flow time will be measured between the upstroke of the flow tracing and the
      dicrotic notch, and it will be corrected for pulse rate by dividing flow time by the square
      root of the cardiac cycle time to calculate corrected carotid artery flow time (flow
      time/âˆšcycle time).

      The blood pressure will be measured 5 minutes before spinal anesthesia is commenced
      (baseline) and every minute afterwards until end of surgery.

      Group FTc will receive a 500 mL Ringer's lactate bolus if the FTc is <349 ms (fluid
      responder); the FTc measurement will be repeated 15 minutes later and additional 500 mL
      Ringer's lactate bolus will be applied if the patient is still considered fluid responder;
      this sequence will be repeated until the patient's FTc is > 349 ms (non responder).

      Ephedrine bolus will be used in allh groups if the mean arterial pressure drops below 30% of
      the baseline value.
