      building. The study will be administered entirely for research purposes. All data will be
      self-reported (see attached survey). Data collection will be through a web-based version of
      the EPIQ loaded into Research Electronic Data Capture REDCap, a secure web-based system for
      data collection. Data collection will occur over 6 half day sessions at the University of
      Minnesota D2D building at the Minnesota State Fair Grounds while the Fair is running.
