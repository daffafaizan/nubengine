      despite its being by far the most commonly used illicit drug during pregnancy (particularly
      among African-American women), and despite growing evidence that it may have a range of
      long-term cognitive and neurobehavioral consequences. This R34 clinical trial planning grant
      therefore proposes the development and preliminary validation of two high- reach and mutually
      compatible technology-based interventions for marijuana use during pregnancy. The first, a
      theory-based, synchronous, and highly interactive computer-delivered brief intervention, will
      be based on an emerging knowledge base regarding key elements of efficacious
      technology-delivered interventions. The second intervention, a series of tailored text
      messages, will build on the rich literature regarding key tailoring elements. These
      interventions will be developed and refined with input from pregnant women who report active
      use of marijuana, as well as from health care providers. They will subsequently be
      tested-alone and in combination-in a pilot randomized trial involving 80 women actively using
      marijuana during pregnancy. This Stage I pilot work would set the stage for a confirmatory
      Stage II trial. It would also produce the first high-reach brief interventions for marijuana
      use during pregnancy. If effective, these approaches could have a substantial population
      impact on marijuana use among pregnant women, with potential for lifelong improved outcomes
      for both mother and child.
