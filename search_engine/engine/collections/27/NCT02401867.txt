    
      This observational study will examine sexual health in a bio-behavioral cross-sectional
      mixed-methods design among 150 FTM patients in Boston, Massachusetts, and will determine the
      acceptability as well as collect epidemiologic data on the comparative performance
      characteristics of several biological screening modalities in this patient population.
      Patients and stakeholders are key partners throughout the project and are involved in all
      phases of study development, implementation, and plans for dissemination.

      Eligible participants will participate in a one-time clinical visit. Following written
      consent, the one-time clinical visit will include: 1) Quantitative assessment; 2) Collection
      of biological specimens/biomarkers (HPV DNA vaginal self-swab, HPV DNA cervical swab
      collected by provider, Pap test with cytology, STI testing self- and provider-collected); 3)
      Qualitative Interview.

      A series of national, online focus groups with FTMs, providers, and key stakeholders will
      occur to gather information on the sexual health needs of FTM individuals outside the Boston
      area and to ensure that the dissemination of study findings take differing demographic
      concerns into consideration.
