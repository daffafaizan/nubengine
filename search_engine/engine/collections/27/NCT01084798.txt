    
      Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and
      is characterised by areas of demyelination, or plaques in the CNS. The disease is twice as
      prevalent in women as compared to men and causes considerable disability over time and
      continues for the lifetime of the subject. Subjects with MS are thought to have a genetic
      predisposition for the disease, though environmental factors such as geographic location and
      possibly viral infection also play an important role in the process of development of the
      disease.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To understand the clinical care pathways of MS subjects at the site over the last 10
           years in order to raise the medical attention of MS diagnosis

      Secondary objective:

        -  To review the pattern of MS treatment regimens in MS subjects at a particular site
           between 1997 and 2007
