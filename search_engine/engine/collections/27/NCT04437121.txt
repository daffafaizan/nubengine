      Coronavirus (Sars CoV-2). WHO declared the disease of COVID-19 as a pandemic in February
      2020. Since then, many countries around the world have imposed lockdown (quarantine at home),
      as the main measure to prevent the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the lockdown was
      officially imposed from March, 23rd, 2020. This unprecedented situation may have caused
      changes in adults' and children's dietary and lifestyle habits.

      Data were collected via an online survey consisting of 70 questions. Study participants were
      enrolled after signing an informed consent form. The questionnaire self-reported by
      volunteers (parents of children aged between 2-18 years old). The survey had 3 sections. The
      first section focused on participants' sociodemographic data (e.g. gender, age, city of
      residence and socioeconomic level). The second and third sections contained questions about
      the parents' (section 2) and their children's (section 3) dietary and lifestyle habits before
      and during quarantine.

      The scientific community raises concerns about the health implications that will be caused
      due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The results of this study are expected to shed light into
      children and adolescents, as well as their parents', changes in dietary and lifestyle
      behaviours and feed the development of effective strategies to prevent the adoption of
      unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and weight gain in the event of a second wave of COVID-19 in
      the coming months.
