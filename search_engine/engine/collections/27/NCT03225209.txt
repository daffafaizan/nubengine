      (OPTIFAST) to "enhanced GLP-1 release" (Liraglutide) will lead to discontinuation of Lantus
      and Metformin. The primary outcome measure is change in glycemic control measured as
      hemoglobin A1C. Secondary outcome measures are change in weight, medication intensity and
      health related quality of life.
