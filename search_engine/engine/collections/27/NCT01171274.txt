      condition since centuries and gaining more and more interest in Europe and the US. The
      efficacy of Hatha Yoga for relieving chronic low back pain has been repeatedly demonstrated
      in clinical trials, while there are no studies in the literature regarding chronic neck pain.
      The aim of this study is to investigate, whether a 9 weeks-course of Hatha Yoga reduces
      subjective pain ratings and disability in patients suffering from chronic neck pain.
      Furthermore, as neck pain patients have been shown to suffer from impaired sensory processing
      and proprioception, along with restricted range of motion, the study aims to test if Hatha
      Yoga can improve these variables. Therefore, tests regarding cervicocephalic proprioception,
      active range of motion and the processing of mechanical, vibration and pain stimuli will be
      included.

      58 patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain will be randomized to either Hatha Yoga group
      or control group, receiving information regarding exercises for chronic neck pain. The
      control group will be offered to take part in a Yoga class after the end of the study.
