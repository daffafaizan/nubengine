      satiety and energy metabolism. The primary objective is to determine the effects of chronic
      intake of dietary fatty acids of varied saturation and chain length on satiety, thermogenesis
      and energy utilization in healthy individuals. The investigators hypothesize that unsaturated
      fatty acids will 1) increase satiety and 2) increase energy metabolism and that 3) the fatty
      acid binding protein polymorphisms are associated with reduced energy expenditure in response
      to dietary fat intake.
