      intervention (PCI) has been a feasible treatment for patient with coronary artery disease.
      However, stent failures including in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis have been still
      problematic. Moreover, neoatherosclerosis, which is the atherosclerotic process developed in
      the neointima within the implanted stent, has been reported to be associated with
      neoatherosclerotic plaque rupture and contribute to the development of acute coronary
      syndrome in patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation.

      In this perspective, recent AHA/ACC and ESC guidelines recommend the high-dose(intensity)
      statin therapy for patients performed PCI. However, the efficacy of the high-dose(intensity)
      statin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes is still controversial. Several meta-analysis
      failed to show the benefit of the high-dose(intensity) statin therapy to reduce the
      mortality. Moreover, clear evidence for the benefits of such high-dose(intensity) statin
      therapy has no yet been demonstrated in East Asian patients.

      This trial was designed to compare the 30 month-safety and efficacy between low-dose (5mg/dL)
      and high-dose (20mg/dL) rosuvastatin treatment for patients with coronary artery disease
      after PCI in the era of the newer generation DES era.
