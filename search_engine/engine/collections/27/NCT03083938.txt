      roll-up technique at pancreato-jejunal anastomosis in patients undergoing
      pancreatoduodenectomy. The purpose of this study is to prove the hypothesis that omental
      roll-up technique can reduce the complication rate or pancratic fistula after
      pancreatoduodenectomy. This study was approved by the committee on human rights to conduct
      the research involving human subjects, faculty of medicine Ramathibodi hospital, Mahidol
      university. The patients are operated by experienced surgeons of Hepato-pancreato-biliary
      unit, department of surgery, Ramathibodi hospital and randomized into two groups by using the
      closed envelope method after completing pancreato-jejunal anastomosis. Then, patients are
      followed-up and the data are collected for 30 days after the surgery.
