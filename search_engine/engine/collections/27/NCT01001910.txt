      I. To evaluate the response rate of combination pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) (Alimta) and
      carboplatin (Paraplatin) in recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube
      carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free interval, overall survival, and adverse effects among
      patients receiving this drug combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 8-15 minutes and carboplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the
