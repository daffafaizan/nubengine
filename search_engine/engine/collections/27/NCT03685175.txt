      doxorubicin treatment. The study will be conducted in parallel to the standard clinical care,
      at dedicated visits.

      In this study patients will undergo a cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) signal detection after
      injection of hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate. The study will be performed before the course
      of doxorubicin, and after completing doxorubicin treatment.

      Patients will be screened prior to enrollment based on study specific inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and MRI safety criteria.

      On the day of the metabolic cardiac MR scan an IV line will be inserted and the participant
      will receive a bolus of oral glucose. The ingestion of glucose will be required to prepare
      the state of the heart for metabolic imaging. Following this preparation the participant will
      undergo a cardiac MR study of about 45 minutes, including carbon-13 dedicated sequences.

      A separate dedicated cardiac MRI session may be completed in certain participants.

      In part I 10 patients will be studied after completion of doxorubicin therapy for correlation
      with cardiac mechanical function.

      In part II up to 100 patients will be studied before and after completion of doxorubicin
      therapy for identification of subclinical cardiac metabolic changes.
