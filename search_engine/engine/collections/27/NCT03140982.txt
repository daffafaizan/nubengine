    
      Clinical experimental randomized study, approved by the Ethic Committee, with informed
      consent, included ASA I- II adults, without neurological illness and normal physical exam.

      The patient randomized in two groups, rapid induction (GR) with propofol in target controlled
      infusion (TCI) effect site mode using the phamacokinetic (PK) model from Marsh ke0 1,21 min-1
      using a calculated target of 5.4 ug/ml (loss of counsciousness EC95) and slow induction (GL)
      10 mg/kg/h with calculated effect site concentrations (CeCALC) same PK model.

      The same neurologist, blind to the correspondent group, evaluated all the patients every 30
      sec using the coma FOUR scale until loss of counsciousness (LOC), defined as a FOUR (E0 no
      eyes opening response and /or M0 no motor response). At LOC the existance of brainstem reflex
      was evaluated (B no pupil and corneal reflex), respiratory pattern (R apnoea), CeCALC and
      patient state index (PSI) SEDlineâ„¢ was recorded during all the examination.

      After LOC in both groups we maintain in GR the initial target (5.3 ug/ml) and the LOC CeCALC
      during 10 min without intervention, except respiratory support if it was required.

      Frontal EEG 4 channel and spectrogram from SEDline monitor was extracted for each case and
      posterior analysis.

      Fisher exact test was used to describe primary outcome and difference between B and R for
      each group. The difference in time to reach LOC LOC, Ce and PSI was analysed with T- Student.
