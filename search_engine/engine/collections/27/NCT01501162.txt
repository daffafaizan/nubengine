      Gut-derived microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been known as a central role in the
      pathogenesis of AH. Some animal studies suggested an emerging role of probiotics in
      restoration of the bowel flora and improving liver enzymes. We explored the therapeutic
      effects of probiotics in patients with AH.

      Methods: Between September 2010 and April 2012, we conducted a 7-day, double-controlled,
      randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of probiotics in improving
      liver enzymes, LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines. AH was defined as an aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2 and elevated AST (ALT) level with
      an alcohol consumption history within 48 hours. Patients were randomized to receive 7 days of
      probiotics (1500 mg/day) or placebo. The levels of liver enzymes, modified Discriminant
      Function (mDF), LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were checked at baseline and again after
      therapy.
