      invasive urothelial carcinoma. The urinary diversion will be completed intracorporeal either
      as ileal conduit or ileal neobladder. Outcome parameters include perioperative complications,
      oncologic data and oncologic follow-up data (tumor classification, recurrence, survival) as
      well as data on functional follow up (continence, quality of life).
