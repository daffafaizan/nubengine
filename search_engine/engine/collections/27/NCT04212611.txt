      anesthetic with rapid onset and prolonged duration of analgesia and similar or more
      pronounced nerve blocking effects, depending on the concentration. Hence the present study is
      aimed to compare the effectiveness of 0.375% levobupivacaine and 0..375% ropivacaine in infra
      orbital block for cleft palate surgery.
