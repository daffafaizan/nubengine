      thigh under the supervision of a female clinic staff. The thigh to which each cream will be
      applied will be selected randomly, but half of the subjects will have cream A on the right
      thigh and cream B on the opposite thigh while the other half of the subjects will have the
      sides reversed. To evaluate the primary endpoint, both thighs will be measured at baseline
      and at the end of each treatment week, and the secondary endpoint will be assessed with
      standardized pictures of each thigh at baseline and on the last day of the fourth week which
      will end the study.
