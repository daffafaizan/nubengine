      approved pharmacological treatment, Alteplase, which has to be administered within 3 hours
      from symptom onset. Consequently, only about 2-3% of patients world wide with ischemic
      strokes are treated. The naturally occurring hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), is able to
      protect various neuronal tissues from ischemic injury and is beneficial in animal models of
      acute ischemic stroke. However, treatment of stroke with EPO is undesirable due to its
      ability to stimulate production of red blood cells and to promote the blood to coagulate. Lu
      AA24493 is a modified (carbamylated) version of EPO, neuroprotective but without the
      haematopoietic side effects. Lu AA24493 is developed for treatment of patients with acute
      ischemic stroke.

      In this safety study of single doses with Lu AA24493, patients will receive Lu AA24493 within
      12-48 hours from symptom onset.
