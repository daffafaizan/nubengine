    
      The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the antiviral activity, safety, and
      tolerability of VCH-759 monotherapy in adult subjects with early-stage chronic HCV-infection.

      In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VCH-759 at steady state in HCV-infected
      adults and the relationship between VCH-759 plasma levels and corresponding HCV RNA reduction
      with the administered dosages of VCH-759 in adults will also be investigated. The kinetics of
      plasma HCV RNA during treatment for up to ten (10) days with VCH-759 and following
      discontinuation of therapy will also be studied.

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in which subjects will be
      assigned to receive treatment with one of the following oral dosages of VCH-759: 400 mg
      t.i.d., 600 mg t.i.d., and 800 mg t.i.d., or placebo; enrollment into the three cohorts will
      occur sequentially. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to a treatment: placebo
      ratio of 3:1 for a total of 12 subjects per cohort; subjects will be randomized in blocks of
      4. The decision to continue dosing within a cohort will be determined by an independent
      review of all safety data up to and including Day 11 for the first 4 subjects within that
      dose cohort; this review will be conducted by a qualified medical specialist, in conjunction
      with the sponsor and medical monitor. The decision to proceed to the next cohort will be
      decided by an independent review of Day 11 safety data for all 12 subjects in the previous
      cohort. Eligible subjects will receive study medication three times daily for 10 days and
      will return to the study center for follow-up assessments on Day 11, Day 17, and Day 24.
