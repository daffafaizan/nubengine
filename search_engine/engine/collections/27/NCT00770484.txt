    
      -  Subjects will be studied twice, once after receiving placebo and in a second occasion
           after receiving propanolol.

        -  An exercise capacity test with estimation of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) will
           be done within 1 hour of receiving a pill containing placebo and that will be in
           appearance identical to the one for propanolol. This test will be conducted on a
           stationary bicycle and the effort will be gradually increased while expired air is
           measured during exhaustive physical work. The test will last approximately 30 minutes
           and be conducted in Vanderbilt's Clinical Trial Center.

        -  The day before and the day after the exercise test subjects will be asked to collect
           urine for 12 hours each time and to keep a record of how much liquid they ingest.

        -  Posture study tests (measurements of heart rate and blood pressure taken while lying
           down and at intervals for up to 30 minutes while standing) will be done the day before
           and the day after the exercise test.
