      be compared to national registries and national or regional databases of PCI in Troponin
      negative patients with overnight stay. As part of the registry we will also assess compliance
      with dual antiplatelet therapy at six months and at 1 year and will record any reasons for
      premature discontinuation as well as any associated adverse events.
