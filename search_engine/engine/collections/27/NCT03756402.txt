      physiological needs (e.g. pregnancy) or pathological states (e.g. solitary kidney). This
      capacity is known as renal functional reserve (RFR), and it is calculated as the difference
      between the measured maximum GFR achieved through a renal stress test and the baseline GFR
      measured in rest conditions.In clinical practice, the most common renal stress test is
      performed as a standardized protein loading test. In a pilot study, the investigators
      demonstrated a significant correlation between RFR and the intra-parenchymal renal resistive
      index variation (IRRIV) during an echo renal stress test in a cohort of healthy volunteers.
      IRRIV test has proven to be rapid, safe, bedside and easy to perform and it might represent a
      preliminary test in screening patients' RFR. For this purpose, externally validation of IRRIV
      test is performed in a validation cohort of healthy subjects.
