      home-based OGTT by comparing, in patients with CF:

        -  Standard hospital-based OGTT with measures of plasma glucose and the use of 75g glucose
           beverage;

        -  Home-based OGTT with measures of glucose using a continuous glucose monitoring system
           (CGMS; without blood sample collection) and the 75g glucose beverage;

        -  Home-based OGTT with measures of glucose using CGMS and 75g of glucose from candies as a
           substitute to this poorly appreciate beverage.

      Specific objectives are to determine i) the internal validity (specificity, sensitivity) of
      both home-based OGTTs versus a standard OGTT in controlled setting, and ii) the predictive
      value (positive and negative). The investigators will also iii) investigate patient's
      perception and likelihood that the proposed method improves adherence to annual screening,
      and iv) evaluate potential cost reduction associated with proposed simplified screening
      tests.

      On the day of the OGTT, and after obtaining informed consent, a CGMS will be installed.
      Patients will receive the very simple training required to use it as well as a pre-packed
      Jelly Beans bag containing 75g of glucose and a standard 75g glucose beverage bottle. This
      CGMS will provide interstitial glucose values each 15 min over the next 14 days.
