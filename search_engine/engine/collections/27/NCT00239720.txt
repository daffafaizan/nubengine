      people who have psoriasis. Treatment typically include drugs such as methotrexate,
      azathioprine, and etanercept, which suppress the immune system in a nonspecific fashion in an
      attempt to control the immune responses causing the disease. In some severe cases of
      psoriatic arthritis, these drugs cannot adequately control the disease, often requiring
      patients to undergo continuous treatment to prevent or combat disease activity. hOKT3gamma1
      (Ala-Ala) is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody directed against the CD3 antigen on
      T cells. hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala) specifically targets immune cells that are actively involved
      in destructive immune responses, such as those that cause psoriatic arthritis. In a small
      pilot study of eight people with psoriatic arthritis who received a 2-week course of
      hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala), the drug appeared safe and caused no serious side effects. This study
      will test the safety and efficacy of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala) in alleviating symptoms in
      psoriatic arthritis patients.

      This study will last 2 years. Individuals with psoriatic arthritis who are receiving
      methotrexate or azathioprine therapy and have active disease are eligible to participate.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala) or placebo.
      Participants will receive a 5-day treatment with the drug or placebo every month for the
      first 4 months of the study. There will be 5 study visits over 2 years to assess the safety
      and effectiveness of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala) and to evaluate laboratory measures related to the
      underlying immune problems that cause psoriatic arthritis.
