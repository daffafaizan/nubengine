      insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism. Accordingly, the intestinal microbiota
      could play an important role in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
      role of gut-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), the formation of which is enhanced by
      microbial fermentation of fibre, is still controversial. At the present time, our
      understanding of the effects of SCFA on human metabolism (in gut or systemically) is still
      limited. The investigators hypothesize that the ingested prebiotic inulin is fermented into
      SCFA and these SCFA have metabolic effects.
