      emphasized the health benefits of single probiotics, particularly on the immune system.
      However, it is unclear how a combination of two different probiotics complemented with green
      tea extract can beneficially modify markers of the immune.

      The aim of this study is to determine the dose-response effect of a yogurt containing a
      combination of bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus Acidophilus LA-5 and green
      tea extract on immune system in healthy subjects. More specifically, this randomized,
      parallel placebo controlled study will investigate the impact of increasing doses (109 and
      1010) of these probiotics on phagocytosis activity, oxidative metabolism and on the
      antipneumococcics antibody specific serotype response S. pneumoniae vaccination. Finally,
      this study will also examine the effect of increasing dose of these probiotics on intestinal
      microflora and blood lipids.
