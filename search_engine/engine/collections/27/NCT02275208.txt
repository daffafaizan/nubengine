      Sanchez-Pernaute et al. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2013;9:731) indicates that this procedure is
      safe, quick to perform, and offers good results for treatment of both morbid obesity and its
      metabolic comorbidities. CovidienTM plans to further investigate this procedure and has
      proposed a prospective clinical study to obtain data on subject outcomes through 12 months
      following the SIPS procedure.
