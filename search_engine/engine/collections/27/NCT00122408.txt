      treatments used (such as catecholamine or antibiotics) or by the disease itself. This gut
      alteration favours the adhesion and/or internalisation of bacteria by intestine cells which
      lead to the production of large amounts of cytokines that rapidly reach the blood
      compartment, inducing neutrophils activation and then organ damage. Moreover, the imbalance
      in the normal intestinal flora (demonstrated as early as 24 hours after ICU admission) is one
      of the mechanisms involved in the development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP
      is the leading cause of ICU-acquired infection and is responsible for prolonged ICU stay,
      increased mortality and costs. Probiotics, and especially Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG ('LGG'),
      have been demonstrated to possess beneficial effects in terms of intestine flora imbalance
      and immune response.

      Objective: To study the effects of a probiotic mixture (containing LGG) enteral
      administration on the survival and the incidence of VAP in mechanically ventilated patients.

      Patients and Methods: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After
      randomization, 740 intubated patients with a predictive length of mechanical support of more
      than 48 hours will enterally receive either 10.10 cfu of probiotic (Ergyphilus, Nutergia,
      France) or a identical placebo daily until withdrawal of mechanical support. The main
      endpoint is the mortality rate in ICU. Secondary endpoints include hospital length of stay
      and mortality rate, VAP incidence and the number of days free from antibiotics. Length of the
      study 24 months.

      Perspectives: The objective is to demonstrate a survival advantage due to LGG administration,
      along with a reduction of VAP episodes and antibiotic use.
