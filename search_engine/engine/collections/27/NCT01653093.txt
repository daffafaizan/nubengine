      I. To assess the impact of prostate MRI, without an endorectal coil, done at 3-Tesla on
      surgical management. This would be performed by examining the agreement of lesion location
      based on the MRI compared to the lesion location based on pathology and/or surgery and local
      extent of the disease, i.e. involvement of contiguous organs and local lymph nodes, based on
      the MRI compared to the local extent based on pathology and/or surgery.

      II. To test the reproducibility of functional MRI (dynamic-contrast enhanced [DCE_MRI] MRI,
      magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted MRI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the usefulness of MRI data in treatment planning for radiation therapy, and to
      test the feasibility of amide-proton-transfer MRI in prostate cancer detection.

      II. To evaluate MRI changes in prostate and tumor morphology between endorectal coil versus
      no endorectal coil.

      III. To assess the usefulness of ex-vivo prostate specimen MRI for accurate co-registration
      between in-vivo MRI of the prostate and pathology slides.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3-tesla (3T) MRI, including DCE-MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI,
      amide-proton-transfer MRI, and MR spectroscopy scans. Patients may undergo an additional 3T
      MRI scan at least 24 hours after the initial scan.
