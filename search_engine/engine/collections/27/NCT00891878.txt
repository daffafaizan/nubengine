      Primary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of elderly (age ≥ 65 years) and/or poor
           performance status patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or
           gastroesophageal junction treated with capecitabine with verus without sunitinib malate.

        -  Report other indicators of efficacy with these regimens, including the confirmed
           response rate, overall survival, time to tumor progression, duration of response, and
           time to treatment failure.

        -  Compare the adverse event profiles of these regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Explore whether certain key proteins associated with anti-VEGF therapy are able to
           predict tumor response.

        -  Bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or slides, and blood products for future studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to gender (male vs
      female), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), and age (≥ 65 years vs < 65 years). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Patients
           experiencing disease progression may crossover to arm II at the physician's discretion.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine as in arm 1 and oral sunitinib malate once
           daily on days 1-21.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline for evaluation of protein markers as possible
      predictors of tumor response to this regimen. Samples are analyzed by IHC for expression
      levels of markers

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
