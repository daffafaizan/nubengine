      to target cardiovascular as well as musculoskeletal functions in individuals with
      post-stroke. Lower limb's resistance training alone in chronic stroke produces a large effect
      on muscle strength. However, it has shown uncertainty results on walking performance.
      Therefore, it is suggested that to prescribe mix training (treadmill training and strength
      training) in order to improve muscle strength, gait performance and quality of life in stroke
      survivors. Previous studies have shown the effect of mixed training on walking performance
      and endurance in other populations such as multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease.
      However, there is a lack of study that conducted mixed training among chronic post-stroke.
      Therefore, the feasibility study on the effectiveness of combining LV-ITT and RE in
      post-stroke should be conducted.
