      that the pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood yet makes it hard to treat
      these patients in the right manner.

      Possible patho-mechanisms might be microvascular changes and dysfunctions of the inhibitory
      descending pain system. Furthermore, recent studies showed that CRPS patients have
      macrovascular changes and a lower blood level of NO on the affected side. This indicates a NO
      mediated perfusion dysfunction.

      Aim of this study is to examine the pathophysiological mechanism of CRPS in relation to
      healthy subjects and patients with a different type of pain syndrome (carpal tunnel syndrome)
      on the upper limb.

      The investigators try to get a better understanding of the changes in the pain inhibitory
      system and micro- and macrocirculating blood-systems, as well as of the autonomic system of
      CRPS-patients.
