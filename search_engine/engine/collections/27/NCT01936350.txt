      magnetic resonance for ventricular analyses and after this first exam they will be randomized
      to placebo or sildenafil. After one hour drug intake they will undergo another cardiac
      magnetic resonance to evaluate the drug impact on right and left ventricular function.

      The first and second exams will be performed by the same staff. All patients will be
      evaluated by two, three and four chambers view. Left and right ventricle quantification
      analyses will be performed by Argus software.
