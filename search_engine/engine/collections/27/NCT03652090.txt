      patients carrying 2 CF causing mutations with no CFTR expression/function, and patients
      carrying at least 1 mutation with residual function, such R117H) Parents or siblings of the
      CF subjects, as healthy hétérozygotes healthy controls All these subjects experience nasal
      brushings. From these nasal brushings,nasal cells are expanded, and cultured in air liquid
      interface to obtain polarized epithelium. This epithelium is then studied in Ussing chamber
      experiments to characterize the level of cAMP dependant Chloride transport and Sodium
      reabsorption. Apical expression of CFTR is assessed by immunofluorescence.

      Results will allow to define the variability of CFTR function and expression criteria in
      subjects with the same genotype. Such data are crucial for interpretation of the effect of
      CFTR modulators.
