      conducted in two stages (stage 1 and stage 2). After the screening visit and confirmation of
      eligibility, evaluable participants will be enrolled across treatment groups. In stage 1, up
      to 24 evaluable participants across two treatment groups will be enrolled. A Safety and Data
      Monitoring Committee will convene to review stage 1 data and decide whether further treatment
      groups are required in stage 2. Stage 2 may include up to 60 evaluable participants across up
      to 5 treatment groups.

      Stage 1 Group 1: AZD9833 Dose A once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose B once daily

      Stage 2 (Optional) Group 1: AZD9833 Dose C once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose D once daily
      Group 3: AZD9833 Dose E once daily Group 4: Fulvestrant 500 mg Group 5: AZD9833 Dose F once
      daily (pre-menopausal women)

      AZD9833 doses C, D, E or F could be the same as Dose A or Dose B from stage 1.

      Adverse events and concomitant medications information will be collected throughout the
      study. Thereafter there will be 28-day follow-up visit after discontinuation of study
      treatment.
