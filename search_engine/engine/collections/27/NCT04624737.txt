      followed for an average of 2 years. Each year, general data as well as ophthalmological data
      will be collected. Retinal images and videos of both eyes will be acquired using different
      imaging modalities including ultrawidefield photography, OCT and OCT angiography. The EviRed
      cohort will be split in two groups: one group of 1,000 patients (validation cohort) will be
      randomly selected during the inclusion period by unbalanced draw to be representative of the
      general diabetic population. Their data will be used for the validation of the algorithms.
      The data of the remaining 4,000 patients (training cohort) will be used to train the
      algorithms. The main objective will be the validation of the prognostic tool and evaluate how
      accurately the algorithm can predict progression to severe retinopathy in the following year.
      Secondary objectives will be to evaluate how accurately the algorithm can assess DR severity
      and individual components of DR complications as well as to compare prediction by algorithm
      to that made by ophthalmologists based on the current DR classification
