      clearance of a previously administered CNS depressant. By using pharmacologic reversal agents
      of commonly used benzodiazepines and opioids, the investigators aim to identify participants
      that may likely improve after complete clearance of the drugs from their system.

      Prospective trial with enrollment of 30 subjects in 2 intensive care units at Palmetto Health
      Richland from January 1st 2019 to June 30th 2020. Research procedures will be performed in
      the intensive care setting. If participants had undergone targeted temperature management
      (33-36 degrees Celsius for 24 hours via intravascular or surface control methods, with or
      without sedation or neuromuscular blockade, followed by rewarming actively or passively at
      0.25-0.5 degrees per hour over 8-12 hours to 37 degrees) investigators will wait 24 hours
      after rewarming prior to testing. End point is to evaluate if pharmacological reversal agents
      would result in improved GCS scores or return of cerebral or brainstem functions in some
      comatose subjects, which will be considered a positive test result.
