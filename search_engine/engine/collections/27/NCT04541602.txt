      ultrasound and blood biomarkers of neuromuscular damage as innovative diagnostic features for
      the detection, monitoring and prognostication of dysphagia and ICU-AW in critically ill
      patients. A detailed neurological examination, NMUS as well as blood biomarker measurements
      (e.g. Myl3, TNNI1, FABP-3) will be longitudinally performed at study day 1 (day of study
      inclusion), day 3, day 10 and day 17 after study inclusion. The neurological examination
      comprises the use of validated scales (GCS, RASS, mRS) and scores (MRC-ss) to assess
      consciousness, neurological disability and muscle strength as well as the the examination of
      the reflex status. Using a standardized in-house NMUS protocol the facial (masseter muscle),
      submental (digastricus muscle, mylohyoid muscle), cervical (sternocleidomastoid muscle) and
      extremity muscles (biceps brachii, brachiradialis, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior) as
      well as the vagus nerve will be assessed repeatedly. Additionally, a FEES as the current gold
      standard diagnostic for dysphagia will be performed at study day 10 or as soon as possible
      (depending on the ability of the patient to cooperate with the examiner) after study day 10
      to detect and grade the dysphagia.

      All study participants will be reevaluated at day 90 after study inclusion with regard to
      functional disability and survival.

      Furthermore, healthy volunteers will be recruited and assessed in the same way as patients
      including a clinical examination, NMUS, laboratory testing and FEES.

      The investigators hypothezise that:

        -  acquired dysphagia due to critical illness (not caused by central nervous system damage)
           is more likely in patients with ICU-AW

        -  the outcome in patients with a combination of ICU-AW and dysphagia is worse compared to
           patients with only one of these entities

        -  NMUS is able to detect and monitor dysphagia and ICU-AW in critically ill patients who
           are at risk of neuromuscular dysfunction

        -  specific blood biomarker levels correlate with the severity of neuromuscular impairment
           and are of value to identify patients with ICU-AW and acquired dysphagia
