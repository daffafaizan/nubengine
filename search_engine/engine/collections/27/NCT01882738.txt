      consecutive pregnant patients in 2nd or 3rd trimester who will attend our unit for routine
      ultrasound exam will be asked to participate. Cervical length will be assessed in all
      patients, once abdominally and then vaginally (that would serve as golden standard).
      Correlation would be assessed between accuracy of measurement to BMI. Accuracy would be
      defind as the delta of cervical length between abdominal and vaginal routs.

      BMI would be calculated prior to the ultrasound exam (by weighing and measuring all
      patients).
