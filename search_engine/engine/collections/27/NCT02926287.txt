      techniques available makes this surgery to ambulatory care, while the latter is only slightly
      conducted in France.

      Main objective is evaluation of success rate of ambulatory surgery (AS) for pelvic organ
      prolapse (POP). All surgical approaches (laparoscopic, vaginal) are included in the study.

      Secondary objectives are AS rate in the overall population and reasons for ineligibility or
      failure of ambulatory surgery.

      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of AS for POP and identify pitfalls in AS.

      A randomized control study will follow PCAP study.
