      Subsequently, subjects in PCI added to OMT group will be randomly assigned to everolimus
      eluting stent(n=400) vs. zotarolimus eluting sten(n=400). All subjects will be followed for 1
      year after randomization. Additional long-term follow-up (2- or 3-year) will be preceded in
      the next plan after 1-year study period.
