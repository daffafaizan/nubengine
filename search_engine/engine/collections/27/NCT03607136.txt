      sarcopenia are two common and mostly overlapping geriatric conditions, which may cause
      negative consequences of aging, such as disability, hospitalization and mortality.

      Regular physical activity has been suggested to maintain or improve functional capacity and
      body composition, as well as delay aging process. Nevertheless, inactivity prevalence still
      significantly increases among older adults, especially those with a disability. One of the
      probable reasons is that the use of physical activities or exercise interventions is not
      tailored to the needs and capabilities of the elderly.
