    
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, and positive-controlled clinical trial. A total
      of 1300 infants aged 2 months will be enrolled and assigned to 4 groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1
      to receive vaccination of 3 lots of investigational sIPV and control IPV manufactured by
      Sanofi Pasteur S.A respectively. Each subjects should finish the three-doses primary
      vaccination at the schedule of 2,3,4 months of age. Thirty-days safety observation after each
      dose of vaccination will be carried out. Venous blood should be collected from all the
      subjects before and 30 days after the three-doses primary vaccination, for the neutralizing
      antibody assay, and further to evaluate the immunogenicity.
