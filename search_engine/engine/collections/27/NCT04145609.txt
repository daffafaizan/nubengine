      and 90 days following AKI, has been proposed as a window of intervention to prevent the
      occurrence of CKD. However, the effective therapeutic strategies of AKD care remain to be
      developed. We intend to conduct a prospective, randomized, open-label, behavioral
      interventional trial to validate the efficacy of multidisciplinary team (MDT) care model
      which aims to improve AKD care and to reduce de novo CKD incidence.
