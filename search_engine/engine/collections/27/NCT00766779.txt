      following induction therapy, but relapse despite consolidation and maintenance therapy. In
      response, post-remission treatment has been progressively intensified and results improved
      either by high-dose post-remission therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT) or by allogeneic HCT, which has the highest curative potential for patients with AML.
      Given the toxicity of dose intensification and of allogeneic HCT, however, only younger
      patients profit from this treatment approach
