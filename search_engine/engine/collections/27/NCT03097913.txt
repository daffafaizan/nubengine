      to establish airway and realize the tube angle changes while advancement, however, patients
      who did not inform or refuse to enroll into the study still use the video-stylet establish
      airway. the technique to use videostylet-tube assembly to establish airway is a commonly
      clinical practice in our hospital.

      In general, the endotracheal tube goes through nasal cavity blindly either assist with
      traditional laryngoscope or video-laryngoscope. Tube advances through selected nasal cavity
      by using a video-stylet is able to prevent from damages of the abnormal turbinates and tissue
      mucosa. In addition, we are able to record the stylet angle into nostril, shift axis angle in
      nasal cavity to prevent orifice and side hole from damaging tissues while tube-stylet
      assembly advancement, and the angle ranges from initiate intubation to tube advanced into
      trachea.

      the selected nostril is determined by Otolaryngologist who is not aware of the study.
