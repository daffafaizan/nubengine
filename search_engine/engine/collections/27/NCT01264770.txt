      Full title: Optional Genetic Research

      Date: 10 September 2010

      Version: 1

      Objectives: To collect and store, with appropriate consent , DNA samples for future
      exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie,
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to
      fostamatinib disodium and/or adalimumab; and/or susceptibility to, progression of and
      prognosis of RA

      The main study recruitment is complete, and sub study recruitment will continue until the
      target is reached, estimated to be June 2013

      Full title: (Sub-study to OSKIRA-4): A Phase IIB, Multi-Centre, Randomised, Double-Blind,
      Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Fostamatinib Disodium
      Monotherapy Compared with Placebo or Adalimumab Monotherapy in Patients with Active
      Rheumatoid Arthritis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sub-Study

      Primary objective: Assess the efficacy of fostamatinib in reducing joint synovial disease
      activity as measured by:

        -  Change from baseline to Week 6 (versus placebo) in OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis score.
