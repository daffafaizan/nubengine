      morbidity. Many non-operative and operative treatments have been described, but few
      multicenter prospective evidence based trials exist comparing standard treatments. This
      continuing search for consensus and improvement of best clinical practice has been reviewed
      in a thorough meta-analysis of operative treatments for basal joint arthritis. Operative
      treatments range from osteotomy, partial or complete trapeziectomy with or without
      reconstruction of the ligaments, tendon interposition to arthrodesis, however the functional
      outcome varies. Allograft has been previously described in joint replacement / prosthetic
      implantation surgery in other areas of the body, however not in the thumb. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate using osteochondral allograft in the surgical intervention phase
      of treatment for patients with basal joint arthritis.
