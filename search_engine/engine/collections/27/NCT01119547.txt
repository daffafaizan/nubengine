      diseases that cause suffering for affected patients and costs for society.The predominant
      symptoms are pain, stiffness and impaired quality of life, often together with psychological
      distress. Treatment often consists of medication. Later in the disease, when the joint is
      destroyed, joint replacement surgery commonly occurs. Physical exercises aimed to increase
      muscle strength, endurance, proprioception and stability have proved to influence cartilage
      as well as function, symptoms and quality of life positively. Physical exercise may also
      reduce the need for hospital care after knee joint replacement.Research suggests that patient
      education is feasible and valuable in terms of improvements in quality of life, in function,
      in well-being and improved coping . Accordingly, guidelines recommend education and exercise
      as a core treatment for osteoarthritis.

      Since 1994, Primary Health Care in Malm√∂ has used a patient education programme directed
      towards OA.The program does not include exercise. In 2007-09 a study was made to investigate
      this education program.The study showed improvements in self-perceived health and in a few
      functional tests but not in self-efficacy.
