    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, cross-over Phase 3 study evaluating
      hyperpolarized 129Xe gas MRI as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy for the evaluation of
      pulmonary function. This study will enroll subjects being evaluated for possible lung
      resection surgery (i.e. segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy). Subjects will have both
      a 129Xe MRI and 133Xe scintigraphy image. The vast differences in technique for obtaining
      hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy make it impossible to blind study
      procedures. However, all image interpretation will be performed by personnel blinded to the
      subject's medical history and all study assessments.
