      Hypopnea Index (AHI) in an exercise trained group performed through in a national based
      non-profit organization (Fédération Française d'éducation Physique et de Gymnastique
      Volontaire (FFEPGV)) using a medical established program (NeuroGyV) during nine months
      against a control group receiving only standard dietetic and physical activity counseling.

      The first partial observations of the study EXESAS seem encouraging in the term of 3 months
      of training. However, in the longer term, there is not a coverage in the treatment of the
      moderate Sleep Apnea: Obstructive Syndrome (SAOS). Thus they can logically expect that the
      possible therapeutic effect of the exercise is not maintained in the long term after the stop
      of the training.

      This nex study suggests studying the profit of the exercise on sleep apneas for the patients
      who were initially in the control group in the EXESAS study and to observe if the
      preservation of a regular physical activity for the group which was trained in EXESAS study
      is associated with a preservation of the AHI after the additional year of follow-up without
      additional intervention
