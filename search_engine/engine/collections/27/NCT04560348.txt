      they have to face in university life. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate
      the effectiveness of university counseling programs in Hong Kong. This project aims at
      developing and systematically evaluating a culturally adapted and adventure-based cognitive
      behavioral intervention (aCBI) program to decrease psychological distress and improve various
      mental health outcomes for Chinese university students in Hong Kong. The aCBI program was
      delivered in a form of general education course in a university setting. Single group
      Pre-posttest design was adopted.The program was evaluated its effectiveness in reducing
      psychological distress, perceived stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, negative thoughts
      and negative emotions and increasing positive thoughts and positive emotions.
