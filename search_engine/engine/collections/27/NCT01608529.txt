      an increase in the physical performance. It is a control trial to investigate the effects of
      a new restriction and filtering device ventilatory nasal flow (FeelBreathe).

      Methods: A total of 27 trained male caucasian subjects (age: 32.5 Â± 7.23 years) were
      recruited from different sports clubs. Measurement of maximum static inspiratory pressure
      were taken before exercise testing and an incremental test in cycle ergometer to volitional
      fatigue for the determination of gas exchange data. Each subject performed three identical
      submaximal exercises at 50% of ventilatory thresholds under different breathing conditions:
      1) oronasal breathing 2) nasal breathing and 3) nasal breathing with Feel Breathe,
      Restriction and Filtering Device Ventilatory Nasal Flow.

      Discussion: Researchers try to find if the new device called FeelBreathe causes changes in
      the lung ventilation and gas exchange during exercise. If the results show altered breathing
      pattern and cardiometabolic variables, FeelBreathe could be used to training respiratory
      muscles.
