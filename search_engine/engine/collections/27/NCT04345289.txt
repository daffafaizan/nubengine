    
      The study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with two
      parallel treatment arms consisting of either convalescent plasma or intravenous placebo. We
      plan to enroll a total of 1100 patients yielding a statistical power of 80 % to show a 30%
      relative reduction in risk of mechanical ventilation or death at day 28. Patients with
      confirmed COVID-19 infection and signs compatible with pneumonia will be enrolled in the
      study. The participants will be randomized 2:1 to the parallel treatment arms, and receive
      either single dose infusion treatment.

      The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or need of invasive
      mechanical ventilation up to 28 days. Interim analysis will be performed frequently.

      As new knowledge of treatment options for COVID-19 have emerged, the treatment arms including
      sarilumab, baricitininb, hydroxychloroquine and oral placebo have been terminated.
