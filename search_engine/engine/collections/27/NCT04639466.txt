    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Safety and tolerability of the COH04S1 vaccine at three different dose levels (DL):
      1.0x10e7 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/dose, 1.0x10e8 PFU/dose, and 2.5x10e8 PFU/dose.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Longitudinal evaluation of humoral immunity. II. Quality and properties of cellular and
      humoral immunity elicited as a result of the vaccination.

      III. Explore the role of two injections versus one injection, and evaluate a placebo group.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Surveillance for incidental coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during follow-up (1 year).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive COH04S1 intramuscularly (IM) in the non-dominant upper arm on day
      0 and day 28 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive COH04S1 IM in the non-dominant upper arm on day 0 and placebo IM
      in the non-dominant upper arm on day 28 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Participants receive placebo IM in the non-dominant upper arm on day 0 and day 28 in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants are followed up at 7, 14, 35, 42, 56, 90, 120, 180, 270, and 365 days.
