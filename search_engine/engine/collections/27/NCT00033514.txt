        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of erlotinib when
           combined with trastuzumab (Herceptin) as first-line therapy in women with metastatic
           breast cancer associated with HER2/neu overexpression. (Phase I closed to accrual as of
           01/2004)

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate and duration of objective response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacologic behavior of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine time to disease progression and duration of survival in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Correlate the antitumor activity of this regimen with epidermal growth factor receptor
           expression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of erlotinib. (Phase I closed to accrual as of
      01/2004).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily beginning on day 2 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV
      over 30-90 minutes (1-4 hours after erlotinib) once weekly beginning on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional
      patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion (closed
      to accrual as of 01/2004) and 27-81 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this
      study.
