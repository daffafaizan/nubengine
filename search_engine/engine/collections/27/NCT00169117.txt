      highly effective means of reducing the risk of malaria. Recent studies in The Gambia and
      Kenya have shown that untreated bednets in good condition can also protect against malaria
      (51% protection against parasitaemia, 95% CIs 34-64%). However, most children in rural Gambia
      sleep under untreated nets in poor condition, often with a few holes, and do not close their
      nets properly at night. These children remain exposed to mosquito bites and the risk of
      malaria.

      This pilot study examines whether subsistence farmers in rural Africa can be encouraged to
      repair their mosquito nets and use their bednets appropriately. Attitudes and practises on
      sewing and net use were examined in rural Gambia and an intervention developed to promote net
      repair. Songs and posters were used to emphasise the importance of repairing nets and their
      correct use, and served as aural and visual reminders to repair nets now rather than postpone
      this household chore. The intervention was aimed at effectively and cheaply turning a poor
      net into a good one.

      The intervention was developed and implemented in two neighbouring villages in The Gambia,
      with each village composing their own songs. There was no formal control village. An internal
      comparison group was used in which the nets of responders and non-responders living within
      the same village were compared.The success of the intervention was assessed by: recording the
      number of nets repaired and used correctly for malarial prevention before and after the
      intervention; by counts of mosquitoes entering the nets classified according to number of
      holes and degree of repair; as well as by canvassing participants' opinions.
