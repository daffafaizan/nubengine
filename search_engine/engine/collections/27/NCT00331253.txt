    
      Comparative, controlled, multicenter, masked, randomized study, three parallel groups,
      comparing the Indocyanine Green-Mediated Photothrombosis to two control groups, for the
      treatment of neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

      Only patients matching the following criteria are eligible:

      A. BCVA worse than 20/80 and neovascular complex with some component of occult CNV as defined
      by the fluorescein angiography, or; B. BCVA worse than 20/80 and neovascular complex with
      total area of CNV (classic and occult) by fluorescein angiography occupying an area lesser
      than 50% of the neovascular complex, or; C. BCVA worse than 20/200 and neovascular complex
      with some CNV (classic OR occult) by fluorescein angiography.

      The eligibility of the patients will be assessed by an independent Centre of Interpretation
      after masked analysis.

      Eligible patients will be allocated into one of the three study groups, randomized at 2:1:1
      proportion:

      Group 1: Treatment Procedure #1 = i-MP (ICG + Laser), at proportion of 2. In this group the
      patients will be submitted to endovenous infusion of ICG followed by irradiation with diode
      laser.

      Group 2: Treatment Procedure #2 (Distilled water + Laser), at proportion of 1. In this group
      the patients will receive endovenous placebo infusion (distilled water) followed by
      irradiation with diode laser with same power utilized in Group 1.

      Group 3: Treatment Procedure #3 (Distilled water + Sham Laser), at proportion of 1. In this
      group the patients will receive endovenous placebo infusion (distilled water) followed by
      simulated application of laser.
