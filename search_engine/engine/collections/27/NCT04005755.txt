      analgesia over administration of comparable doses of either component alone or placebo, when
      given as an intravenous formulation or as a solid oral tablet in the postoperative setting.

      The superior efficacy of the combination does not appear to come at the expense of
      tolerability. A previous study of Maxigesic® IV in bunionectomy patients found that there
      were no differences between patients treated with repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV and those
      treated with intravenous acetaminophen, ibuprofen or placebo in the rate of discontinuations
      due to adverse events (AEs), the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or the
      severity of TEAEs. The incidence of common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 10% of the study population),
      including gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, general disorders and
      administration site conditions, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, was not changed
      due to combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in Maxigesic® IV.

      This study aims to determine the tolerability of repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV over an
      extended period of exposure (≥ 48 hours).
