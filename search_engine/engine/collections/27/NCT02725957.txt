    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study performed
      in healthy subjects.

      The study will include up to four escalating dose cohorts with eight (8) subjects in each
      cohort.

      In each cohort, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive single IV
      administration of 9% trehalose (Treatment Arm 1) or placebo (Treatment Arm 2).

      All subjects, regardless of their treatment arm assignment, will undergo the same evaluations
      and will receive the study drug at the clinic. Each subject will continue to be followed for
      one week post dosing.

      Cohorts 1 to 3 After all subjects in a given cohort complete their 1-week follow-up visit
      (Visit 4), a Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the safety and PK data of that cohort.
      If no safety concerns are identified, and the exposure data supports a higher dose is
      acceptable, the SRC will approve continuation into the next cohort (dose level).

      Cohort 4 Cohort 4 will be initiated based on review of the safety and exposure data from the
      first 3 cohorts by the SRC. This cohort will only be performed if there is a suggestion that
      exposure can be safely increased.
