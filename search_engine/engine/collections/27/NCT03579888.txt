    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of donor-derived genetically
      modified, CD19-specific T cells expressing mbIL15 and HER1t using the Rapid Personalized
      Manufacture (RPM) process (autologous CD19-CD8-CD28-CD3zeta-chimeric antigen receptor
      [CAR]-mbIL15-HER1t T cells [CD19-mbIL15-CAR-T cells]) administered to patients with CD19+
      advanced lymphoid malignancies who have previously received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT), including haploidentical HSCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of the RPM process. II. To determine the incidence and
      grading of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.

      III. To determine persistence of genetically modified T cells. IV. To determine if cetuximab
      can control numbers of infused T cells. V. To screen for the development of host immune
      responses against the transgenes (one or more of CAR, mbIL15, HER1t).

      VI. To determine cytokine profile of the patient with infused T cells. VII. To demonstrate
      the homing ability of the infused T cells. VIII. To assess disease response after T-cell
      infusion. IX. To assess progression-free and overall survival. X. To detect emergence of CD19
      negative (neg) malignant B cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19-CD8-CD28-CD3zeta-CAR-mbIL15-HER1t
      T cells.

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days -5, -4, and -3 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous CD19-CD8-CD28-CD3zeta-CAR-mbIL15-HER1t T cells
      IV over 15-30 minutes on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 3 days after T-cell
      infusion and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months, then periodically
      for up to 15 years.
