      recent years, but the etiological diagnosis rate is still low. Quickly identifying the
      pathogenic bacteria and the corresponding antimicrobial therapy treatment is particularly
      important. Fibrotic bronchoscopy combined with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has become a
      routine diagnostic tool for pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients.

      The correct operation of bronchoalveolar lavage and normalization of bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid is a prerequisite for the exact results of the pathogen of BALF.

      American Thoracic Society recommended amount of 100-300ml of saline solution was instilled
      into the distal bronchial tree in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. But there is
      no standard of lavage fluid volume in the etiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract
      infections, ranging from 60ml to 250ml ever reported in literature.

      Less lavage volume would be more safer in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
      The investigators hypothesize that microbiological yield would be no significant difference
      in patients with low volume ï¼ˆ60ml) compared with large volume (120ml).

      The purpose of this study is to explore a more effective and safer way of bronchoalveolar
      lavage in lower respiratory tract infection patients, and determine the pathogenic
      distribution among them.
