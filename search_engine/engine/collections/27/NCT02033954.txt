    
      Prospective, non-randomized, multi-center confirmatory observational study for the treatment
      of subjects with the need for vascular occlusion for the following conditions:

        1. Stopping blood loss from a damaged blood vessel from a traumatic vascular injury

        2. Hemorrhage caused by a neoplasia

        3. Neoplastic process (tumor)

        4. Gastrointestinal bleeding

        5. Closing an abnormal blood vessel supplying a vascular anomaly such as arteriovenous
           malformations or an arteriovenous fistula

        6. Interrupting blood supply to an organ or part of an organ for permanent
           devascularization

        7. Devascularization of tissues involved by a neoplastic process either pre-operatively or
           as a palliative measure

        8. Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS)
