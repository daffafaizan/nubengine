    
      Dupuytren's disease is characterised by retractile fibrosis of the superficial palmar
      aponeurosis that can result in irreversible flexing of the fingers and long-term disability.
      The treatment of Dupuytren's disease, whether medical or surgical, remains symptomatic. It is
      based in Europe on percutaneous needle aponeurotomy and surgical aponeurectomy. Its
      objectives are the reduction of the deformity of the fingers in flexum, and that of the
      incapacity that generates the illness. Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's
      disease was developed by Jean-Luc Lermusiaux in 1972 in the Rheumatology Department of the
      Lariboisi√®re Hospital in Paris. Its efficiency, its tolerance, its simplicity, its low cost
      and the possibility of repeating it make it a benchmark treatment. Percutaneous needle
      aponeurotomy is, for many, if the existence of this technique is known and understood, the
      first-line treatment of Dupuytren's disease.

      As part of a graduated medical-surgical strategy, and in our practice, surgery for
      Dupuytren's disease appears as a second-line treatment indicated in a situation of failure
      after treatment with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. The safety and efficacy of the surgery
      was evaluated in the context of a first-line treatment of Dupuytren's disease. The results of
      second-line surgery in terms of safety and efficacy have not been specifically evaluated in
      patients who underwent failed percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. This evaluation nevertheless
      appears necessary for the validation of a medical-surgical strategy during Dupuytren's
      disease.
