      airway exclusion pathway similar to previously described acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) in other viral syndromes (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Lung neutrophilia in
      ARDS is related to significant neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production and formation.
      Thus, NET production is likely contributing to the severe lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 (Yu
      Zuo et al. Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight. 2020). Recent connections have been
      made between NET formation in SARS-CoV-2 patients and excessive thrombosis and the
      development of cytokine storm further warranting evaluation as a potential site for
      consideration of treatment (Barnes, Betsy et al. J exp Med. 2020). Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme)
      is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I, that acts as a mucolytic by cleaving
      extracellular chromosomal DNA from NETs and other cell-free DNA. Unknown are the effects of
      dornase alfa therapy on SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS and if therapy with dornase alfa truly
      reduces the amount of NETs in the severely damaged lungs.

      This study is a non-randomized, single-center, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the
      potential benefit and cellular mechanism of nebulized dornase alfa administration in
      mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS. Evaluation of dornase alfa
      effects at a cellular level will be measured by analysis of blood samples before and after
      the 3 days of therapy for cell-free DNA, quantification of citrullinated histone H3,
      quantification of Myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage
      samples for quantification of NETs and cell count and differential.
