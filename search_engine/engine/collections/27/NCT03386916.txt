      biology. So biopsies are done several times during cancer progression. But risk is high for a
      lung biopsy with enough sample, so a CT scan guide percutaneous biopsy of lytic bone
      metastases of lung cancer can be an alternative.

      In case of primary lung cancer, bone metastases biopsy can be done in initial diagnosis or
      follow-up. But this contribution in diagnostic (anatomopathologic an molecular biology) is
      poorly understood. It is demonstrated that to sample on lytic bone lesion have a failure rate
      lower than on calcified osseous lesion. Nevertheless, any study focus on rentability and
      biopsy complications of lytic bone lesion for the context of lung cancer.

      this study aims to demonstrate that CT scan guide percutaneous biopsy of lytic bone lesion
      help to anatomopathologic diagnosis and molecular biology with a low complication rate
      inasmuch a lung cancer is suspected.

      This study is observational, retrospective, descriptive, one-center Patient's records
      selection will be done by keyword search on the CHU Grenoble Alpes radiology software. Only
      records with bone biopsy register between January 2010 and June 2017 will be included.
