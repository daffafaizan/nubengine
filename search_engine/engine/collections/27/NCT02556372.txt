    
      This is a Phase 2, pilot study in which JKB-122 is given once daily for 24 weeks to subjects
      with AIH who have liver enzymes that are 1.25 to 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and
      who have had a failed response to, incomplete response to, intolerant to, ineligible to or
      unwilling to take current immunosuppressant therapies. Current immunosuppressant therapy is
      defined as prednisone or other steroids with or without azathioprine. Failed response is
      defined as being non-responsive to or worsening in symptoms (elevated Alanine
      Aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or total bilirubin) despite
      compliance with the standard of care (SOC) over a 6 months period. Incomplete response is
      defined as lack of a sustained normalization of elevated ALT/AST to current standard of care
      (SOC) for at least 6 months. "Refractory" to the current therapy includes patients who had a
      failed response to, or incomplete response to the current therapy.

      Subjects will be at least 18 years of age, either male or female and will have been on
      therapy for AIH and have not had a normalization of ALT with the current therapy.
