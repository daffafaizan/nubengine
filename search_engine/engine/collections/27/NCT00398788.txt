      from phase I through phase III by the researchers), non-comparative, open-label, repeated
      dose study of OROS® hydromorphone HCL consisting of 3 phases: Phase 1 - prior opioid
      stabilization phase (2-7 days); Phase 2 - OROS® hydromorphone HCL conversion, titration, and
      stabilization phase (3 - 14 days); Phase 3 - OROS® hydromorphone HCL maintenance therapy
      phase (28 days) Before Phase 1, patients must have had no change in their prescribed opioid
      regimen over the prior 30 days. During Phase 1, patients were to have demonstrated 2
      consecutive days of stable baseline oral or transdermal opioid medication.

      During Phase 2, patients requiring =96 mg OROS® hydromorphone HCL every 24 hours converted to
      a once-daily dosing OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose at approximately a 5:1 morphine to
      hydromorphone equivalent ratio. OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose titration (25-100% baseline
      dose) was allowed every 2 days to achieve stabilization. OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose
      reduction was allowed during Phases 2 and 3 for opioid-related adverse events (AEs). Rescue
      medication, Dilaudid IR (immediate release) was allowed during all 3 phases. During Phase 3,
      patients attended 4 weekly study visits to provide diary information about study medication
      and rescue medication usage, daily pain relief scores and adverse events, and to receive
      weekly supplies of study medications. OROS® hydromorphone HCL tablets of 8,16, 32, or 64 mg
      depending on Phase I stable baseline oral or transdermal opioid medication, 2-7 days; study
      drug dose titration was allowed every 2 days to achieve stabilization in Phase II, 3-14 days;
      Phase III , maintenance therapy phase 28 days; study drug dose reduction was allowed during
      Phase 2 and 3 for opioid-related adverse events. Rescue medication of Dilaudid IR (immediate
      release) 2, 4, 8mg tablets were allowed during all phase.
