      have seizures despite optimal medication. The only realistic prospect of seizure freedom,
      feasible in very few cases, is surgery to remove the brain area where seizures arise.

      Patients with refractory neocortical epilepsy who are being evaluated for surgical resection
      of the seizure focus will be invited to join the trial. The non-integrating lentiviral
      vector, which has been engineered to deliver an engineered potassium channel, will be
      administered via intracerebral infusion to the area scheduled for resection.

      The primary objective in this study is to test the safety of the lentiviral gene therapy
      treatment, including the surgical procedures required for vector administration. Secondary
      objectives will look at delayed onset adverse events and indicators of efficacy.
