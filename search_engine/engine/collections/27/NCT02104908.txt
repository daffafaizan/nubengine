      randomly assigned to 2 groups: a lumbar and sacral plexus block(LS) group with 20ml 0.5%
      ropivacaine at lumbar plexus(level L3-4) and 10ml 0.5%ropivacaine at sacral plexus; a lumbar,
      sacral plexus and paravertebral nerve block(LSP) group with 20ml 0.5% ropivacaine at lumbar
      plexus(level L3-4) , 10ml 0.5%ropivacaine at sacral plexus and 10ml 0.5%ropivacaine at
      paravertebral nerve(level L1). The target-controlled propofol infusion is started immediately
      after positioning the patient on the operating table. The initial target concentration was
      0.5μg/mL. The infusion rate is adjusted every 5min by increasing or decreasing the target
      concentration by 0.2μg/mL steps based on the patients' respiratory rate(RR), blood
      pressure(BP), heart rate(HR), and level of sedation(score of 5 on Ramsay Sedation Scale ).
      The minimal, maximal, optimal target concentration, cumulative propofol dose, frequency of
      spontaneous movement and incidences of associated complications are recorded. Patients were
      phoned for followup and questioned for activity status in one year. If the patients were
      dead, date of death; if they survived, daily living activity questioned.
