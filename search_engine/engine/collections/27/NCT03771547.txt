      during ERCP in elderly patients and its role as a risk factor for adverse events.

      METHODS: A total of 614 patients, with a mean age of 65.3±16.7 years, underwent ERCP during
      the study period, were prospectively managed and divided into two groups based on their age.
      There were 146 patients aged 80 years or older in group A with the mean age of 84±3.4 years.
      The primary outcome measurements were the difficulty grade of papilla cannulation, clinical
      outcomes, and ERCP-related complications in the two groups. The adverse events were analyzed
      by logistic regression about patient age, co-morbidities, indications, and difficult
      cannulation grading.
