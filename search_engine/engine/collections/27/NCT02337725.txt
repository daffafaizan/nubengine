    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVP-1012 in Japanese participants with early
      Parkinson's disease.

      The study period consisted of a 28-week trial period. The participants who fulfill the
      inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion criteria were enrolled, and
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the 1 mg of TVP-1012 or the placebo group. In each
      treatment group, participants received either 1 mg of TVP-1012 or placebo once daily in a
      double-blinded manner.
