      disability and death. The problems associated with the condition may continue into adulthood;
      therefore, early identification and effective treatment of adolescent depression is critical.
      Studies indicate that depressed adolescents experience greater variations in sleep and
      hormone patterns than depressed adults. These variations may influence responses to
      antidepressant treatment. This study will examine the mechanisms underlying developmental
      differences in sleep and hormone patterns to develop a strategy for identifying adolescents
      and adults who could benefit from antidepressant treatment.

      This study will last approximately 10 weeks. At study start, participants will wear an
      activity monitor on their wrist and keep track of their nightly sleep schedule to establish
      baseline measures. This will continue for 2 weeks. During the second week of wearing this
      watch the participant will be asked to come in for a sleep study. This study will consist of
      two initial nights in the sleep lab and then two more nights in the lab a week later.
      Participants will be able to leave during the day. Upon completing the sleep assessment,
      participants will receive bupropion twice daily for 8 weeks. Upon completion of this 8-week
      treatment, participants will be interviewed to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. One
      follow-up meeting will occur 6 months post-treatment.
