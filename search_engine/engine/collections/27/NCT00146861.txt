      patients and compare changes in quality of life and physical activity between patients
      randomized to receive rate response driven by either blended sensor or accelerometer. Changes
      in chronotropic response between CI patients randomized to either blended sensor or
      accelerometer will be compared. A sub-study will evaluate changes in functional capacity
      between CI patients randomized to either blended sensor or accelerometer.
