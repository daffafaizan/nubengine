      that it affects patients in a wide spectrum in terms of their clinical features worldwide. It
      is known that age, gender, and comorbidity play an important role in the course of the
      disease. Although mortality rates vary from country to country, there is no clear information
      due to the fact that the pandemic has not yet ended. In this study, the investigators planned
      to examine the laboratory characteristics of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of
      Covid-19 and to investigate their relationship with mortality in Istanbul city which is the
      most affected by the pandemic in Turkey
