      cholangiopancreatoscopy using a thin, disposable, flexible endoscope performed by
      gastroenterological endoscopists and/or interventional radiologists in procedures including
      but not limited to:

        -  PTCS for tissue diagnosis in cases of surgically or pathologically-altered anatomy,

        -  PTCS for stone removal after surgically or pathologically-altered anatomy,

        -  Percutaneous rendezvous to aid ERCP after failed endoscopic cannulation,

        -  Percutaneous delivery of palliative intraluminal brachytherapy,

        -  Intra-procedural percutaneous salvage procedures when an initial route of access fails
