      I. To compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV
      melanoma treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo versus carboplatin, paclitaxel and
      sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate).

      II. To compare progression-free survival, response rate, and safety of patients with
      unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo
      versus carboplatin, paclitaxel and sorafenib.

      III. To analyze the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic properties of sorafenib including
      angiogenesis, monooxygenases polymorphisms and multidrug resistance (MDR).

      IV. To assess the association of expression markers in the patient tumor with clinical
      outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Patients also receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      (approximately every 12 hours) on days 2-19.

      Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also receive
      placebo PO BID (approximately every 12 hours) on days 2-19.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 10 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or who achieve a partial
      response or complete response may continue to receive sorafenib tosylate or placebo alone BID
      (approximately every 12 hours) on days 1-21. Courses with sorafenib tosylate or placebo
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
