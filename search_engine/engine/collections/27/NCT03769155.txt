    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 (pepinemab) in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors on T cell infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment in involved and uninvolved
      lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors on the
      immune profile of involved and uninvolved lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

      II. Assess safety and tolerability of profile and tolerability of single agent VX15/2503 to
      the combination of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable
      metastatic melanoma.

      III. Document pathologic response rates of single agent VX15/2503 and combination VX15/2503
      and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable melanoma.

      IV. Compare pathologic response to radiographic response using Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients receiving single agent VX15/2503 and
      combination VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable melanoma.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 5 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and nivolumab IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo surgery between days 35-49.

      ARM II: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 21 and undergo surgery between days 35-49.

      ARM III: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes, nivolumab IV over 30 minutes, and
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo between days 35-49.

      ARM IV: Participants nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo between days
      35-49.

      ARM V: Participants undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 90 days, every 12 weeks
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually up to 10 years.
