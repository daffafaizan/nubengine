      associated with postoperative morbidity. External compression from advancing tumor or tissue
      growth through the stent can cause stenosis or re-obstruction. In these patients, the
      creation of a patent fistula that allows gastric emptying may significantly improve
      palliation. Minimally invasive techniques that carry no greater risks than enteral stenting
      may provide a viable palliative treatment. The primary objectives are safety, and successful
      creation of a gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Secondary objectives are successful resumption or
      improvement in the ability to tolerate PO feeding, rate of stent migration, and duration of
      stent and anastomosis patency.
