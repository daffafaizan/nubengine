      this study include:

        -  to describe the pathology underlying low bone mineral density

        -  to assess the relationship between low bone mineral density and antiretroviral therapy
           exposure

        -  to assess the relationship between low bone mineral density and vitamin D /PTH status
           and/or markers of bone metabolism

        -  to assess the relationship between osteopenia and subsequent changes in bone mineral
           density and markers of bone metabolism

        -  to assess the validity of the currently available fracture risk assessment tool in
           predicting fractures in HIV positive populations
