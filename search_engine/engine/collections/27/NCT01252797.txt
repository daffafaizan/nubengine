      radiosurgery (SRS) in the treatment of brain metastases. Patients will be placed in one of
      two dose groups based on index tumor size, and dose will be adjusted according to presence or
      absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

      Group A: Index Tumor > 2 cm and up to 4 cm in maximum diameter Group B: Index Tumor > 4 cm
      and up to 6 cm in maximum diameter

      Dose escalation or de-escalation will be conducted via a modified 3+3 method at the following
      levels. Group A will start at dose level II. Group B will start at dose level I.

      Dose Level I: 12 Gy Dose Level II: 15 Gy
