      I. To define the clinical phenotype of young-onset versus (vs.) later onset colorectal cancer
      (CRC), including clinicopathologic characteristics, tumor molecular markers, family history,
      and associated lifestyle/environmental factors.

      II. To examine germline genetic alterations in patients with young-onset (diagnosed between
      age 18 and 50), CRC and those of their first-degree relatives, in comparison to those in
      patients with later-onset (diagnosed at age 51 or older) CRC.

      III. To determine the frequency of the mutations and pattern of inheritance of the mutations
      identified above in this patient population.

      IV. To correlate molecular findings to clinical endpoints of survival and disease recurrence
      and/or progression in patients with young-onset vs. later-onset CRC.

      V. To compare the treatments received by patients with young-onset vs. later-onset CRC and
      their subsequent survivorship experiences.

      OUTLINE:

      PATIENTS: Patients complete questionnaires over 30-50 minutes about work, family history,
      medical history, health habits, and experience as a cancer survivor (quality of life,
      well-being, concerns, types of health care, and follow-up care received). Active patients,
      who have undergone treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center within the past year, complete
      additional questionnaires at enrollment, 6 months, 12 months after treatment completion, and
      then every years for up to 6 years. Also, active patients who are consented to the study more
      than 5 years from surgery, they may complete the survivorship questionnaire once. Patients
      medical records are also reviewed.

      FAMILY MEMBERS: Participants complete questionnaires over 10-15 minutes. Participants also
      undergo collection of blood or saliva samples once.
