      reducing SSI (RCTs: OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.88; observational studies: OR 0.58; 95% CI
      0.40-0.83). As there are no clinical trials focusing on cesarean delivery, and because the
      risk factors and pathogenesis for post-cesarean SSI may not mirror other procedures, further
      data is needed before generalizing the WHO recommendations to cesarean procedures.
