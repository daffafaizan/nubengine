      some extent. There, they act in an anti-inflammatory manner, as was first described for the
      serine protease trypsin. Similarly, the cysteine protease bromelain, extracted from the stems
      of pineapples, is an effective phytotherapeutical drug with anti-inflammatory
      properties.Proteases have also been indicated to show a certain improvement of the fluidity
      of the blood. An additional component of the oral enzyme combination can be rutoside, or
      rutin, a flavonoid known to have cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties.
