      is one of the common causes of admission to hospital and the commonest cause of death in
      Ugandan children under 5 years of age. The signs of pneumonia also occur in children with
      asthma making it difficult to differentiate the two. Other researchers have found that one of
      two children under five years of age with pneumonia have asthma. Wheeze which is regarded as
      a sign of asthma is heard in only one of three children with asthma, implying that many
      children with asthma especially in the first few years of life are less likely to be
      diagnosed. They are also less likely to receive inhaled steroids, the recommended treatment
      for asthma. Failure to administer asthma medicines may contribute to delayed improvement and
      increase the risk of death. The study hypothesizes that use of inhaled corticosteroids in
      addition to standard treatment in children hospitalized with ALRI will be associated with
      reduced morbidity and mortality and that the improvement will be more marked in children
      diagnosed with asthma posthoc. Outcomes: Reduction in case fatality, Time to normalization of
      respiratory rate, Time to normalization of oxygen saturation, Duration of hospitalisation.
