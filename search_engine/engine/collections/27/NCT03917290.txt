      i. To determine the effect of a sports injury prevention program on MSK injuries initiated at
      concussion RTP and continued throughout the subsequent athletic season.

      ii. To examine the effect of a neuromuscular training (NMT) program on clinical and
      instrumented postural control measures before and after the intervention.

      The proposed study will use an intervention-based paradigm to further understand MSK injury
      risk after concussion RTP and to identify potential methods to reduce this risk. Common Data
      Element (CDE) and instrumented postural control data will be linked to objectively classify
      the clinical and functional underpinnings of concussion recovery and subsequent MSK injury
      among those engaged in an injury prevention program compared to those who are not. These are
      important elements to investigate because: 1) few studies have explored the mechanisms for
      MSK injury incidence after concussion using a multimodal and objective approach and 2) no
      investigations have examined interventions to improve long-term concussion outcomes initiated
      at RTP.
