      and strictures) following duct-to-duct and roux-en-y biliary reconstruction during right lobe
      living donor liver transplantation.

      Biliary complications are much more common with right lobe living donor liver grafts than
      with whole organ grafts and are considered a major limitation of this surgery. Two surgical
      techniques are currently used for biliary reconstruction and each has its
      advantages/disadvantages. However, it is unclear which technique leads to fewer biliary
      complications. Retrospective studies which examine biliary complication rates may be hampered
      by such factors as a surgeon's bias or inexperience with a particular technique. Therefore a
      prospective randomized trial is needed.
