      associated with Th2-mediated immune response in asthma and related to the characteristics of
      Th1-mediated immunity in COPD . Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is the term to describe patients
      who have features of both asthma and COPD, recomÂ¬mended by the 2019 Global Initiative for
      Asthma (GINA) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstruction Lung Disease (GOLD)
      guidelines. Patients with asthma and COPD are commonly seen in clinical practice. In
      addition, compared with patients with asthma or COPD alone, patients with ACO experience
      frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations, have poor quality of life, a more rapid decline
      in lung function and high mortality, and consume a disproportionate amount of health care
      resources than asthma or COPD alone .

      Cell count in induced sputum is a noninvasive biomarker to assess airway inflammation
      phenotypes. Accordingly, sputum cell counts are extensively used in the treatment of asthma
      and COPD. Nevertheless, the clinical application of sputum cell counts in patients with
      asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) remains elusive .
