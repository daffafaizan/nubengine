      care settings. Task-sharing, which involves building capacity of frontline non-specialist
      health workers to deliver evidence-based treatment for common mental disorders such as
      depression, is an effective approach for bridging these gaps in available care. This
      emphasizes the need for novel approaches to scale up training efforts and to support the
      development of a skilled and competent workforce capable of delivering high quality treatment
      for depression in primary care settings. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare
      two forms of digital training (i.e., low-intensity and high-intensity) with traditional
      face-to-face training of non-specialist health workers to deliver an evidence-based brief
      psychological treatment for depression called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) in primary
      care settings in India. This trial uses a 3-arm randomized controlled design. This study will
      evaluate a low-intensity digital training (DGT) compared with traditional face-to-face
      training (F2F) on change in competence outcomes and cost-effectiveness; and evaluate a
      high-intensity digital training with the addition of individualized coaching support (DGT+)
      compared with traditional F2F on change in competence outcomes and cost-effectiveness. In
      this trial, a total of 336 non-specialist health workers will be recruited from community
      health centers in Sehore District of Madhya Pradesh, a large and predominantly rural state
      situated in central India. This trial will generate knowledge on the most effective and
      cost-effective approaches to address the critical knowledge gap regarding the training of
      non-specialist health workers to deliver an evidence-based brief psychological treatment for
      depression in a low-resource setting. The findings from this trial will inform broader
      efforts to develop a mental health workforce necessary for scaling up brief psychological
      therapies for common mental disorders.
