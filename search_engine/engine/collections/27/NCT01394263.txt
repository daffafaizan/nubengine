    
      This trial was an open-label, randomized, parallel treatment, active-control multicenter
      study in adult males with documented metastatic prostate cancer disease who were judged to be
      candidates for hormone therapy.

      Within 21 days prior to implant insertion, all prospective enrollees were entered into a
      screening period to provide medical history, demographic information, physical examination,
      laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECG, bone scan, chest x-ray, liver ultrasound, concomitant
      medications and procedures, and a physician assessment including pain level and WHO
      performance scale in order to assess eligibility for the study. Written informed consent was
      obtained before any procedures were undertaken.

      Once inclusion/exclusion criteria were met, baseline evaluations (physical assessment and
      examination, vital signs and weight, clinical laboratory evaluations, concomitant medications
      and procedures, adverse events, and a Quality of Life questionnaire) were obtained prior to
      implant insertion on Day 1 [Visit 1]. All appropriately screened patients were to then
      receive either histrelin acetate 50-mg or Zoladex 3-Month 10.8 mg implant based on 1:1
      randomization at Day 1 [Visit 1]. Patients with implants were evaluated at Week 1 and 2
      [Visits 2 and 3] post-insertion for testosterone and PSA concentrations, vital signs, adverse
      events, and concomitant medications and procedures. The Zoladex implants were replaced at
      Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 [Visits 6, 9, 12, and 15], while the histrelin acetate implants were
      replaced at Week 52 (Visit 16), respectively. Patients were followed monthly from Weeks 4 to
      60 [Visits 4 to 18] to evaluate testosterone and PSA concentrations, adverse events,
      concomitant medications and procedures, disease progression, and urine and serum histrelin in
      the renal/hepatic impairment subgroup. Periodic clinical and subjective assessments were
      completed for all patients.
