      exercise performance, it recently appeared that regular physical exercise practiced
      aerobically could improve the clinical status of asthmatic patients.

      The investigators are planning a 12-week randomized controlled study to assess the effect of
      regular aerobic exercise on quality of life, asthma control, bronchial hyperresponsiveness
      and bronchial and systemic inflammation in patients with persistent asthma

      The hypothesis is that regular physical exercise increases control and quality of life and
      reduces inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to simple physiotherapy
      sessions.
