      greater than 99% efficacy per year of use and are completely reversible .

      Post-placental intrauterine device (IUD) insertion is a safe, convenient, and effective
      option for postpartum contraception. "Post-placental" refers to insertion within 10-15
      minutes of placental delivery, after vaginal or cesarean delivery.
