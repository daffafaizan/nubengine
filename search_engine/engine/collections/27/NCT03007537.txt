      assigned into the control group or erythropoietin group.Interventions will be applied 1
      day(24hrs) before the cardiac surgery. Blood and Urine samples will be collected after the
      surgery. By using the criterion given by KDIGO2012 and testing the biomarkers for acute
      kidney injury, we hope to find out if there is an association between erythropoietin
      administration and the occurence of acute kidney injury.
