      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-dose melphalan when administered with
           palifermin in patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
           for stage II or III multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess overall response (complete and partial response and stable disease) in these
           patients at 28 and 100 days post-transplantation.

        -  Assess the efficacy of palifermin as a cytoprotective agent in reducing incidence and
           duration of mucositis in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess patient-reported outcomes and impact of palifermin on quality of life of these
           patients.

        -  Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan. Patients are stratified according to
      creatinine clearance (normal vs < 60 mL/min).

      Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV on day -2 and palifermin IV on days -5 to -3 and 1-3.
      Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      In each stratum, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients complete questionnaires about overall health, mouth and throat soreness (MTS), and
      activity limitations due to MTS once daily on days -5 to 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at days 28 and 100 and then
      periodically thereafter.
