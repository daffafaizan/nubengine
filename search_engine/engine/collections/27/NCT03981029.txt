      high dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on the prevention of preeclampsia (PE) in a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

      The primary objective of the FACT Biomarker Subgroup Analysis is to determine the folate
      status and its impact on risk for PE in a subgroup of women participating in FACT. Our
      secondary objectives are to:

      i) To determine serum vitamin B6 and B12 status, modifiers of folate metabolism, and their
      impact on risk for PE in women participating in the FACT

      ii) To determine plasma homocysteine status, a folate-responsive biomarker for PE risk, and
      its relationship with risk for PE in women participating in the FACT

      iii) To determine the modifying effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key
      folate metabolic enzymes (MTHFR, MTHFD1, MTR) on PE risk in women participating in the FACT

      iv) To determine the effect of folic acid supplementation and folate status on biomarkers of
      PE (sFLT, sENG, PlGF) and their association with PE risk in women participating in the FACT

      Folate biomarker analyses will provide key information to identify modifiers of the response
      to folic acid treatment and elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the relationship between
      folic acid treatment and PE risk. Folate status will vary in response to folic acid treatment
      depending on a number of factors including compliance in taking the study supplement, folate
      intake from the diet (natural folate and folic acid used for enrichment), vitamin B12 status,
      and genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in folate metabolism that have been shown to
      effect placental development/function. As such, variation in the response to folic acid
      treatment may account for differences in observed PE risk.

      Folic acid supplementation may also reduce homocysteine, its related endothelial dysfunction
      and consequently reduce PE risk. In addition, homocysteine metabolism is dependent on
      vitamins B12 and B6, the deficiency of which can result in hyperhomocysteinemia. Thus,
      homocysteine, B12 and B6 will each be evaluated.

      Lastly, it will be useful to assess biomarkers of placental health and PE risk (sFlt-1, sEng,
      PlGF) that are found in maternal circulation and determine their association with folate
      intake and status.
