      peristalsis seems to be most important for correct sperm transport towards the fallopian
      tubes and implantation of the embryo. At the same time, an impaired uterine peristalsis is
      discussed to be the reason for lower pregnancy rates and may account for dysmenorrhea and
      menorrhagia. The connection of impaired peristalsis and various clinical symptoms has been
      shown for patients with e.g. leiomyoma and endometriosis, but not for women with adenomyosis,
      though the concept seems to be widely accepted.

      It has also been repeatedly postulated that impaired peristalsis interferes with implantation
      of the embryo, yet Martinez-Conejero published a trial that showed a higher incidence of
      miscarriage, but no effect on embryo implantation in women undergoing oocyte donation. This
      might either indicate that the postulated effect of peristalsis is wrong or, more likely,
      since this is a study in an IVF setting, that hormonal treatment with gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone (GnRH)-agonist could improve implantation.

      It is possible to monitor peristalsis with transvaginal ultrasound and standard patterns of
      uterine peristalsis are defined by Jiland already in 1996.

      Findings resulting from the investigations in this study may help to determine the role and
      extent of impaired peristalsis in women with adenomyosis and possibly give new clues on
      potential treatments, as well as fill a gap in today's knowledge.
