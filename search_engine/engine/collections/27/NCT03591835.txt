      distress. The ideal location of the tube is between the top of the 1st thoracic vertebra and
      the bottom of the 2nd thoracic vertebra in the X-ray. Clinicians use different methods to
      estimate the intubation insertion depth.

      In this study, investigators aimed to compare the two different methods (kilogram+6 cm and
      nasal septum-tragus length (NTL)+ 1 cm) used to determine the endotracheal intubation
      insertion depth.

      In this multicentre randomized prospective study, infants who had intubation indications in
      neonatal intensive care unit will be enrolled. The intubation tube will be fixed at the lip
      level using the Tochen formula (Group 1) or the NTL+1 cm formula (Group 2). The same brand
      endotracheal tubes will be used and after intubation the chest radiograph will be performed
      in the neutral position. Chest X-ray will be evaluated blindly by a single radiologist in the
      digital environment (above T1, in place and below T2).
