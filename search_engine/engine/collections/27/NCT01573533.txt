    
      This is a pilot trial to assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of Rituximab therapy in
      20 adult and pediatric patients with either steroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor resistant
      FSGS or with a significant intolerance or contraindication to the use of these agents. In
      addition to clinical criteria, elevated levels of suPAR will define inclusion. Changes in the
      baseline levels of the potential biomarkers (suPAR, as well as activation of beta-3 integrin)
      in response to treatment will be compared to clinical measures of efficacy.

      Participants will have a screening/baseline visit to confirm eligibility within 6 weeks prior
      to the first of two Rituximab infusions (at Day 1 and Day 15). Participants will then attend
      follow up visits at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after Rituximab treatment to assess adverse events
      and collect safety blood and urine samples.
