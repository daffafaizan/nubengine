    
      Aortic dissection (AD) is a condition in which a disruption of the medial layer (in most
      cases provoked by a tear or an ulcer in the intima) results in separation of the aortic wall
      layers, with concomitant 'false lumen' formation and malperfusion of end organs.

      The underlying mechanism of the condition has, until recently, remained unclear. The Pi of
      the present sutdy has shed light on a mechanism that shows that inflammation underlies the
      condition. The PI of the present study has showed that inflammation in the aorta is triggered
      by macrophage infiltration into the aortic wall in both pre-clinical models using animal
      models of the condition (murine) and in patient tissue samples obtained at time of surgery.

      Macrophage infiltration into the aortic wall, as a result of activation of the cytokine,
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), is the trigger for an inflammatory
      cascade that is presently understood to underlie the pathogenic mechanism of the condition

      Non-invasive assessment of macrophage infiltration would prove that this pathogenic mechanism
      exists (proof-of-concept). Macrophage infiltration has been shown to be feasible by
      contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using ultrasmall super paramagnetic iron
      oxides (USPIOs).

      The hypothesis of the present study is that macrophage-mediated inflammation can be
      visualised in the aorta of patients with AD using the USPIO-enhanced MRI technique, and use
      the present study to confirm this (proof-of-concept).
