      digestive enzyme dietary supplement product, on markers indicative of inflammation after a
      meal. The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over type
      study. The markers will be assessed by blood levels TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and hsCRP at
      times 0, 45 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-meal. A full blood CBC panel and an ESR blood
      test will also be conducted at times 0 and 4 hours post-meal. In addition, a questionaire on
      Gastrointestinal symptoms will be administered 4 hours post-meal. The study hypothesis is
      that some or all of these potential markers of inflammation will increase following the meal,
      and the amount of increase in inflammation will be attenuated when a digestive enzyme is
      consumed with the meal compared to the placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that levels
      of gastric discomfort as assessed by the questionaire will be reduced with the digestive
      enzyme compared to the placebo.
