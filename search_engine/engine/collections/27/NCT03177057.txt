      I. To test the effects of a behavior tracking and individually-tailored daily text message
      intervention on sun protection and exposure behaviors and to see if these techniques will be
      most effective in conjunction or separately.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine mediators in the effects of the intervention on safe sun behaviors, based on
      Fishbein?s Integrative Model.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 study arms.

      ARM I (SELF-MONITORING): Patients complete tanning and sun protection usage entries daily for
      14 days.

      ARM II (TEXT MESSAGES): Patients receive individualized text messages based on baseline
      assessment of tanning motives (appearance, enjoyment, social) daily for 14 days.

      ARM III (COMBINED GROUP): Patients complete tanning and sun protection usage entries and also
      receive individualized text messages daily for 14 days.

      ARM IV (CONTROL GROUP): Patients complete study assessments.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.
