      psychological stress related to concerns about adult height. Additionally, extreme short
      stature often presents life-long emotional, social, and physical obstacles to the affected
      individual. The onset of puberty in such patients presents a critical management problem
      because puberty initiates the process of epiphyseal closure that terminates linear growth.
      Until recently, there was no way to delay the onset of puberty in such patients. The
      development of synthetic LHRH analogs, however, has provided such a method. Administration of
      such analogs to children with precocious puberty caused a regression of their clinical signs
      of puberty, a decrease in their gonadotropins and sex steroids, and a slowing of the rate of
      bone age advancement.

      We propose to treat pubertal children with extreme short stature with a long-acting analog of
      luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRHa). The goal of LHRHa treatment in
      these children is to halt the normal progression into puberty and thereby delay epiphyseal
      fusion. We postulate that delay of puberty will prolong pre-pubertal growth prior to the
      pubertal spurt and subsequent epiphyseal fusion, and thus will enhance ultimate height. This
      study will test this hypothesis through a double-blind, randomized comparison of the effect
      of LHRHa and placebo on final adult height. Patients will be treated with LHRHa or placebo
      for 4 years, and will then be followed until they have completed puberty and have stopped
      growing.
