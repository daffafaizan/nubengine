    
      This study will evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a
      recombinant, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, LID/ΔM2-2/1030s, in
      RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive a single dose of
      intranasal RSV LID/ΔM2-2/1030s vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0). Group 1 (intensive)
      and Group 2 (less intensive) will differ only in the frequency of study visits and nasal swab
      collections.

      Participants will receive study product between April 1 and October 15, outside of the RSV
      season, and will remain on the study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between
      April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study
      duration is between 6 and 13 months, depending upon time of enrollment.

      Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study, which may include blood
      collection, nasal swabs, and physical examinations.
