      sleep. In this model, BT for insomnia directly targets nighttime symptoms of insomnia (BT
      pathway), which improves sleep by increasing the homeostatic drive for sleep. Although BT is
      hypothesized to indirectly reduce arousal, no study has specifically investigated this
      effect. In contrast, MBSR is an intervention that is hypothesized to target arousal and, as
      preliminary findings suggest, also improves some symptoms of insomnia (MBSR pathway). It is
      therefore hypothesized that a combination of BT and mindfulness is superior to each treatment
      alone as it targets both nighttime symptoms and hyperarousal (Mindfulness + BT pathway). Our
      preliminary data suggests that this combination treatment has effects on both self-reported
      arousal and sleep. Conceptually, this novel approach would provide a set of self-regulating
      skills that could potentially target a broader range of daytime and nighttime symptoms that
      is characteristic of an insomnia disorder.

      To test the conceptual model, this study employs a randomized clinical trial design with
      three conditions: 1) Mindfulness-Based Therapy for insomnia (MBT-I), 2) mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR), and 3) delayed-treatment condition followed by behavior therapy for
      insomnia (BT-I). Each of the three treatments will be delivered in a group format with 8
      weekly sessions spanning an 8-week period.
