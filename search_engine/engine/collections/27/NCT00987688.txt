      Emergency Department. POLAR study trained paramedics and physicians will screen patients in
      the pre-hospital setting. Eligible patients will be randomised if they fulfil the inclusion
      criteria with no pre-hospital exclusion criteria. Those randomised to the normothermia group
      will follow standard care. For those randomised to the "cooling arm", pre-hospital
      prophylactic hypothermia will be induced by exposure and by infusing up to 2 litres
      intravenous cold (4°C) 0.9% sodium chloride aiming for a core temperature of 35°C during
      transport. In the emergency department the "cooling arm" patients will be assessed to exclude
      significant bleeding and, once significant bleeding has been excluded, surface cooling
      vests/wraps will be applied to reach the target core temperature of 33°C. The patient will be
      then maintained at this temperature for a further 72 hours. Patients with significant
      bleeding will have cooling withheld until it is safe to decrease the temperature to the
      target core temperature of 33°C. Patients who have not been randomised pre-hospital will be
      re-screened in the ED. Eligible patients will be randomised if they fulfil the inclusion
      criteria with no ED exclusion criteria. Hypothermia will be induced by administration of up
      to 2L intravenous ice-cold (4°C) 0.9% sodium chloride followed by application of the surface
      cooling vests/wraps to achieve the target core temperature of 33°C. Patients allocated to
      standard 'normothermic' care will be maintained at a core temperature of 37°C ± 0.5°C.
