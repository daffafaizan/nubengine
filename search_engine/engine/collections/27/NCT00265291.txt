      desipramine. All subjects have a comprehensive psychiatric and medical assessment, and if
      enrolled, continued with two consecutive phases of the study: 1) A one-week, single-blind
      placebo lead-in phase to eliminate placebo responders. 2) Subsequent random assignment to one
      of two treatment groups: fluoxetine 10-40 mg/day or desipramine 50-200 mg/day. Given the
      proven efficacy of these antidepressant medications, a placebo lead-in period followed by
      active treatment for all patients has been utilized in order to minimize human subjects at
      risk.
