    
      Patients of IU Health Physicians Urology who have been scheduled to undergo percutaneous
      removal of one or more kidney stones will be asked to consent to be part of our registry and
      database for percutaneous procedures. The database contains information about the subjects
      surgery, such as stone size and location, number of access sites to remove the stone, length
      of stay in the hospital, secondary procedures, etc. This information is reviewed periodically
      to look for trends so that physicians may find ways to improve the percutaneous procedure.
      All information in the database is kept confidential. Data is collected at follow-up
      appointments at one month and one year to see if the subject is still stone free.
