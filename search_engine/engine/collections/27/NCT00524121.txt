    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the overall survival of older patients with stage I-IV squamous cell carcinoma or
           adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with erlotinib
           hydrochloride in combination with radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the proportion of patients achieving mucosal complete response after treatment
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the effect of this regimen on dysphagia control, performance status, and overall
           quality of life of these patients.

        -  Investigate the correlation between smoking status and overall survival of these
           patients.

        -  To correlate the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosphor Epidermal growth
           factor receptor (pEGFR) expression by IHC and EGFR mutation status with clinical
           outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a
      week in weeks 1-4 or 5 days a week for the first 5.5 weeks.

      Tumor tissue samples are analyzed by IHC for the expression of E-cadherin, P-cadherin,
      vimentin, cytokeratin, phospho-S6, and Ki67.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and annually
      thereafter.
