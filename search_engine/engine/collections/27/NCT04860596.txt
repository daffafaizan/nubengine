      model on the functional status, self care, depression, quality of life and rehospitalization
      rate of patients with heart failure. This is a three-year project. The first phase
      (introduction phase): A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of collaborative care
      and heart failure patients will be conducted, and relevant research results will be evaluated
      for the clinical benefits of heart failure patients, and empirical knowledge will be proposed
      as The basic holistic conclusions are supported by the research literature on the
      establishment of a collaborative health management model for heart failure (CHMM). The second
      stage (construction period): based on the results of systematic literature review and
      meta-analysis, adopt the CHMM model, design intervention measures, and conduct pilot studies
      to determine the safety and feasibility of the research, and review future research
      improvements Wherever possible, develop more complete intervention measures. The third stage
      (operation period): Randomized controlled trials were adopted, with random sampling and
      double-blind research design. In the cardiology ward of a regional teaching hospital in the
      south, 120 patients with heart failure who met the admission criteria were selected, and 60
      patients were selected as control group. The group received routine care in the hospital, and
      60 of the experimental group received interventions in the collaborative health management
      model, including identifying high-risk patients and tracking them by electronic medical
      records, inter-disciplinary team members discussing patient issues, setting goals together,
      and passing cross-team members Jointly provide professional care, post-discharge outpatient
      and telephone follow-up case self-monitoring status, provide telephone consultation hotline,
      Data collection includes variables such as functional status, self-care behavior, depression,
      quality of life, re-admission rate. Instruments tools include European Heart Failure
      Self-care Behavior Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Minnesota Heart Failure Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, after the intervention 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months.The intervention effect
      will be statistically verified and analyzed by GEE. It is hoped that this care model will be
      applied to the clinical care of patients with heart failure, and will be verified by clinical
      benefits, reduce symptom troubles, improve quality of life, and reduce medical costs.
