      complications. A change of practice should therefore be introduced in the management of
      premature newborns. However, one could assume that probiotic administration before birth
      could be as effective if not more. Indeed, one could hypothesise that when the newborn is
      exposed to probiotics earlier, the protective effect is potentially increased.

      Objective: This pilot project aims at confirming the in-utero transmission of probiotics,
      from the mother to the baby.

      Population: Women aged 18 to 42 years, with a single pregnancy, considered low risk will be
      approached for this study Products under study: Probiotics containing 5 bacterial strains
      (total of 12 million colony-forming unit / day) vs. Placebo.

      Procedure: At 32-33 weeks, participants will complete questionnaires (medical, obstetrical,
      socio-demographic data) and will be randomized (double-blind) in one of the 2 following
      groups:

      Group A: taking probiotics every day from the 34th week of pregnancy until delivery; taking
      placebo for 10 days after delivery.

      Group B: taking placebo every day from the 34th week of pregnancy until delivery; taking
      probiotics for 10 days after delivery.

      Follow-up: All women will complete a logbook to monitor the study products intake and monitor
      side effects until the end of the study (10 days postpartum).

      Samples: maternal stool samples, vaginal secretions, stool (and meconium) as well as breast
      milk (and colostrum) will be taken at different times of the study to confirm the presence of
      probiotics and transmission between the mother and the baby.
