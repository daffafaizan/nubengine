      with varied microbiome fingerprints, vitamin D levels, and blood serotonin levels compared to
      non-IBS patients. The investigators have novel 3-D immunocompetent intestinal models to
      establish a new model of high fidelity disease to examine the relationship of IBS-D patients
      gut microbiome, with supplemental vitamin D levels, and the relationship of blood serotonin
      and vitamin D levels. IBS-D patients and healthy controls will be asked to provide a fecal
      sample, a biopsy sample of colonic tissue obtained during a clinically appropriate flexible
      sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and a blood sample. There will be 1-2 office visits. One visit
      will last 30 minutes, the second visit no longer than 3 hours. This study is funded by a
      combined MAYO-Arizona State University seed grant. The samples will be analyzed at ASU. Our
      long-term goal is to understand the relationship between gut microbiome, vitamin D levels,
      host gene expression, serotonin levels, and IBS-D symptoms that could ultimately be used as a
      testing platform for treatment and prevention of this highly prevalent disorder.
