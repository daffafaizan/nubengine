        -  To assess the efficacy and safety of docetaxel and cetuximab in patients with
           docetaxel-resistant hormone-refractory prostate cancer

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV once weekly and docetaxel IV on day 1 (3-week courses) or on
      days 1, 8, and 15 (4-week courses). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses or
      every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
