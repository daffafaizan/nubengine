      blastocyst developmental stage and a receptive endometrium. The endometrium is receptive to
      blastocysts during a spatially and temporally restricted time window called the "window of
      implantation". Failure of the endometrium to attain receptivity is one cause of infertility,
      and this is not currently assessed during infertility workup due to a lack of reliable
      markers for receptivity. Better tests are required to assist the clinician with the decision
      when to defer a transfer and to freeze all embryos. Proteomics, or the analysis of the
      proteins in any sample, provides physiologically relevant information, since there are many
      regulatory steps between the transcriptome and functional proteins. Uterine fluid is a
      protein-rich histotroph that contains, among other components, secretions from the
      endometrial glands and cleavage products of both the secreted proteins and the glycocalyx.
      The aim of this study is to assess the highly sensitive mass spectrometer analysis of the
      proteins from cervical mucus for the detection of defects in endometrial receptivity and
      search for new endometrial receptivity biomarkers.
