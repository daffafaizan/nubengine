      been developed to provide whole bowel cleansing. Studies have shown that formulating the
      osmotically active agents sodium ascorbate/ascorbic acid (also known as vitamin C) and sodium
      sulfate in combination with PEG 3350 enable a reduction in the volume of the PEG-based lavage
      solution.

      NER1006 has a dual formulation containing an initial majority PEG dose followed by a majority
      ascorbate dose to maximise the overall effectiveness. This novel formulation addresses the
      challenges faced by patients to comply with drinking higher volume, 2 and 3 L, preparations.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is systemic exposure to components of the
      NER1006 formulation.
