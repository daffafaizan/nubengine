      inspiratory muscle strength and athletic performance in soccer players.

      Method. Participants will be randomized into two groups: experimental (G-IMT) and sham
      (Gn-IMT). The two groups will perform a protocol of 12 weeks of training (4 days / week) with
      the PowerBreathe device. The G-IMT will use progressive resistance loads up to 80% of the
      Mmax, while the Gn-IMT will use the device with a minimum load (10% PImax) during the 12
      weeks. All participants will have the following tests before and after the intervention and 3
      months after the end of the program: spirometry (FVC, FEV1), PImax, biophotogrammetry, and
      fit 30/15 test. For the statistical analysis, a 2-factor variance analysis will be performed
      for repeated measures and Pearson's correlations. The statistical significance will be set
      with a value of p <0.05. The effect size will be calculated using the partial eta-square.
