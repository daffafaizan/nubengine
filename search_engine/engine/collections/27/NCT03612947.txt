      required so as to block nociceptive transmission from both the abdominal wall incision, and
      visceral sites.

      Using of opioids can result in significant adverse effects, thus delaying early mobilization
      of patients.

      Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been used as a satisfactory
      approach that provides postoperative analgesia. TAP block is safe; it diminishes or replaces
      the use of opioids; and it has a lower incidence of adverse effects.

      Bupivacaine is a medication used to decrease feeling in a specific area. It is used by
      injecting it into the area, around a nerve that supplies the area, or into the spinal canal's
      epidural space. Bupivacaine is indicated for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block,
      sympathetic nerve block, and epidural and caudal blocks.

      Magnesium is the fourth most plentiful cation in our body. It may be worthwhile to further
      study the role of supplemental magnesium in providing perioperative analgesia, because this
      is a relatively harmless molecule, is not expensive and also because the biological basis for
      its potential antinociceptive effect is promising.

      Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist has the potential to be
      an ideal adjuvant in TAP block.
