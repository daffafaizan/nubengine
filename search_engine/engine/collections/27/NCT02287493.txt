    
      Antibiotic concentrations are measured whilst patients receive SLED for renal replacement
      therapy. The plasma specimens will be quantified using high Performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC).

      Primary endpoint:

      - Plasma levels of antiinfectives during SLED

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  mortality

        -  length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital

        -  clinical cure of infections

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  age: > 18 years

        -  patients under SLED

        -  antiinfective treatment

      exclusion criteria:
