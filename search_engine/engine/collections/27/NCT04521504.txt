      tear. For this purpose, two groups of patients of equal size are identified. The attribution
      of each patient to one of the two groups is random. The standard rehabilitation protocol is
      applied to the Control group (Group A), whereas the standard rehabilitation protocol
      integrated by proprioception exercises (physical therapist assisted) performed with ISEO is
      applied to the Experimental group (Group B). The primary objective is to verify if the ISEO
      system, used as a biofeedback tool, improves shoulder functionality and activity of patients
      arthroscopically treated for rotator cuff tear, both in the short (90 days from surgery) and
      in the medium term (6-12 months from surgery). All patients are longitudinally evaluated from
      the pre-surgery to a 6/12 months follow-up. Each evaluation includes both a clinical and an
      instrumented assessment of shoulder kinematics. The primary outcome tested is the
      Scapula-Weighted Constant-Murley Score, which represents a reformulation of the
      Constant-Murley Score, which is modified based on the quality of the scapular movement
      measured with ISEO.
