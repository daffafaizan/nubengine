      were blinded to vaccine group assignment. Forty adults were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either FMP1/AS02A or the control rabies vaccine. The aims of the control group were
      to account for baseline morbidity and the impact of seasonal malaria transmission on the
      dynamics of anti-MSP-1 antibodies, and to minimize bias in assessment of adverse events.
      Vaccines were given on a 0-, 1- and 2-month schedule. The first immunization was given in
      early July just as malaria transmission began; the second dose at the end of July as
      transmission was increasing; and the third dose in late August near the peak of malaria
      transmission intensity. Study day 90 was in October, shortly after transmission crests and
      when severe and uncomplicated malaria disease episodes peak, study day 180 was at the end of
      the malaria season, and study day 272 was at the height of the dry season. The final study
      follow-up on day 364 coincided with the beginning of the 2004 malaria season. Interim safety
      analyses were reviewed by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee before the second and
      third immunizations.
