      irinotecan in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine whether the pharmacokinetic
      profile of irinotecan is altered by prior administration of mitomycin in this patient
      population. III. Determine the effect of irinotecan and mitomycin on the expression of
      DT-Diaphorase and the Topo I gene. IV. Determine the preliminary antitumor activity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive mitomycin IV over 20 to 30 minutes
      on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 2, 8, 15, and 22, followed by 2 weeks of
      rest beginning on day 29. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each receive escalating
      doses of mitomycin and irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD
      is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
