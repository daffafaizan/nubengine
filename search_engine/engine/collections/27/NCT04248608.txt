      is one of the main approaches applied for solid tumors. surgical approach for breast cancer
      involve the breast region. Various analgesic modalities are used for proper perioperative
      pain control. Morphine has always been considered as the gold standard analgesic, however
      opioids have multiple side effects. Several loco-regional techniques have been introduced for
      breast surgery pain management including serratus plane block (SPB) and erector spinae plane
      (ESP) block. In this study the investigators are comparing the effect of erector spinae block
      versus serratus block versus intravenous morphine in patients undergoing modified radical
      mastectomy for breast cancer surgeries regarding intraoperative and postoperative analgesia,
      time to first analgesic, any possible side effects
