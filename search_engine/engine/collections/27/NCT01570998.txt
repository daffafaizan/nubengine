      I. To establish eligibility criteria based on previously published trials and studies in
      order to allow women who meet these criteria to receive intraoperative radiation therapy
      (IORT) on an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol.

      II. To systematically collect and assess acute and long-term toxicity and outcomes in larger
      cohort of patients.

      III. To study the efficacy and toxicity of breast radiotherapy given intra-operatively as a
      single fraction after breast conserving surgery, with or without whole breast radiation, as
      indicated by pathologic risk factors, in women with early stage breast cancer.

      IV. In-breast local failure and patterns of in-breast failure. V. Ipsilateral regional nodal
      failure. VI. Toxicity and morbidity. VII. Relapse-free survival. VIII. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo IORT in a single fraction over 15-40 minutes at the time of standard of care
      lumpectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 6 weeks and then every 6
      months for 3 years and yearly for 2 years.
