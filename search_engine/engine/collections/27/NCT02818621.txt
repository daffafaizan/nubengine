      requirements due to its sedative and analgesic properties. However, until now, there has been
      studies based on indirect measures such as hemodynamics. Entropy shows to quantify the level
      of consciousness by EEG and Surgical pleth index(SPI) allows to predict the effect of pain
      stimuli and analgesic therapy by the index of the nociception-anti-nociception balance. The
      investigators analyzed quantitatively the requirements of propofol and remifentanil under
      continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine when using entropy and SPI.

      Patients (20~65 years old, ASA class 1 or 2) scheduled lumbar discectomy under general
      anesthesia were recruited. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups. Both groups
      received Target controlled infusion(TCI) of propofol and remifentanil and the dexmedetomidine
      was added to the Dex group and normal saline was added to the Placebo group. The Dex group
      received 1mcg/kg loading dose followed by 0.5mcg/kg/hr infusion of dexmedetomidine which was
      administered at induction of anesthesia through skin closure. The placebo group received
      equal amount of normal saline. During maintenance of anesthesia the effect site concentration
      of propofol and remifentanil was titrated to maintain Entropy(SE) 40~60 and SPI under 50.
      Blood pressure and heart rate also was measured. The total amount of propofol and
      remifentanil administered, time between eye opening and extubation was recorded. The quality
      of recovery was evaluated by QoR-40 survey after 24 hours postop.
