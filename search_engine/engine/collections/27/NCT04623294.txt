      state of unconsciousness associated with depressed cerebral activity. Timely distinguishing
      the two states is crucial for saving patients. The noninvasive, sensitive, universally
      available, and timely ancillary method to assess brain death and deep coma has not been
      established. This study aims to explore a noninvasive and straightforward way in brain death
      and deep coma online assessment. The changes of hemodynamic parameters including
      oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) were detected by near infrared spectroscopy
      instrument attached on the forehead of participators. A multiple-phase protocol at varied
      fraction of inspired O2(FIO2) were utilized during the assessment. Then the investigators
      compared the multiple physiological parameters changes among different groups at different
      FIO2.
