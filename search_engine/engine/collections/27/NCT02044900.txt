      Itaperuna, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Polysomnography (PSG) monitoring and diagnosis was in
      accordance with American Society of Sleep Medicine (ASSM) standards. Standard baseline
      polysomnography is performed using a computerised system. The following extracted signals are
      measured: 2 electroencephalogram channels (O1-A2, O2-A1, C3-A2, C4-A1), 2 electrooculogram
      channels, electromyography (EMG, bilateral anterior tibialis), pulse oximetry (arterial
      oxygen saturation), nasal-oral airflow (thermistors), and electrocardiogram (ECG derivation
      DII). The polysomnograms are scored according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales.
