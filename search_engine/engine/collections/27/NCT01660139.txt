      medicine (CAM) usage among Primary Care and Dermatology clinic patients through the use of an
      anonymous, self-completed written survey. This survey will assess the prevalence and
      regularity of CAM usage (with and without concurrent use of allopathic therapies), the
      reasons for CAM usage, perceived success with CAM usage, and socioeconomic status, in both
      Dermatology and Primary Care patients. We will then compare these elements of CAM usage
      between the two clinic patient populations.
