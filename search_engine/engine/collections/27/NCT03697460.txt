      Treatment naïve and treatment refractory patients with LP will be treated with INCB018424
      PHOSPHATE CREAM. Patients who are non-responders, to physician choice standard of care, will
      undergo a washout period and will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 3 epochs:
      screening/washout period (of at least 1 week and up to 4 weeks), treatment epoch (of 8 weeks
      from screen/washout), and follow up epoch (of 4 weeks). The screening and washout period will
      allow for treatment naïve/ new diagnosis LP to undergo evaluation and diagnosis and for
      treatment refractory to undergo a washout. The total duration of the study will be 13-16
      weeks.
