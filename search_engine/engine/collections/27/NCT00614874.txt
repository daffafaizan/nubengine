      in patients with asthma. However, corticosteroids have many side effects and are not
      universally effective. New safe anti-inflammatory agents are needed to help modulate the
      disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are widely used to manage
      diabetes mellitus, another common chronic disease. These agents have been study models and
      have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in lung tissue. Case reports have noted
      improvement in asthma symptoms in patients being treated with these agents. These agents are
      ideally placed for human research given their long record of safe use in the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes.
