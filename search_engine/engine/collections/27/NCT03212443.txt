      arthroscopic shoulder surgery will be included in this study. Patient will be divided to two
      groups by using computer -generated list for randomization. In group A, the surgeon will
      apply 20 ml of 0.250% bupivacaine to the subacromial region at the end of the procedure. In
      Group B, suprascapular (10 ml of 0.250% bupivacaine ) and axillary block (10 ml of 0.250%
      bupivacaine) will be performed with ultrasound and nerve stimulator guidance before induction
      of anesthesia. In all patients after standard and BIS (Bi spectral index) monitorization
      general anesthesia will be induced with remifentanil (10mcg iv), propofol (2.5 mg/kg iv) and
      rocuronium (0.5mg/kg iv). After intubation, anesthesia will be maintained with 50% O2 and N2O
      mixture. Hemodynamic parameters, BIS values, end-tidal sevoflurane consumption will be
      recorded by blind investigator. Postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) values, postoperative
      analgesic consumption (Tramadol, patient controlled analgesia), complications will be
      recorded.
