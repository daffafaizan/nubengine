      mechanisms. Decreased thalamic pontine cholinergic projections may affect respiratory drive
      leading to both central and obstructive apnea at least in certain degenerative conditions.In
      contrast to the prolific literature on physical and surgical treatments for sleep apnea there
      is a dearth of effective pharmacological approaches.Most drugs previously tested for this
      purpose acted upon monoaminergic and adenosinergic systems and showed unsuccessful or
      ambiguous results.A previous study showed that donepezil treatment improved apnea-hypopnea
      index and oxygen saturation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Treatment also increased
      REM sleep duration and reduced ADAS-cog scores.Based on these facts we hypothesize that
      donepezil treatment may be beneficial for sleep apnea patients.

      Intervention: Patients will be administered donepezil or placebo. The study has a randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled design. Complete polysomnography will be performed at
      baseline, after 28 days of drug or placebo treatment, after 15 days drug or placebo washout
      and after 28 days of CPAP treatment.
