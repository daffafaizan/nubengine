      patient-randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat
      FIT testing. Patients identified as eligible will be contacted through MyChart to test a
      web-based, culturally-sensitive virtual human intervention for CRC screening. The
      web-application will provide information to encourage CRC screening. Therefore, this study is
      a minimal risk study.
