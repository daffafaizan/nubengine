      confirmed by urine void. Participants will complete an UTI questionnaire, and if consistent
      with a simple non-febrile UTI will be randomized to one of two arms: oral nitrofurantoin
      treatment for 7 days, or intravesical gentamicin instillation once a day for three days.
      Patients will be followed for symptom relief with a repeat voided urine in 7 to 10 days, and
      with a repeated questionnaire for symptom relief.
