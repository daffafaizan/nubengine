      are in the area of the original resection, local delivery of a chemotherapeutic agent may
      prevent or delay additional recurrences. Paclitaxel has demonstrated activity against 9L
      glioma tumor lines, but has poor central nervous system penetration after intravenous
      administration. OncoGel is a new formulation of paclitaxel in a bioerodible gel that can be
      administered directly to the brain, thereby bypassing the blood-brain barrier.
