      induced pain, and if altered pain sensitivity occur under these circumstances.

        -  First we want to evaluate the effect of mobilization on acute postoperative pain using
           the visual analog scale (VAS)

        -  Second to test weather chances in pain sensitivity are occurring following surgery and
           mobilization after total knee arthroplasty, using two simple tools, the Pain Matcher and
           a Pressure Algometer.
