      subacromial impingement syndrome, which represents 44%-60% of the total.Specific supervised
      exercises obtain improvements in the range of movement and muscular function by restoring the
      shoulder's mobility and stability. Physiotherapeutic options include several electrotherapy
      techniques.

      Ultrasound is no more beneficial than exercise alone. Likewise, the results of some more
      recent studies evaluating the application of ultrasound alone versus placebo, showed that
      ultrasound alone in physiotherapy treatment of shoulder pain is only effective in patients
      with calcific tendonitis of the shoulder. All the authors, however, suggest that
      effectiveness can vary, depending on application conditions, dosage and timing.

      The primary objective of the trial is to analyze the efficacy of electrotherapy treatment
      (monopolar radiofrequency or ultrasound) coadjuvant to mobility and exercise therapy in the
      reduction of pain intensity in subacromial impingement syndrome.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the differences between three
      intervention groups: monopolar radiofrequency, ultrasound and inactive radiofrequency, in
      improvement of performance status, quality of life and global impression of improvement.
