      trial (2011), and are currently doing a cost-effectiveness substudy (2012-13)

      1. AIM OF THE TRIAL To investigate the effectiveness of fluid restriction (vs. liberal), and
      the possible effect-modification of goal-directed therapy (eg. oesophageal Doppler,
      FlotracÂ®). The first will be randomly assigned; the latter will be measured covariates
      according to local practices and beliefs.

      The optimal fluid regimen and haemodynamic (or other) targets for patients undergoing major
      surgery are based on rationales that are not supported by strong evidence. Practices vary
      substantially; guidelines are vague, small trials and meta-analyses are contradictory. The
      strongest and most consistent evidence, and biological plausability regarding tissue oedema,
      supports a restrictive fluid strategy. There is less (and more contradictory) evidence
      supporting goal-directed therapy using a flow-directed device and/or dopexamine, and use and
      choice of colloids. A large, definitive clinical trial evaluating perioperative fluid
      replacement in major surgery is required.

      Study Hypotheses A restrictive fluid regimen for adults undergoing major abdominal surgery
      leads to reduced complications and improved disability-free survival when compared with a
      liberal fluid regimen.

      Secondary hypotheses: The effects of fluid restriction are similar whether or not
      goal-directed therapy is used (assessed as a statistical test of interaction). A restrictive
      fluid regimen will reduce a composite of 30-day septic complications and mortality.
