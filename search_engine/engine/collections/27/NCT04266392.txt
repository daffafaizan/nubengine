      multiparametric pelvic/prostate MRI for PCa detection in men with recurrence as determined by
      biochemical PSA level or evidence on CIM. Results of tracer uptake and MRI image features on
      whole body PET/MRI and dedicated pelvic/prostate PET/MRI, alone and together, will be
      correlated and compared to detection of lesions on CIM that usually includes bone scan (BS)
      and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, or PET imaging with F-18 Fluciclovine. In addition, in
      patients who undergo a biopsy when performed as standard of care, image features will
      correlate directly with histopathological findings on lesion biopsy to directly demonstrate
      that 'radiotracer and/or MRI positive' lesions contain tumor cells.

      To test the hypothesis, this study is being proposed using the [18F]-DCFPyL PET tracer for
      the detection of PCa in patients with biochemical recurrence or evidence on CIM. The
      [18F]-DCFPyL PET tracer will be provided by the company Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (New
      York, New York) and conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) approval received by
      Stony Brook University.
