    
      This is a multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the use of multiple intravenous doses of
      131I-TM601 in adults patients with progressive and/or recurrent malignant melanoma (Stage
      IIIc or IV) with measurable disease who have failed first line/standard therapy.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases. During the first, Dose Escalation Phase, eligible
      patients wil be assigned in groups of 3-6 (depending upon the treatment response seen at each
      dose) to dose cohorts of between 2-5 weekly IV doses of 131I-TM601. Escalation to the next
      highest dose during the Dose Escalation Phase will be dependent upon demonstrated tolerance
      in the previous dosing group. In the second, Efficacy Phase, all patients will be treated
      with the Maximum Tolerated Dose determined in the Dose Escalation Phase.

      Prior to initiating treatment, all patients will be administered a single imaging dose of
      131I-TM601, IV, as an Imaging Dose to evaluate tumor uptake. Only patients demonstrating
      tumor uptake will remain on the study.

      Patients in both study phases will have safety parameters evaluated continuously throughout
      the study. Clinical response to 131I-TM601 will be assessed in each study patient at 28 days
      following the final study dose, and then at 2-month intervals, starting at 3 months following
      the first study dose (during the first year of follow-up), and finally at 3-month intervals
      thereafter until disease progression.
