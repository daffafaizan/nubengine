      underwent LTA with adrenal mass were recorded prospectively and analyzed retrospectively.

      The inclusion criteria were all hormonally active adrenal lesions, detection of increases in
      size in < 4 cm adrenal tumors on serial imaging, solitary adrenal metastases without evidence
      of local invasion, tumors size ≥ 4 cm, patients between the age of 18 and 80, and American
      Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA) ≤ 3. The patients with adrenal masses that specified
      suspicion of malignancy on imaging such as local invasion, irregular tumor margins were
      evaluated as ineligible for LTA, and excluded in this study, were addressed to open surgery.
      Retroperitoneoscopic and laparoscopic partial adrenalectomies were also excluded from the
      study.

      Totally 102 patients were included in the study. The patients were allocated according to
      adrenal tumor size as <6cm (group 1:76) and ≥ 6 cm (group 2: 26). The variables such as
      demographics, tumor size, and laterality, operation time, blood loss, per-operative and
      postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, final pathology result were compared
      between the two groups. In order to evaluate the learning curve, the patients were also
      classified into three consecutive groups including group A (1-25), group B (25-50), group C
      (51-75) and group D (76-102) according to the chronological order of their surgery. Variables
      including operation time, tumor size, blood loss, and hospital stay, and overall
      complications were used to investigate the learning curve.
