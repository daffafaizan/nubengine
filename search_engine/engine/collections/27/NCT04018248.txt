    
      1. Phase Ia (Dose Escalation)

           Primary Objectives

             -  To assess the safety and tolerability of BR101801 in patients with
                relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and PTCL.

             -  To assess DLT and to determine the MTD and/or the RDE dose for BR101801 when
                administered orally on a daily schedule in 4-week cycles until disease progression.

           SecondaryObjectives

             -  To characterize the plasma and urine PK of BR101801.

             -  To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BR101801.

        2. Phase Ib (Dose Expansion)

      Primary Objectives

      â€¢To assess the safety and tolerability of BR101801 at the RDE dose in patients with relapsed
      and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and PTCL.

      SecondaryObjectives

        -  To assess clinical activity of BR101801 when administered orally on a daily schedule in
           4-week cycles until disease progression.

        -  To assess the plasma PK of BR101801

      OUTLINE: This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, FIH study. Safety monitoring committee
      (SMC) will be responsible for safety oversight.
