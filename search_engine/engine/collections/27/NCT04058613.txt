      functions are inferred by serum albumin and INR estimation. Lower albumin level is a marker
      of severe liver disease and probability of worsening ascites, hepatorenal syndrome with
      increased risk for infections. Of the three recent RCTs on utility of long-term
      administration of albumin, two showed improvement in survival. The studies had included
      different patient populations (diuretic refractory ascites, high dose diuretics and patients
      on liver transplant waiting list) with different albumin infusion protocols and different
      end-points. These studies were done in advanced cases of cirrhosis. There is limited data on
      the utility of regular albumin infusions in early hepatic decompensation (albumin
      levels-<2.8g/dl with ascites) and the effect of maintaining a targeted albumin level on
      survival or liver related side effects. Investigators are trying to address this issue by
      starting regular albumin infusions at an earlier stage of liver decompensation.
