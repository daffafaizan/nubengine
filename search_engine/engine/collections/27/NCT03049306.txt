      (OSA) patients, and these elevations may be responsible for adverse cardio-metabolic
      consequences of OSA. The sympathetic nervous system is well known to mediate adipose tissue
      lipolysis as well as "stress hyperglycemia". Thus, investigators may be able to mitigate
      these nocturnal metabolic changes with beta adrenergic blockade. Propranolol is a
      non-selective beta blocker that is used for a variety of indications including hypertension
      and anxiety. In this study investigators will administer propranolol or placebo to patients
      with OSA before sleep. Investigators will compare nocturnal metabolic profiles and
      hemodynamics on/off propranolol in the setting of CPAP withdrawal.
