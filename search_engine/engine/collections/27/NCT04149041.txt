      (ED). However, previous studies have focused only on selected groups of patients, such as
      trauma, shock, dyspnea, or critically ill patients, or patients with an already known
      diagnosis. Most patients seen in the ED do not match these criteria. This study aims to
      investigate prevalence of agreement between sonographic and clinical diagnosis in adult
      patients seen in an emergency department.
