      (AIS C-D) will be recruited from the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa. In the first
      period of the crossover study, other part of the participants will get technological-assisted
      upper extremity rehabilitation, while the other part of the participants continue their
      normal lives. The first period is followed by 4-week wash-out period. In the second period,
      roles of the participants will be switched. The rehabilitation phase lasts for 6 weeks with 3
      weekly sessions, each therapy session including at least 30 minutes of technological-assisted
      upper extremity rehabilitation. Rehabilitation includes passive, active and resistance
      exercises, and will be carried out by using AMADEO, PABLO and/or DIEGO devices made by
      Tyromotion.
