      DDD-60 versus DDD-80. Each patient is paced for 2 periods of 90 days with DDD-60 and DDD-80
      in a randomly sequence.

      Blood samples NT-proBNP plasma levels are analysed at baseline and at the end of each phase
      using electrochemiluminescence-immunoassay. Patients rest for 15 minutes before the samples
      are taken.

      These result are monitored by supervisory group to ensure that increase of more than 15% than
      baseline values result in termination of study.

      Investigators conduct two distinct questionnaires (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      (LIfHE) questionnaire and Medical Outcome Survey Short Form (SF-36)) A symptom limiting
      bicycle (Ergoline, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany) exercise test is performed to measure maximum
      work capacity and oxygen consumption at each phase.

      Recordings of resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) are sought in all patients at
      both rates of pacing. All patients are studied on the same set-up in the semi-recumbent
      position after 30 minutes of rest. Tungsten microelectrodes (Iowa Bioengineering) are
      inserted into the common peroneal nerve just below the knee.
