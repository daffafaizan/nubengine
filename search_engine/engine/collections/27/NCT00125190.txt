      has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular defects in growth hormone (GH)
      action. In this protocol, primary IGFD is defined as short stature (<-2 standard deviations
      [SDs] below the mean for age and gender), and abnormal serum IGF-1 (<-2 SDs below the mean
      for age and gender).

      The trial is an open-label, concentration-controlled trial conducted at up to 20 centers
      throughout the United States.
