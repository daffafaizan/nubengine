      dysfunction leading to pulmonary vascular constriction, smooth muscle and endothelial
      proliferation, and progressive right-sided heart failure. The severity of pulmonary
      hypertension is mostly determined by the response of the right ventricle (RV) to the
      increased afterload or pulmonary pressures, and RV failure is the leading cause of death in
      PAH. Most accepted therapies for PAH have been aimed at vasodilation of the pulmonary
      vasculature, and there has been little thought that PAH patients would benefit from
      traditional left heart failure treatments. A cornerstone therapy in left heart failure is
      £]-adrenergic receptor blockade because of its ability to reverse cardiac remodeling and
      improve clinical outcomes, despite decades of concern regarding its propensity to exacerbate
      heart failure. It has been reported to reduce mortality by about 30% in patients, and while
      the precise mechanisms that contribute to its beneficial effects remain to be elucidated,
      there is evidence that patients with underlying contractile reserve (i.e., via recruitment of
      viable myocardium with £]-adrenergic receptor stimulation) may experience greater recovery of
      their cardiac function. In a study using rats with pulmonary hypertension treated with £]
      blocker, RV function improved, and maladaptive myocardial remodeling was prevented.
