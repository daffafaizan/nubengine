      life, whose etiology and pathophysiology is not yet fully demonstrated. Perhaps this is why
      its therapeutic approach is refractory to current treatments.

      Based on the theory that fibromyalgia is characterized by a sensitization at the level of the
      central nervous system that leads to an increase in the perception of pain, any therapeutic
      approach aimed at modulating the central nervous system may be beneficial. Electrical
      stimulation with transcranial direct current (tDCS) is among these techniques.

      In the same way, therapeutic exercise has shown to have, like the tDCS, a beneficial effect
      on pain in different chronic pathologies.

      The present study aims to investigate the effect on pain of a combination therapy of tDCS and
      therapeutic exercise in patients with fibromyalgia.
