    
      This is a Phase 1, double blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers
      nor the participants know what treatment the participants is receiving), randomized (study
      drug assigned by chance), placebo controlled, multiple ascending dose study. The study will
      consist of 3 parts: a Screening period (Days -21 to -2), a Double-blind treatment period (Day
      -1 to Day 11), and a Follow-up period (within 7 to 14 days after last dose administration).
      In double blind treatment period, participants will be randomly assigned to 5, 10, 20, and 40
      milligram (mg) or placebo. Number of participants with any clinically relevant changes
      (adverse events [AEs], laboratory results,electrocardiogram [ECG], Vital signs, Physical and
      neurological, sedation & concentration) and columbia suicide severity rating (CSSR) scale
      will be evaluated as primary outcome measure. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
