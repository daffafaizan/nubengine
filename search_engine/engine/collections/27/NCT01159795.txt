      from asymptomatic infection to life threatening bronchiolitis with respiratory failure. The
      reasons for the differences in clinical presentation remain unknown. Interferons are natural
      antiviral factors and components of the innate immune response, which play a role in limiting
      viral replication.

      We postulate that differences in clinical severity of RSV infection may be due to innate
      immune differences in the production of type I and III interferons (innate interferons). To
      test this hypothesis, we will recruit infants with mild, moderate and severe RSV
      bronchiolitis and compare production of innate interferons in blood and respiratory samples,
      using quantitative and functional analysis. We will determine whether interferon responses
      differ across a spectrum of clinical severity, and will relate them to viral load.

      To establish whether defects in interferon production persist in those infants with severe
      infection, we will retest them following recovery and measure interferon responses after
      challenge with live RSV. Demonstrating a persisting defect may suggest a genetically
      determined defect requiring further investigation. Identification of the mechanisms of severe
      disease in patients without known risk-factors could lead to targeted therapy to prevent or
      treat severe disease.
