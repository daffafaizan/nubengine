      patients. As a result, patients must travel or be transported to secondary and tertiary care
      centres, which often delays diagnosis and subsequent treatment, creates burdens for patients
      and their families, and increases healthcare costs. Robotic telesonography, in which an
      expert remotely performs sonography in real time, has recently emerged as an opportunity to
      provide sonography regardless of the availability of a skilled operator at the site. Studies
      primarily originating in Europe have demonstrated robotic telesonography in abdominal,
      pelvic, obstetric, and cardiologic applications in adults. However, the full potential of
      robotic telesonography across many imaging applications has yet to be explored, and robotic
      telesonography has not yet been trialed in Canada. This study aims to demonstrate the
      feasibility of robotic telesonography in a centre with established sonography services which
      will be used as a comparator to robotic telesonography. Approximately 30 patients will be
      recruited for each substudy (obstetric, adult abdominal, and pediatric abdominal). All
      patients will receive both conventional and robotic scans in a crossover design. The
      sonographer performing the scan will be asked to complete a data collection form which will
      collect information about duration of the exam and any challenges encountered. Following the
      completion of both scans, the patient-site assistant will provide a questionnaire to the
      patient (or for children, a parent/guardian of the patient) regarding his/her experience with
      the system. A physician will review images generated using either the robotic telesonography
      or conventional sonography systems and report findings on a standardized reporting form.
