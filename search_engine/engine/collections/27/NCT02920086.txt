      ill patients who are frequently unable to participate in their own care and decision-making,
      partnering with their family members is particularly important for improving experiences and
      outcomes of care for both patients and families. However, the optimal means by which families
      engage in the role they play, and how best to capacitate them as advocates and partners in
      care while helping them maintain their own wellbeing, is not known.

      The IMPACT trial will evaluate two interventions, each with a separate context, but similar
      in that they empower and support families; one focused on involvement in care, and the other
      focused on involvement in decision-making. The first is a nutrition intervention The OPTimal
      nutrition by Informing and Capacitating family members of best practices (OPTICs)
      intervention, a multi-faceted strategy to engage and empower family members to advocate for
      and audit best nutrition practices in their family members. The second is a decision support
      intervention. The REALISTIC-80 Decision Support Intervention, is a web-based tool
      (www.myicuguide.com) to support families in shared decision-making about goals of medical
      treatments.

      The investigators propose to conduct a mixed methods multi-centre, open-label, randomized,
      clinical trial involving 3 groups (2 active interventions and a usual care group). The
      overall goal of this study is to demonstrate that the multi-faceted nutritional strategies
      that engage families in care of their family member tested in this trial will increase
      nutritional intake and optimize physical recovery in older critically ill patients at high
      nutrition risk.
