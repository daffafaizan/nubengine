    
      The specific objectives are:

      To describe the global incidence of invasive Candida infection To monitor trends globally and
      locally over time To define patient risk groups To assess antifungal resistance among Candida
      spp. causing invasive diseases worldwide To assess attributable mortality of invasive Candida
      infection To assess incremental costs associated with invasive Candida infection

      To describe the clinical pattern of disease To document diagnostic procedures performed for
      confirmation of diagnosis To describe first-line and salvage treatment regimens applied,
      guideline adherence, their efficacy and impact on patient survival To inform consensus
      guidelines To develop clinical screening and diagnostic procedures

      Set up of a collection of isolates with molecular characterization and evaluation of
      resistance genes
