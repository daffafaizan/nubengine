      Diets high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids have been shown to decrease the
      risk of cardiovascular disease. Pumpkin seeds are a good source of monounsaturated and
      polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oil extracted from pumpkin seeds has been shown to lower blood
      pressure. One purpose of this study is to determine whether eating 1.5 ounces of pumpkin
      seeds per day will improve polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acid intake in the diet
      in healthy adult women. Another purpose of this study is to determine whether eating 1.5
      ounces of pumpkin seeds a day will lower blood pressure.
