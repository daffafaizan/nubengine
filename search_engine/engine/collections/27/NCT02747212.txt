      excised. Once the tissue was excised from the patient, the pathologist assisted the one of
      the engineers (already at the hospital) responsible to conduct the measurement. The specimen
      were designed to permit at least one measurement of malignant tissue and at least one
      measurement of normal tissue. Occasionally, the measurement of normal tissue was not possible
      if, for example, the normal tissue occupied a volume of small proportion for every excised
      specimen. The specimens for dielectric properties measurement were classified as normal or
      malignant by the pathologist based on his own expertise and decision criteria (visual
      inspection, anatomy) and the per-operative histological examination. The measurements were
      directly performed on the bulk specimen. The patient age, tissue temperature at the time of
      measurement and time between excision and measurement for each sample were recorded.
