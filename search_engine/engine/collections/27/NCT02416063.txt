      of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.But which route of administration of
      dexmedetomidine is the most beneficial remains unknown.

      The investigators performed prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the effects
      of caudal dexmedetomidine with intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia after
      caudal bupivacaine in children undergoing infra-umbilical surgery.

      75 children (ASAⅠorⅡ,aged 1-6 yr) undergoing infra-umbilical surgery were included in this
      study. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via a facemask, followed by placement of a
      laryngeal mask airway. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3% in
      oxygen-air.Then,caudal block was applied. Patients were randomly assigned in three groups.
      Group B-Dcau (n = 25): Caudal bupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg plus dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg and 10 ml
      normal saline i.v.;Group B-Div (n = 25): bupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg and dexmedetomidine
      1µg/kg(10 ml)i.v.;Group B(n = 25): bupivacaine 0.25% and 10 ml normal saline intravenous
