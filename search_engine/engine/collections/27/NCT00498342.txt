      mechanism of this effect is unknown but possible stimulation of tubular secretion of
      creatinine has been hypothesized based upon a lack of effect on Cystatin C levels. If this
      effect also occurs in subjects with chronic kidney disease, interpretation of clinical trials
      using N-acetylcysteine for prophylaxis of acute kidney injury would be confounded. To answer
      whether such confounding occurs, 50 patients with stable chronic kidney disease (Stage 3-5)
      will be given 4 doses of N-acetylcysteine, 1200 mg each, with measurement of serum creatinine
      and Cystatin C before, 4 hours and 48 hours after the last dose. No other interventions,
      including changes in medications, will be permitted during the study.
