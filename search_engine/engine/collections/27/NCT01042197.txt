      cardiovascular diseases are related to vitamin D deficiency. Elderly people, immigrants as
      well as patients with malabsorption diseases often have vitamin D deficiency. 90-95 % of the
      total vitamin D requirements are obtained from the ultraviolet (UV) radiation of the skin.In
      spite of the risk of skin-cancer, treatment with sunlight radiation is often recommended
      against vitamin D deficiency. This fact has raised a scientific debate, where concern has
      been expressed with regard to the risk of skin-cancer. This dilemma should also be examined
      as no human studies are available on the vitamin D production in the skin after UV-radiation
      showing the frequency and dose necessary for sufficient production of vitamin D. The lowest
      exposure frequency, the smallest body surface area and the lowest UV dose should therefore be
      established to be exposed in order to minimize the risk of skin-cancer by unnecessary
      UV-radiation. The purpose of the project is therefore to clarify which factors there are of
      importance for the production of vitamin D in the skin after UVB radiation.
