      gingival grafts (FGGs) around implants with limited keratinized gingiva (KG) compared to oral
      prophylaxis without gingival augmentation.

      This prospective controlled randomized blind clinical study investigated 44 implants
      displaying lack of KG in 29 subjects. Fourteen subjects received FGGs followed by oral
      prophylaxis. Fifteen subjects in the control group did not receive FGGs. The width of KG,
      gingival recession (GR), pocket depths (PD), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were
      assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months.

      There was a significant gain in KG with a reduction in GR in the FGG group compared to
      controls at 6, 12, and 18 months. The mean PI and GI were significantly lower for the FGG
      group at 12 and 18 months.
