      failure. These registries can allow for a deeper understanding of gaps in guideline
      recommended therapies among patients who are under the purview of large, integrated
      Therefore, we have created a live registry within the integrated Yale New Haven Health
      System-the Yale Heart Failure Registry-that includes all patients with a diagnosis of HF and
      has detailed information about demographics, comorbidities, laboratories, imaging,
      medications, and clinical outcomes (including hospital readmissions). The registry is updated
      daily and can be queried for clinically relevant questions aimed at quality improvement.
