      emerging evidence suggests that in some settings, school staff may be one of the most common
      perpetrator of violence against children.To date, no interventions to prevent violence in
      refugee camp schools have ever been rigorously evaluated. The primary objective of this
      project is to test the effectiveness of the Empateach intervention to prevent physical
      violence from teachers to students in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp, Tanzania. Secondary objectives
      are to assess the impact of the Empateach intervention on student's depressive symptoms,
      experience of emotional violence and educational test scores.

      The aim of the Empateach intervention is to improve 'student and teacher well-being;
      self-regulation; teacher classroom management and teacher's use of positive discipline
      techniques'. Participants in the intervention condition will receive a 10-week group
      intervention.

      A two arm cluster RCT will be conducted, with parallel assignment and an approximately 1:1
      allocation ratio. Cross-sectional surveys of students will be conducted at three time points:
      a baseline, a midline immediately after the 10 week intervention; and an endline 6 months
      after then end of the intervention. The primary outcome, violence from school staff to
      students, will be measured using an adapted version of the ICAST-CI.
