      trial. We will randomly allocate 40 subjects to receive either the active Menopod device
      (n=20) or a sham device with the mechanism disabled (n=20).

      We will recruit menopausal women with moderate to severe hot flashes (as defined by FDA
      standards this means a minimum of 7 per day).

      The two primary outcome parameters are the hot flash score which is the product of frequency
      x intensity (Sloan 2001), and the average duration (in minutes) of hot flash episodes over
      the course of one day. These outcomes will be self-recorded by subjects in a diary designed
      by our research team on five separate days throughout the course of the study, once during
      the evaluation phase and once per week over the four week treatment phase. The two summary
      measures will be the changes from baseline to the last record collected for hot flash scores
      and average durations. Delta values (assessment phase minus fourth treatment period) will be
      compared between the two treatment groups (active versus sham device) using t tests (IBM SPSS
      Statistics version 21).
