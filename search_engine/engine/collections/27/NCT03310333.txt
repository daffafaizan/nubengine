      cervix and no B streptococcus. The case is discussed during the obstetric staff every
      morning.

      If the cervix is unfavourable (cervical Bishop's score <6), the information of the study is
      given to the patient and the consent collected.

      An antibiotic is started at the beginning of the inclusion by amoxicillin (or clindamycin in
      case of allergy of amoxicillin) to prevent choroamnionitis.

      After randomization, the patient is included in one of the two groups: Cook ® balloon or
      Propess ®.

        -  In the Cook cervical ripening balloon group: the device is introduced by a resident or a
           doctor. No traction on the probe was done. It is left in place for maximum 12 hours.
           Oxytocin is added at the end of the first 6 hours even if device is fallen. An epidural
           analgesia can be started before or after the installation of oxytocin

        -  In dinoprostone vaginal group: the device is placed in vaginal fornix by the midwife for
           maximum 24 hours. If Propess ® is fallen before the first 12 hours, another one could be
           introduce if the cervix stayed unfavourable.

      After 24 hours, it is removed. If they are any contraction, oxytocin is started with or
      without epidural analgesic.

        -  The fetal heart rate is monitoring 30 minutes before and after the insertion of the
           device. After, the patient has a monitoring each 6 hours.

        -  Since the oxytocin is started, the monitoring is registered in continue until the
           delivery.
