    
      NEUTRALIZE is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel,
      multicenter, Phase IIIb study to investigate the safety and efficacy of SZC in patients with
      hyperkalemia and low bicarbonate (metabolic acidosis ).

      The study will be conducted in the United States (US) at approximately 35 investigative
      sites.

      After screening on Day 1, all eligible patients will receive open-label SZC for up to 48
      hours. Patients who achieve normokalemia within 48 hours will be randomized 1:1 into the
      double-blind randomized treatment phase to receive SZC or placebo. Study treatment will end
      with the Day 29 visit, which will be followed by a follow-up visit 7 days after the last
      administration of study medication.
