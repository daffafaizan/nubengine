      breathing trial is therefore recommended to predict extubation readiness. However, depending
      on the disease entity and local culture, a range of 10-20 per cent incidence of extubation
      failure has been described from tertiary care hospitals. The aim of this trial is to identify
      additional variables in surgical patients that can be used to support a clinician's decision
      on whether or not to extubate a patient's trachea.

      Te investigators have recently developed and validated the SPORC (Brueckmann, 2013), a score
      that predicts the risk of extubation failure following surgery based on patients
      comorbidities and the acuity of the disease leading to surgery, and the investigators
      hypothesize that the SPORC will also predict extubation failure in the surgical ICU.

      In addition, it is likely that ICU acquired morbidity also predicts extubation failure. In
      fact, the investigators have recently shown that muscle weakness is a predictor of aspiration
      (Mirzakhani, 2013), and the investigators speculated that muscle weakness may also
      respiratory failure after extubation.

      Finally, it has been suggested that the increased mortality seen in patients with acute
      kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) versus end stage
      renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring CRRT can be attributed to an increased need for
      mechanical ventilation. (Walcher, 2011). Therefore, the investigators also hypothesize that
      acute kidney injury increases the vulnerability of patients to postextubation respiratory
      failure.
