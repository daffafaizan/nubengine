        -  To determine the inhibition of the extract of the peel of Carica Papaya (baby) at 3% on
           Streptococcus Mutans by age and sex grouping.

        -  To quantify the inhibition of the extract of the peel of Carica Papaya (baby) at 3% on
           the growth of Streptococcus Mutans before, at 10 minutes and 8 days of use in the
           experimental group.

        -  Quantify the inhibition of 0.12% Chlorhexidine Gluconate on the growth of Streptococcus
           Mutans before, after 10 minutes and 8 days of use in the control group.

        -  Compare the count of Colony Forming Units (CFU) between both groups.
