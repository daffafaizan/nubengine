           hours for a total of ten doses over the course of study surveillance.

        2. To evaluate the tolerability of intravenously administered AVI-4020 Injection every 12
           hours for a total of ten doses over the course of study surveillance.

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenously administered AVI-4020 Injection at 45 mg
           every 12 hours for ten doses, based on the neurological status of each study Subject as
           measured by a combination of the NIH stroke scale score and the Glasgow coma scale
           score.

        4. To evaluate the robustness of the potential effectiveness of intravenously administered
           AVI-4020 Injection every 12 hours for ten doses over the course of 35 days of active
           surveillance, based on a variety of criteria, e.g., clinical, laboratory and/or
           neurophysiological results.
