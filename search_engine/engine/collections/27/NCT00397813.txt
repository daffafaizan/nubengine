    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Decrease the incidence of day-200 hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) failure to <
      20% in patients with MDS-Refractory anemia (RA)-(ringed sideroblasts [RS])/MPD and in
      patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)/refractory anemia with excess blasts
      (RAEB).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The rate of relapse/progression in patients with MPD or MDS-RA and those with CMML or
      MDS-RAEB.

      II. The probability of progression free survival (PFS) in patients with MPD or MDS-RA and
      those with CMML or MDS-RAEB.

      III. The kinetics of donor engraftment.

      IV. The incidence of infections.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of total body irradiation (TBI).

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously
      (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo filgrastim
      (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC infusion after TBI on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:

      Matched Related Donor: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3
      to 56, followed by a taper until day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
      PO BID beginning 4-6 hours after transplantation on day 0 and continue until day 27.

      Unrelated Donor: Patients receive cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 100, followed by a taper
      until day 180. Patients also receive MMF PO three times daily beginning 4-6 hours after
      transplantation on day 0 and continue until day 40, followed by a taper until day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
