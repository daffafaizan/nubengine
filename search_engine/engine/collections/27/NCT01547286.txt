      people in the United States alone. It is of major importance to understand the mechanisms
      responsible for underlying mechanical and physiological changes that occur during asthma
      exacerbations. The effect of asthma on the pulmonary vasculature is virtually unknown. It has
      long been known that areas of severely reduced airflow occur in asthma and contribute
      significantly to the impairment of gas exchange in this disease. However, the extent to which
      local blood flow changes during an asthmatic attack is unclear. This proposal is designed to
      evaluate the relevance of potential mechanisms responsible for the blood flow defects seen in
      our Positron Emission Tomography studies of subjects with asthma and identify factors
      modifying that perfusion distribution. With this knowledge, it is hoped that a more focused
      basic research is motivated to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind these processes
      ultimately targeted to improved asthma therapy. Comparing these measures in healthy subjects
      and asthmatics patients may lead to methods to improve patient care.
