      well-tolerated, effective agent for the treatment of early breast cancer. This pilot study
      represents a first step in exploring this hypothesis by demonstrating preliminary evidence of
      specific anti-tumor effect of black cohosh on areas of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the
      breast.
