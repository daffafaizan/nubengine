      Regardless of the mechanism, excessive hyperbilirubinemia has been traditionally treated with
      phototherapy to minimize any probable risk of developing bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity.
      However, earlier and more recent data suggest that pre-discharge bilirubin screening for risk
      of significant hyperbilirubinemia, whether due to a rapid bilirubin production or an earlier
      age of onset, has impacted the guidelines for clinical use of phototherapy [1, 2]. In this
      study, we plan to test the performance of a novel transcutaneous device (BiliCareTM) first
      for screening for bilirubin levels at postnatal age of 6 to 48 hrs; and possibly also, to
      substitute the use of this measurement for total plasma/serum bilirubin (TB). This device
      applies a novel light transmission technology that has the potential to measure bilirubin as
      a point-of-care test in the subcutaneous tissue, and then uses an internal algorithm to
      calculate bilirubin levels in the skin. In this proposalstudy, we will to assess the clinical
      performance of the BiliCare by correlating measurements made by this device to
      near-concurrent measure of total plasma/serum bilirubin at normative ranges (mean, median,
      range and inter-quartile ranges ) for all term and late-preterm newborns (including those who
      are at-risk for jaundice and / or being administered with phototherapy) born to families of
      diverse race and ethnic backgrounds.
