      as a single agent to patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients are eligible if they are
      refractory, resistant or intolerant to prior therapies.The study will assess YS-ON-001
      administered as a single agent, three times per week for 21-days with 1 week wash out period
      (28 days as 1 cycle) for 12 cycles in a continuous regimen. A dose escalation design will be
      applied in cohorts of 3-6 patients in Part I of the study.

      The starting dose will be 2ml (3 times/ week). Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is
      established, the cohort will be expanded with at least 10 additional patients to further
      characterize the safety and tolerability at RP2D with specific tumour types, Breast cancer
      and Liver Cancer

      Treatment with YS-ON-001 may be continued for up to 12 cycles or until disease progression or
      if patient is withdrawn or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who complete 12 cycles of
      treatment will be considered to have completed the trial. Patients who continue to benefit
      from treatment after 12 cycles may have the option to continue treatment upon agreement
      between the investigator and sponsor, and pending study drug availability.
