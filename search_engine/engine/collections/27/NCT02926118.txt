      detect the impact of a dietary intervention on postprandial blood glucose levels in normal,
      healthy, free living subjects. We will compare a dietary intervention of meals with a high
      glycemic load (high post-meal blood glucose) versus meals with a low glycemic load (low
      post-meal blood glucose) in a cross-over study. In addition, the glucose profiles obtained
      both via venous blood sampling and via continuous glucose monitor following a standard
      carbohydrate load will be compared.
