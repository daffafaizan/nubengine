      Tremor (ET) to cerebellar dysfunction. This has been clinically observed, demonstrated
      through specific gait measures of ataxia (often involving tandem gait), and confirmed through
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Deep Brain stimulation for ET has become a widely
      utilized therapeutic intervention for patients, and the bilateral thalamic ventralis
      intermedius (VIM) is most commonly implanted. However, it has been noted that in some
      patients gait ataxia significantly worsens post-op. This initially was thought to be a result
      of disease progression, but recent studies have in fact shown that this is a DBS related
      phenomenon.

      Methods: Participants will have two visits to either the Portland VA or Oregon Health &
      Science University (OHSU). At each visit, several assessments of balance, tremor, gait and
      balance, and DBS settings will be made. The gait and balance assessments will be performed by
      a unblinded and a blinded rater.
