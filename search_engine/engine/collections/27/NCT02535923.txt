    
      The goal of this project is to develop guidelines for the clinical tailoring of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for Veterans with psychotic disorders and insomnia,
      and to test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of CBT-I for improving
      sleep-related functional outcomes in this population.

      Specific Aim 1: Develop empirically-derived guidelines for the clinical tailoring of CBT-I
      materials and procedures for Veterans with psychotic disorders through an iterative process
      with input from Veteran clients, CBT-I experts and providers, as well as those with expertise
      in psychotic disorders.

      Specific Aim 2: Establish the acceptability of CBT-I for Veterans with psychotic disorders
      and insomnia when delivered using guidelines developed in Specific Aim 1 in order to make
      further refinements to the guidelines in a preliminary trial with 6 Veterans with psychosis
      and insomnia.

      Specific Aim 3: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (n=60) to test the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of CBT-I in producing positive changes at post-treatment and 3-month
      follow-up on the outcomes of insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and functioning.
