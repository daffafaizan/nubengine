      Primary

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients with previously untreated stage IIB-IVB
           nasopharyngeal cancer treated with fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall survival and response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine compliance to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5 and
      cisplatin IV continuously on days 6-7. Beginning 2-3 days after the completion of
      chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. With 2-3
      days between each course, patients receive a second course of chemotherapy, undergo a second
      course of radiotherapy, and then receive a third course of chemotherapy. Treatment continues
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
