      be viable techniques for restoring feedback. Investigators will focus on patients undergoing
      temporary percutaneous trials of DRG or lateral spinal cord stimulation with leads
      manufactured by either Boston Scientific (under PMA P030017) or St. Jude (under PMA P150004),
      which have FDA premarket approval for the management of chronic pain in the trunk and lower
      limbs. In this early experiment, investigators will not focus on individuals with limb loss,
      but rather will include patients already undergoing a percutaneous trial of DRG or spinal
      root stimulation to treat pain. Investigators will characterize the location, modality, and
      intensity of sensations evoked in the hands or feet with stimulation delivered by an external
      stimulator.
