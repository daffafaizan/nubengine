      patients implanted with SN60AT, SN60WF and ReSTOR intraocular lenses. Patients in the
      department of Ophthalmology will be asked to participate in the study on a routine
      postoperative visit at least 3 months after cataract surgery. Patients will be asked to sign
      a consent form prior to participation. Wavefront analysis involves the patient resting their
      chin in a device similar to a slit lamp; they focus on a distant light and the machine
      performs the measurements in mesopic and scotopic conditions (light and dark). Contrast
      sensitivity is a measure of how faded or washed out an image can be before it becomes
      indistinguishable from a uniform field; it involves the patient identifying patterns on a
      chart. Wavefront analysis and contrast sensitivity are noninvasive tests that do not employ
      sedation or anesthesia and does not expose the patient to x-rays or microwaves. The proposed
      research will not alter usual standard postoperative care and can be done on a routine office
      visit.
