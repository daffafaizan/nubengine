      recognized risk factor for cardioembolic events. The flow stasis accompanying ventricular
      remodeling and myocardial dysfunction could favor the formation of small intracavitary
      thrombi between LV trabeculae, small enough not be detected by conventional imaging
      techniques. Computational post-processing techniques allow a robust and complete
      characterization of numerous aspects of fluid dynamics within the heart using the flow field
      obtained by Echo or MRI imaging, and it is possible to quantify the stasis and washing of
      blood in the left ventricular cavity.

      A cross-sectional study in 80 patients with non-ischemic DCM in sinus rhythm is proposed in
      which an echocardiogram, cardiac and cerebral MRI will be performed. Our objective is to
      quantify the ventricular stasis by post-processing of 2D color Doppler echocardiography
      images in order to establish the relationship between quantifiable intraventricular stasis
      variables and the prevalence of silent and embolic events and intracavitary thrombosis
      determined by magnetic resonance (MRI).
