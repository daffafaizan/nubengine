    
      A maximum of 56 healthy adult (male and female) subjects will participate in this study, in
      two stages. In Stage 1, the Single-Ascending Dose (SAD) phase of the study will have up to
      six cohorts with 4 subjects (3 receiving TKM-100201 and 1 receiving saline placebo) in each
      cohort. Additional cohorts may be enrolled if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not
      established after the initial six cohorts. In Stage 2, the Multiple-Ascending Dose (MAD)
      portion of the study will have up to three cohorts with four subjects (3 receiving TKM-100201
      and 1 receiving saline placebo) in each cohort. Additional cohorts may be enrolled if a
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not established after the initial three cohorts.
