      mastication and/or the (TMJ), limitations of jaw opening often accompanied by deviations in
      mandibular path, and clicking, popping or grating TMJ sounds. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of the complementary therapies chiropractic therapy and bodywork therapy to the
      standard of care for TMJ pain. If these complementary interventions are shown to be
      effective, the goal is to design and implement a Phase III clinical trial to further evaluate
      the health consequences and cost of these therapies.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, and 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Clinical
      examinations, saliva samples to assess salivary cortisol levels, and a series of
      questionnaires to assess pain and grade of dysfunctional pain, psychological functioning, and
      other physical symptoms will be used to assess outcomes. The investigators will passively
      monitor health care utilization within KPNW using clinical, research, and administrative
      databases.
