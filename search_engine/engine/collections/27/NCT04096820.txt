      predefined history of recurrent UTIs in the previous year will be treated with 3 months of
      oral vaccine with a further 9 months of follow-up. The primary outcome will be no UTI in the
      12 months following initiation of the vaccine (definition of a responder). A clinically
      significant and important outcome will be defined as a responder rate of 50% (50% of
      participants who had at least 3 UTIs in the previous year reporting no UTIs after therapy
      initiated.
