    
      Patients referred for treatment with ECT at St Patrick's Mental Health Services for treatment
      of a depressive episode will be eligible for recruitment to the clinical trial. Participants
      will be invited to be randomised to a course of twice-weekly ketamine or midazolam infusions
      for the duration of ECT. Participants will receive the first allocated infusion following the
      first or second treatment with ECT. Block randomisation will be independently performed.
      Infusions will be delivered on separate days to ECT. Physical, psychotomimetic and cognitive
      outcomes will be monitored before, during and after infusions.Treatment-as-usual will
      continue throughout the entire trial.

      Trial Interventions: participants will receive twice-weekly infusions of either ketamine at
      0.5mg/Kg or midazolam at 0.045mg/Kg. All infusions will be administered by a Consultant
      Anaesthetist. Repeated infusions of allocated drug have been shown to be safe and well
      tolerated by patients with mental illness. Minor haemodynamic changes and psychotomimetic
      side effects can occur and will be assessed regularly during infusions and for 120 minutes
      afterwards. Participants will be followed-up at six weeks and three months after the final
      infusion to assess for relapse according to standardised criteria.
