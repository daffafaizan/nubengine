      routine practice for screening and diagnostic purposes. Nevertheless, due to their intimate
      nature, pelvic examinations may result in loss of control, embarrassment, discomfort and
      anxiety.

      The mirror pelvic exam has been a proposed technique to decrease patient anxiety and improve
      comfort during an already uncomfortable examination. However, little research has focused on
      this modality to date.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the mirror pelvic exam decreases the
      level of vulnerability and discomfort experienced during the pelvic examination.
