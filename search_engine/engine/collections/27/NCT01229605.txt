    
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study of cyclophosphamide and docetaxel/taxotere
      (TC) every 3 weeks in Her2 (-) subjects with locally advanced breast cancer. It is designed
      to assess (1) the clinical and pathologic response rates to this regimen, as well as its
      tolerability in this subject population, and (2) the expression of Tiam1 in tumor-associated
      fibroblasts pre and post treatment.
