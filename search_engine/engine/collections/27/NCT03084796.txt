    
      This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled
      dose-ranging 6-arm parallel group study to identify the optimal dose of CHF 5259 pMDI with
      respect to lung function and other clinical efficacy and safety outcomes.

      After a 2 week run-in period under rescue albuterol and background ICS as needed, patients
      will be randomized to one of the 6 study treatment groups. Following randomization, subjects
      will be assessed after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of study treatment at the center. A follow-up
      phone call will be performed a week after the last visit.

      During the study, daily symptoms, rescue and background medication use and compliance with
      the study drug will be recorded via a subject diary. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events
      (TEAEs) will be assessed and recorded throughout the study. At screening and subsequent
      visits, subjects will undergo physical and vital signs examinations, spirometry measurements,
      and 12-lead ECG. Symptoms and COPD health status will be assessed through validated
      questionnaires. Routine hematology, blood chemistry, and pregnancy testing will be performed
      before enrollment and at end of study. 24-hour digital recording of ECGs (Holter) will be
      performed before and after the first dose and just before the last dose of study treatment.
