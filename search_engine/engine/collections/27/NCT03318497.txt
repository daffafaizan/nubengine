    
      The experimental 18F-FLT-PET/CT is required to be completed before initiation of
      chemotherapy. Labs and correlative radiology, as directed per clinical care, are required
      within 30 days prior to 18F-FLT-PET/CT; and 18F-FDG-PET/CT is required within 30 days before
      the 18F-FLT-PET/CT. Follow-up will comprise 24 months of standard practice treatment and
      follow up.

      Visit 1: Patients will have at least one visit with investigator (or investigator designee)
      prior to the study to review clinical history and prior treatment of pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma, and to explain the study. Correlative radiology studies including CT, MRI and
      18F FDG-PET/CT as per institutional routine clinical care, and any clinically-directed
      laboratory tests performed as part of staging must be performed within 30 days of the 18F
      FLT-PET/CT

      Visit 2 (Optional): The 18F-FDG-PET/CT may be done as a research scan, if the patient is
      unable to obtain a clinically-directed 18F-FDG-PET/CT as part of their clinical care or
      within 30 days of 18F FLT-PET/CT. The research 18F-FDG-PET/CT, in this instance, will be
      identical in procedure to the institution's clinical 18F-FDG-PET/CT. The blood glucose level
      will be < 200 mg/dl, before 18F-FDG injection, which is institutional standard clinical
      protocol. The following additional patient data will be obtained: histological diagnosis of
      primary and/or metastatic disease, date of diagnosis of primary and metastatic disease,
      gender, height, weight (for BMI), ECOG score and confirmation of absence of prior treatment.

      Visit 3: Day of 18F-FLT-PET/CT: The patient will have an intravenous line placed in the hand
      or arm, 18F-FLT-PET/CT will be given by 1-2 minute IV push, and the dose administered will be
      approximately 5 mCi (+/- 20% dose). After approximately 60 +/- 10 minutes of uptake time, the
      patient will be positioned supine in the PET/CT scanner for standard whole body PET/CT scan
      from the skull base to mid-thigh. This scan will take approximately 20-30 min. The window
      from FLT PET/CT baseline study to initiation of chemotherapy should be no more than 30 days.

      Visit 4: Day of Interim 18F-FLT-PET/CT: The interim 18F FLT-PET/CT will be performed after
      the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy regimen, but before the commencement of 3rd cycle. The second
      18F-FLT-PET/CT study must be performed on the same scanner as the first 18F FLT-PET/CT and
      the imaging protocol described in Visit 3 should be closely followed.

      Study duration:

      Clinical Follow Up: Standard of care clinical follow-up data will be collected up to 2 years
      following the end of chemotherapy.
