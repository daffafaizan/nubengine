      good health throughout the lift span. Unfortunately, many people in developed and developing
      societies do not eat a diet with the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables. Because
      of this, prevalence of chronic disease increases rapidly in worldwide as well as the burden
      on the health care system. Therefore, promoting healthy lifestyle and dietary behavior
      becomes a critical approach in preventing chronic disease development. According to results
      from the Moscow Behavioural Risk Factor Survey performed from 2000-2001 found that mean fruit
      and vegetable intake in men and women in Moscow was 190 grams per day, much lower than the
      World Health Organization's recommended 400 grams per day. This lower than recommended intake
      would correlate to a lower intake of phytonutrients and antioxidants and may be associated
      with higher risks for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. In
      this study, we are particularly interested in understanding whether a multivitamin
      multimineral with phytonutrient product can improve nutritional status and reduce heart
      health risk factors in Russian population with low fruit and vegetable intake. This study is
      conducted in Russia Institute of Nutrition (ION) clinic, which has 200 beds and outpatients
      department.
