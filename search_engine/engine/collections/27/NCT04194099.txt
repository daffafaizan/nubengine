      functions and daily activities. Insufficient central nervous system plasticity can result in
      maladaptive changes that prevent full recovery. It's a challenge to guide this plasticity to
      optimize the functional outcome for individuals with SCI.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and trans-spinal electric stimulation (tsES) may
      modulate cortical excitability, corticospinal output and spinal circuit. However, few studies
      investigated the effectiveness of paired nerve stimulation (PNS) on neuroplasticity and
      functional outcome in persons with SCI. Therefore, this study aim to examine the effects of
      the combination of these two different non-invasive nerve stimulation with the cycling
      exercise on the motor cortex and corticospinal circuit excitability as well as functional
      recovery.

      Present study clarifies the effects of five different settings of combined with TMS and tsES
      intervention and then undergo cycling exercise after PNS on spinal cord and cortical
      excitability in SCI participants.

      It is expected that this project will successfully establish a new neuromodulation technology
      to enhance cortical, corticospinal and spinal circuit excitability as well as to improve the
      outcome of lower-limb function and quality of life in persons with SCI. Therefore, this
      project can not only publish scientific papers, but also can enhance the neuroplasticity and
      improve function in persons with SCI.
