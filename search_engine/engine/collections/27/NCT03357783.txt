      can occur in the cervix, vagina and various abdominal organs like the ovary omentum,
      appendix, peritoneum, the pelvic lymph nodes. Other rare sites with deciduosis include the
      kidneys , the lungs and even the skin . Decidualization is a physiologic process during
      pregnancy, under the influence of ovarian and placental steroid secretion, with total
      involution in the four to six week post partum period.
