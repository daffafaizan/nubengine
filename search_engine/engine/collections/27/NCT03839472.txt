      in 50-70% of patients despite the use of adjuvant anticancer therapy after surgery. This is a
      single-arm, non-randomized pilot study looking to determine whether post-Transurethral
      Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) cells counts differ significantly between continuous
      washout of the bladder (CBI) with normal saline compared to pre-CBI wash out. Anticipated
      decrease in tumor recurrence and/or progression rates will also be measured, and each
      participant will act as their own internal control.
