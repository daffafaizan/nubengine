    
      The Decompressive Craniectomy In MALignant middle cerebral artery infarction (DECIMAL) trial
      is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open (single blind for the evaluation of the
      primary outcome measure) controlled study of the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy plus
      the standard medical therapy as compared with the standard medical therapy alone in patients
      with a malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. The study protocol is approved by a
      regional ethic committee (CCPPRB Hospital SAINT LOUIS, PARIS). The study is conducted in 13
      stroke centers in France and is funded by the French Ministry of Health and the "ASSISTANCE
      PUBLIQUE- HOPITAUX DE PARIS". An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitors the
      safety, progress and ethics of the trial.

      The aim of the trial is to determine if patients with malignant middle cerebral artery
      infarction have a better clinical outcome after early decompressive surgery compared to
      standard medical therapy alone.

      Secondary objectives are to determine clinical or MRI based prognostic factors of better
      outcome after decompressive surgery.
