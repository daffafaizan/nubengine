      and asthma specialist offices in southwest Virginia. These participants will undergo two
      visits. At the first visit, a lung assessment comprised of three components will be
      performed, then a 10 minute OMT session, then the lung assessment will be repeated. The lung
      assessment includes a patient symptom survey, a thoracic excursion measurement, and
      spirometry. The participants will then be divided into one of two groups. Group 1 will have
      no further instruction while group 2 will be taught some simple home OMT techniques and asked
      to do them at home. Both groups will return two weeks later for a follow up lung assessment.
      Results when then be studied to determine the effect of OMT on lung function in asthmatics as
      well as the effect of incorporating home OMT. In addition, physicians will be involved in
      learning about OMT and these techniques and they will be assessed for a change in attitude,
      awareness, and willingness to incorporate OMT when applicable.
