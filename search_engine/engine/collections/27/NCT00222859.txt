      not receive treatment. The reasons for non-treatment need to be elucidated to properly
      address these factors. Appropriate evaluation and treatment of HCV is important in providing
      the optimal care to these persons. It is also important to document and characterize
      treatment patterns and prescription rates for policy, resource allocation and funding
      purposes. This study will determine the rates of treatment for HCV monoinfected and HCV-HIV
      co-infected patients, and determine the reasons for non-treatment. It will also directly
      compare the two populations to determine if any differences exist in the reasons for
      non-treatment. This study has implications for patient care, their health outcomes, policy
      making, funding and resource allocation.
