      augmented risk of fractures. More recently, it has been reported that a consistent percentage
      of the general population consider themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat
      and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical
      condition has been named Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity' (NCGS). In a previous paper the
      investigators suggested the term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity' (NCWS), since it is not known
      what component of wheat causes the symptoms in NCGS patients, and the investigators also
      showed that these patients had a high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity.
      That previous study also showed a percentage of NCWS patients had weight loss and anemia:
      whether these depended on the intestinal malabsorption or not remains unclear. As yet no data
      are available on the presence and prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in NCWS patients.
      The aims of the present study is: 1) to investigate the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patient
      and 2) to search for a possible correlation between BMD and other clinical characteristics,
      in particular the body mass index (BMI), of NCWS patients.
