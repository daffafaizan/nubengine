      (CDDP-e TI) to placebo gel for local control of recurrent or refractory squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Assess achievement of a preselected (by the investigator)
      treatment goal for the most troublesome tumor in patients with recurrent or refractory
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck following up to 6 weekly intratumoral treatments
      with CDDP-e TI vs. placebo gel. III. Compare the effect of CDDP-e TI to placebo gel on total
      local tumor volume per patient. IV. Evaluate the time to response and time to progression for
      the most troublesome tumor after local treatment with CDDP-e TI vs. placebo gel. V. Assess
      the improvement in or stabilization of quality of life in these patients as measured by the
      FACT-H&N questionnaire. VI. Compare the histopathology of injected lesions that respond to
      local treatment.

      OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Randomization weighted 2:1 in favor of Arm I. Arm I:
      Intratumoral Chemotherapy. Cisplatin (NSC-119875) and Epinephrine in a bovine collagen gel,
      MP 5010, CDDP-e TI. Arm II: Control. NS in a bovine collagen gel, PLCB.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 120 evaluable patients will be studied to provide 80 evaluable
      patients on Arm I and 40 evaluable patients on Arm II.
