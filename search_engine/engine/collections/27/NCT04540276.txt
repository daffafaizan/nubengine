    
      Patients will be divided into five groups of median intraoperative FiO2 (quintiles), in which
      baseline characteristics and outcomes will be illustrated.

      The odds ratio (OR) for the primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated in a logistic
      regression analysis with median FiO2 (continuous variable) as independent variable.

      Analyses are performed with multiple logistic regression with adjustment for the following
      potentially confounding variables:

      Age ≥75 years. Male sex. Current atrial fibrillation. History of diabetes. History of
      congestive heart failure. History of coronary artery disease. History of recent (i.e., < 6
      months) high-risk coronary artery disease. History of stroke. History of peripheral vascular
      disease. History of hypertension. Preoperative eGFR (<30 vs. 30-44 vs. 45-59 vs. ≥60
      mL/min/1.73m2). Low-risk surgery. Duration of surgery.
