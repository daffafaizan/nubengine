      who need urgent care while identifying patients that may be able to wait safely. The Canadian
      Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a triage tool constructed from a consensus of experts that
      is universally used in Canada. Until now, there has been no evaluation of the validity of the
      tool for children in a clinical context. Also, its inter-rater reproducibility has not been
      evaluated. The expected implementation of a revised version of the Canadian triage tool in
      2008 would be an ideal moment to evaluate its validity and reproducibility. Specific
      objective: 1. To evaluate the validity of the CTAS for children visiting a pediatric ED and
      2. To measure the inter-rater agreement for nurses using the CTAS in these settings.
