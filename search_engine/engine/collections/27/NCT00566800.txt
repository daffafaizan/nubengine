    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if erlotinib hydrochloride can be used as a chemopreventive agent that can
           cause histologic regression of Barrett esophagus in patients at high risk of developing
           esophageal cancer associated with high-grade dysplasia.

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether erlotinib hydrochloride can cause molecular alterations in EGFR,
           phospho-EGFR, cyclin D1, cdc2, p16, p53, PCNA, COX-2, and ploidy in Barrett esophagus
           with high-grade dysplasia.

        -  To establish surrogate markers of chemoprevention in Barrett esophagus with high-grade
           dysplasia.

        -  To validate the histologic scoring of Barrett dysplasia developed by our group.

        -  To evaluate toxicities associated with the use of erlotinib hydrochloride in patients
           with Barrett esophagus associated with high-grade dysplasia.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 3 months. Patients
      showing no evidence of progression to cancer by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy
      receive an additional 3 months of treatment. All patients then undergo repeat EGD, biopsy,
      and determination of molecular markers (i.e., EGFR, phospho-EGFR, cyclin D1, cdc2, p16, p53,
      PCNA, COX-2, and ploidy).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
