      cancer death in men in North America (Jemal 2003). Many patients with localized disease have
      an excellent long-term survival and high cure rates with standard approaches (D'Amico 1998).
      However, patients with high risk, locally advanced and metastatic disease have a poor
      prognosis, and although hormonal therapy in the form of medical or surgical castration can
      induce significant long-term remissions,development of androgen independent disease is
      inevitable. Androgen independent (AI) disease, also termed hormone refractory prostate cancer
      (HRPC), is clinically detected by a rise in prostate specific antigen (PSA) and worsening of
      symptoms. Once patients reach this stage, therapeutic options are limited and prognosis is
      poor

      Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer after docetaxel chemotherapy have limited
      treatment options and no treatment has been proven to be efficacious. Because of the
      mechanism of action and the activity of anti-microtubule agents and combinations in general
      for HRPC, patupilone has potential for therapeutic activity in patients with HRPC that have
      progressed after first line docetaxel chemotherapy.
