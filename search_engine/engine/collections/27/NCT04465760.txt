      catheter-associated thrombosis (CAT) in individuals with a central venous catheter.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of xisomab 3G3 in cancer patients with a PICC or
      indwelling catheter.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assessment of drug exposure and catheter occlusions leading to medical intervention.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive xisomab 3G3 intravenously (IV) or via catheter within 48 hours of catheter
      placement. Patients then receive standard of care chemotherapy 2 days later. After
      approximately 2 weeks, patients undergo standard of care ultrasound for possible CAT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 60 days.
