      dwelling adults (n=4000) aged 65 years and over. This cohort data will allow the
      investigators to describe the prevalence, severity, course and prognosis a range of
      musculoskeletal problems in older people. The initial focus is to evaluate the impact of back
      pain on important health outcomes for older people (quality of life, mobility, falls and
      fractures). In order to do this, the investigators will study people with and without back
      pain at the inception of the cohort. The OPAL cohort will be followed for 5 years in the
      first instance and the investigators will study a range of factors hypothesised to moderate
      and mediate the effects of back and other musculoskeletal pain for example, co-morbidities.

      The OPAL cohort will be sampled from older people registered with primary care practices.

      The investigators aim to develop a prognostic tool using the cohort data that will help older
      people, GPs and other health professionals identify when LBP is a risk factor for disability,
      functional limitation and loss of mobility, and when LBP should be prioritised as a treatment
      target.
