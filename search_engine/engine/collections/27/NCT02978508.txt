      following dermal application. In these settings, a conventional pharmacokinetic human study
      to demonstrate that Mayne Permethrin cream (5% w/w) is bioequivalent to the Reference Listed
      Drug [RLD] Elimite™ is not appropriate.

      This is a clinical endpoint bioequivalence (BE) study for a Permethrin Cream, 5% formulation
      for the treatment of active scabies in comparison to Elimite™ Permethrin cream (5% w/w).

        -  Test Product: Permethrin Cream, 5%

        -  Reference Product: Elimite™ marketed by Prestium Pharma, Inc. ("Prestium"), the branded
           subsidiary of Renaissance Pharma.

      The infested person, as well as household members are treated at the same time to prevent
      re-infestation. In consideration of this recommendation, the household members of the
      enrolled subject will be examined and treated at the same time as the enrolled subject with
      an FDA-approved generic Permethrin Cream, 5%.
