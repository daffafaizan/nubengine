      that predispose patients to such injury. The brain is a highly interconnected organ linked
      through neuronal connections, cellular migration, and vascular supply and is endowed with
      exquisitely radiosensitive stem cell niches responsible for neuro-regeneration. To date, the
      effects of brain radiation have been quantified in few brain substructures. The majority of
      publications on this topic have focused on regions receiving higher doses. Even low dose
      radiation exposure, however has global implications on brain development and function, and
      its effects are less well studied. It is increasingly recognized that radiation damage to one
      brain region can potentially affect brain development more broadly. This has important
      implications on RT planning and the potential for understanding its long-term effects.

      In this protocol, the investigators aim to measure serum inflammatory cytokine levels and
      other molecular biomarkers at baseline and post-exposure in an exploratory manner to
      investigate potential associations with the risk of developing volumetric changes in the
      brain and radiation-induced toxicities.

      This study will observe sixty (60) patients under the age of 21 with brain or base of skull
      tumor. The study team will observe the effect of radiation therapy per the study protocol
      versus standard of care.
