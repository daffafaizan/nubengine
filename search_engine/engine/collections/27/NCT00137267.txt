      the inpatient psychiatry service at the New Jersey VA with a substance abuse disorder and a
      severe and persistent mental illness. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two
      conditions: 1) treatment-as-usual in inpatient and outpatient services plus 8 weeks of Time
      Limited Care-Coordination (TLC), a brief linkage augmentation intervention or 2)
      treatment-as-usual along with 8 weeks of matched attention in the form of health education
      sessions (TAU+A). The data analytic plan included descriptive and advanced statistical
      analysis.

      Objective # 1: To determine whether those in TLC have better attendance in inpatient sessions
      compared to those receiving Treatment-As-Usual Plus Attention (TAU+A).

      Objective # 2: To determine whether those in TLC have better attendance in outpatient
      sessions compared to those receiving Treatment-As-Usual Plus Attention (TAU+A).

      Objective # 3: To determine whether TLC, compared to Treatment-As-Usual Plus Attention
      (TAU+A) reduces rehospitalizations and has an effect on the use of the Emergency Room use.

      Objective # 4: To determine whether TLC achieves a reduction in drug usage and related
      problems as compared to those receiving TAU+A.

      A total of 102 veterans were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Time Limited
      Care-Coordination (TLC), an eight-week co-occurring disorders intervention or (2) Treatment
      As Usual + Matched Attention (TAU+A) control condition in the form of health education
      sessions. However, both groups also received treatment as usual in inpatient and outpatient
      settings.
