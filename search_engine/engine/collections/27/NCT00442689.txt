    
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common conditions of young women, and it
      is frequently associated with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome (MBS). In addition,
      affected women have significantly elevated mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and an
      increased prevalence of at risk LDL levels, independent of obesity. We are directly testing
      the role of androgens in the metabolic abnormalities in PCOS by examining the impact of
      direct androgen receptor blockade by anti-androgen medications and indirect suppression of
      androgen production through suppression of leutinizing hormone (LH) with oral contraceptive
      pills (OCPs), compared with placebo, on visceral adiposity, circulating LDL levels, insulin
      secretion and sensitivity as measured by frequently-sampled IV glucose tolerance tests
      (FSIGT) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), resting energy expenditure, and maximal
      aerobic capacity measurement.

      Note: Originally there were 2 additional study arm, Metformin only and Metformin + Flutamide.
      These study arms were ultimately eliminated and were not included in analysis of baseline
      characteristics or endpoints.
