      colonoscopy duration, and increasing the rate of cecal intubation and of polyp detection.
      There are several types of preparations available on the market and, irrespective of the
      choice, the split-dose regimen should be followed. A reduced volume preparation makes the
      process easier and more tolerable, increasing adhesion. Regarding the diet to be applied
      before the examination, there are no advantages to a liquid diet compared to a low fiber
      diet, and there is no evidence on the duration of the diet. In addition, a restrictive diet
      has an impact on satisfaction and also on adherence to treatment.
