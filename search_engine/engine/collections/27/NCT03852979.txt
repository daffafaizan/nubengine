      fertility is an abdominal radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Since the
      number of take home babies after completing this procedure is below 10%, there is a need for
      exploration of alternative treatment modalities with better chances of preserving fertility
      at equal risk of recurrence. Since low fertility rates after abdominal radical hysterectomy
      are observed due to the radical surgery performed on the uterine cervix, less radical surgery
      is warranted. To enable less radical surgery by cervical conisation, neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy to reduce tumor size is incorporated to the multi-modal treatment scheme of
      these patients.
