      volunteers participating in a cadaver laboratory as part of their training. The study took
      place in Bulverde, TX. Participants were randomized to perform cadaver ventilation first
      using either the novel Nu-MaskR intraoral device or conventional bag valve mask. A one handed
      seal technique was used to simulate single operator ventilation. Participants were
      responsible for mask placement while a ventilator delivered 10 breaths each with a
      standardized tidal volume of 750 ml. After a 5-minute washout period, they performed
      ventilation using the alternative device. The primary outcome measure was air leak as
      calculated by subtracting tidal volume received from tidal volume delivered as measured by
      the ventilator.
