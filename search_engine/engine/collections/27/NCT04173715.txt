      substantially improved in the last decades with accelerometer-based estimations. The
      popularity of these devices is partially explained by the capacity of objectively recording
      physical behaviors (e.g., sleep, sedentary time, physical activityâ€¦) during the whole day.
      The so-called "cut-point" approach is behind most of the research on physical activity with
      accelerometers. Cut-points provide metrics that are easy to understand, to translate to the
      public and to replicate by researchers in different settings. Usually, the minimum
      requirement is to use cut-points adapted to the age-group of the population of interest.

      Under this paradigm, cut-points have been developed in all age-groups and with a variate set
      to data collection and processing protocols. However, some scenarios lack of available
      cut-points to implement, being older adults (> 65 years) the population with less
      alternatives of cut-points to use. In this sense, studies with older adults choose cut-points
      developed in younger adults to classify physical activity intensities. Biomechanical and
      physiological differences between adults and older adults advise against using this strategy.
      Therefore, relative energy expenditure and functional status should be considered for future
      cut-points design. Moreover, must be also awarded that hardly any previous cut-points
      validation protocols have been performed in a free-living setting. For this reason, more
      studies following these designs seems necessary to improve cut-points population's validity.
      Missing all mentioned factors could lead to physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns
      misclassification in this population.
