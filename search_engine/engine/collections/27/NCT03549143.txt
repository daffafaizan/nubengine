      among patients. To date there are no data on the prevalence of the disease in Russia. This is
      the first study to show patient profile, main trigger factors and concomitant diseases among
      patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in Russia. Also treatment characteristics for
      these patients in Russia will be measured. This study fills a lack of scientific data about
      prevalence of IBS and additional information.
