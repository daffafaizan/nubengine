      microorganisms, which play a significant role in the development, regulation, and maintenance
      of immune functions. Fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), are thought to
      be anti-inflammatory and consequently may increase susceptibility to infection by hindering
      their body's ability to produce an adequate inflammatory response in defense against
      infectious disease. Currently, women in Canada are supplementing their diets with n-3 PUFA
      during gestation and lactation despite their being conflicting clinical evidence regarding
      the beneficial effects on infant development. It is currently unknown how maternal fish oil
      supplementation impacts the offspring's gut microbiota and immune functions. Considering that
      diet influences microbiota and maternal microbiota is passed from mother to infant, the
      investigators hypothesize that maternal fish oil supplementation will affect the
      participants' infant gut microbiota and immunity.

      This study will evaluate the effects of postnatal n-3 PUFA supplementation in breast milk on
      the fecal microbiome in infants over a six-month period. The investigators will analyze the
      fecal microbiome of infants born to mothers in the fish oil and non-fish oil groups via next
      generation sequencing. As short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced by gut bacteria and
      affect immunity, the investigators will analyze SCFA in stool through gas chromatography.
      Markers of inflammation like fecal calprotectin and sIgA in stool samples will also be
      identified.
