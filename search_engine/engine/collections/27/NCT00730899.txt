      hypertrophy by transducing signals of neurohormones in cardiomyocytes. Single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the G protein subunits Galphas and Galphaq have been shown to result
      in altered protein expression. We now want to examine whether G Protein polymorphisms alter
      NYHA functional class, and hemodynamic variables in patients with coronary artery disease
      scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting .
