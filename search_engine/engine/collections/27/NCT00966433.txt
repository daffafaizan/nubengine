      allows the patient to breathe in and out adequately under general anesthesia (GA). The
      ProSeal™ LMA (PLMA™) is a specialized type of LMA with a design that permits the delivery of
      higher pressures to help the patient breathe in and out (ventilate) and also contains a
      channel to suction the stomach.

      Children under GA may breathe through a PLMA in different ways. Spontaneous ventilation
      consists of the children breathing on their own through a PLMA™. Pressure support ventilation
      allows the patient to breathe on their own with additional help from the anesthesia machine.
      Pressure control ventilation allows the patient to breathe with the help of an anesthesia
      machine.

      A child undergoing surgery requires a deep level of general anesthesia which negatively
      affects their ability to ventilate. Thus, children may not breathe in oxygen and carbon
      dioxide out adequately at this level of anesthesia and it may be beneficial to provide some
      level of support to enhance carbon dioxide exchange and to avoid hypoventilation.

      This study will attempt to determine whether pressure support ventilation improves
      ventilation in children undergoing outpatient surgery.
