    
      LN-145/LN-145-S1 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL
      manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with
      recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The cell transfer
      therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative
      regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen
      of IL-2.
