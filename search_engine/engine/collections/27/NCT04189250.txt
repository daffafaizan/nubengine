      rebreathing protocol (aCO). Although theses two protocols using the same method, they show
      some relevant differences.

      The oCO use a 2 minutes rebreathing period in a seated position and capillary blood is taken.
      The aCO use a 10 minutes rebreathing period in a supine position and venous blood samples are
      taken.

      It is essential to know to what extent the aCO with capillary or venous blood sampling with
      different rebreathing time and position compared to oCO will influence the provided
      hemoglobin mass values. It is important to ensure the comparability of formely hemoglobinmass
      data measured using oCO with hemoglobinmass data measured using aCO for scientific research.
