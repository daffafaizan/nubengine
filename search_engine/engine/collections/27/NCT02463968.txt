      arthritis in approximately one fourth of patients. There is currently no standard treatment
      for chikungunya arthritis, and the mechanisms leading to this chronic arthritis are unclear.
      Further characterization of the disease pathophysiology is needed in order to guide
      evaluation of potential therapeutics. It is hypothesized that chronic chikungunya arthritis
      is due to persistence of active virus in the synovial fluid where macrophages serve as a
      viral reservoir. The predominance of activated macrophages in persistently infected tissue
      and the presence of viral genome within these macrophages in non-human primates makes our
      hypothesis plausible. To test this hypothesis, this study has three Specific Aims. Aim 1,
      describe host characteristics affect susceptibility to severe or persistent arthritis. Aim 2,
      determine if chikungunya virus persists in synovial fluid and synovial fluid macrophages in
      humans as shown in non-human primates. Aim 3, investigate how these macrophages may be
      activated and modulated by cytokines. To date, these pathophysiologic factors have not been
      well characterized in humans. Information gained from this study can directly lead to
      recommendations for the further evaluation of antiviral versus immune modulating medications.
