      the production of molecules that impact health-are widely accepted to play a key role. A
      significant proportion of IBD patients with pouches (surgically created rectums after the
      diseased colon is removed) continue to have inflammation similar to their previous disease.

      Only a few microbes are known to have the capability to modify primary bile acids (PBAs) made
      by the liver to secondary bile acids (SBAs). SBAs are some of the most common metabolites in
      the colon and play key roles in several diseases.

      In previous study, the investigators examined bile acid levels in stool from pouches
      (surgically-created "rectums" made of small bowel) in colectomy-treated patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) versus colectomy-treated controls without inflammatory disease. This
      comparison revealed that certain SBAs are significantly decreased in stool from UC compared
      to control pouches.

      In this study the investigators will investigate if ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) may reduce
      inflammatory markers and improve quality of life (as assessed by validate survey) in UC pouch
      patients (colectomy-treated patients with ulcerative colitis) with active antibiotic
      refractory or antibiotic dependent pouchitis.
