      morbidity and mortality. Despite being dangerously underweight, people with AN believe that
      they are overweight, and frequently exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety. Other
      symptoms of AN include the following: resistance to maintaining a healthy body weight; fear
      of gaining weight or becoming overweight; and denial of the seriousness of one's current low
      body weight. Relapse rates for AN are extremely high. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or
      chemical messenger, that affects mood, impulse control, and appetite. A serotonin transporter
      is a specialized protein that allows cells to communicate with each other by using serotonin.
      Disturbances in the serotonergic system, the network of nerve cells that uses serotonin as
      its neurotransmitter, may contribute to the behaviors that are characteristic of AN. This
      study will compare women with a history of AN who are now maintaining a normal weight to
      healthy women of normal weight in terms of the concentration of serotonin transporter in
      their brains.

      Participants in this observational study will undergo one positron emission tomography (PET)
      scan and one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Both will be used to measure the
      concentration of the serotonin transporter. A radioactive tracer will be used for the PET
      scan, and will be administered via an intravenous catheter line. No treatment will be
      provided in this study.
