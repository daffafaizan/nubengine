      prevalence rate ranges between 29.5 - 85.5%. One of the internal etiological factors is
      decreased production of natural moisturizing factor as a humectant. Application of
      moisturizer is the mainstay treatment. Moisturizer with humectant property, like lactate and
      urea, could restore skin hydration and barrier dysfunction. This study aims to compare the
      efficacy and safety between moisturizing cream containing 12% ammonium lactate and 10% urea
      in geriatric with xerosis cutis.
