      we propose to use TRUS and the TRUS-Robot to record ultrasound images during PVP in 10
      patients. The PVP procedure will be conducted as usual, without using the ultrasound for
      guiding the intervention. TRUS images of the prostate gland and the intraprostatic cavity
      formed during the PVP procedure will be recorded. These will include three dimensional (3-D)
      images acquired at the beginning and end of the operation. In addition, real-time 2-D images
      will be recorded during the case. Recorded images will then be analyzed offline to observe
      the extent of the vaporization or enucleation of the prostate gland.
