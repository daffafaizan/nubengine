    
      To compare the analgesia and side effect of nalbuphine and morphine for elective Laparoscopic
      myomectomy, by using patient controlled analgesia postoperatively, a randomized, double blind
      clinical trial. Patients undergoing elective Laparoscopic myomectomy are randomly divided
      into two groups: nalbuphine and morphine groups. All patients are under general anesthesia
      with routine methods. The nalbuphine group receive postoperative patient controlled analgesia
      using nalbuphine 30mg/120ml, while the morphine group receive postoperative patient
      controlled analgesia using morphine 60mg/120ml. Perioperative parameters are to be collected
      to compare the two groups.
