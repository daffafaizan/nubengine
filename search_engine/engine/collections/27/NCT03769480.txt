      are effective in performance is very important to determine the physical performance
      potential. The body is a kinetic chain and core muscles play an important role in this chain.
      The relationship between the performance ability of the athletes and the relationship between
      the core muscles and performance abilities and respiratory function is extremely important.
      Different functional classifications caused by different barriers (physical, mental or
      visual) in many paralympic branches affect physical training because it is directly related
      to the classification, performance and training adaptations of an athlete. Determining the
      parameters that affect the respiratory function of paralympics is very important to develop a
      training program with strategies that can affect the physical performance of athletes and
      thus to achieve the desired results in training and competitions. Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to investigate the relationship between respiratory muscle strength and core muscle
      strength in paralympic athletes (athletes with disability).
