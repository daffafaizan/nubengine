      matrix stability and to maintain the blood clot in the defect site, which promoted the
      cartilage regeneration by mesenchymal stem cell . It was a atelocollagen, highly purified
      porcine derived type collagen І that has been modified to virtually eliminate the risk of
      rejection by removal of telopeptide.

      The investigators randomized patients undergoing HTO in combination with microfracture to
      receive either microfracture alone (control group, n = 5) or microfracture with collagen
      augmentation (experimental group, n=6). At postoperative one year, the clinical outcome in
      terms of Visual Analogue Scale of pain level (VAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner scores were
      evaluated. In addition, second look arthroscopic examination and biopsy of regenerated
      cartilage were carried out when the HTO plate was removed at postoperative one year. Biopsy
      specimens were graded by International Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale (ICRS
      II scores). Finally, radiologic outcome in terms of Magnetic Resonance Observation of
      Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scores was assessed using follow up MRI undertaken at
      postoperative one year.
