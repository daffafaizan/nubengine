      quality of life by increasing relaxation and sleep quality in children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD). Essential oils (aromatic oils extracted from plant parts) are routinely used
      by the public and are available on the market. Investigators are conducting this study
      because it is unknown whether the essential oils formulations will be safe and effective for
      helping children with ASD relax and sleep.

      To participate in this study children must be between 3-9 years of age and have been
      diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Approximately 40 children will be screened to enroll
      28 children and their families in the study.

      In a double-blind crossover study, participants will be randomized to treatment order. All
      participants will receive both fragrant oil blends. Those randomized will receive one
      fragrant oil blend for 3 months, with a 1-month "washout" period in between and then start
      the second fragrant oil blend in the last 3 months. The treatment orders are A/C and C/A.

      Study participation will last for 7 months. There will be one screening visit (about 5 hours
      long, which can be split into 2 visits), two baseline visits (about 2 hours each), two
      endpoint visits (2 hours each) and 5 other clinic visits (each 45-60 minutes). Visits will
      take place at the OSU Nisonger Center and the OSU General Clinical Research Center.
