      necessary occupations. The emotional and physical demands of caregiving often contribute to
      caregivers experiencing burden. Caregivers with burden are at-risk for poor health and a
      heightened risk of mortality. This is likely, in turn, to negatively impact care-recipient
      quality of life. The proposed study refines a behavioral intervention that teaches caregivers
      to facilitate problem solving over the course of daily activities. The long-term goal for
      this project is to establish an effective rehabilitation intervention that promotes caregiver
      health and well-being, which ultimately influences care-recipient health. This study will use
      an open-case series and a single-arm clinical trial to refine the intervention and examine
      caregiver and care-recipient response to the intervention. This research applies to the
      priorities and objectives of this research initiative through examination of a
      caregiver-centered, standardized intervention that is based on occupational theories and
      principles, investigating outcomes experienced by caregivers of individuals with cognitive
      deficits after stroke. Data from this pilot project will be used to design and obtain federal
      funding for a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the refined intervention
      on caregiver and care-recipient health outcomes.
