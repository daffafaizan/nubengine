      identify follicular fluid changes in cancer patients undergoing fertility preservation.
      Although metabolomics have been applied already in cancer studies, this is the first
      application on follicular fluid of cancer patients.

      Methods: The investigators selected for the study 10 patients with breast cancer and lymphoma
      who resorted to oocyte cryopreservation to preserve fertility and 10 healthy women undergoing
      in vitro fertilization treatments. Follicular fluid was collected at the time of oocytes
      retrieval. Metabolomic analysis of follicular fluids was performed by 1H NMR spectroscopy in
      combination with multivariate analysis to interpret the spectral data. Univariate statistical
      analysis was applied to find correlations between patients' features and metabolites
      identified by NMR.
