      I. Determine the antitumor activity of karenitecin in patients with persistent or recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive karenitecin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
