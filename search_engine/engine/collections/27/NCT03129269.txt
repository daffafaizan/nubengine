      individuals referred to the Toulouse Frailty Clinic during 2 years. The procedure consists in
      neuroimaging to diagnose the presence of amyloid plaques in the brains and permit earlier
      detection of Alzheimer's disease.

        -  Visits will be scheduled at baseline, 1 and 2 years for a full neuropsychological,
           functional and physical evaluation.

        -  At 6 and 18 months patients will be seen in consultation by a Geriatrician and research
           assistant for a medical check.

        -  PET-Scan will be scheduled in the 2 months following inclusion for amyloid measurements.
           The MRI will be proposed, depending on the clinical relevance

        -  A blood sample for biobank will be taken at visit 2 and at the end of the study
