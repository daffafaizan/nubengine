      I. To determine the complete remission (CR) rate in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients
      prospectively selected for tipifarnib (ZARNESTRA) treatment on the basis of a 2-gene
      signature (RASGRP1:APTX ratio) in bone marrow aspirates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median overall and 1-year survival of patients treated with this regimen
      II. To determine the median relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      III. To determine the safety of this regimen in these patients IV. To determine the
      immunophenotypic expression of RASGRP1 on baseline bone marrow blasts and assess correlation
      with PCR-based detection.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy are collected at baseline and on day 28 of course 1 and 2
      for RasGRP1 protein expression analysis by qRT-PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 30 days.
