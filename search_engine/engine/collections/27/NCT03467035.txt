    
      80 patients with proven bronchiectasis, diagnosed by high-resolution computed tomography
      (HRCT), will be recruited from our outpatient clinic of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital with
      written informed consent. Inclusion criteria are: daily sputum > 10 ml; absence of asthma or
      other unstable systemic diseases; and "steady-state" bronchiectasis (< 10% alteration of 24 h
      sputum volume, FEV1, and FVC, and in the absence of deterioration in respiratory symptoms at
      baseline visits). Exclusion criteria include: unreliable clinic attendance; regular user of
      inhaled or oral corticosteroids; history of lung resection and known asthma defined according
      to American Thoracic Society guidelines.

      The lung function and desaturation will be assessed by six-minute walking tests and the
      severity of disease will be evaluated by HRCT scores. Peripheral blood sample (40ml/person)
      is performed to analyze the bone turnover markers and the level of Hif in PBMC.
