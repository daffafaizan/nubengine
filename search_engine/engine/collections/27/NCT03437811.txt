      severe conditions, for the efficacy of the Electro Flo Percussor, Model 5000 (K031876),
      Regulation Number: 21 CFR 868.5665, with current FDA indication of: provide airway clearance
      therapy when external manipulation of the thorax is the physician's choice of treatment.
      Indications for this form of therapy are described by the American Association for
      Respiratory Care (AARC) in the Clinical Practices Guidelines for Postural Drainage Therapy (
      I ) (1991). According to AARC guidelines, specific indications for external manipulation of
      the thorax include evidence or a suggestion of retained secretions, evidence that the patient
      is having difficulty with the secretion clearance, or presence of atelectasis caused by mucus
      plugging. In addition, the Med Systems Electro Flo Percussor Model 5000 is also indicated for
      external manipulation of the thorax to promote airway clearance or improve bronchial drainage
      for purposes of collecting mucus for diagnostic evaluation.
