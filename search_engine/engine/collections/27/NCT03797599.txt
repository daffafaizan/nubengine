      length mindfulness practice (lasting 20 mins) and 5 mins of an audio book; (2) four sessions
      of brief mindfulness practice (lasting 5 mins) and 20 mins of an audio book; and (3) a
      control group who just receive 4 sessions of audio book (lasting 25 mins). In the mindfulness
      arms, in each session, the participants will receive the audio book prior to the mindfulness
      practice. Mindfulness levels, and depression, anxiety and stress will be measured by
      self-report at baseline, session by session, and at post-intervention.
