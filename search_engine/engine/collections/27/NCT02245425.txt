      to attend 4 sessions, with one week in between each session as follows: Week 0 = baseline
      assessment and treatment 1; Week 1= treatment 2; Week 2 = treatment 3; and week 4 = follow-up
      assessment.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either a supine or
      prone thoracic spine thrust manipulation intervention.
