    
      This is a 2-year post approval safety (PAS) study evaluating the Adverse Event (AE) rate of
      Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS) baseline grade 4 hands (Group A) compared to the AE rate of
      MHGS baseline grade 2-3 hands (Group B).

      Subjects will be recruited at each site with the intention to have an equal number of
      subjects in Group A and Group B. All subjects will receive an initial Radiesse hand treatment
      in both hands, and up to 3 retreatments in the study. Hands will be assessed by evaluators on
      the MHGS who will be blinded to group, treatment details, time since last treatment, and
      number of retreatments.
