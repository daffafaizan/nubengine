      educational or organisational decision-making activities. DSSs fuse human knowledge and
      technology to support and improve decision-making.

      The area of precision oncology that supports the treatment of breast cancer has not only seen
      an increase in the availability of different treatment choices but also genomic tools to
      support the decision-making process. CDSSs have been available for use in clinical oncology
      practice for over a decade. However, there has been some criticism around the utility of CDSS
      in personalised medicine decision-making of breast cancer, with these systems often viewed as
      aids better suited to support the 'average' patient's requirements rather than personalised
      treatment for the individual patient.

      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate an innovative CDSS (MedicBK) platform based
      on the comparison of multiple treatments simultaneously in making care decisions taking into
      account the individual characteristics of patients, i.e., based on personalized
      evidence-based medicine.
