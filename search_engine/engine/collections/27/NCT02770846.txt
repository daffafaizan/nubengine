    
      Purpose: The objective of the present prospective randomized clinical study was to compare
      the overall treatment outcome following immediate loading (IL) and delayed loading (DL) of
      single implants after 5 year of follow-up.

      Patients with a missing maxillary tooth (15-25) were randomly assigned to IL or DL. The
      protocol included implant installation in healed sites, immediate loading, delayed loading,
      temporary screw-retained restoration, and replacement with a permanent single implant crown.
      Outcome measures were implant survival, marginal bone level, soft tissue changes, papillae
      index, pink, and white esthetic score (PES and WES), patient judged aesthetics, and oral
      health impact profile (OHiP-14).
