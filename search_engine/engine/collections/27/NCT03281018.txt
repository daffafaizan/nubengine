      20% more anxious than the general population, according to a study of 2013. Cancer as well as
      surgery modifying the body pattern and impairing femininity are risk factors for preoperative
      anxiety. Recent work in both children and adults has shown that significant levels of
      preoperative anxiety increase the risk of postoperative complications and the occurrence of
      postoperative emotional and behavioral disorders. The consequences of hysterectomy increase
      patients' anxiety, for fear of affecting femininity, and the modification of the body
      regimen. The prevention of preoperative anxiety in such population is therefore a major
      issue.
