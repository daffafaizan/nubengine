      two studies at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) designed to determine the safety of treating
      hepatocellular carcinoma with SBRT. These studies have shown that SBRT can be delivered
      safely to the majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The treated tumour was
      controlled (shrank or remained the same size) in 78% of patients at one year following
      treatment.The median survival of patients was 11 months (i.e. half of patients survived
      longer and half shorter than 11 months). This survival rate is better than that expected in
      patients treated with supportive care only (no treatment other than care to make you feel
      better). Supportive care patients have a median survival rate of 3-9 months. We expect that
      the benefits of SBRT in this study will be similar to those observed in our initial studies.
