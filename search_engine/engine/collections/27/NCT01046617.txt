      placebo. Both the active treatment and placebo will be taken orally, 1 times daily, for 21
      days.

      All infants are eligible for screening. If a patient appears to meet the criteria for
      enrollment and express interest in the study, cow's milk elimination diet will be prescribed
      for 1 week to a breastfeeding mother (and to an infant, in case of formula fed infants). Care
      givers will be asked to record for 1 week symptoms of colic. Children fulfilling inclusion
      criteria will be asked to participate in the study.
