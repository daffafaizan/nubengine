      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sonidegib in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors as part of the dose escalation
      phase. (Part A) II. To estimate the response rate of sonidegib in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as part of the expansion cohort based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. (Part B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety profile and tolerability of sonidegib and pembrolizumab.

      II. To obtain preliminary estimates of efficacy as measured by response rate (based on RECIST
      criteria), disease control rate at 6 months, duration of response, overall survival (OS), and
      progression free survival (PFS) of sonidegib and pembrolizumab in patients with selected
      advanced solid tumors.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the immunologic effects of sonidegib and pembrolizumab by investigating the
      changes in circulating tumor cells, immune cell markers, cytokines, and soluble PD-L1 in
      blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sonidegib.

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-8 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 24
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.
