      tags (called microfabricated tags) that surgeons can put on their sponges. Then, if the
      surgeons forget to remove a sponge from a patient, they'll be able to detect these special
      tags in an x-ray. We wish to take x-rays of healthy people's abdomens with microfabricated
      tags lying on them. The x-rays will help us improve our system for detecting sponges left
      inside people's bodies.
