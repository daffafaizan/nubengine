    
      Hypertensive patients aged 40-65 years, both genders, presenting serum triglycerides levels
      higher than 150 mg/dl will be randomized into two groups. The first group will be receiving
      ciprofibrate 100mg/day and the second group will be receiving fish oil 1800mg/day. All
      patients will be evaluated with brachial flow-mediated dilation and with EndoPAT to assess
      endothelial function before and after supplementation. SPHYGMOCOR and pulse wave velocity
      (PWV) measurements will also be obtained.
