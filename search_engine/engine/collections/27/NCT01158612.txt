      population. The healing process is a prolonged process, and complete recovery of tissue
      strength is nearly never reached. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of local
      injection of human Growth Hormone on tendon collagen synthesis.

      in order to investigate the collagen synthesis potential and the influence of growth hormone,
      12 elderly males age > 50 year, is enrolled in this study.
