      often leads to worsening of symptoms and decreased mobility, daily functioning and quality of
      life. Total joint arthroplasty improves pain in end-stage arthrosis but accustomed
      postoperative care and rehabilitation alone may not guarantee optimal regain of functioning
      for frail and vulnerable older arthroplasty patients. Preoperative optimization of older
      patients with multimorbidity and functional limitations may improve benefits of the
      arthroplasty even at lower costs. Patients randomized into intervention arm of the present
      study receive preoperative assessment with treatment and prehabilitation plan. The focuses of
      the intervention are patient's chronic conditions, nutritional status, medication and
      physical activity. The intervention is delivered by multiprofessional team (geriatrician,
      registered nurse, physiotherapist and pharmacist).

      Older adults undergoing surgery are a rapidly growing but vulnerable patient group. Knowledge
      on effects of preoperative evaluation and optimization is sparse, especially on the effects
      of multi-domain interventions.
