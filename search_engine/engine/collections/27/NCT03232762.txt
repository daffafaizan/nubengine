      to Diet A, a high proportion of calories from refined grains as a carbohydrate source, and
      Diet B, a high proportion of calories from whole grains. Random number assignment is
      impractical for counseling purposes and blinding not possible. Therefore, randomization by
      diet assignment by day of initial visit via random number was chosen. If the random number is
      odd Diet A would be selected, if the random number is even Diet B will be selected for that
      day.
