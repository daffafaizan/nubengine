      some negative reports also existed.(Wang F. et al. 2008)Recently conducted systematic review
      of Pittler and Ernst reported that there was insufficient, but not conclusive evidence to
      support the efficacy of acupuncture and acupressure for weight loss. However, most of these
      studies had methodological limitation, such as lack of adequate control group or unclear
      specific effect of electroacupuncture alone because auricular acupuncture was administered as
      well. In this sudy, we had three-arm randomized controlled trial(with sham control group) to
      investigate whether electroacupuncture is effective in the treatment of obesity.
