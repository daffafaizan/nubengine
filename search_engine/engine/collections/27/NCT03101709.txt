      suitability of their T cells for CART-19 manufacturing will be determined at entry phase.
      Subjects will be collected their T cells and modify them, the modification is a genetic
      change, that CD19:4-1BB:CD3 modified T cells, in order to tells the T cells to recognize
      their target tumor cells and potentially kill them, but not other normal cells in the
      subject's body. The CART cells will then be expanded in vitro and then administered to
      subjects.

      The purpose of this study is to assess ssess the safety and feasibility of CART-19 cells in
      the patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma.
