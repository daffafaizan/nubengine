      results. Although the rate of tendon healing is reported to be around 80% for small tears, it
      can decrease to about 30% for large and massive tears. Poor tissue quality of bone, tendons,
      and muscles can affect healing and functional recovery of the rotator cuff and has been
      advocated as a major cause of tendon nonhealing and/or retear. Several biological
      augmentation procedures have recently been suggested to enhance tendon healing after
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, such as marrow-stimulating technique with microfractures of
      the greater tuberosity. The purpose of this study was to introduce a new technique,
      "greenhouse technique", and to compare the clinical outcomes with microfracture combined with
      suture bridge technique.
