    
      1. To compare the incidence and severity of self-reported symptoms in persons with CD4
           counts <100 cells/mm3 versus those with CD4 counts ≥ 100 cells/mm3 who are initiating
           antiretroviral therapy.

        2. To determine the relationship between self-reported symptoms and levels of T cells, HIV
           RNA, activation marker cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and
           other cytokines as measured before and after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

        3. To determine the relationship between antiretroviral drug trough levels (estimated drug
           concentrations) and the incidence and severity of self-reported symptoms in persons
           initiating antiretroviral therapy.

        4. To determine the relationship between adverse events and immunological status as
           evidenced by lymphocyte counts and activation marker cytokine levels.

        5. To determine the relationship between clinical events and immunological status as
           evidenced by lymphocyte counts and activation marker cytokine levels.
