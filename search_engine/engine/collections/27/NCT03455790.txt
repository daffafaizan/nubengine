      shoulder internal and external rotation, grip strength, anaerobic capacity, aerobic capacity
      and sportive performance in wheelchair basketball athletes.

      26 wheelchair basketball athletes were involved into the study. Wheelchair basketball players
      were divided into two groups according to the classification levels (Group 1: less than 3
      points, Group 2: 3 points and higher). Upper extremity muscle strengths were evaluated with
      the ISOMED 2000Â® isokinetic device. Hand grip strength was evaluated with hydraulic hand
      dynamometer. The measurement of the aerobic capacity was measured using its own wheelchair on
      the treadmill by applying a custom ramp protocol. Anaerobic capacity was evaluated with
      Wingate anaerobic power test (WAnT) for 30 seconds in standard laboratory conditions. The
      sportive performances were assessed by "20 m Sprint test", "Slalom Test" and "Zone Shot"
      tests.
