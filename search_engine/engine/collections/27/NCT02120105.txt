      to the recurrent nature of the disease. Despite recent advancements in knowledge about
      cystinuria, such as the discovery of the genetic defects that cause the disease, there have
      been very few studies of clinical determinants of recurrent stone formation. An optimal
      method of measuring cystine solubility in the urine has been lacking, and therefore response
      to pharmacologic and dietary therapy is often not known. Recently, a new assay to measure the
      amount of cystine in the urine was developed called Cystine Capacity, or CysCap. It is an
      assay that adds a pre-formed amount of cystine crystals to urine and measures the amount of
      cystine the urine can take up from the solid phase (in undersaturated urine) or gives up to
      solid phase (in supersaturated urine). This study seeks to examine how well this measure of
      urinary cystine predicts stone occurrence, with the ultimate goal of helping to guide therapy
      and preventing kidney stones in cystinurics.

      This is an observational study over 3 years. Subjects who are enrolled in the study will
      perform semi-annual 24-hour urine collections. They will undergo imaging of the kidneys every
      6 months to monitor kidney stone formation or growth, in order to correlate urinary
      parameters with clinical events. The study will examine how well the urinary cystine capacity
      predicts stone formation.
