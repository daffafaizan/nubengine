      phosphate in ambulatory patients diagnosed SMA Type 3 over an extended period. The study is
      planned to include approximately 12 male and female SMA Type 3 patients. The planned duration
      of participation for each patient may be up to 1 year. Patients must have demonstrated
      benefit during the initial SMA-001 trial.
