      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of white blood cell infusion in patients with metastatic or
           unresectable cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive allogeneic white blood cell infusions once daily for 5-10
      infusions.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative laboratory studies. The
      samples are evaluated by in vitro white cell kill assay before the first infusion,
      immediately after the first infusion, on day 2, and then immediately after the last infusion
      to assess in vitro cancer cell killing activity. Chimerism studies are performed before the
      first infusion, immediately after the first infusion, and then on days 2 and 7. Complete
      chimerism is assayed by short tandem repeat analysis using PCR. Patients with readily
      accessible tumor tissue (e.g., cervical or axillary lymph nodes or subcutaneous tumor
      nodules) may also undergo biopsy during the first week of treatment to demonstrate the
      presence or absence of tumor infiltrating granulocytes.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 months.
