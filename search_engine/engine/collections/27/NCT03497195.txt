    
      The purpose of this study is to initiate sustained, active health facility and
      community-based case finding interventions to achieve improved TB case detection in high
      burden settings (Zambia) and contribute to TB control.

      The interventions are expected to increase the impact of Xpert on TB case finding, thus
      increase TB case detection through scaling up of a combination of community level and
      facility level TB case finding interventions. The study will generate evidence on the added
      value of using Chest X-ray (CXR) screening at community level, whilst also comparing the
      performance of CXR with computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      symptoms as screening tools in terms sensitivity, specificity and cost effectiveness. Symptom
      screen alone has been shown to be suboptimal for screening as it misses a significant
      percentage of TB due to atypical presentation of TB in HIV-infected populations.
