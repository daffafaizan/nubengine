      adults. The side effects appear more quickly and are often apparent in as few as 14 days.

      Although extensive studies have been performed with Xerecept® in adults, no studies have been
      performed with Xerecept® in pediatric subjects. Therefore, this study is being conducted to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xerecept® in children with central nervous system
      tumors and to identify appropriate doses of Xerecept® to be used in subsequent pediatric
      clinical trials. The study will also explore if Xerecept®, when administered to pediatric
      patients, is effective in allowing decreases in dexamethasone dosing
