      cellular differentiation and turnover, such as those in the immune system and
      gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutic zinc supplementation has been initiated in low-income
      countries as part of diarrhea treatment programs to support these needs for young children
      but, the effects of preventive supplemental zinc as a tablet or as a multiple micronutrient
      powder (MNP) on child growth and diarrheal disease are mixed and pose programmatic
      uncertainties. Thus, a randomized, double-blind community-based efficacy trial of five
      different doses, forms, and frequencies of preventive zinc supplementation vs. a placebo was
      designed for a study in children aged 9-11 months in an urban community in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
      The primary outcomes of this 24-week study are incidence of diarrheal disease and linear
      growth. Study workers will conduct in-home morbidity checks twice weekly; anthropometry will
      be measured at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Serum zinc and other related biomarkers will
      be measured in a subsample along with an estimate of the exchangeable zinc pool size using
      stable isotope techniques in a subgroup. Therapeutic zinc will be provided as part of
      diarrhea treatment, in accordance with Bangladesh's national policy. Therefore, the proposed
      study will determine the additional benefit of a preventive zinc supplementation
      intervention.
