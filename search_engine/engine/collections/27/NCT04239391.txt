    
      This is a global, multi- center, multi dose, open-label study assessing the safety of
      Triferic iron administered via dialysate and intravenously to pediatric patients (< 18 years
      of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD).

      Total participation in the study is approximately 44 weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, baseline, open label treatment, and a follow-up visit.

      Upon completion of the respective Baseline observational periods, all patients will
      transition to the interventional period where they will receive Triferic. The Triferic will
      be administered via the liquid bicarbonate or via IV. Once patients enter the interventional
      period, IV iron will only be administered if ferritin <100 µg/L and Hgb decreases by ≥0.5g/dL
      from the last value obtained in the observational Baseline period. Patients will remain in
      the interventional period for either 36 or 28 weeks (depending on randomization assignment),
      at which time a final study visit will take place.
