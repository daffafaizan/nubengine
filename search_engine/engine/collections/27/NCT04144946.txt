      movement and is therefore uniquely designed to withstand considerable loads (up to ~8 times
      body weight) during human locomotion. Yet, repetitive use often results in overuse injuries
      such as tendinopathies, which is a common clinical condition characterized by pain during
      activity, localized tenderness upon palpation, swelling of the tendon and impaired
      performance. Tendinopathy is a sizeable problem in both elite and recreational athletes. In
      fact, the incidence of tendon injuries has been estimated to be as high as 30-50% of all
      sports injuries, and 50% of elite endurance runners, and 6% of sedentary people will at some
      point experience a tendon injury. Moreover, the symptoms and reduction in performance may be
      quite protracted and last for years. To date the ability to detect the early onset of the
      disease, and thus to prevent it from becoming chronic and debilitating, remains an enigma and
      the investigators wish to bridge this gap in knowledge by studying patellar tendon tissue
      samples coupled with magnetic resonance imaging (3T and 7T)
