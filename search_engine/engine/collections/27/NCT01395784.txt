      be maintained on ascending doses of pioglitazone (3 weeks on placebo followed by 3 weeks on
      PIO 15 mg followed by 3 weeks on PIO 45 mg). At the end of each maintenance period the
      effects of oxycodone (0, 10, and 20 mg) will be examined during a single laboratory session
      using a cumulative dosing procedure.
