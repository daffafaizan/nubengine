      a 12, weekly, supervised, online-delivered, individualized resistance-based exercise program.
      The attention control arm will include a printed, individualized resistance-based physical
      activity program. A total of 50 breast cancer survivors will be recruited from Rutgers Cancer
      Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) and randomized to one of two study arms. The intervention arm
      will test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention compared to the control arm,
      which will receive a printed or digital copy of an individualized physical activity program.
      Participants from both arms will receive an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+), resistance bands
      (TheraBandÂ®), and additional free weights (if required). Outcome measures will be assessed at
      baseline (pre-intervention) and Week 12 (post-intervention). Data collection will occur both
      in-person and online. Data will be both objective (1RM, functional strength, physical
      activity measured by accelerometers, physical function assessments, and attendance) and
      subjective (self-reported physical activity program adherence, satisfaction, physical
      activity levels, health-related quality of life, and exercise and barrier self-efficacy).
