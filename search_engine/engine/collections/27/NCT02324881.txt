      I. Obtain consumer input to determine the optimal way to address and monitor the patient's
      symptoms.

      II. Train patients to use the pain management smartphone application (PMSA) and determine the
      compliance characteristics and the number of additional on-treatment visits (OTVs) prompted
      by usage of the application.

      OUTLINE:

      Selected patients are interviewed for input that will help guide the wording of questions of
      the PMSA. All patients/caregivers are then instructed to download the PMSA and are
      demonstrated how to properly use the application. Beginning on the first day of radiation
      therapy (day 1), patients are instructed to use the PMSA for the duration of their radiation
      therapy (up to day 50), although the timing may change based on the availability of the app.
