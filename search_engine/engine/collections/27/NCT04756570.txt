      as spinal cord trauma, multiple sclerosis, post-stroke hemiplegia. In treatments applied with
      robotic walking devices, since accurate and equal weight transfer is provided in both lower
      extremities, sensorimotor learning of the patient is also supported. Thanks to the intense
      and repetitive simulation provided in every phase of the walk and the proprioceptive inputs
      taken, reorganization occurs in the cortical and sub-cortical regions. With the continuous
      facilitation of the walking cycle, neural transmission is regenerated or existing
      communication is strengthened between the motor areas of the brain and sensory pathways. The
      advantages of robotic systems can be listed as enabling longer and more intense treatments,
      ensuring that the patient feels better cognitively, adapting to exercise better, providing
      the opportunity to check the patient's condition objectively by monitoring and recording the
      patient's condition functionally. A recent systematic review showed that individuals with
      stroke who received robotic gait training combine with physiotherapy were more likely to
      achieve independent walking than those who received gait training without robotic gait
      training. Different studies on the effectiveness of robotic rehabilitation have reported that
      robot-assisted gait training should be applied together with a physiotherapy program.
      However, there is no clear information on the optimal dosage of Robot-Assisted Gait Training
      (RAGT) to achieve clinically meaningful functional recovery after a central nervous system
      injury. This study aims to investigate the effect of RAGT dosage on Functional Recovery and
      Quality of Life in patients with stroke.
