      tonsillectomy. Its incidence is between 62% and 73% when no prophylactic antiemetic is given.
      Because of Limited efficacy and side effects with antiemetics, many alternative treatment had
      been used. Acupuncture is simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive with minimal side effects. The
      objective of this study is to compare two prophylactic antiemetic treatments :

        -  Dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) immediately after induction of anaesthesia

        -  Acupuncture treatment (immediately after induction of anaesthesia and for approximately
           20 minutes)
