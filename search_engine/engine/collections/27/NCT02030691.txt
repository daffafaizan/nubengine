      respiratory distress.

      High frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) is a pressure limited, time-cycled,
      high-frequency mode of ventilation that delivers subphysiologic tidal volumes at rapid rates
      and that can be used via an endotracheal tube, a nasal probe or a face mask. In burned
      children, it has been shown to provide the same or improved oxygenation and ventilation at
      lower peak pressure when compared with conventional ventilation. In neonates, HFPV has been
      described in hyaline membrane disease and acute respiratory failure ventilation with
      improvement in oxygenation, significant decrease in PaCO2 and no change in central
      hemodynamics and we recently shown that nasal HFPV is more effective than nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure in transient tachypnea of the newborn. This stud is a cross-over
      clinical trial. For each patient enrolled, the 2 respiratory devices (nHFPV and nCPAP) were
      used one after the other for 15 minutes each. Randomization determines which device to use in
      first (group A nCPAP then nHFPV, group B (nHFPV then nCPAP). During the experiment, rSO2c is
      continuously recorded by NIRS, and oxygenation and capnia are monitored in a non invasive way
      by transcutaneous oxygen saturation and transcutaneous capnia measurement. Ventilators'
      setting (PEEP, FiO2) will be modified to achieve oxygen and capnia targets (SpO2 > 90%, and
      under 95% if FiO2>0.21, Capnia between 5 to 7 kPa). Duration of patient follow up is 30
      minutes. After these 30 minutes, if PEEP is always needed, patients undergo nCPAP. If needed
      during the experiment, patients can receive mechanical ventilation (the criteria for
      mechanical ventilation are the same as those used in clinical practice).
