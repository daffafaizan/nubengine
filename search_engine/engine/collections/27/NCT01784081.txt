    
      -  Each patient undergoing treatment at Johns Hopkins for metastatic pancreas cancer will
           receive palliative care support during their course to include: palliative care
           consultation early in their treatment course; patient decision aids that give survival,
           treatment benefits and risks; suggestions to complete such tasks as advance directives,
           durable power of medical attorney, wills, family and spiritual reviews as recommend by
           the American Society of Clinical Oncology; and when indicated, transition to hospice.

        -  Patient will have an iPad for their visit, and a corresponding website to print
           information.

        -  Each patient will assess their distress with the Distress thermometer; symptoms with the
           Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale and a depression screen. This information
           will be given to the health care practitioner before the patient visit.

        -  Patients facing a treatment decision will receive a Patient Information Program link (or
           paper for those unable to work on the iPad) to review the diagnosis, prognosis, specific
           benefits and risks with the proposed chemotherapy. This will then give transition
           "prompts" to encourage thinking about advance directives, durable power of medical
           attorney, use of hospice, and doing a life review.

        -  We will also offer a hospice information visit when patient has - in the projection of
           the team or treating physician - 3 to 6 months to live.

        -  The palliative care team will meet at least monthly with each of the enrolled patients.

        -  Participants will be followed for as long as he or she is alive before receiving hospice
           care.
