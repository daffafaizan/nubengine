      of which the measurement is invasive and therefore not suitable for routine clinical
      practice. The detection of serum biomarkers is potential for noninvasive diagnosis of portal
      hypertension in cirrhosis. However, many are still in the exploratory phases of testing and
      are not yet ready to enter clinical practice. This study prospectively enrolled participants
      in 6 liver centers (Beijing YouAn Hospital, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Beijing Shijitan
      Hospital, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Xingtai People's Hospital, and 302 Hospital of PLA) in
      China designed to study the correlation between serum biomarkers associated with endothelial
      dysfunction and immune inflammation and HVPG in cirrhosis.
