      after surgery involving the genitourinary tract. However, Urinary tract infections(UTI)
      associated with indwelling catheter is the second leading cause of nosocomial infections. 20%
      of hospital acquired bacteremia arise from UTI with an associated mortality of 10%.

      There are many different types of catheters available for use. Standard indwelling catheters
      are made from a variety of materials including polyvinyl chlorine, plastic, plain latex,
      polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone elastomer, pure silicone hydrogel and polymer hydromer.
      Specialized catheters have been developed with the aim of reducing infection. Strategies
      generally involved coating the inner, outer or both surfaces of the catheter with
      antimicrobial materials. These materials can be antibiotic or antiseptic with the most common
      antiseptic material used being silver. Silver ions are bactericidal, are used safely when
      applied topically to humans and used in controlling infections.

      Previous studies comparing UTI rates in transurethral catheters have reported a significant
      reduction of UTI rate in silver-alloy catheters with a range of 5-12% compared to standard
      catheters with a range of 7-50%. There are no studies comparing the UTI rate in silver-alloy
      supra-pubic catheters to standard supra-pubic catheters. The investigators hypothesize that
      this study will show a statistically significant decrease in UTI rate among the individuals
      with a silver-alloy suprapubic catheter compared to the standard silver-alloy catheter.
