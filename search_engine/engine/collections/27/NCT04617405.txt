    
      This is a prospective observational study including app. 300 pregnant women from the
      outpatient clinics at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Aalborg, Odense and Aarhus
      University Hospital.

      The study includes 50 healthy normal-weight women, 150 healthy overweight women, 50 women
      with gestational diabetes and 50 women with type 2 diabetes.

      Hormonal profiles and inflammatory markers will be measured at gestational week 8-10, 10-14,
      18-22, 24-28 and 34-38. The blood samples will include HbA1c, glukose, insulin, C-peptid,
      lipid profile, liver enzymes, creatinine, FGF-21, TSH, Cortisol, human chorionic
      gonadotropin, estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, human placental lactogen, placental growth
      hormone, IGF-1, IGF-BP's, Leptin, Adiponectin, GLP-1, GIP, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1α, IFN-ɣ,
      TNF-α, ICAM1, VCAM and CD163. In addition to this, exosomes will be isolated precisely and
      profiling of the content of exosomes will be performed using in vitro assays. Proteomics and
      miRNAs sequencing will be employed.

      Height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured at every visit and a urine sample will be
      collected.

      Insulin sensitivity will be estimated using the homeostasis model assessment, IS-HOMA, based
      on fasting insulin and glucose concentrations.
