      therapy, could produce potent diuretic effects, and improve renal functions in patients with
      decompensated congestive heart failure. It holds ture even in the patients who failed to
      respond to high dose of furosemide (>200mg/day). The present study is to confirm the clinical
      efficacy of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular mortality in patients with decompensated
      congestive heart failure who are on best conventional therapy.
