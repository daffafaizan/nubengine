    
      This study will involve up to 10 annual cross sectional surveys during malaria peak
      transmission with possible further extension, dependent on the duration of the EPI-MAL-002
      and EPI-MAL-003 studies. Surveys will provide point estimates of parasite prevalence and
      subsequently a longitudinal assessment of the level of endemicity in each area covered by
      EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003. This study will be conducted in parallel to EPI-MAL-002 and
      EPI-MAL-003 in order to assess parasite prevalence and malaria control measures before
      (EPI-MAL-002) and after (EPI-MAL-003) vaccine introduction.

      By taking into account variations in malaria transmission intensity (MTI) and malaria control
      intervention coverage, it will enable a more complete assessment of the benefits and risks of
      the vaccine introduction, and thereby more insight into the potential vaccine impact in
      EPI-MAL-002/-003, by adjusting incidence data for overall changes in transmission and other
      malaria control intervention coverage, and assist generalisation of results to other
      populations.
