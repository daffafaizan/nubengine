      comprising about 50 percent of all major joint dislocations. In the standard management of
      shoulder dislocations physicians generally need to see pre and post reduction x ray graphics.
      Ultrasonography is harmless way of evaluating shoulder and may be used in the management of
      the shoulder dislocations instead of the x ray evaluations.Recent literature has demonstrated
      the superiority of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in detecting both anterior and
      posterior shoulder dislocations, making it another rapidly evolving tool to improve accuracy,
      decrease error, and improve efficiency. The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy and
      clinical usability of ultrasonography in the management of the shoulder dislocations.
