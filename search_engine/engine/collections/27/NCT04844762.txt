      smokers will complete a three phase, 3 week study: in Phase 1, utilizing a randomized
      crossover design, participants will complete 5 smoking sessions, each session smoking a
      different product examining each participants puff topography while sampling the product, the
      products' ability to suppress nicotine craving/withdrawal, and the product's demand indices.
      Products will include participants usual brand menthol cigarette (UBMC) as well as 3
      commercially-available alternatives, including an mFLC, a pre-assembled mRYO product (menthol
      tobacco and non-menthol tube), and an nmC. All sessions will occur following 12 hours of
      nicotine abstinence and be separated by 48 hours. In Phase 2, participants will select their
      preferred study product from Phase 1 and be instructed to completely substitute the product
      for their UBMC for one week. Participants will complete ecological momentary assessments
      (EMA) during this period to more accurately assess degree of substitution and perceived
      effects in real time. In Phase 3, participants will complete a final in-lab visit to assess
      the substitutability of their preferred product, under simulated ban conditions using a
      progressive ratio task. In all phases, multiple domains of abuse liability will be assessed,
      including product administration (in-lab puff topography and EMA self-report measures),
      product liking and craving and withdrawal suppression (in-lab and EMA self-report), and a
      hypothetical purchase task to simulate demand.
