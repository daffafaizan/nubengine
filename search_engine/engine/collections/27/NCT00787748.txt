      are participants in an ongoing population-based study (CORSAIB) aimed at investigating the
      distribution of CVD risk factors in the general population of the Balearic Islands, Spain.
      The design and full methodological details of the CORSAIB study have been published elsewhere
      (Rigo F, et al. Rev Clin Espa 2005). A third group will include patients with stable CVD
      regularly visited at the referral hospital of our community.

      Inclusion criteria for the study are male and female individuals, aged 40 to 81 years,
      residents of the Balearic Islands, and who are willing to participate in this research.
