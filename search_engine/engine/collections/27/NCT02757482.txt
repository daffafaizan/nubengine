      it is an oral anticoagulant with serious adverse effects. Therefore, the patient must be
      informed about its safe use.

      A patient's level of knowledge concerning the drug plays a key role in the effective and safe
      use of warfarin. In the Joint Commission International (JCI) National Patient Safety Goal
      (NPSG) guideline for 2014 education on treatment for patients taking oral anticoagulants was
      recognized as a vital factor. Previous studies have reported that a positive relationship
      between patients' anticoagulant knowledge levels and the INR number in the therapeutic range.

      For this reason there is a need for effective education programs to increase patients'
      knowledge concerning warfarin and to keep it up to date. Education and information services
      provided to patients using anticoagulants will reduce the costs of treatment by reducing
      risks such as thromboembolism and bleeding. When planning education, individual
      characteristics and needs must be kept in mind, and group education in addition to individual
      sessions and the use of written and visual material will increase the effectiveness of the
      education.
