      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of onalespib
      (AT13387) given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free
      survival (PFS) and document the 6-month PFS and 1-year overall survival (OS) of patients with
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with AT13387 given weekly in
      combination with dabrafenib and trametinib.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and AT13387.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), trametinib PO once daily (QD) on
      days 1-28, and onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 6 months
      for up to 2 years.
