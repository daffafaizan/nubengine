      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with stage IV malignant melanoma with measurable
           and unresectable disease of the central nervous system treated with temozolomide and
           radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on performance status and mental status of these
           patients.

        -  Determine the response of extra-cranial disease in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising whole brain radiotherapy
      daily on days 1-5, 8-13, and 16-21 and oral temozolomide daily on days 1-5. Subsequent
      treatment with temozolomide repeats every 4 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-30
      months.
