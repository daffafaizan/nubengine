      Pentacam, IOLMaster and A-scan. Correlations and differences between the three measurements
      were investigated. The accuracy in detecting the anterior lens surface in pseudophakic eyes
      was also assessed.Differences in ACD-Pen, ACD-IOLM, and ACD-A were analyzed using one-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). When an overall significance of P< 0.05 was obtained, pair-wise
      comparisons were made using Tukey's multiple comparison t tests. The association between
      ACD-Pen, ACD-IOLM, and ACD-A was assessed using Pearson's correlation test. The distribution
      of erroneous ACD-Pen measurement for the three IOLs was analyzed with the chi-square test. In
      all analyses, P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
