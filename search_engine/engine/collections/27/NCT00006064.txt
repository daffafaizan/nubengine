      HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy on body composition in children. Preliminary
      information indicates that lean body mass is lost in preference to fat mass in HIV-infected
      children, supporting the theory that failure to thrive in HIV infection is often cytokine
      mediated. It can be hypothesized that changes in body composition (lean body mass) may
      predict changes in weight growth velocity and may give an early clinical indication of
      treatment failure. If so, body composition measurement may yield an additional outcome
      measure for clinical trials, equivalent in utility to other laboratory measures of treatment
      response, e.g., persistent CD4+ cell count changes. Additionally, if body composition changes
      are highly correlated with responses in viral load, body composition may prove to be a more
      affordable measure of antiretroviral effectiveness in developing countries.

      This study is a nonrandomized, observational study. Children are recruited to each of 4 age
      strata:

      Stratum A: 1 month to 18 months. Stratum B: greater than 18 months to 3 years. Stratum C:
      greater than 3 years to 8 years. Stratum D: greater than 8 years to less than 13 years.
      Children beginning or changing antiretroviral therapy and fulfilling the study specifications
      may be enrolled in the study. Children have 5 outpatient clinic visits, at entry and at 12,
      24, 36, and 48 weeks, for anthropometry, body composition by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis, cytokine levels, viral load, CD4+ cell count, and markers of lipid and glucose
      metabolism.
