      These include postoperative complications (only ICD-10 coded diagnoses), length of
      hospitalization (ward/ICU), disposition, and survival. The project will also attempt to find
      synergism between a positive frailty status and common medical conditions (e.g. diabetes,
      congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, dementia, and kidney disease), as well as
      anesthesiological and surgical processes (e.g. duration and type of anesthesia, surgical
      risk, and surgical discipline). Different assessment tools will be analyzed regarding their
      predictive power and clinical practicability. This should help improve preoperative risk
      assessment and allow for the multidimensional (physical, cognitive, social) identification of
      relevant frailty characteristics in the perioperative setting. All outcome parameters,
      including admission and discharge periods, will be collected using coded information from our
      hospital database. There will be no follow-up measurements after hospital discharge.
