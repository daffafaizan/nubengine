    
      Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH; omim 143880) is a genetic disorder of mineral
      metabolism characterized by severe hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria, suppressed serum
      levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and elevated levels of the active vitamin D metabolite,
      1,25(OH)2D. Biallelic inactivating mutations of CYP24A1, the gene encoding the 24-hydroxylase
      enzyme that represents the principal pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites, cause
      the most common and severe form of IIH.

      Investigators have preliminary data supporting a novel therapeutic approach to repurpose
      rifampin as an agent to induce over-expression of CYP3A4, an enzyme that is expressed in the
      liver and intestine. When CYP3A4 is induced, the increased enzyme activity provides an
      alternative catabolic pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites. The purpose of this
      study is to obtain support for an open label, escalating dose study to assess the effect,
      safety, and tolerability of once daily oral rifampin in participants with IIH due to
      inactivating mutations in CYP24A1.

      In this study, Investigators will recruit 18 patients with biallelic inactivating mutations
      of CYP24A1. Participants will be observed for 8-weeks before a 16-week treatment phase of
      rifampin and 8 further weeks of observation. In addition to following the effect of treatment
      on calcium homeostasis, Investigators will also study the pharmacokinetics of rifampin in
      this condition and the effect on intestinal calcium absorption.
