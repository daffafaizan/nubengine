      within 20 days to 8 weeks following a documented HIV exposure. However, symptoms vary from
      person to person, and some people undergo asymptomatic seroconversion. Because of the
      difficulty identifying patients with either acute HIV infection (within 30 days of initial
      infection) or early infection (within 12 months of initial infection), no systematic review
      of viral dynamics or immunodynamics in this patient population has been undertaken. A better
      understanding of the virologic and immunologic parameters during acute and early HIV
      infection should provide information relevant to the optimal design of future clinical
      therapeutic trials.

      The only patient intervention is obtaining blood, lymph node tissue, CSF, and semen or
      vaginal secretion specimens at designated intervals according to the schedule of evaluations.
      Patients are followed for 5 years. Patients may elect to start or discontinue antiretroviral
      therapy at any time; however, no antiretroviral therapy is administered as part of this
      study. Descriptive analysis includes tolerance and toxicity, magnitude and durability of RNA
      suppression, magnitude and durability of immunologic responses (CD4 and CD8 cells), and decay
      and emergence of resistant virus in tissue reservoirs (CSF, genital secretions, and lymph
      nodes).
