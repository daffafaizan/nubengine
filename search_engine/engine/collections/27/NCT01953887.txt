      Subjects are admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 for pre-dose assessments. They remain in
      the clinic for two periods of 11 days and one period of 14 days.

      After randomization the subjects receive a single dose treatment on Day 1 followed by blood
      sampling for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. For both EC905 and Vesicare®, blood sampling
      continues for 10 days after dosing; for Omnic OCAS®, it continues for 3 days after dosing.

      Each period is separated by a wash-out period of at least 4 day, and subjects are checked for
      eligibility again one day prior to the start of a new dosing day.

      Vital signs, safety ECG measurements, safety laboratory assessments, adverse events and
      concomitant medications are monitored throughout the investigational period.

      A blood sample is drawn for CYP2D6 genotyping, in order to evaluate the effect of the CYP2D6
      genotype on the PK of tamsulosin.

      Subjects return for an End of Study Visit (ESV) 7 days after the last on-site period, or
      after withdrawal.
