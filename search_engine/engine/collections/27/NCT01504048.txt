      diarrhea. Obvious endoscopically identifiable changes of the mucosal surface are usually
      absent, thus diagnosing microscopic colitis relies on multiple biopsy sampling from all
      segments of the colon. Chromoendoscopy using indigo-carmine dye spray might, however, unravel
      mucosal changes in microscopic colitis (Suzuki 2011).

      The aim of this study is to investigate if chromoendoscopy using Indigo-Carmine 0.2-0.5% in
      patients with chronic watery diarrhea is useful in diagnosing microscopic colitis.
