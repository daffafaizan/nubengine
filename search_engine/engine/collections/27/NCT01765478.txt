    
      Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability, and if possible maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
           HM71224 after single and multiple ascending dose administration in healthy subjects.

      Secondary objective

        -  To determine the PK of HM71224 and selected metabolites (M1 and M2) following single and
           multiple oral dose administration of HM71224.

        -  To assess the PD effects of HM71224 on the biomarkers pBTK, pPLCÎ³, and pERK.

        -  To assess whether the PK of HM71224 is affected by food.
