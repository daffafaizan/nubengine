      I. To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients ages 75 years or older and 50 years and
      younger with metastatic or unresectable head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer,
      to a structured pilot study that includes pharmacokinetic sampling in a special patient
      population.

      II. To preliminarily compare the ZD-1839 peak concentration level, elimination half-life and
      steady state level between the two patient age groups.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (75
      years and over vs 50 years and under)

      Patients receive oral gefitinib on day 1 and then daily beginning on day 8. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30 days and then for up to 3 years after study registration.
