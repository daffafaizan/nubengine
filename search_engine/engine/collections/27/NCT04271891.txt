      is booked to our rehabilitation ward for further rehabilitation programs is eligible for our
      study. the investigators will recruit 30 patients, and randomize them to experimental and
      control group. This study is going to be single blinded, which the evaluator is blinded to
      the condition of the subjects. Whether experimental or control groups will received the same
      intensive rehabilitation programs (6 days a week). The experimental group will receive
      additional WBPA treatment. The duration will be 30 minutes a time, and the frequency will be
      5 days a week, and the treating period will be 3 weeks. The evaluator will assess twice,
      before and after the experiment period. The measurements include: muscle power, brunnstrom
      stages, Barthel Index, functional independence measure (FIM), time up and go test, 6 minutes
      walk test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, berg balance scale, cardio-pulmonary test. In addition, to
      confirm the immediate effect of WBPA over brain circulation, the investigators will choose 6
      patients to received carotid ultrasonography before and immediately after the WBPA treatment.
