      gastro-entero anastomosis. The anastomosis will be pre-colic, along the posterior wall of the
      stomach with the length of at least 5 cm. The first jejunal loop approximately 40 cm from the
      angle of Treitz will be used. The anastomosis can be performed manually or with staplers.

      The second group (group B) will be considered the intervention group in which patients will
      undergo gastric partitioning plus gastro-entero anastomosis. The gastric partitioning is done
      5 cm proximal to the lesion along the greater curvature towards the lesser curvature above
      the incisura using linear cutting stapler. The partitioning is performed horizontally and
      preserve a narrow tunnel along the lesser curvature that is calibrated with a orogastric tube
      gauge 32. Subsequently, a pre-colic gastro-entero anastomosis is performed in the proximal
      gastric chamber created by the partitioning. The anastomosis is done along the posterior
      wall, with at least 5 cm of length using the first jejunal loop approximately 40 cm from the
      angle of Treitz. The anastomosis can be performed manually or with staplers.
