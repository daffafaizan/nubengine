      stenosis have been increasing in recent decades. Levosimendan, an innovative inotrope, is
      powerfully evidenced to have the function to improve cardiac output and hemodynamic
      parameters. However, there is no specified study concentrated on the role of Levosimendan in
      surgical procedure such as transcathter aortic intervention. This double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study is aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Levosimendan
      in adults having severe aortic stenosis combined with heart failure undergoing transcatheter
      aortic valve replacement. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to explore whether the
      improvement of cardiac and renal performance can be rendered by intra-operative Levosimendan
      infusion.
