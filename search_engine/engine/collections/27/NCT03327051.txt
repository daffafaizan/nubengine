      over-the-counter acid suppression medication or placebo from weeks -2 through week 4. All
      participants will receive VSL #3 (over-the-counter probiotic) from weeks 0 through 4. Survey
      data, serum, and stool samples will be collected at weeks -2, 0, and 4.

      The intervention medication and probiotics have a very low side effect profile and are
      available over the counter. All data collection methods are non-invasive.

      Elucidation of the effects of acid suppression on probiotic colonization will allow us to
      better understand the utility of probiotics use by individuals on acid suppression
      medications.
