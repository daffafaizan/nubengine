      created in Jaseng Hospital. This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain to
      move the part of their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians'
      observation. This treatment is known to relieve the pain and increase the range of
      motion(ROM). However, there has been no specific value for the effect of this treatment.

      Therefore, The investigators conducted observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of
      shoulder MSAT. From July 2019, The investigators will collect 80 patients with ROM limitation
      on both or each shoulder and who are suffering from shoulder pain with the numeric rating
      scale(NRS) over 4.

      The investigators will compare pain, dysfunction, quality of life and satisfaction of
      patients who are treated with Korean medical treatment including MSAT and patients who are
      treated with Korean medical treatment not including MSAT.

      For these two groups, The investigators will compare Range Of Motion(ROM), NRS(Numeric Rating
      Scale), Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index(SPADI), Patient Global
      Impression of Change (PGIC) and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D-5L).
