      significantly impact short- and long-term survival after lung transplantation. However, there
      is limited data about prevalence of kidney disease according to current KDIGO consensus
      guidelines. It is the aim of this study to describe short- and long-term renal outcomes
      following lung transplantation. Selected patients who underwent prospective pretransplant
      renal functional reserve testing with high oral protein load will be analyzed separately in
      respect to occurrence of acute kidney injury following lung transplantation and development
      of chronic kidney disease.
