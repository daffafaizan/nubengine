      and FP) has already been conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe seasonal AR. The
      combination formulation appeared to be superior in these patients with better symptomatic
      relief. However, objective analysis of the effect of this treatment on nasal mediators and/or
      nasal hyperreactivity has not yet been performed and would help in understanding the
      additional benefit of the combination treatment over monotherapy with nasal corticosteroids.
