      double-blinded manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clevidipine or placebo IV infusion.
      Upon completion of Stage 1, Stage 2 patients will be randomized in an open-label manner in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either clevidipine or standard of care (SOC) IV infusion. At the time of
      randomization, a patient-specific, prespecified systolic blood pressure (SBP) target range
      will be determined and recorded prior to study drug treatment. Up to 500 patients may be
      enrolled to achieve a total of 100 Stage 1 and 300 Stage 2 patients with confirmed AHF per
      protocol.

      A Data Safety Monitoring Board will be utilized periodically throughout the study to monitor
      the safety of patients. Adverse events will be assessed for 7 days post-study randomization
      or hospital discharge, whichever occurred sooner. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed
      for 30 days following study randomization.
