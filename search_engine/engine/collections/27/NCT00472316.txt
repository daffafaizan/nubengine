      not diminished in this city overall (29), suggesting that DOTS alone will not be sufficient
      to turn the tide. Nevertheless, an elemental ACF strategy did appear to work well in this
      city. A prior International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research (ICIDR), in one
      area of Rio de Janeiro, evaluated the use of the WHO's directly observed therapy, short
      course (DOTS) strategy versus an enhanced DOTS strategy (DOTS-A), which included household
      contact investigation as a means of identifying cases. A statistically significant reduction
      in incidence rates between DOTS versus DOTS-A communities was seen from 2000 to 2002 (Figure
      2), suggesting that ACF strategies can be instrumental in reducing incidence rates if
      subjects are detected and treated. Treatment completion rates among new TB cases were not
      significantly different statistically in the 2 study arms, however treatment completion rates
      overall increased from 68% to 77% over the course of the study. Overall, the DOTS communities
      exhibited little change (+7%) in TB incidence over the 5-year period, while DOTS-A
      communities showed a combined decrease (-14%) (P<0.05). The difference suggests that a large
      scale ACF campaign at a more intensive level (ie, door-to-door case finding) could have a
      significant impact on long-term TB incidence in a community.
