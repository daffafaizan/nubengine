    
      PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the accuracy of MRI rectal and pararectal signs in
      predicting a segmental resection of lesions located in the rectum until the recto-sigmoid
      junction.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval for this study was obtained and
      waived written informed consent. The MR images of 61 patients treated for rectal
      endometriosis over a 6 years period were reviewed. Two blinded readers performed in consensus
      a systematic analysis of 7 rectal (length, transverse axis, thickness and circumference of
      the lesion, and presence of a convex base, submucosal edema and hyperintense cystic areas)
      and 4 pararectal (posterior vaginal fornix, parametrial, ureteral and sacro-recto-genital
      septum involvements) signs for each lesion. MR imaging results were compared with surgical
      procedure (shaving versus segmental resection). Efficacy parameters were calculated with 95 %
      confidence intervals (CIs).
