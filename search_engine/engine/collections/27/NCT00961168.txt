      occur partly from the unequal distribution of a super-normal tidal volume to normal areas of
      the lung.2 Alveolar overdistension causes alveolar-capillary membrane damage,3
      increased-permeability pulmonary edema4 and hyaline membrane formation.5 Therefore, it is
      recommended that tidal volume should be reduced to 6-7 mL/kg, and that the peak alveolar
      pressure, or the end-inspiratory plateau pressure (PPLAT), should be limited to < 30 cm H2O.6
      The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's ARDS Network demonstrated a 22% reduction in
      mortality using a "lung-protective" (low tidal volume) ventilation strategy in patients with
      ALI/ARDS.7 High tidal volume ventilation causes a rapid and substantial increase plasma
      levels of proinflammatory mediators which decrease in response to lung protective
      ventilation.8,9 A consequence of lung-protective ventilation is dyspnea and increased work of
      breathing.10 Our recent study11 on work of breathing during lung-protective ventilation found
      that inspiratory pleural pressure changes were extraordinarily high, averaging 15-17 cm H2O.
      Whereas tidal volume was well controlled during volume ventilation, in contrast, it exceeded
      target levels in 40% of patients during pressure control ventilation.

      High tidal volume-high negative pressure ventilation causes acute lung injury in animal
      models.12,13 Thus ventilator-induced lung injury results from excessive stress across lung
      tissue created by high transpulmonary (airway-pleural).pressure.14 This suggests the
      possibility that despite pressure control ventilation being set with a low positive airway
      pressure, "occult" high tidal volume-high transpulmonary pressure ventilation still may
      occur.11 However, during spontaneous breathing diaphragmatic contractions cause ventilation
      to be distributed preferentially to dorsal:caudal aspects of the lungs.15 Therefore, high
      transpulmonary pressures created by large negative swings in pleural pressure theoretically
      may not cause regional lung over-distension and ventilator-induced lung injury if tidal
      ventilation is preferentially distributed to dorsocaudal lung regions. However, a study16
      examining the effects of diaphragmatic breathing during Pressure Control Ventilation found
      that dorsocaudal distribution of tidal volume was not necessarily improved compared to
      passive ventilation, as the amount of tidal ventilation distributed to areas of high
      ventilation/perfusion was unaltered. Regardless, during a recent conference on respiratory
      controversies in the critical care setting, it was noted that the effects of ventilator modes
      such as volume control, pressure control and airway pressure-release ventilation on
      proinflammatory cytokine expression during lung-protective ventilation has not been studied
      in humans.17 Thus it is unknown whether or not differences in transpulmonary pressure and
      tidal volume between these modes has a direct impact on lung inflammation.
