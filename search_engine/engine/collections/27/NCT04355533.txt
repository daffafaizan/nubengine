      characteristic that modulates the epidemic potential of SARS-CoV2. To adapt the epidemy
      control, it is essential to study the immunoprotection of the general population. A crucial
      question is the study of pauci or asymptomatic subjects, and in particular children who make
      mild forms, because they could act as a real reservoir for the spread of the virus. The
      serological study is essential in this context.

      The serologic test Abbott will be used to study immunoprevalence. Institut Pasteur has
      validated test using neutralizing Ab. CEA will used a antibodies and antigen test.
