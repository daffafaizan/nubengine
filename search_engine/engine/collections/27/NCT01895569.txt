    
      In an estimated temporal space of about 3 years, 64 not well controlled, type 2 diabetic
      patients will be recruited.

      Patients will be instructed to take metformin 500 mg three times a day for the first three
      months, then pioglitazone 15 mg twice a day will be added for further three months, and
      finally sitagliptin 100 mg once a day will be added for the last three months. At the
      baseline, and every three months a continuous glucose monitoring system will be performed.

      At any stage of the study, if the value of glycated hemoglobin reach the desired goal
      (<6.5%), participation in the study will be stopped and the patient will not be subjected to
      further adjustments of hypoglycemic therapy or additional continuous monitoring glucose.

      After collection of written informed consent, the following data will be collected:

        -  History: type of diabetes, comorbidities, current medication, duration of diabetes and
           complications, voluptuary habits such as tobacco smoke (both number of packets/year and
           n° packets/day), alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, physical activity.

        -  Physical exam, general anthropometric parameters such as weight, height, circumference,
           body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure.

        -  Assessment of glycemic variability every three months using a continuous glucose
           monitoring system.

        -  Collection of blood and urine samples to assess: glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma
           glucose (FPG), post-prandial glucose (PPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), HOMA-index
           (HOMA-IR and HOMA-β), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol,
           LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, tryglicerides, lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)],
           metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble adhesion molecules
           (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1), sE-selectin, adiponectin (ADN), complete urinalysis, 24-hour
           microalbuminuria.
