      paroxetine-controlled study consisting of three segments (A, B, and C). Segment A is a
      1-week, placebo, single-blind period and Segment B is an 8-week, double blind period.
      Patients completing Segment B may be eligible for enrollment into Segment C, a 44-week,
      double blind extension. All randomized patients must complete a post-study telephone visit
      and a post-study office visit 3 days and 1 week, respectively, after intake of the last dose
      of study medication.
