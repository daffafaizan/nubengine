    
      Primary objective is to evaluate hand function following distal radial artery access compared
      to proximal artery access in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.

      Hand function will be assessed by:

        -  QuickDASH questionnaire

        -  Hand grip test

        -  Thumb forefinger pinch test utilizing a pinch gauge

      Secondary objectives: Vascular access success rates, hematoma, bleeding, complications of
      vascular access and radial artery occlusion.
