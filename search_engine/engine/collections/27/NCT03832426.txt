      combination with RTV in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and in matched healthy
      controls.

      The study consisted of 2 parts. In Part I of the study, 8 patients with compensated cirrhosis
      (Child-Pugh Class A) and 8 matched healthy adult subjects received single doses of NVR at 200
      mg with 240 ml of water after a standard breakfast. The 200-mg NVR dose was chosen since this
      is the intended therapeutic dose. Blood and urine samples were obtained to determine
      narlaprevir concentration in plasma and urine.

      As an additional safety precaution, patients with Child-Pugh Class A hepatic impairment were
      studied successively in Part I and Part II on the basis of the results of an interim safety
      analysis data and PK data.

      Based on the results of the interim analysis after the Part I of the study, it was decided to
      reduce the dose of narlaprevir from baseline 200 mg to 100 mg in Part II of the study.

      In part 2 of the study, 8 patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A) and 8
      healthy subjects received NVR at 100 mg in combination with RTV at 100 mg with 240 ml of
      water after a standard breakfast. Blood and urine samples were obtained to determine
      narlaprevir concentration, its metabolite and ritonavir in plasma and urine.

      The total duration of the study for each subject was a maximum of 35 days.
