      are used to improve the activity of solutions. The selected techniques in this study are
      accepted as efficient methods for activation. However, postoperative pan is an important
      issue for clinicians. Thus, Traditional Irrigation (GI), Xp-endo Finisher (XPF), Passive
      Ultrasonic Irrigation (PUI), EndoActivator (EA) techniques will be used for irrigation
      activation. All techniques remove hard and soft tissue remnants successfully. The clinician
      expect to eliminate the postoperative pain. Therefore, a possible increase in pain due to
      activation technique may limit the use of these methods. The pain scores will be measured
      using the scale and statistically analyzed.
