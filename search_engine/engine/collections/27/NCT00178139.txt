      weaning from mechanical ventilation. The music will support the procedure by serving as a
      stimulus for relaxation and/or pain and anxiety management. The intervention will consist of
      40 - 50 minutes of active music therapy and improvisation in which the music is used as a
      distraction from the hospital setting and the procedure taking place. The intervention will
      end with 5 to 10 minutes of discussion of music activities/selections to be used between
      music therapy sessions. The intervention is individualized and can be modified accordingly to
      the subject's preferences.
