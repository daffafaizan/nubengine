      in ambulance and rescue helicopter), trainee anaesthetists and consultants of the department
      of anesthesiology from the university hospital Mainz. After written informed consent the
      participants have to complete an pre-study questionnaire, than the participants get an
      information sheet about the 3 techniques and the investigators show the participants a short
      video demonstrating the different techniques. All participants have the opportunity to
      practice one insertion with each method on a plastic laryngeal model.

      After that the participants have to perform each technique on the plastic model and the
      investigators measure the time from initially handling equipment to the final end-point,
      which the investigators take as a successful placement of the endotracheal tube verified by a
      fiberoptic position check.
