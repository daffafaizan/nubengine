    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients.

      After confirmation of COVID-19, patients that meet the eligibility requirement and provide
      informed consent will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (1
      unit of approximately 250 ml) or placebo (1 unit albumin 5%, approximately 250 ml). We will
      evaluate the ability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma vs. placebo control to decrease
      disease progression (measured by the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement) during the
      28 days following administration to hospitalized, non-ICU patients. If patient is discharged
      from the hospital prior to Day 28, Day 28 assessment will be by phone.
