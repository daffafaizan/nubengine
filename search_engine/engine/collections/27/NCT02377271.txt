      8 weeks for recovery anatomical criteria (RFNL in OCT, optic atrophy) and functional (visual
      acuity, visual field). The primary endpoint will be the improvement of the visual field, a
      major criterion of the affected visual function in this disease.

      The evaluation of bosentan will mainly after 8 weeks of treatment in order to assess the
      effectiveness of drug treatment in the absence of continuous positive airway pressure (set up
      after three months if necessary, feasible confounding factor for the evaluation of results ),
      the period of three months is sufficient to assess the anatomical and functional recovery
      (disappearance of papilledema).
