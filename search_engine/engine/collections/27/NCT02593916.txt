    
      To create a registry/database of patients who either have taken drugs that treat
      cardiovascular conditions or that have presented with cardiovascular symptoms that may be
      related to medication. Potential enrollees are those receiving (presently or in the past) the
      medicine(s) of interest. Subjects will be identified from computerized Intermountain
      Healthcare records. Patients receiving a drug of interest, both with and without an ADE will
      be enrolled in approximately equal numbers. Outpatients will be contacted by mail and invited
      to participate. Interested subjects will be instructed to return the enclosed response card
      with their intent indicated. The registry coordinator will contact interested subjects and
      the project will be explained. Willing participants will be enrolled either in person or via
      mail with the assistance of the project coordinator. Persons presenting in person for
      enrollment will be given the choice of venipuncture or buccal swab for sample collection for
      DNA extraction. In all cases informed consent will be obtained before collecting samples.
