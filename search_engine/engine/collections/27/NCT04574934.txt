      and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. The disorders differ in which muscles are
      primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin.
      Many people will eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with
      problems in other organs. The muscular dystrophy group contains thirty different genetic
      disorders that are usually classified into nine main categories or types.

      The signs and symptoms consistent with muscular dystrophy are: progressive muscular wasting,
      poor balance, scoliosis (curvature of the spine and the back), progressive inability to walk,
      waddling gait, Calf deformation, Limited range of movement,respiratory difficulty,
      cardiomyopathy and muscle spasms
