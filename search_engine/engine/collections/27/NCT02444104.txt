      getting population requires precise and accurate hemodynamic monitoring.(1) However, advanced
      invasive hemodynamic monitoring is often combined with complications by arterial or central
      venous catheterization. Complications such as vessel harming, infection, cardiac arrhythmias
      and nervous lesions are likely to occur.(2-4) Therefore, in the past various techniques of
      minimal- or non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring devices have been evaluated.(5, 6) One of the
      very promising technique is continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring by applanation
      tonometry. Published data revealed efficacy of this technique. (7) However, ability of this
      technique remains unclear in patients suffering from cardiological pathologies leading to
      changing stroke volumes as in arterial fibrillation, to highly reduces stroke volume as in
      severe impaired left-ventricular function or in severe aortic valve stenosis. Further,
      ability of applanation tonometry in patients without having pulsatile blood flow such as in
      patients with left-ventricular assist device remains unclear. Therefore, validation of this
      technique should be performed in the presented study.

      Further development of applanation tonometry including pulse contour analysis now enables
      assessment of cardiac output. However, till now there is limited data assessing validation
      cardiac output measurement by this method. Cardiac output validation should also be performed
      in the planed clinical study.
