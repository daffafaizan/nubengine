      steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) will relapse following an initial response to
      corticosteroids. Half of these children will experience frequent relapses (FRNS) or become
      steroid-dependent (SDNS).

      The results of multiple observational studies and randomized control trials have shown that
      Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the cluster of differentiation antigen 20
      (CD20) antigen on B cells, is safe and effective for children with FRNS/SDNS without
      corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. To the investigators' knowledge, Rituximab has
      never been investigated for the initial episode of NS with the aim to reduce the subsequent
      risk of relapse that is a major concern in the management of children with NS.

      Children aged 1-18 years with the first episode of the SSNS will be treated with a single
      intravenous infusion of Rituximab 375 mg/m2. The prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day
      (maximum 60 mg in single or divided doses) for 6 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg)
      as a single morning dose on alternate days for the next 6 weeks; therapy is then
      discontinued.
