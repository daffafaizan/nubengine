      antiseptic effectiveness of preoperative surgical scrubbing using 4% chlorhexidine
      digluconate and 3% parachlorometaxylenol. Samples were taken from the hands of each volunteer
      after a preparatory handwash, pre-surgical scrubbing, post-surgical scrubbing and 3 hours
      after surgical scrubbing.
