    
      Primary Objectives To determine safety of MBG453 given in combination with spartalizumab and
      SRS in patients with recurrent GBM.

      Secondary Objectives

      To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity using the following measures:

        1. To estimate overall survival

        2. To estimate progression-free survival

        3. To estimate Radiographic Response (RANO and iRANO)

        4. To evaluate pain for patients undergoing the treatment of anti-TIM3 and anti-PD1 in
           combination with SRS

      Exploratory Objectives

        1. To assess the effects of MGB453, spartalizumab and their combination with SRS on immune
           cells in peripheral blood, including but not limited to the T cell compartments, myeloid
           cells, and serum proteins (cytokines and other immune modulators).

        2. To assess the pharmacodynamic activity in tumor tissue and peripheral blood in treated
           subjects who undergo tumor biopsies as clinically indicated.

        3. To explore potential associations between biomarker measures and anti-tumor activity by
           analyzing markers of inflammation, immune activation, host tumor growth factors, and
           tumor-derived proteins in the pre-treatment and on-treatment setting.

        4. To explore characteristics of tumor immune microenvironment change after the treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive MBG453 and spartalizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes each on Day 1.
      Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on Day 8 per standard of care. Courses with
      MBG453 and spartalizumab repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months thereafter.
