      individuals who use a wheelchair for the majority of their mobility (over 40 hours per week),
      have the ability to transfer independently (may use equipment like sliding boards), use a
      seated pivot to transfer, and speak English as a primary a language. This study will be
      accessed entirely online and participation is expected to last approximately one year.
      Subjects will be randomized into three groups; one group that will receive transfer training
      immediately with no follow up, one group that will receive the transfer training immediately
      with 1 month and 6 month follow up, and one group that will receive the transfer training
      after 6 months. The transfer training program itself will take approximately 1 hour to
      complete.

      After obtaining informed consent, participants in the first two groups will complete baseline
      questionnaires. They will then receive the transfer training program.

      Participants in the third group (a wait-list control group) will complete the baseline
      questionnaires and be contacted one month later to complete a transfer assessment instrument
      questionnaire. They will then wait 5 months. After this period, participants will complete
      the baseline questionnaires a second time, and then receive the transfer training.

      After completing the transfer training, all groups will be contacted immediately post
      training to complete additional questionnaires to assess the effectiveness of the remote
      transfer training program. Participants in the 2nd and 3rd group will be contacted 1 month
      and 6 months post-training to complete additional questionnaires.
