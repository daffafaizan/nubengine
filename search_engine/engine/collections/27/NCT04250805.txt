      for patients presenting oral feeding disorders. Gastrostomy could be put in place by
      different manners:

        -  Chirurgical technique or endoscopy: with general anesthesia;

        -  Percutaneous technique under radiological guidance: allowing local anesthesia. This last
           one is better tolerated by weak patients, and involves less complication.

      However, there is no clear recommendation about local analgesia during this exam. Operator
      can chose Lidocaine with a short period of action, or Ropivacaine with a longer period of
      action.

      The association of these two drugs could enhance the analgesia post procedure. Indeed, pain
      felt during the twenty four hours post procedure seems to be the most frequent adverse effect
      reported by patients.

      Pain could decrease significantly when Ropivacaine is added to the reference Xylocaine.
      Ropivacaine had already proved its efficacy in association with other antalgics.

      The main objective of this study is to decrease maximal pain felt during a twenty four hour
      stay, after a gastrostomy under percutaneous technique with radiological guidance.
