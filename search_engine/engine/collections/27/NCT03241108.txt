      patients who are inadequate responders to MTX, in two double blind arms (NI-0101:placebo,
      with a ratio of 2:1). Patients will receive NI-0101 or placebo infusions up to a maximum of 6
      administrations (every two weeks for 12 weeks). All patients will continue receiving a stable
      dose of MTX. After 12 weeks, patients will enter the follow up period with monthly visits for
      a minimum of 12 weeks.
