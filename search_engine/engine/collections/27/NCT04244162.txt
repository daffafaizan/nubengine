      postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) in an at-risk population (obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA)). This study proposes that neuro-inflammation is associated with measurable
      tissue changes that can be examined with MD measures and blood biomarkers.

      On the day of surgery, standard of care procedures will take place. Hemodynamic vitals will
      be continuously monitored. As per the latest guidelines and recommendations from the American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be targeted to > 60
      mmHg or within 20% of baseline values, and processed EEG-guided anesthesia will be monitored
      to maintain a patient state index between 20-50. Electronic medical records and
      intraoperative integrated physiologic waveform will be collected.

      In summary, the investigators will examine the potential mechanisms of brain injury
      contributing to postoperative delirium (POD) and acute and long-lasting neurocognitive
      deficits in an at-risk population (OSA).
