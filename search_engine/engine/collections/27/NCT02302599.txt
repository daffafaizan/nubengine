      reduce the islet progressive damage, ease or regenerate of the islet beta cells and improve
      hyperglycemic state of diabetes by secreting a variety of cytokines. It can induce damaged
      alpha cells differentiate into beta cells in the islet transformation to realize the islet
      beta cells in situ regeneration by improving microenvironment of islet beta cells. Umbilical
      cord mesenchymal stem cells also have immunosuppressive effect, it can promote islet cell
      repair and regeneration by the inhibition of T cell mediated immune response to beta cells.
