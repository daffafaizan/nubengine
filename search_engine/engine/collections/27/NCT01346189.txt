      strong evidence that reducing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) with statins successfully lowers
      CVD risk, physicians under-prescribe statins, physicians fail to intensify treatment when
      indicated, and more than 50% of patients stop taking statins within one year of first
      prescription, though such therapy typically should be life-long. In this study, we will test
      the effectiveness of different behavioral economic interventions in increasing statin use and
      reducing LDL cholesterol among patients with poor cholesterol control who are at very high
      risk for CVD. The application of conceptual approaches from behavioral economics offers
      considerable promise in advancing health and health care. Pay for performance initiatives
      represent one such potential application, but one in which incorporating the underlying
      psychology of decision makers has not generally been done, and experimental tests have not
      been conducted. We will test these approaches among primary care physicians and their
      patients at very high risk of CVD at Geisinger Health System and University of Pennsylvania
      outpatient clinics. Using a 4-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial, we aim to answer
      these questions: [1] How does the provision of provider incentives compare to the provision
      of patient incentives, to a combination of patient and provider incentives, or to no
      incentives at all? [2] Are results sustained after incentives and other interventions are
      withdrawn? [3] How do these approaches compare in implementation, acceptability, cost, and
      cost-effectiveness?
