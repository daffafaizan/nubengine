    
      Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common problem associated with many chronic diseases such
      as chronic kidney disease (CKD). IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL)
      burden on the subjects. Therapy of these subjects includes treating the underlying cause of
      IDA and restoring haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and iron stores.

      This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside/ferric derisomaltose
      compared with iron sucrose in subjects with both non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney
      disease (NDD-CKD) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA).

      The study subjects received either a single intravenous (IV) dose of iron isomaltoside/ferric
      derisomaltose (1000 mg at baseline) or iron sucrose (200 mg IV injections at baseline and
      repeated according to standard practice or physician choice up to a maximum of five times
      within the first two weeks starting at baseline; a cumulative dose of 1000 mg was
      recommended). The study subjects were monitored for up to 8 weeks from baseline.
