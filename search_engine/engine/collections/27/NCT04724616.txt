      Vienna, Austria. About 60 children between three and six years of age attending kindergarten
      will be included in the study. Prior inclusion in the study eligible adults have to sign a
      parental consent form. We will randomly assign 30 children to the intervention group (n=30)
      and 30 children to the control group (n=30). Depending on the randomization (intervention
      group vs. control group), children either receive our CARTOON (intervention group) or no
      educational training (control group).
