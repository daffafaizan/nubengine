      can cause lesions responsible for motor, ocular, sensory and cognitive symptoms.

      The Theory of Mind and the primary facial emotions recognition (anger, joy, fear, surprise,
      sadness, disgust) are two processes of social cognition that play a role in the social
      interactions and social reasoning. The Theory of Mind is defined by the ability to understand
      the other person including thoughts, beliefs and desires that are unique and that may be
      different from our own.

      In multiple sclerosis, difficulties in social cognition are associated with cognitive
      disorders, (even if the link with a deficit in executive functions remains debated). Indeed,
      when attributing a mental state to another person is needed,it is mandatory to put ourselves
      in the other person's place to adopt another perspective. Thus, several executive functions
      are required: working memory to maintain and manipulate several perspectives, flexibility to
      switch from one perspective to another one, and finally the inhibition of our own perspective
      to adopt the other's point of view.

      The Theory of Mind's assessment uses nonverbal false belief task which assesses the ability
      to inhibit its own perspective to infer the mental state of another and the ability to change
      its perspective to adopt another's.

      Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore inhibition and inference abilities in The
      Theory of Mind skills in multiple sclerosis patients using the Theory of Mind task.
