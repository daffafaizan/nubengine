    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational drug, idelalisib, to learn whether idelalisib works in
      treating a specific cancer. "Investigational" means that idelalisib is still being studied
      and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to
      use, the side effects it may cause, and if idelalisib is effective for treating different
      types of cancer. Idelalisib has already been approved in the US by the FDA to treat patients
      with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic
      lymphoma.

      Idelalisib is a newly discovered drug that is being developed as an anti-cancer agent. This
      drug has been used in laboratory experiments and other research studies in B-cell
      malignancies and information from those other research studies suggests that idelalisib may
      help to target the tumor cells in B-cell malignancies, including WM. B cells are a type of
      white blood cell responsible for making antibodies.

      In this research study, the investigators are testing the safety and efficacy of idelalisib
      as a treatment option for relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.
