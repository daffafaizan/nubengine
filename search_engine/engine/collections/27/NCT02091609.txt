      dental implant survival and success. The investigators profession demands us to educate the
      patients about the risk of peri implantitis and peri mucositis in plaque infected dentitions.
      In periodontal patients the areas of most ineffective plaque removal are typically the
      palatal/lingual and interdental areas.

      there is therefore a need to developing scientific evidence to form a framework for
      professionals to follow when educating patients about their home care.
