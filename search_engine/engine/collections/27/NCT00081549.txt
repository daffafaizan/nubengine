    
      Phase I Primary Objective:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy with Aroplatin and
           gemcitabine (GemzarÂ®) in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer.

      Phase II Primary Objective:

        -  Evaluate survival after therapy with Aroplatin and gemcitabine at the MTD in subjects
           with unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Phase II Secondary Objective:

        -  Evaluate the severity and quantity of adverse events and determine the proportion of
           non-progressors and the progression-free interval.
