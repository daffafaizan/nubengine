    
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of azithromycin in pregnant singletons admitted with preterm premature
      rupture of membranes (PPROM) at 24 0/7- 33 0/7. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either
      1000mg azithromycin orally once or 500mg azithromycin orally daily for seven days in addition
      to standard care. During the course of eight days participants will have serial collection of
      amniotic fluid, maternal serum; and at delivery, of placenta, membrane, and cord blood. After
      delivery, neonatal respiratory samples will be collected as well.
