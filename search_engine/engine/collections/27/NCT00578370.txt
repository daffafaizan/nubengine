      hyperproliferative component. Scaly, erythematous infiltrated skin lesions are indicative of
      psoriasis vulgaris. The disease is characterized micromorphologically by epidermal
      hyperplasia with incomplete differentiation, intraepidermal accumulation of polymorphonuclear
      neutrophils, elongated papillae containing dilated, tortuous capillaries and
      lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.

      Since the underlying cause of the disease remains unknown, causal therapy is not possible.
      The complex clinical picture necessitates a polypragmatic therapeutic approach. Typical
      therapies include phototherapy and photochemotherapy, topical treatment with corticosteroids,
      vitamin D3 analogs, coal-tar preparations and dithranol, and systemic treatment with
      retinoids, methotrexate and ciclosporin (oral or injection).

      In the present study the topical cutaneous ciclosporin formulation for topical treatment of
      psoriasis will be tested in low-dose for efficacy and tolerability. Two concentrations of the
      ciclosporin formulation (0.5% and 1.5%), the corresponding vehicle, a marketed corticoid
      preparation and a marketed topical Vitamin-D-analog will be tested simultaneously in the same
      patient. Five test fields located at the torso and at the extremities will be examined per
      subject, and will be treated non-occlusively on 22 study days over a period study of 26 days.

      Experimental measurements (sonography) and clinical assessments will be performed at baseline
      and on some study days.
