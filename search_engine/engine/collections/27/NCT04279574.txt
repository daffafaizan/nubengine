      popular current materials include glass ceramics and full contour zirconia. Glass ceramic
      materials are generally preferred for their high translucency mimicking enamel-like esthetics
      of natural teeth and zirconia is preferred for high strength applications. Both of these
      materials are available for clinical treatment using chairside CAD/CAM technology.

      The introduction of an induction sintering oven (SpeedFire oven/Dentsply Sirona) opened the
      opportunity for chairside full contour zirconia crowns by decreasing sintering times for
      zirconia to under 30 minutes. 3M Chairside Zirconia (3M) was marketed in 2019 and offers
      improved esthetics and high strength for monolithic zirconia restorations with an efficient
      processing time.

      This investigation will be a longitudinal clinical trial to study the long-term clinical
      performance of CAD/CAM restorations. Lithium disilicate chairside CAD/CAM onlays (IPS
      emaxCAD/Ivoclar) will be adhesively bonded using a selective enamel etch technique with a
      universal adhesive (3M) and a resin cement (3M). Full contour zirconia crowns (3M Chairside
      Zirconia/3M) will be cemented using a self-adhesive technique.
