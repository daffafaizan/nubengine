      intravenous anesthesia is more effective to maintain depth of anesthesia compared with target
      controlled infusion with open systems, it is unclear what driver and variables to achieve
      this goal be more physiological; in the literature doesnÂ´t exist studies showing that the
      closed-loop system for hypnotic is better than the controlled algorithm based pharmacokinetic
      models and open loop system (target controlled infusion-TCI) to maintain anesthetic depth.
      Thus, a system was designed for intravenous anesthesia in closed loop for propofol as
      hypnotic based on neuromonitoring with Entropy and surgical pleth index as adequacy of
      Anesthesia depth.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of a closed loop TCI
      for administration of intravenous anesthesia using adequacy of anesthesia monitoring to
      maintain a depth of anesthesia compared to an open loop system TCI.
