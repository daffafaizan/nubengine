      definition) and controls (asymptomatic healthy children ascertained by clinical and
      anthropometric criteria) were analysed by v3v4 16S rRNA sequencing, redox and pH measurement
      and using specific polymerase chain reaction targeting Methanobrevibacter smithii and
      Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Based on the literature and oxydative stress reported in SAM,
      the investigators tested if the proportion of aerotolerant prokaryotes is increased among gut
      prokaryotes enriched in SAM in comparison to prokaryotes enriched in controls. The
      investigators further linked this to fecal redox potential and assessed the total number of
      bacteria in feces by flux cytometry.
