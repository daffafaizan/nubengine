      fluoride vanish application has been reported to exhibit significant caries inhibiting effect
      in both permanent teeth and primary teeth. The greatest advantage of fluoride vanish is its
      ability to adhere to tooth tissues for a longer period of time that enables improved fluoride
      uptake. It allows continuous release of fluoride ions into enamel, dentine, plaque, and
      saliva.The main action of topical fluoride is to retard demineralization and promote
      remineralization of enamel by the uptake of calcium and phosphates from saliva. The proposed
      mechanism of action of topical fluoride is the formation of intraoral calcium fluoride
      reservoirs, which are retained on enamel and slowly released to inhibit mineral loss during
      demineralization.

      However, the formation of the intraoral calcium fluoride reservoirs is limited by the
      availability of intraoral calcium and fluoride ions. Low concentration of salivary calcium
      and phosphate ions leads to mineral deposition only at the surface of enamel as a result of
      low ion concentration gradient. Deposition of minerals at the surface of enamel alone may not
      improve the structural properties of the deep part of the incipient carious lesions. Hence,
      many manufacturers have modified fluoride vanish to include calcium and phosphate ions in an
      attempt to further improve efficacy of fluoride varnishes.

      The in vitro remineralizing effects of calcium- and phosphate-containing fluoride vanishes
      are encouraging and scientifically sound, a longitudinal, high quality clinical study is
      needed to verify the laboratory findings.
