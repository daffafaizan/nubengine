      surpassed lung cancer to be the most common cancer. Hence it is essential not only to have
      up-to-date surgical and oncological treatment but also a need an effective preventative
      strategy.

      In the past few decades, removal of pre-malignant colonic lesions such as adenomas have been
      shown to prevent development of colorectal cancers. Colonoscopy is currently the only
      technique which can perform both detection and treatment during the same procedure. However,
      concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of colonoscopy in the prevention of CRC
      after several studies reported unexpected high incidence rates of interval carcinomas (IC),
      especially in the proximal colon. Most ICs are suspected to arise from missed colon lesions
      during colonoscopy. Factors concerning missed colonic lesions are multifactorial such as
      adequate bowel preparation, skill level of endoscopists, the number of endoscopy staff in the
      room as "eyes" to help with polyp detection and withdrawal time.

      Following a pilot study in our endoscopy unit, we believe the size of the screen projecting
      the endoscopic image may have a positive influence on adenoma detection. Therefore, we feel
      that a well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trial may help to confirm
      this.
