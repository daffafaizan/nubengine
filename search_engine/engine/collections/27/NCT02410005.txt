      and losartan in subjects with type II diabetes (T2DM) with macroalbuminuria. Should the
      investigators study confirm the hypothesis that the proposed novel regimen is superior to the
      current practice of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, the study would
      significantly advance the care of subjects with type II diabetes and kidney disease in Qatar
      and worldwide. In this regard it is worth noting that the prevalence of end stage renal
      disease in Qatar is 202 subjects per million population. This would translate into fewer
      subjects requiring dialysis or transplantation, an enormous benefit to individuals and
      society.
