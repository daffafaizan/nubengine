      after applying bupivacaine and caudal anesthesia on postoperative analgesia time, the need
      for additional analgesics, postoperative recovery, sedation, and to find out its adverse
      effects in children having lower abdominal surgery.

      Methods: 40 children between 2 and 10 years of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA)
      I-II stages were randomized and applied caudal anesthesia under general anesthesia. Patients
      were applied caudal block in addition with saline and 1milliliter/kilograms (mL/kg)
      bupivacaine 0.25%. In the postoperative period, Group C (n=20) was given 5 milliliter (mL)
      saline and Group M (n=20) was given 0.30 mg/kg rectal midazolam diluted with 5mL saline.
      Sedation scale and postoperative pain scale (CHIPPS) of the patients were evaluated. The
      patients were observed for their analgesic need, first analgesic time, and adverse effects
      for 24 hours.
