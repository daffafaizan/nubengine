    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      copanlisib and nivolumab combination in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of copanlisib combined with nivolumab and
      ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the doublet and triplet combinations on markers of anti-tumor
      immunity in circulating immune cells and pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies.

      II. Evaluate the effect of the combination on biomarkers of AKT inhibition, deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) damage (gammaH2AX, pNbs1, Rad51), apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      in CTCs and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies.

      III. Assess preliminary antitumor activity of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      DOUBLET TREATMENT PLAN: Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1,
      8, and 15 and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      TRIPLET TREATMENT PLAN: Patients receive copanlisib IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15,
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or on days 1 and 15. Beginning cycle 2, patients also
      receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 for a total of 4 doses. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
