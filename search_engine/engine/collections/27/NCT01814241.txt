      order to accomplish two objectives: (1)to confirm the diagnosis of peanut allergy, and (2) to
      measure the amount of peanut protein it takes to cause an allergic reaction. Each subject
      will then undergo a modified rush phase in which the subject receives 6 doses of peanut
      protein in one day. The build-up phase begins afterward in which the subject's dose of peanut
      protein is increased every 2 weeks for 36 weeks. After the final build-up dose, the subject
      consumes that dose for 2 weeks after which he or she returns to the food allergy center for
      the second food challenge. If the subject successfully consumes this food challenge without
      symptoms, the daily dosing of peanut protein will be stopped and the subject will then
      undergo a third food challenge. If the subject successfully consumes the peanut protein
      during that challenge, he or she will return for a fourth food challenge to peanut.
