      associated with life-threatening interstitial pneumonia. Clinically, patients affected from
      severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) are described as exhibiting rapidly progressing
      acute respiratory failure with unusually low oxygen levels in arterial blood. On computed
      tomography scans, diffuse, peripheral "ground glass" opacities of the lung are seen while
      autopsy lung specimens showed diffuse alveolar damage and capillary endothelialitis.

      The objective of the current study, conducted in patients who had recovered from
      mild-to-severe COVID-19 illness, was to test that simultaneously-determined lung diffusing
      capacity for nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) may be of great use to early detect
      post-infective diffusive gas exchange abnormalities. More specifically, we hypothesized that
      measurement of membrane diffusive conductance for CO and pulmonary capillary volume may
      provide accurate information on residual changes of peripheral gas exchanging units of the
      lung related to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.
