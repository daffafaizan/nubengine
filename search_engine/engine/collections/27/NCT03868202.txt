      brain, and is the primary stimulus for growth of the ovarian follicle that contains the egg.
      Glycosylation, or adding glucose, to FSH is critical for its bioactivity on stimulating the
      ovarian follicle. The FSH with less glycosylation (FSH21) has a higher affinity for the FSH
      receptor and activates more pathways than does fully-glycosylated FSH (FSH24). Previous
      studies showed pituitaries from young women contain a high ratio of FSH21/FSH24 while
      pituitaries from older and postmenopausal women have a lower ratio of FSH21/FSH24. The
      investigators hypothesize that the higher FSH21/FSH24 ratio found in young women is
      responsible for normal follicle growth.

      This study is intended to provide the first determination of systemic changes in the ratio of
      FSH21/FSH24 and determine if estradiol increases the FSH21/FSH24 ratio in the first morning
      urine of women. To take part in this study, the participant must be willing to collect the
      first morning urine on particular mornings of the menstrual cycle and be available for blood
      draws on those mornings. Additionally for postmenopausal participants, the participant must
      be willing to use topical estrogen, EstroGelÂ©, for 14 days and be willing to collect the
      first morning urine on particular mornings and again be available for blood draws on those
      mornings. For the postmenopausal participants with an intact uterus, the participants must be
      willing to take an oral progestin, micronized progesterone, for 12 days following the
      completion of the study.
