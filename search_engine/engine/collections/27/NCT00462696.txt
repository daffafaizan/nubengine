      Primary

        -  Evaluate the feasibility (reproducibility and repeatability) of MRI for assessing tumor
           vascularity in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for infiltrative breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the results obtained by semiquantitative measurement of vascularization (MRI) vs
           traditional empirical evaluation.

        -  Evaluate the MRI accuracy for the measurement of tumoral volume after completion of
           chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an uncontrolled, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising epirubicin hydrochloride IV and
      docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo dynamic-contrast MRI before treatment, 3 weeks after the first course of
      chemotherapy, and 3 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. They also undergo a bilateral
      mammogram and sonography and clinical examination.

      Within 22-35 days after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo breast-conserving
      surgical resection of tumor and lymph nodes or mastectomy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
