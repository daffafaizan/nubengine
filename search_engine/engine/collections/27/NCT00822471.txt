      diabetes (N=360) consented to participate in this prospective cohort study with historic
      self-controls. The small group, interactive DSME (two 2-1/2 hour classes) focused on
      improving CVD risk factors and enabling communication with the primary care physician.
      Knowledge, prescriptions, diabetes-related testing and clinical outcomes were assessed.
