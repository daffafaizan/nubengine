      in this ICU population. The study is mainly European based, but will also allow for ICUs
      outside Europe to participate.

      20 consecutive ICU admission in patients ≥ 80 years of age will be collected OR all patients
      ≥ 80 years in a three months' period (whatever comes first).

      Data are collected electronically through an e-CRF and with baseline documentation of the
      ICU. The database is located in Denmark, at the Department of Epidemiology, University of
      Aarhus (http://vip1study.com/) . Each ICU will only have access through the database of their
      own patients, and patient ID is not registered (Names, birth-date or social security numbers)
      so it is in that sense anonymous.

      Even with de-identified data, most countries must seek necessary consent from the authorities
      to collect such data, and hence there will be a period between ICU recruitment (starting
      April 2016) and patient recruitment (October 1. 2016) to allow for this to be done prior to
      study start.

      The goal is to recruit at least 100 ICUs which will give data from approximately 2000 elderly
      patients.
