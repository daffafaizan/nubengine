      adverse outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients after drug-eluting stent (DES)
      implant.

      A total of 660 consecutive patients with ACS who underwent coronary angiography and
      percutaneous coronary intervention enrolled this study at the Beijing Mentougou District
      Hospital, Beijing Tiantan Hospital and Beijing Shijitan Hospital. All the subjects were
      divided into two groups based on the retinal artery lesions: Group 1, retinal artery lesionsâ‰¤
      Stage 2 (n=296) and group 2 (n=364), retinal artery lesions > Stage 2. Beside,the eye fundus
      examination was done in all patients to mesure the extent and severity of atherosclerotic
      vascular lesions in the retinal arteries . Patients were excluded from the study if they had
      severe nephropathy (GFR< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), vascular obstruction, acute illnesses or any
      other condition that was thought to contraindicated coronary angiography.

      Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The composite endpoint was defined as major adverse
      cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), namely recurrent serious angina pectoris,
      nonfatal MI, revascularization and stroke.
