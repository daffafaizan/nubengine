      efficacy data supporting the twice-daily use of a dentifrice containing 67% w/w sodium
      bicarbonate in the management of pre-existing gingivitis, and plaque accumulation. Six
      studies that were chosen for inclusion in the pooled analysis were single-center,
      examiner-blind, 2 to 3 treatments, parallel group, stratified and randomized clinical study.
      In all studies, participants entered the screening period during which eligibility for the
      study was determined. The participants included male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female
      subjects at least 18 years of age with pre-existing gingivitis as determined by an
      appropriately qualified clinical examiner. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria
      entered an acclimatization period in order to minimize any potential placebo response.
      Participants were randomized into treatments, parallel group, stratified and randomized
      clinical studies twice daily at home for 6, 12 and 24 weeks and participants returned to the
      site. Participants underwent a full OST examination and the recording of any Adverse Events
      (AEs). Participants then underwent Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Bleeding Index (BI),
      Gingival Severity Index (GSI) followed by dental plaque assessments.
