      package of prevention services is effective in preventing HIV infection among men who have
      sex with men (MSM). The PrEP administered in that study was given in the context of a
      research setting/controlled trial, but it is important to evaluate the acceptability,
      sustainability, and safety of PrEP in a "real world" setting. This study will evaluate PrEP
      administered to HIV-uninfected MSM and transgender females at two STD clinics and one
      community health center in the United States.

      Each participant will receive PrEP for up to 1 year and will have up to 8 study visits. PrEP
      will consist of one fixed-dose FTC/TDF combination tablet orally each day. All participants
      will have study visits at screening, enrollment, and 4 weeks after enrollment; participants
      will continue to have visits at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52 if they do not seroconvert.
      Participants who seroconvert will discontinue PrEP and will have a post-drug discontinuation
      visit 4 weeks after discontinuing PrEP. At most visits, participants will undergo blood,
      urine, and hair sample collection; give a medical history; undergo a physical exam; receive
      risk-reduction counseling and condoms; undergo testing for HIV and other STDs; receive study
      drugs; and undergo a pill count and adherence assessment (follow-up visits only). For
      participants who stop taking the study drug but remain in the study, urine, blood, and hair
      samples will not be collected at 12-week follow-up visits if all stop procedures have been
      completed and if there are no lab abnormalities that require additional follow-up.
      Participants will also answer questionnaires at screening, 12-week visits, and at study exit.
