    
      This is a multi-center feasibility study intended to collect information on changes in
      intra-thoracic impedance measurements from CRT-D devices. In order to obtain an
      intra-thoracic impedance measurement, the device delivers a subthreshold impulse that
      measures the resistance between two electrodes.

      At the programmed interval, measurements will be obtained between six different lead
      configurations.
