    
      This study is a single site, open-label, "baseline-controlled" (pre LPS saline period) study
      examining the pro-atherosclerotic metabolic responses and safety responses to a single
      administration low-dose (3 ng/kg) endotoxin (LPS) in 20 additional non-metabolic syndrome
      participants: 10 healthy overweight and 10 healthy lean counterparts (20 non-metabolic
      syndrome participants were studies in first phase), and 40 subjects with the metabolic
      syndrome. We are continuing to use an approach whereby "metabolic syndrome" subjects will be
      recruited to have key metabolic syndrome abnormalities that are sensitive to insulin
      resistance compared to the non-metabolic syndrome groups, although all of these "metabolic
      syndrome" subjects may not fulfill traditional NCEP criteria for the syndrome.
