    
      This is a long-term follow up study of the earlier part of the phase I, during which the safe
      and effective dose(safety) of NEUROSTEM®-AD was determined for implantation into the brains
      of subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's
      type, who signed the informed consent form and meet the eligibility criteria, were implanted
      with a single dose of NEUROSTEM®-AD, hUBC-MSCs, into the brain. The subjects were
      hospitalized for 5 to 10 days following the surgical implantation and were observed for acute
      adverse events: Gradient echo MRI within the the 24 hours post-op, vital signs, clinical
      laboratory tests, chest x-rays within Day 2. On Day 14, DLT was assessed, and the subjects
      were followed up on the safety and disease progression of dementia (of the Alzheimer's type)
      for 12 weeks post-implantation.

      In this part of the study, the subjects described above will be followed-up for upto Month
      24, and 3 additional subjects with comparable demographics and disease characteristics as the
      treatment group (refer to Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be enrolled as a control group,
      followed up for 3 months and compared with the treatment group for various indicators of the
      disease progression.
