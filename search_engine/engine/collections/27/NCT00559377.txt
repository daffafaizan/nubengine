      I. Test the extent to which fluoromisonidazole F 18 ([^18F] FMISO) uptake predicts survival
      of patients undergoing therapy for newly diagnosed stage IB-IVB cervical cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test [^18F] FMISO tumor uptake as an independent predictor of response to therapy and that
      it provides additional predictive power over fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([^18F] FDG).

      II. Test [^18F] FMISO tumor uptake as a predictor of response in a subgroup of patients
      receiving radiotherapy.

      III. Test the relationship between [^18F] FMISO uptake in the primary tumor and the volume of
      the primary tumor estimated by CT scan.

      IV. Test the reproducibility of [^18F] FMISO uptake in tumors by imaging the same patients on
      sequential days in a test-retest protocol.

      V. Compare [^18F] FMISO PET or PET/CT scan with [^18F] FDG PET or PET/CT scan to test whether
      [^18F] FMISO is an independent predictor of treatment outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluoromisonidazole F 18 ([^18F] FMISO) IV over 1 minute followed by PET
      scanning. Patients undergo a second [^18F] FMISO PET scan 4-8 weeks later. Patients who have
      not had a prior fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([^18F] FDG) PET scan as part of their routine clinical
      management undergo [^18F] FDG PET scanning at baseline. A subset of 10 patients undergo two
      [^18F] FMISO PET scans within a 48-hour period to evaluate the variability (test-retest) of
      this imaging measurement.

      Patients response to therapy is followed periodically until time to disease progression or
      for 2 years.
