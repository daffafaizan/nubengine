      postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented.

      Postoperatively, activation and / or dysregulation of the inflammatory system influence on
      the endothelial glycocalyx. Damage of the vascular endothelia increases the risk of
      cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications.

      In animal studies glucocorticoids have been found to preserve the endothelial glycocalyx and
      the vascular barrier.

      The effect of glucocorticoids on human endothelial glycocalyx after surgery is unknown and
      calls for further investigation.
