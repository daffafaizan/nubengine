      stimulation (TES) could enhance brain plasticity and conical motor output. Home-based
      rehabilitation is shown to be effective in motor recovery and improvement of functional
      ability in stroke rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study was to develop a home-based rehabilitation program to investigate
      whether combined electrically induced sensory inputs through TES with task-related trunk
      training (TRTT) in a home-based program would induce earlier and/or greater improvement in,
      seated reaching distance and trunk control when compared with placebo TES and TRTT, or
      control with no active treatment in subjects with chronic stroke.
