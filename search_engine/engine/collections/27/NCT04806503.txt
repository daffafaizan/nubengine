    
      This is a multi-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study.
      The total duration of the study is approximately 13 months. Approximately 225 presbyopic
      participants will be enrolled into the study.

      Presbyopic participants aged 45 to 55 years are the primary age group in this study.

      Screening and Baseline: Participants will be screened for eligibility followed by a baseline
      visit after which they will be randomized to receive either UNR844 (low, medium 1, medium 2,
      and high) or Placebo, dosed one drop in each eye twice daily, for 3 months and then will
      undergo a 9 month treatment holiday period.

      Randomized subjects will attend the following study visits after baseline: at Week 2, Month
      1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5, Month 6, Month 7, Month 8, Month 9, Month 10, Month 11
      and Month 12.

      The primary objective for the study is to characterize dose-response of UNR844 for change
      from baseline in binocular DCNVA at Month 3.

      There are 3 secondary objectives:

        1. Characterize dose response of UNR844 as measured by change from baseline in monocular
           DCNVA at Month 3

        2. Assess the duration of effect using change in DCNVA after Month 3 with various dose
           concentrations of UNR844

        3. Evaluate the efficacy of improving DCNVA in presbyopic participants, as measured by
           proportion of participants gaining at least 0.3 logMAR DCNVA at Month 3
