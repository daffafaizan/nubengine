      degree of airway inflammation is a determinant for the long-term disease outcome, it follows
      that, asthma therapy should be aimed at maximal reduction of airway inflammation, in addition
      to reducing symptoms. However, according to current guidelines, therapy should only be
      directed to the clinical severity of the disease. There is increasing evidence that bronchial
      hyper¬respon¬siveness can be used as a non-invasive reflection of airway inflamma¬tion [29].
      However, it is still unknown whether bronchial responsiveness provides relevant additional
      information for adjusting therapy during follow-up of patients with asthma. Therefore, in
      this study we will:

        1. compare the disease outcome in two parallel groups of patients with asthma, receiving
           therapy aimed at either clinical severity only, or therapy aimed at both clinical
           severity, and bronchial hyper¬responsiveness to methacho¬li¬ne. The outcome will be
           assessed at three levels. First, the severity, second, lung function and bronchial
           responsive¬ness, and third, humoral, cellular, and histological indices of airway
           inflamma¬tion. To that end we will assess symptoms, lung function, bronchial
           respon¬siveness, and immunological parameters in blood, every three months. Furthermore,
           a bronchos¬copy with a bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsy will be carried out
           to provide for material for immunologic and pathologic anatomical examination, at the
           beginning and at the end of the study.

        2. analyse the predictors among clinical- and inflammatory parameters of exacerbations and
           long-term decline in lung function during long-term follow-up
