      randomly assigned to be on the high-sodium diet (200mmol/24hours x 8weeks) or low-sodium diet
      (50mmol/24hours x 8 weeks ) with crossover separated by 4-week washout period. Investigators
      will allow a 7-day window on the diet (i.e., to facilitate scheduling the diet can be between
      7-9 weeks), and investigators will allow a 1-week window for the washout (i.e., washout can
      be 3-5 weeks).

      Investigators will measure changes in inflammation (as measured by DAS28 (using tender and
      swollen joint count, disease activity and sedimentation rate)), blood pressure measured over
      a 24 hour period, and tissue sodium (using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)).

      If a relatively simple dietary modification has a clinically important effect on inflammation
      and blood pressure regulation in vivo in patients with RA, this will have far-reaching
      implications for the treatment of RA and prevention of Cardiovascular disease in this
      population.
