      postoperative debridement warrants additional studies that document postoperative protocols
      and use universally accepted endoscopy scores in order to consistently track patient
      outcomes. Further investigation into the efficacy of postoperative debridement is especially
      interesting with the potential benefits of further reduced synechiae formation and edema.
      Conversely, if objective evidence fails to demonstrate benefit of postoperative debridement,
      there could be significant cost and time saving for healthcare professionals in removing this
      therapy from the postoperative protocols.

      We hypothesize that postoperative debridement will have a significant effect on reducing the
      rates of synechiae formation. In addition, we hypothesize that this improvement in synechiae
      development will also be matched by improvements in postoperative endoscopic sinus scoring,
      and patient's overall symptoms at 1 and 3 months postoperatively.

      This study can clarify the efficacy of postoperative debridement and the potential benefits
      of further reduced synechiae formation and edema, and thus decrease the rates of complication
      and revision surgery. Conversely, if objective evidence fails to demonstrate benefit of
      postoperative debridement, there could be significant cost and time saving for healthcare
      professionals in removing this therapy from the postoperative protocols.
