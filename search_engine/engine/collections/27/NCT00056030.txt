        -  Determine the surgical resectability rate of patients with unresectable hepatic
           metastases secondary to metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with oxaliplatin,
           fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and cetuximab.

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour (over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 only) on days 1
      and 8. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a minimum of 12 courses
      or until deemed to have resectable disease.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to each treatment course.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 67-73 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
