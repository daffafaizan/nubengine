      amputation, especially if limbs can not be revascularized. Urokinase is effective in critical
      limb ischemia by lowering fibrinogen and might improve outcomes. The effect and safety of
      urokinase treatment was investigated in a phase II clinical trial. Based on the results this
      trial was planned to investigate the effect and safety of an additional therapy with
      urokinase versus a single conventional therapy.
