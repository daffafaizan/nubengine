      and asynchronies during sleep. Intellivent-ASV would be able to avoid apneas, providing
      controlled cycles when respiratory rate become too low. Moreover, the constant adjustment of
      ventilatory parameters to the patient needs would avoid asynchronies between the ventilator
      and the patient ventilatory drive.
