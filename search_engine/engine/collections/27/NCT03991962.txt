    
      The Primary and Secondary are listed below.

      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate progression free survival after modified FOLFIRINOX and SBRT in borderline
      resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the radiographic response to FOLFIRINOX and SBRT by comparing IV contrast CT
           scans before and after therapy.

        -  To determine rates of recurrence (local only, systemic only, and both local and
           systemic), and overall survival.

        -  To determine rates of grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity, including acute
           toxicities occurring within 3 months of treatment, and late toxicities occurring over 3
           months after completion of radiation.
