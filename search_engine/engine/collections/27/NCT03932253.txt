      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of FCN-159 in
      up to 37 patients with NRAS-aberrant including both NRAS amplification and mutation (Ia) and
      NRAS-mutation only (Ib) in local advanced or metastatic melanoma. In this study, the dose
      escalation phase utilizes 3+3, accelerated titration design with starting dose of 0.2 mg, QD,
      orally, and the dose will be escalated up to Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD) or until the
      Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified. The dose level will be considered to expand up
      to 6 patients if the objective response is observed, intends to collect more clinical data to
      support the RP2D determination. Once the MTD or RP2D dose is identified, an expansion cohort
      will be followed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of FCN-159 in patients with
      NRAS-mutation melanoma.
