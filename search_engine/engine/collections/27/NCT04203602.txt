    
      This study is aimed to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of performing the ward round
      using a telepresence robot (PadBot U, Inbot Technology Ltd, China), compared to the
      face-to-face ward round, for hospital discharge after bariatric surgery. Patients who
      underwent either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
      will be randomized to one of two groups: intervention group - who will be evaluated and
      discharged, on postoperative day (POD) 2, during ward rounds with the assistant team present,
      but the telepresent surgeon via robot; and control group - who will be evaluated and
      discharged, on POD 2, during ward rounds with the whole team physically present.

      The study main hypothesis is that the ward rounds with the surgeon telepresent by a robot are
      not inferior to the face to face ward rounds, to evaluate and discharge patients after
      bariatric surgery.
