      disease (CVD) risk and, in a broader view, the concept of early metabolic programming and
      future health have been extensively discussed during the past decades. Observational studies
      have suggested that formula-fed infants as compared with breastfed infants have an elevated
      risk of future CVD, since they have faster early growth rate and higher risk of overweight,
      type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and unfavorable blood lipid profile in adult age.
      Formula-fed preterm infants have higher serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, higher
      serum low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein (LDL:HDL) ratio, and higher serum
      apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1 (apoB:apoA1) ratio in adolescence as compared with
      preterm infants receiving banked breast milk.
