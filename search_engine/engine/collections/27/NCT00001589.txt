      of lipoproteins. This observational study will evaluate the association between frequency of
      blood donation - expected to be associated with relatively reduced body iron stores in
      frequent donors - and carotid atherosclerosis. The primary outcome variable will be whether
      the presence and extent of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis as measured by ultrasound is
      greater in infrequent (less than or equal to 1 donations/year greater than or equal to 5
      years) vs. frequent (greater than or equal to 4 donations/year greater than or equal to 5
      years) blood donors. Body iron stores, lipid and hemostatic parameters, nitric oxide
      formation, inflammatory parameters, and markers of vascular oxidative stress will be analyzed
      as secondary outcome measures. Laboratory analysis and ultrasound testing will be performed
      blinded to the patient's phlebotomy and iron status. Sixty frequent (n=40 males greater than
      40 y/o, n=20 females greater than 50 y/o) and 60 infrequent (n=40 males greater than 40 y/o,
      n=20 females greater than 50 y/o) blood donors will be recruited for this study from the
      Department of Transfusion Medicine, W. G. Magnuson Clinical Center. All donors will be
      assessed for study eligibility and cardiovascular risks during the screening visit. The
      presence of atherosclerotic lesions by carotid ultrasound and secondary outcome parameters
      will be assessed during a second visit.
