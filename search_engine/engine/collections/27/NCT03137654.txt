      sex differences to examine the potential efficacy of cognitive training in treatment-seeking
      men and women with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Specifically, the ask whether cognitive
      training interventions derived from current methods and conceptual models has differential
      benefits for treatment-seeking women vs. men. Although neurocognitive improvement during
      training is desired, of practical import is whether gains achieved transfer to other tasks
      and settings. Therefore, transfer of gains to tasks/domains varying in their similarity to
      training are assessed. Given noted sex differences in emotional processing and the purported
      role of emotional factors in women's substance use, training engaging emotional processing
      via the use of affective stimuli (faces and words) is included, predicting that women may
      differentially benefit from such training. Equal numbers of treatment-seeking men and women
      with AUDs will be randomly assigned to one of two active training interventions (neutral or
      affective stimuli). To control for abstinence-related recovery, a third group of
      participants, meeting identical selection criteria, will complete pre and post-intervention
      testing, but will not undergo the training intervention. Ss will complete baseline, 3 wks
      training (for active groups) and post-intervention testing and will be contacted monthly for
      3 months after discharge.
