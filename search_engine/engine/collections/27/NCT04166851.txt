      messages for MSM at risk of HIV in Baltimore. The investigators hypothesize that participants
      viewing top messages developed via open contests will show higher brain activation in the
      Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) regions than those viewing messages developed by a social
      marketing approach. The investigators further hypothesize brain activation in the MPFC
      regions is significantly more correlated with PrEP behavioral intention, initiation, and
      action than self-reported message effectiveness.
