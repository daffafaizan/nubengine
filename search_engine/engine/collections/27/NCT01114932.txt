      care. However, studies using various methods have shown differences in terms of the optimal
      time, technique and number of breaths needed for efficient oxygenation. The only difference
      to the standard pre-anesthesia care is that we will record the time to raise patient oxygen
      to 90%. Age is recorded to ensure that the subjects fall within our inclusion criteria. The
      weight (W) in kilograms and height (H) in meters will be used to calculate the body mass
      index (BMI): BMI = W/H2. Alveolar oxygen uptake is dependent on respiratory rate, heart rate,
      blood pressure, temperature and hemoglobin level. These parameters are measured in order to
      identify factors that may affect the accuracy of the study. We will record the pulse oximetry
      value to note the initial oxygen saturation on room air and after the oxygenation.

      Facial hair and mask fit are recorded to assess possible failure of an optimal facemask seal.
      End-tidal carbon dioxide (FE'CO2) is also measured to ensure an adequate facemask seal.
      Anxiety can increase the respiratory rate, heart rate and affect patient compliance with a
      fitted facemask. All of the aforementioned values are recorded to assess reasons for possible
      failure of the preoxygenation technique and inaccurate results.
