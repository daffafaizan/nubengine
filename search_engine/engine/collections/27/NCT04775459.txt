      semi-quantitative assessment : the Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS), in preterms <33 weeks on the
      time to surfactant administration.

      The current hypothesis is that Lung Ultrasound can increase the number of preterms with
      surfactant replacement within the first 3 hours of life.

      This is a prospective, comparative, observational trial between two different cohorts : the
      last 6 months of 2019 (without Score LUS) versus the first 6 months of 2021 (with Score LUS).
