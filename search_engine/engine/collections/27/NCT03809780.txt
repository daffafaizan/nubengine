      The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years, and two-thirds of patients with newly
      diagnosed MM are older than 65years. As life expectancy increases, the population of older
      individuals grows. Consequently, the number of patients with MM, especially elderly patients,
      is expected to increase considerably in the next two decades. Elderly patients may have a
      variety of comorbidities and reduced physical function at diagnosis, and may be intolerable
      to standard chemotherapy.

      Recent prospective multicenter phase II study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lower
      dose lenalidomide (15mg) and dexamethasone (20mg) in frail patients with relapsed or
      refractory MM[8]. The overall response rate was 71% including complete remission of 15%.
      Median progression free survival and overall survival were 8.9 and 30.5 months. In addition,
      grade 3-4 toxicities such as neutropenia, and infections were reduced. This study supported
      that lower dose lenalidomide may be optimal stating dose for elderly patients with frailty.

      Therefore, investigators thought that the use of lower dose of lenalidomide in the frail
      group is expected to increase the effectiveness as it is used for a long time while reducing
      toxicity.
