      morningness-eveningness chronotype, and mood. Participants will then wear a wrist-worn
      accelerometer for 14 days to objectively record activity level and sleep quality.
      Participants will also fill out a daily sleep log and short self-report measures assessing
      sleep and mood. On days 4-7 and 11-14 of the study the participants will wear either amber or
      placebo control lenses prior to sleep onset in a randomized crossover design (i.e.,
      participants will be randomized to wear either amber lenses or placebo lenses for the first
      part of the protocol and then switch to wear the opposite lenses for the second part of the
      protocol). Participants will spend nights 7 and 14 of the study in a sleep laboratory in
      order to obtain hourly melatonin samples and wear a wrist sleep monitor to non-invasively and
      objectively measure sleep state and quality using peripheral arterial tone and oxygen
      perfusion.
