      primary mandibular first molar infiltration of 1.8 mL of non-buffered 4% articaine with
      1:100,000 epinephrine, and 1.8 mL of buffered 4% articaine with 1:100,000 in two separate
      appointments spaced at least one week apart. With the crossover design, 160 infiltrations
      will be given for the first molar and each subject will serve as his or her own control.
      Eighty infiltrations will be administered on the mandibular left side and 80 administered on
      the mandibular right side. The order of the two injections will be assigned randomly and the
      dentist and subject will be blinded about which anesthetic the subject is given. The
      anesthetics used in this study are not experimental. An electric pulp tester (EPT) will be
      used to test the lower first molar for anesthesia starting 30 seconds after the injection;
      and testing every 30 seconds for the first five minutes. After five minutes the EPT will be
      used to test the lower first molar every minute and the contralateral control canine every 5
      minutes for a grand total of sixty minutes. The pain of injection and postoperative pain will
      be recorded in a survey. Patients will report any postoperative pain or discomfort on a
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for three days following each appointment. The data will be
      statistically analyzed.
