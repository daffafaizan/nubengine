    
      The SUSPECT2 study is a modified concept from the first SUSPECT study (N14SUS). The first
      study investigated whether lymph drainage mapping (LDM) using SPECT/CT was a safe and
      feasible method to exclude the contralateral neck from irradiation, or, in case of
      contralateral lymph drainage, to tailor the contralateral ENI field to the level containing
      the tracer accumulation. In this study, large dose reductions to most organs at risk were
      realized, as well as significant reductions of both short term (mucositis, dysphagia) and
      long term (xerostomia, dysphagia) toxicities.

      Firstly, the SUSPECT2 study aims to expand the inclusion criteria of the original SUSPECT
      study. Secondly, it aims to further reduce the proportion of patients that undergoes
      bilateral ENI, by performing a contralateral sentinel node procedure (SNP) in case of
      contralateral lymph drainage. The patient will only receive contralateral ENI if
      (micro/macro)metastasis are found in this contralateral sentinel node.
