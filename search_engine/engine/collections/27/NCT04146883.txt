      been documented in previous studies. Concerns of bacterial resistance and unnecessary cost,
      our prospective observational case-control study had suggested the redundancy of
      post-procedural antibiotics. In this well-designed study, we sought to investigate the
      efficacy of post-procedural antibiotics and confirm the hypothesis.
