      the treatment of conditions associated with slow rates of gastric emptying. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the absolute bioavailability and the metabolic profile of
      GSK962040. Subjects will be administered a single oral dose of 50 mg followed by a single
      intravenous dose of 10 mL containing 100 microgram (not more than 270 nCi, 10 kBq) 14C
      GSK962040, administered by infusion over 15 minutes, beginning at 90 min after administration
      of the oral dose (approximate Cmax). The oral dose of 50 mg was well tolerated following
      single oral administration and is predicted to be a therapeutic dose. There is need to
      characterize GSK962040 disposition in anticipation of drug use in special populations such as
      critically ill patients. The intravenous (infused) microdose (100 microgram) is 500-fold
      lower than the oral dose, therefore exposure to GSK962040 originating from the infused
      microdose is considered negligible.
