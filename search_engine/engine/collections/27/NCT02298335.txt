      protracted tapering period at 10th , 22nd, 42nd and 66th week. If the patients reach complete
      remission within 4 weeks, prednisone may be decreased at the 6th week, otherwise keep on the
      course to the 8th week. All patients reach complete remission will shift to protracted
      tapering period and follow up until prednisone withdrawal, except the cases that relapse and
      drop out the study. If proteinuria reappears in someone, angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitor（ACEI） or angiotensin receptor blocker（ARB） will be considered combination, on the
      premise of the blood pressure is affordable.
