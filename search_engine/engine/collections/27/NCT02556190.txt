      multidrug-resistant bacteria, interest in "old" antibiotics like colistin re-emerged. Lastly,
      colistin is administered more frequently especially in cases of infections due to Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter baumanii in intensive care units (ICUs)
      around the world. However, dosing of colistin in critically ill patients undergoing renal
      replacement therapy is based on scarce data. The aim of this study is to evaluate single and
      multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of both colistin and its inactive prodrug
      colistin-methanesulfonate (CMS) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI)
      undergoing extended daily dialysis (EDD).

      The investigators perform a prospective clinical pharmacokinetic single- and multiple-dose
      study in the medical and surgical ICUs of the Hannover Medical School. ICU patients with
      anuric AKI being treated with EDD and receiving i.v. colistin are studied on day 1 and (if
      possible) on day 5-9 of treatment. A loading dose of 6 Mio IU colistin Ã­s administered 8
      hours prior to the EDD session followed by 3 Mio IU every 8 hours. Colistin Plasma
      concentration levels as well as dialyzer clearance rates are measured at different time
      points.
