      muscles such as the tibialis posterior that are not easily accessible or directly palpable
      secondary to the deep anatomical position and due to the proximity of the tibial nerve and
      the posterior tibial artery within the deep compartment, examining accurate needle placement
      is clinically relevant. In addition, DN has been shown to be a beneficial management strategy
      for individuals with lower extremity condition; however, the investigators may be able to
      optimize these beneficial effects by performing DN on the MTrP versus other sites within the
      same muscle.

      If needling directly into the MTrP is more effective than needling away from the MTrP but
      into the same muscle, it is possible that the improved efficiency could help to optimize
      management of patients with injury to the ankle/hindfoot with less visits and potentially
      decreasing health care costs.
