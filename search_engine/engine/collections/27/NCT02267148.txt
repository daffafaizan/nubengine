      highly relevant for liver disease. The investigators have identified a pattern of genetic
      variation that is associated with fatty liver burden and potentially, risk for liver disease.
      One of the most prominent genes in this pattern is ABCB4. This data needs to be replicated in
      the general population. This study will test the hypothesis that aberrant function of ABCB4
      due to genetic variations will increase the risk of fatty liver progression to fibrosis. It
      will also implement innovative, non-invasive technology to measure liver fat and fibrosis
      utilizing the FibroScan® instrument. As additional proof of principle that the measurements
      we are making correlate with genetics, the investigators will also measure two genetic
      variants that have been shown in many studies to correlate with liver fat and fibrosis by
      their research team and others: PNPLA3 rs738409 and rs2281135. Finally, the investigators
      will calculate a NAFLD-Fibrosis score as an additional correlate to liver disease status.

      Participants: To test this hypothesis, 50 ethnically diverse, overweight or obese male and
      female adults will be recruited from the general population.

      Procedures: Genotyping to correlate variation in the ABCB4 and PNPLA3 genes with level of
      fatty liver and progression to fibrosis with the FibroScan®. Calculation of NAFLD-Fibrosis
      score.
