      inhibitors. Olaparib is a new type of drug for ovarian cancer. Laboratory tests show that it
      may help slow the growth of ovarian cancer.

      Olaparib works by blocking the PARP protein. PARP is an important protein which tries to fix
      damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain important instructions for the
      development of cells). Many cancers are thought to develop from damaged DNA. Research has
      shown that PARP inhibitors stop the PARP protein from working, and that sometimes that can
      cause cancer cells to stop growing or die.
