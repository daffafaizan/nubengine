    
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug),
      placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), four-way-crossover trial
      (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) in patients
      with stable schizophrenia. The four-way-crossover treatment phase will consist of four
      blinded treatment periods separated by a wash out period (the period allowed for the entire
      administered drug to be eliminated from the body) of 6 to 14 days. The study duration for
      each patient will be approximately 12 weeks. Each patient enrolled will receive 3 (out of 5)
      dose levels of JNJ-39393406 and one dose of placebo. Part A of the study will include smoking
      patients with schizophrenia and will precede part B which will include non-smoking patients
      with schizophrenia. Safety evaluations include adverse event monitoring, vital signs and
      clinical laboratory tests. The study drug will be given as a single dose on Day 1 of each
      treatment period as a kind of liquid formulation with 240 mL non-carbonated water between
      7:00 AM and 10:30 AM. Before dosing patients will be given a standard breakfast. The proposed
      dose levels for this study (Part A and Part B) will range from 10 to 200 mg.
