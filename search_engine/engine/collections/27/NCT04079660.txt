    
      This study aims to compare the predictive capacity of both fructosamine and HbA1c on
      preoperative basal glucose level, as well as adverse events (cardiovascular events, surgical
      site infection, and mortality) and length of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay in both
      Type I and Type II diabetic patients. Secondary outcomes include length of anesthesia
      administration, an indicator of intraoperative complications, and perioperative glucose
      level.
