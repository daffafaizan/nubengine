      general anesthesia with the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position. The bladder is entered
      either with a cystoscope or a semi-rigid ureterorenoscope. Guidewires (0.035") will be used
      to facilitate access (under fluoroscopic guidance). After access sheath (12/14) will be
      placed up to the kidney pelvis. Through the access sheath ureteroscope will be introduced.
      For nephrolithotripsy 145 mcm and 200 mcm fibers will be used. Large fragments could be
      extracted with nitinol basket. After the surgery ureteral stent (7 Fr.) will be placed inside
      the ureter for 10 to 14 days.

      A 10 Fr urethral catheter can be placed in the bladder for the drainage of the bladder during
      the operation.
