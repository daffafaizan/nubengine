      All subjects will be treated with platinum-based chemotherapy for a maximum of 6 cycles (that

      continue treatment with cilengitide (Groups A and B) and cetuximab (Group A, B and C).
      Subjects who discontinue treatment without PD will remain on study. Response assessment will
      continue every 6 weeks until PD or until other anti-tumor treatment is started. Upon this
      occurrence, all study medication should be discontinued and a final tumor assessment (FTA)
      visit will be carried out. The end-of-study visit should be performed around 4 weeks after
      the last investigational medicinal product administration but not before the FTA visit.
