    
      Beta Lactams are the keystones of shock septic treatment. Early phase of septic shock is a
      period of disturbed pharmacokinetics, with augmented renal clearance and distribution volume
      of hydrophilic drugs as Beta Lactams. Consequently, early phase of septic shock is a period
      at risk of underdosing Beta Lactam, which could increase the risk of clinical failure an
      mortality.

      Data are available concerning underdosing of MEROPENEM, PIPERACILLIN-TAZOBACTAM and CEFEPIME,
      when administered in bolus.

      No data exist concerning the achievement of a target of 100% of the whole interval above 4
      time the superior breakpoint of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa according to EUCAST (European
      Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing), during the 48 first hours of treatment of
      septic shock, when Beta Lactam are administered in extended infusion.
