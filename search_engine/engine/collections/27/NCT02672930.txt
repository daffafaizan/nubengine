      metabolic emergencies. Serious hyperkalemia is mostly seen in patients who have known chronic
      renal failure or end stage renal disease, and also new diagnosis of acute renal failure can
      be appear with serious hyperkalemia. Paresthesia and weakness which is proceeded to flask
      paralysis can be observable, sharp ''T'' waves (the repolarization and relaxation of the
      ventricles), diminution of ''P'' waves (atrial depolarisation and contraction), long ''PR''
      intervals (time frame from the beginning of atrial depolarization to the beginning of
      ventricular depolarization), or elongated ''QRS'' complexes (depolarisation and contraction
      of the ventricles), ''ST'' segment (end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave)
      elevation, and serious ventricular arrythmias can be seen in electrocardiography. Calcium,
      insulin, beta adrenoceptor agonists, bicarbonate, diuretics, sodium polystyrene sulfonate and
      lastly dialysis are advised in treatment. Especially, avoiding evolution of serious
      arrythmias and İv calcium using in the treatment of occured ''ECG'' abnormalities, there is
      not sufficient level of survey in the literature. The group of Cochrane stated in systematic
      assessment report, which is published in 2005 about IV calcium administration, available
      dates are based on anecdotal and animal experiments. And in the researches that we have done,
      we did not find clinical human studies showing the benefits of calcium administration beyond
      the delivery of case reports . The aim of this study was to evaluate administration of İv
      calcium efficiency on vital signs and ECG.
