    
      Objective 1:

      Conduct a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a 24-week aerobic exercise
      intervention in adult, female breast cancer survivors with self-reported cognitive changes
      following chemotherapy.

      The investigators will test the following hypotheses:

        1. A) The exercise intervention will improve performance on neuropsychological tests of
           specific cognitive domains of executive function, namely i)selective attention and
           response inhibition, ii)processing speed and mental flexibility, and iii) verbal memory
           and learning in exercisers (EX; n=15) versus delayed exercise controls (CON; n=15).

           B) The exercise intervention will reduce self-reported cognitive dysfunction and its
           impact of function and quality of life, in EX compared to CON, measured as a decreased
           score on the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cognition Scale (FACT-Cog).

           Objective 2:

           Conduct analyses on the effect of the intervention on brain activation patterns using
           functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

           The investigators will test the following hypotheses:

        2. A) At baseline, brain activation patterns will differ in breast cancer survivors
           reporting cognitive difficulties following chemotherapy compared to breast cancer
           survivors who have not received chemotherapy (who serve as breast cancer/no chemotherapy
           controls; not enrolled in the exercise intervention) during neuropsychological tests
           completed in the scanner.

      B) The exercise intervention will result in a decrease in regions of cortical activation,
      particularly in regions that show higher activation in breast cancer survivors following
      chemotherapy, compared with no change in controls.
