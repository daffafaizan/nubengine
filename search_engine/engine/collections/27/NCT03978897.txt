      unblinded. A target of 44 patients for enrollment has been set for 80% power. Treatment will
      last for 6 visits with physical therapy with recommended visit intervals of 1 week :

      Intervention Group: Evidence based physical/occupational therapy, with the addition of
      therapeutic exercises using a blood flow restriction tourniquet.

      Control Group: Patients will receive standard evidence based physical therapy

      The primary outcome (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation [PRTEE]) will be collected at
      enrollment, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Secondary outcomes will be collected at the beginning and end of physical therapy
      interventions (change in: numeric pain rating scale, maximum pain free grip strength, pain
      free grip strength). We will collect treatments received after the end of physical therapy
      and before final follow up.
