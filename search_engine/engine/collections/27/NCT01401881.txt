      Cardiac magnetic resonance image (CMRI) is the preferred method of assessing myocardial
      infarct size and function. However,the relationship between CMRI changes and the ischemic
      time [symptom onset to device activation time (S2D)] in patients with primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) is not well understood.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators will test the primary hypothesis that there is strong (at least 70%) direct
      correlation between the S2D time and infarct size by CMRI and inverse correlation with
      myocardial salvage.

      Method:

      The investigators will study a prospective cohort of 80 consecutive patients with STEMI and
      primary PCI. The investigators will perform CMRI at day 3 to 1 post STEMI and a repeat CMRI
      30 to 40 days post STEMI.

      Exclusion Criteria:

      The investigators will exclude patients with 1)-culprit lesion in the distal artery,
      2)-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73m2, 3)-pacemaker, defibrillator, aneurysm
      clips, 4)-body weight > 400lb, 5)-history of allergic reactions to gadlinium based contrast
      agents, and 6)-those unwilling to participate in the study protocol.

      Outcome Measurement:

      The primary outcome measure is the CMRI myocardial infarct size (scar). The secondary
      outcomes include the CMRI transmurality of scar, area at risk, myocardial salvage index,
      microvascular obstruction (MVO), left ventricle (LV) thrombus, and LV ejection fraction (EF).
      Important covariates include symptoms and ST segment resolution before and after the PCI,
      peak cardiac troponin (cTn), and angiographic TIMI flow and myocardial perfusion grade.

      Follow-up:

      Patients will be followed with repeat CMRI at 30 to 40 days and with phone survey at 6 months
      and 12 months.
