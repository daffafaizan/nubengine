      I. Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care coordination, communication, and
      primary care provider (PCP) knowledge, comparing the intervention and attention control arms
      at 4 and 8 months post-accrual.

      II. Determine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes, comparing the
      intervention and attention control arms at 4 and 8 months post-accrual.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the
      intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (SURVIVOR SELF-MANAGEMENT): Patients receive a personalized care plan/resource manual.
      Patients also participate in 5 telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 4
      months (months 1-4) about self-management skills building, then 3 maintenance telehealth
      sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 3 months (months 5-7) for additional
      self-management skills building support. A copy of patient's care plan is also sent to their
      PCP.

      ARM II (ATTENTION CONTROL): Patients receive an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
      care plan. Patients also participate in 5 telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes
      each for 4 months (months 1-4) to review a handbook about life after cancer treatment, then 3
      monthly telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 3 months (months 5-7) to
      answer questions about the handbook. A copy of the ASCO care plan is also sent to their PCP.

      After study initiation, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 months.
