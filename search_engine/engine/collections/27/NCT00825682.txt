      pressure on specific areas of the feet. Reflexology is based on a system of zones and reflex
      areas that are believed to reflect an image of the body on the feet with a premise that such
      work effects a physical change to the body.

      The effect of reflexology on fatigue, quality of life, and quality of sleep of 20 breast
      cancer patients during and after radiation therapy will be compared to age-matched control
      group of 20 breast cancer patients treated by radiation therapy.
