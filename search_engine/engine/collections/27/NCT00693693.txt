    
      An investigator-blinded prospective study of subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis
      (>5% Body Surface area and 2 or 3 on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale). The
      drug will be used within FDA-approved labeling. Subjects will be randomized to each of the
      following topical hydrocortisone 17-butyrate 0.1% preparations- ointment, cream or lipocream-
      in the manufacturer's original tube fitted with a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)
      cap. This cap records dates and times the assembly is opened and this data can be downloaded
      and tabulated with the associated software.

      The study will consist of a 2-week Treatment Phase (visits at Baseline and Week 2). Subjects
      will be instructed to apply the medication twice daily (morning and evening) for 2 weeks to
      all of their AD lesions.

      Adherence will be measured by MEMs cap.
