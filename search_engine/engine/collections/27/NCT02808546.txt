      incidence of Gallbladder cancer in small isolated island, Jeju island, one of small province
      among 11 self governing area in South Korea. Tow studies, including descriptive epidemiology
      and analytic epidemiology using case-control study, some risk factors were obtained regarding
      Gallbladder cancer development in this area. Old age, female, and gallstone were potential
      risk factors and alcohol consumption was preventive factors. So authors decided to evaluate
      the relationship between alcohol and gallbladder stone in order to how much portion of causal
      relationship they have with gallbladder cancer. So this study was designed to investigate the
      relationship between gallbladder stone and alcohol consumption then performed clinical based
      case-control study with age-sex matching to each subjects.
