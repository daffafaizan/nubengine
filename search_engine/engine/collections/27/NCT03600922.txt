      arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to receive resurfacing or retention
      of the patella. All patients received the Scorpio NRG knee prosthesis. Evaluations were done
      preoperatively and yearly, up to a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Knee Society Score and
      Feller Score outcomes were measured. Anterior knee pain, the clunk of patella, and patient
      satisfaction questionnaires were completed.
