      chemotherapy. They will be observed during a period of 9-12 week, including at least 2
      chemotherapy treatments. The presence and severity of the nutritional problems will be
      examined by observing as many different factors as possible. This includes taste alterations,
      weight changes, nutritional intake, physical activity, interviews and weekly questionnaires.
      In relation to this our primary outcome is to investigate the correlation between changes in
      taste and changes in nutritional intake. Secondarily we want to investigate nutritional
      intake, physical activity, appetite, food preferences, side effects, fatique and meal
      perception.
