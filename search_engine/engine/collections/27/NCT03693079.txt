      for detoxifiying purposes.Current literature also points out its blood clarifiying capacity
      in order to illuminate the underlying mechanism of this ancient treatment.

      Steel industry workers, different from the general population are exposed to heavy metals
      more often.Conducting a study in this special group where we will evaluate the levels of
      selected heavy metals in blood before and after the three sessions of WCT might let us know
      its detoxifiying capacity based on measurable parameters.
