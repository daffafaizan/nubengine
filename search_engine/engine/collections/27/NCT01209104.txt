    
      GSK1325756 is a potent, competitive, selective and reversible CXCR2 receptor antagonist that
      is being developed as a once-daily oral anti-inflammatory medication for the treatment of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Selective antagonism of the interaction between
      CXCR2 and its various chemokine ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the underlying
      inflammation in COPD via the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and activation. The current
      study explores the effects of age, gender and food (high fat meal) on the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK1325756.

      Because a significant proportion of COPD subjects are prescribed proton pump inhibitors
      (PPI's) such as omeprazole in order to alleviate symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease
      (GERD), it is important to understand the absorption of the current formulation of GSK1325756
      in an environment of raised intra-gastric pH as will be encountered in patients taking PPI's.
      Therefore, this study will also evaluate the impact of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole
      on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1325756.
