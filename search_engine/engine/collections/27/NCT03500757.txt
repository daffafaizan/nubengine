      percutaneous ablation of solid tumors to ultimately overcome limitations of displaying images
      on 2D flat-panel monitors ("flat screens"). 3D Holographic percutaneous ablation (3D HPA)
      provides real-time, 360Â° visualization for guidance and navigation of tracked interventional
      instruments augmented to the operative site. In this preliminary protocol, 3D HPA will be
      evaluated as an adjunct to flat-screen display of conventional images used for guidance
      (ultrasound, fluoroscopy, CT), in accordance with standard of care.
