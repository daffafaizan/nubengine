      including lymphocyte, Lymphoplasmacytic cells and plasma cells. We designed a oral regimen to
      target both lymphoma cells (Zanubrutinib) and plasma cells (Ixazomib plus Dexamethasone) to
      eliminate the tumor cells of WM. We propose this combination will improve the deep remission
      of WM (â‰¥VGPR) . Zanubrutinib will be given 160mg Bid per day, up to 24 months, Ixazomib 4mg
      per week and Dexamethasone 20mg per week for three weeks, every 4 weeks one course. ID will
      be given 6 course as introduction and then one course every 12 weeks for up to 24 months. At
      the last ID course, Zanubrutinib will be stopped. The last ID course is to prevent the bounce
      of IgM because of Zanubrutinib discontinue.
