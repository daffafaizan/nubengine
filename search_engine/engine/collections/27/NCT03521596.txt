    
      Multicenter retrospective and prospective observational study including patients with WM or
      IgM-MGUS evaluated at the time of diagnosis and during the disease course using highly
      sensitive techniques such as flow cytometry, real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), digital
      droplet PCR (dd-PCR) and NGS, in order to: evaluate the mutational status on genomic DNA or
      cell-free DNA and compare the results to assess the most reliable source for mutation
      studies; perform and compare molecular and flow cytometry analyses on bone marrow, peripheral
      blood (both analyses), plasma and urine samples (only molecular analysis) to assess the best
      source for diagnosis and MRD monitoring.
