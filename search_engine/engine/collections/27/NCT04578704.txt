      A Randomized Control Trial

      Study Population Pre-treatment of bimaxillary proclination patient who completed active
      orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances and are scheduled to debond at Orthodontic
      Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya.

      Study Design Randomized, prospective, single-center control trial. Three parallel arm groups
      of patients will be assigned for 3 types of retention methods; 1.VFR 2.Fixed bonded retainer
      3.Double regime (bonded & VFR)

      Aim of study To determine the best mode of retention to maintain the stability of bimaxillary
      proclination cases treated by four premolars extraction and fixed appliances.

      Specific Objectives

        1. To measure the post treatment dental and soft tissue stability in the retention phase up
           to one-year post treatment

        2. To compare the effectiveness the different types of retainers to maintain the stability
           of orthodontically corrected bimaxillary proclination

        3. To determine the impact of the different types of retainers on the OHRQoL

      Sample Size The sample size calculation was done using G*power software version 3.1.The
      f-test, repeated measures ANOVA, within-between interaction were used.

      Based on the effect size of 0.43 (Keating PJ 1986), maximum accuracy (power) of 80% (0.80),
      error of 5% (0.05), number of groups are 3, number of measurements are 2, correlation among
      repetitive measures is 0.5, nonsphericity correlation is 1, total number of 18 subjects
      needed for entire study. Allowing for 50% dropout, a final sample size of 27 subjects with 9
      subjects per group will be used.

      Study Duration September 2019 - Disember 2021
