      regarding reason for presentation, fever, pain and and possible allergies. This is done
      through a touch-screen.

      The vital signs and potential alarm symptoms from the (multilingual) questionnaire are being
      displayed with the pain score on a screen in the triage room and at the nurses desk. An
      adapted Early Warning Score (aEWS - without respiratory rate) is calculated from the vital
      signs. Abnormal results are being highlighted and carried up on the screen to the top
      position. This enables the triage nurse to pick up the sicker participants in the waiting
      room faster. The measurements are valid, so they do not have to be repeated by the triage
      nurse.

      Users will be contacted afterwards regarding satisfaction of use
