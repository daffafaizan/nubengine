      fractures. When reamed intramedullary nails are used, the risk of suffering a compartmental
      syndrome must be in mind of surgeons. Diagnostic of compartmental syndrome could be difficult
      just after the surgical intervention, because the patient is under conditions of regional
      anesthesia or opioids and analgesics, which could mask the symptomatology. In fact, when
      there is a great suspicion of this syndrome, we recommend measuring compartmental pressures;
      therefore, physicians might apply the term delta-P value, which is the result of the mean
      arterial pressure minus compartmental pressure. If this one is less than 30 mm Hg, a
      fasciotomy should be performed even when the clinical diagnostic is not clear.
