      exercise (4x4 intervals) on psychological variables state mood, state anxiety, well-being and
      psychological distress. This possible effect will be examined in three groups, one group
      being the main group that the other two groups will be compared up against. Group 1: Patients
      with schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. Group 2: people with non-psychotic
      diagnosis. Group 3: people without any psychological diagnosis.
