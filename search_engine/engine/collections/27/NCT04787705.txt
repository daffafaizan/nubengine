      was developed using 783 adults (>16 years) who underwent surgery for congenital heart disease
      at Toronto General Hospital (TGH) during 2004-2015. It identifies five pre-operative
      variables, namely presence of cognitive impairment, hepatic function, >3 chest incisions,
      anatomy diagnosis, and Body Mass Index <20 and >28, as significant predictors of composite
      adverse outcomes such as in-hospital mortality, prolonged ventilation (exceeding 7 days) and
      acute kidney injury.

      This newly prediction model developed in a single-center has only been internally validated.
      It requires further external validation to demonstrate its utility in ACHD populations who
      require cardiac surgery in other cardiac institutions both nationally and internationally.
