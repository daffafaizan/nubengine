      corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory components. It represents a novel class of skin
      barrier repair therapy for chronic dermatoses. The objective of this clinical study is to
      determine whether BRT-FC-83C, applied twice a day to the affected area of the skin,
      ameliorates signs and symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.
