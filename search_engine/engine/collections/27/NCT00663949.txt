      morbidity of diabetic patients. Despite renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic
      patients they can not hinder the progression of renal disease completely. TNFa is a cytokine
      that is a target for medical therapy in diabetic nephropathy. In this study the effect of
      captopril on overt diabetic nephropathy compared to effect of combination of captopril and an
      antiTNFa drug ( pentoxifylline).
