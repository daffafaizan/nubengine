      subjects with previously treated advanced solid tumor. Subjects at each dose level will
      receive KW-2450 orally, once daily for 28 days followed by a 1-week observation period. After
      completing the 1 week observation period, all subjects will receive KW-2450 on a continuous
      daily schedule. All doses of KW-2450 will be administered to subjects under overnight fasting
      conditions.

      Dose escalation may proceed once >= 3 subjects have completed the Day 29 blood sample to
      evaluate glucose. The safety of each dose level will be established prior to enrollment of
      subjects in the next dose level. Dose escalation will proceed sequentially with accelerated
      titration. Once the criteria for completing the accelerated titration are reached, dose
      escalation will follow a modified Fibonacci schedule. Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at
      each dose level. Enrollment will proceed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been
      established or the highest dose level (800 mg/day) has been reached.
