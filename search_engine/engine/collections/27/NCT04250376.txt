    
      The present study is designed as an open label study of patients with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) or dementia to evaluate longer term tolerability and early efficacy of
      transcranial ultrasound treatment.

      Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests that are appropriate for
      repeated measures which are not affected by practice effects. For patients with amnestic
      predominant cognitive change, the target will be the mesial temporal lobe through a trans
      temporal scalp window. Targeting will include reference to scalp fiducials based on the
      obtained MRI and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) waveform confirmation will be obtained because of
      the ability of TCD to record Doppler signal from the posterior cerebral artery that runs
      medial to the mesial temporal lobe.

      On the day of the ultrasound appointment, patients will undergo ten to thirty minutes of
      transcranial ultrasound treatment. The sonification device will be aimed at the hippocampus
      or the putamen and substantia nigra, depending on the predetermined condition. Targeting will
      include reference to scalp fiducials based on the obtained MRI; confirmation of target
      accuracy will either be obtained by Doppler waveform confirmation or optical tracking
      technology which co-registers patient neuroimaging with real space. Patients will undergo 8
      total sessions of focused ultrasound. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and upon final
      ultrasound treatment using the same measures obtained upon entry. Safety and any adverse
      events will be monitored closely.
