      (100 exclusive-EC users; 50 never-users) will complete 5 laboratory visits (baseline, 3-,6-,
      9-, and 12-months) following >12 hours of abstinence, which will include laboratory-based
      respiratory assessments of airway reactivity, inflammation, and spirometry. All participants
      will also provide salivary samples for bio-confirmation of nicotine (cotinine). To assess
      acute changes in pulmonary functioning related to tobacco product use, participants will
      complete twice daily EMA "bursts" and home-based spirometry for the 2-weeks prior to each
      follow-up laboratory visit. EC users' puff topography will also be assessed at all laboratory
      visits during a 30-minute ad libitum EC puffing session, to examine the association between
      total inhaled volume and self-reported nicotine dependence and respiratory health.
