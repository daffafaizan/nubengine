    
      To assess the safety and tolerability of betrixaban at doses of 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg given
      orally once a day for at least 3 months compared to dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF).

      This is a Phase 2, exploratory, randomized, parallel group, multicenter, active comparator,
      dose finding study of patients with documented non-valvular AF. Patients will be randomized
      (1:1:1:1) to 1 of 4 treatment groups (approximately 125 patients per group) using an
      interactive voice response system (IVRS). A dynamic randomization will be used to balance
      patients by country, concurrent aspirin use (yes or no) and antecedent warfarin (yes or no).
      The study will be open label for randomization to warfarin versus betrixaban, but the three
      daily doses of betrixaban, 40 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg, will be double-blind (identical capsules
      for all three dose levels). The warfarin-treated patients will be managed according to each
      center's usual clinical routine with INR monitoring and dose-adjustments in order to maintain
      a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 at maximum intervals of four weeks. No loading doses or dose
      titrations will be used for betrixaban. The betrixaban dose should be ingested in the evening
      (e.g. at bedtime), preferably at least 2 hours after the evening meal. Note: acenocumerol may
      be substituted for warfarin as indicated by local practice.
