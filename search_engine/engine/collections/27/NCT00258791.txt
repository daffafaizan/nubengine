      receiving ibuprofen prior to ECT treatment with patients receiving placebo prior to ECT
      treatment.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 600 mg ibuprofen 90 min prior to
      treatment or placebo orally, blinded to patient, physician and treatment team.

      Patients will be asked about their headache with a visual analogue scale (VAS) 2 hours prior
      to and within 2 hours after treatment, 2-month, 6- month and 1 year follow-up [5].
