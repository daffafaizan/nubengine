      change by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like)
      cells. Accumulated evidences have suggested that the prevalence of NE-like cells is
      associated with disease progression and poor prognosis.

      NED can be induced by a therapeutic agent. Such therapeutic agents include RT and ADT.
      RT-induced NED represents a novel pathway by which prostate cancer cells survive radiotherapy
      and contribute to treatment failure and tumor recurrence. Chromogranin A is the serum
      biomarker for NED and correlates well with CgA-positive staining in biopsy specimens. It has
      been reported that elevated serum CgA is associated with poor therapeutic response,
      androgen-independent growth, and biochemical recurrence.

      The study tests whether the extent of serum CgA increase by RT +/- ADT, which reflects
      radiation-induced NED, is correlated with the risk of prostate cancer recurrence following RT
      and a Gleason score of prostate carcinoma.
