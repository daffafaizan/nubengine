      worldwide. Estimated prevalences of subclinical genital HPV-infection in the immunocompetent
      sexually active population range from 10 to above 50%. Genetic or iatrogenic
      immunosuppression is known to play a decisive role in the initiation of a variety of
      cutaneous neoplasias and their precursor lesions. In this context, HPV-associated anogenital
      malignancies occur with high frequency in patients with HIV-infection. In several studies,
      perianal HPV-infections have been detected in up to 90% of HIV-positive men and a high
      incidence of anal dysplasia has been reported in these patients. The data concerning the
      incidence of oral HPV-infection in HIV-positive men, especially in the era of highly
      antiretroviral therapy, are conflicting. Thus, this prospective study mainly focuses on the
      incidence and prevalence of oral HPV-infection, spectrum of HPV-types, and oral high-risk HPV
      viral load in HIV-positive men.
