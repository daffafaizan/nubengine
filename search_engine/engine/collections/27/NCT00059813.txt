      I. To estimate the objective response rate of metastatic renal cancer to the combination of
      G3139 plus α-Interferon (α-IFN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further assess the clinical toxicity of this combination. II. To evaluate the impact of
      G3139 plus α-IFN on molecular targets involved in the regulation of apoptosis in tumor cells
      and lymphocytes.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of G3139 when given with α-IFN at this dose and
      schedule.

      IV. To evaluate the potential toxicity of this combination on cells of the immune system.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and interferon alfa subcutaneously on
      days 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 of course 1 and on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of all subsequent
      courses. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) receive an additional 2 courses past
      CR.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 20-24
      months.
