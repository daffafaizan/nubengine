      study. Healthy subjects will be recruited to the study. The aim is to recruit 15 participants
      for the part 1. The study will be conducted with a cross-over setting, where the subjects
      will go through exposure meals and SmartPill ingestion three times (three different oat
      products) in a randomized order. The study meals are identical in appearance and fiber
      content. After consuming the meal subjects will ingest the SmartPill capsule, which will send
      data on intestinal pH, pressure and temperature to the external portable device. Before and
      during the passage of capsule the subjects will fill a symptom and food diary. The capsule
      will exit the body in 1 to 3 days and the data collected by the external device will be
      collected and analyzed. Before the oat exposure the subjects will give a fecal and a blood
      sample. In addition, 24 hours urine samples will be collected.
