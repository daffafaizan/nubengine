      analgesia. A caudal block is performed by injecting local anesthetic in the low epidural
      space while a penile block is performed by injecting local anesthetic above the pubic
      symphysis. Local anesthetic in the epidural space is known to caudal vasodilation interiorly.
      It is unknown as to whether this vasodilation results in alteration in flow to the penile
      tissue and potentially changes tissue characteristics. The aim of this study is to measure
      blood ultrasound velocity in the dorsal penile artery and vein before and after a block.
