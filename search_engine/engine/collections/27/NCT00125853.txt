      therapy as increasing the risk of developing new-onset diabetes. This has led to the latest
      British Hypertension Society guidelines advising caution when using beta blockers
      particularly in combination with thiazide-like diuretics. However the National Institute of
      Clinical Excellence recommends beta-blocker + thiazide combinations as the treatment of
      choice in patients who are not at increased risk of developing diabetes. Nebivolol is a newer
      class of beta blocker. Some studies in diabetic hypertensive patients have suggested that
      nebivolol does not impair insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study is to compare the effect
      on insulin sensitivity of nebivolol versus atenolol, both in combination with a thiazide-like
      diuretic, in a group of non-diabetic hypertensive patients.
