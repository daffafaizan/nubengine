      Determine the feasibility of three doses of atezolizumab prior to surgery in patients with
      advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess response rates to neoadjuvant atezolizumab Objective response rate following
           completion of neoadjuvant therapy based on RECIST 1.1 criteria oPathological response
           rate (major and complete pathological response) in final surgical resection specimen

        -  Assess change in surgical margins or vital structures preserved following neoadjuvant
           treatment

        -  Assess safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant atezolizumab
