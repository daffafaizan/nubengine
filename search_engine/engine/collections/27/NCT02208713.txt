      patients underwent physical examination, laboratory evaluations, EMG-NCV, muscle sonography
      and muscle MRI. Then, a sample of patient's muscle is taken from Biceps Femoralis to isolate
      and culture of MDSC. The AD-MSC is prepared from Royan Adipose Tissue Bank. The patient is
      admitted in general hospital, and the cell suspensions are injected into biceps, triceps and
      trapezoids muscles by neurologists. After transplantation, the patients will be under
      observation for 5 hours and will be discharged if no side effect happen. All the patients
      will be followed at 1,2,4,6 and 12 months after cell injection.
