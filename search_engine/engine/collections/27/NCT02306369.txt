      adolescents. Medical or dietary treatments lack evident efficiency, while psychosocial
      interventions, i.e. cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)has shown promising effects in
      face-to-face treatments. Therapists trained to deliver CBT for IBS are scarce, leading to a
      situation where very few adolescents with IBS receive the only evidence-based intervention.
      Exposure-based internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) for adults with IBS has shown strong stable
      effects and cost-efficency. Our aim is to develop a treatment that enhances the availability
      to evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with IBS. Such a treatment could
      swiftly be implemented in regular health care for this large population. The main purpose of
      this study is to compare the effectiveness of exposure-based ICBT to treatment as usual
      (wait-list) for adolescents with IBS.
