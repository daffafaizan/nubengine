    
      This phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site clinical trial is
      designed to investigate the effect of a prolonged course of atorvastatin versus placebo on
      CCM lesional iron deposition assessed by validated quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
      MRI studies in patients who suffered a symptomatic bleed within the preceding one year.
      Subjects will also be assessed by lesional and brain vascular permeability MRI using dynamic
      contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP) and a number of clinical evaluation tools.
      Subjects shall be followed for 2 years from randomization, the period of highest likelihood
      of rebleed after a recent CCM hemorrhage. Subjects will undergo clinical and MRI evaluations
      at baseline, and at 12 and 24 months during the study period. Enrolled subjects and the
      treating team will be blinded to treatment group allocation.
