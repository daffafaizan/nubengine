      girls' activities will take place in girl-only safe spaces located in their communities and
      contains the following components: Mentorship: girls have access to older female mentors.
      Mentors both provide weekly group-based and one-to-one interaction with girls as well as
      teach them critical skills; Asset building: Girls will have access to life skills and
      financial literacy training. This includes setting up savings accounts so girls practice
      their financial literacy skills, Monthly caregiver discussion groups among guardians of
      program girls, Capacity building and training of local health and psychosocial service
      providers to provide quality services to survivors of gender-based violence Intervention
      communities will either receive the GE program alone or the GE program with the plus small
      cash transfers to the girls' families as an incentive to attendance in weekly sessions (GE+).
