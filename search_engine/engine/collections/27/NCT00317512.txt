      oxygen supply provoked by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque associated with
      inflammation, thrombosis, vasoconstriction and microembolization. Occlusive thrombosis
      superimposed on a ruptured atheroma in an epicardial coronary artery is firmly established as
      the immediate cause of an acute ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Rapid
      restoration of blood flow (oxygen supply) to jeopardized myocardium limits necrosis and
      reduces mortality. This can be accomplished medically with a thrombolytic agent, or
      mechanically, with so-called primary balloon angioplasty or stenting. Primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) has become the preferred therapy for STEMI in most developed
      countries.

      HBOC-201 is a solution belonging to a new class of biologic oxygen therapeutics, hemoglobin
      based oxygen carriers. HBOC-201 is a crosslinked and glutaraldehyde-polymerized hemoglobin
      (Hb) extracted from isolated bovine red blood cells. On a gram-for-gram basis, HBOC-201 was
      calculated to be approximately three times more potent than stored fresh red blood cell
      hemoglobin at restoring baseline tissue oxygenation following severe acute anemia. Evaluation
      of this Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Carrier has been undertaken in 57 preclinical studies and 21
      human clinical trials. The compound is under review by the US FDA and has been approved in
      the Republic of South Africa. However, HBOC-201 has not yet been evaluated in the setting of
      this disease (narrowing of a coronary artery).

      Biopure will be studying the safety and feasibility of HBOC-201 in patients with typical
      symptoms of Unstable Angina or Non ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction eligible to
      undergo invasive revascularization through a PCI procedure.
