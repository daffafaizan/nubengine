      minutes following by continuous infusion of Dex 0.7γ/Kg (group D) or esmolol 500mcg/Kg over 5
      min following by continuous infusion of 300mcg/Kg/min (group E). Patients in both groups are
      subjected to a standardized anesthesia comprising of induction with propofol, fentanyl,
      rocuronium, and maintained with Oxygen-air: 1/1, sevoflurane and bolus fentanyl in order to
      access the same level of anesthesia (BIS 40-50). The hemodynamic variables at various stages
      of surgery (HR-heart rate, MAP-Mean arterial pressure) and recovery characteristics are also
      recorded. It is also performed monitoring of cerebral oximetry (INVOS).
