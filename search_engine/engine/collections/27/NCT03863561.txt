      (SCPI) to assess diabetes self-management in patients. The SCPI is web-based, gives immediate
      feedback to the healthcare provider, and is associated with glycemia. The SCPI was designed
      to allow a healthcare provider to individualize the education/support by assessing the three
      critical dimensions of self-management: knowledge of a skill; confidence in ability to change
      a behavior; and preparedness to begin implementing the behavior change. Two previous
      validation studies showed that the SCPI has high internal consistency, reliability,
      generalizability, and external validity.

      Following further focus groups with healthcare providers and patients, the SCPI questions and
      response scale were edited to further optimize clarity. This study assessed the validity and
      reliability of a revised, final version of the LMC SCPI in a large sample of diabetes
      patients, as well as clinical responsiveness of the SCPI to a diabetes self-management
      education (DSME) program intervention.

      This study recruited type 1 and type 2 patients from the waiting rooms of seven LMC Diabetes
      & Endocrinology specialist clinics in Ontario, Canada. Patients completed the SCPI
      electronically and their demographic and health information was retrieved from their
      electronic medical records. A smaller cohort of patients with uncontrolled glycemia were
      enrolled into a DSME program. Participants completed the SCPI at their baseline visit and
      their individual results were incorporated into the care paths that were then customized for
      that participant. The DSME program provided five to seven visits with a diabetes educator
      over three to four months. Patients completed the SCPI again at their final visit.
