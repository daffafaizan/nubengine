      Current urology practice requires every patient to have a urinalysis lab done prior to any
      in-office procedures. If the patient's urinalysis is positive, they are then required to have
      a urine culture done, which takes 1-3 days to show results, and they may also be prescribed
      antibiotics. This practice may cause diagnostic delays, unnecessary cancellations of
      procedures, and the overuse of antibiotics.

      The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of urinalysis labs and urine cultures in
      patients prior to in-office cystoscopies, intravesical BCG treatments, and prostate biopsies.
      The investigators predict there is no difference in the number of cases of urinary tract
      infections in patients that undergo in-office procedures with or without a prior urinalysis.
      The investigators propose a change in protocol could allow for improved clinical efficiency,
      antibiotic stewardship, and be economically advantageous.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive standard of care before their
      procedure or have their procedure conducted by their provider without consulting the
      urinalysis results beforehand. Participants will have follow up questionnaires seven days and
      thirty days after their procedure. A total of 664 participants will be enrolled between the
      two study sites.
