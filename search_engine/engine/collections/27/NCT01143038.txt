    
      The study includes a 4-week screening period, a 12-month romiplostim treatment period, and a
      romiplostim dose-tapering period.

      During the 12-month treatment period romiplostim doses could be increased or decreased to
      maintain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and ≤ 200 x 10^9/L. Participants who dose
      reduce such that they no longer require treatment with romiplostim during the 12-month
      treatment period will continue with all required study procedures up to 12 months and will be
      monitored for ITP remission for at least 6 months.

      At the completion of the 12-month treatment period, participants receiving only romiplostim
      and with a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L will enter the tapering period, during which the
      romiplostim dose will be decreased by 1 µg/kg every 2 weeks, for up to 19 weeks. If a
      participant maintains a platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10^9/L in the absence of romiplostim and all
      medications for ITP (concomitant or rescue), the participant will be followed for at least 6
      months to confirm the incidence of ITP remission. If a participant's platelet count falls
      below 50 x 10^9/L and the participant has tapered off treatment with romiplostim, the
      participant will enter the stabilization period and reinitiate romiplostim for up to 8 weeks.
