      following: (1) an absolute rise of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL (44 µmol/L) and/or (2) a relative increase of
      25% in serum creatinine compared to baseline within 48 to 72 hours after contrast
      administration. In the last decades, several novel biomarkers of AKI have been studied
      including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Furthermore, remote ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC) turned out to be one of the most promising and intriguing
      non-pharmacological strategy. This simple procedure consisting of brief, non-lethal episodes
      of ischemia and reperfusion applied in one tissue or organ protects remote tissues or organs
      from subsequent injury.
