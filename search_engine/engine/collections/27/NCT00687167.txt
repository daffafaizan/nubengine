      absorption) of a test formulation of zonisamide capsules compared to the reference
      formulation, Zonegran® (zonisamide)capsules, after a single oral dose administered under
      non-fasting conditions.

      Thirty-four healthy, non-smoking, non-obese male and female volunteers at least 18 years of
      age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two zonisamide dosing
      regimens in sequence with a 28 day washout period between dosing periods. On the morning of
      Day 1, 30 minutes after initiation of a standardized, high-fat breakfast, subjects will
      receive either a single oral dose of the test formulation, zonisamide (1 x 100 mg capsule) or
      a single oral dose of the reference formulation, Zonegran® (1 x 100 mg capsule). After a 28
      day washout period, on the morning of Day 29, 30 minutes after initiation of a standardized,
      high-fat breakfast, subjects will receive the alternate regimen. Blood samples will be drawn
      from all participants before dosing and for 72 hours post dose at times sufficient to
      adequately define the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide. A further goal of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be
      monitored throughout the confinement portion of the study for adverse reactions to the study
      drug and/or procedures. Blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained prior to dosing and as
      scheduled following dose administration. All adverse events whether elicited by query,
      spontaneously reported or observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the investigator and
      reported in the subject's case report form.
