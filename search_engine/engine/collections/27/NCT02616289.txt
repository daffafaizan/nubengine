      dehydration and electrolyte imbalance - complications attributable, at least in part, to
      compromised skin barrier function. Essential fatty acid (EFA)-containing emollients such as
      sunflower seed oil (SSO) have been shown to augment skin barrier function, reduce
      transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and risk of bloodstream infection and mortality, and promote
      weight gain in preterm infants. Recent research from rural Bangladesh showed very low levels
      of EFAs in young children in the general population. It is believed that EFA levels will be
      further depleted in children with SAM. So the investigators aim to demonstrate the
      feasibility of topical applications of SSO to children with SAM, and to measure clinical
      impact of emollient therapy with SSO on skin barrier function, skin condition, EFA levels in
      blood, weight gain, co-morbidities (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis), and time to complete acute
      rehabilitation from SAM, in addition to the benefits of normal standard-of-care.
