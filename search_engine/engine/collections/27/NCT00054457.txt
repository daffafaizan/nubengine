        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with metastatic gastric or
           gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with docetaxel and capecitabine.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether interleukin-1 polymorphisms are present among patients who have weight
           loss vs no weight loss, and their relationship to a poor prognosis.

        -  Assess the quality of life and swallowing uniscale during chemotherapy in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily
      on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at each tumor measurement, and at the end of
      treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months until
      3 years from registration.
