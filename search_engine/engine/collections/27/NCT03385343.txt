      generate cross-sectional views of the human esophagus with microscopic resolution. VLE has
      been used to detect dysplasia associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE) but its use in cancer
      staging has not been previously explored. The investigators propose that VLE can accurately
      and comprehensively stage T1 EAC.

      VLE scans will be analyzed using an automated computer algorithm to measure degree of signal
      attenuation over areas demarcated for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). The signal
      attenuation cut-off established will be used to classify cancers as superficial versus deep.
      EMR specimens will be reviewed histopathologically for grade of tumor differentiation, depth
      of invasion, and presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion. Depth of tumor invasion will
      be measured and used to classify cancers as superficial versus deep.
