      development leading to increased lung tissue stretch, increased cell proliferation, and
      accelerated lung growth. European colleagues have developed foregut endoscopy and techniques
      to position and remove endoluminal tracheal balloons in utero. Recently, the Belgium group
      published summary results of FETO showing an improved survival in 175 patients with isolated
      left CDH from 24% to 49%.

      The goal of this pilot study is to study the feasibility of implementing FETO therapy in the
      most severe group of fetuses with left CDH Observed/expected lung-to-head ratio < 25%(O/E LHR
      < 25%).
