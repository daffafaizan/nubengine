      Plasma in an immunodeficient murine model with AS/EA Blood from patients with Asherman's
      Syndrome (AS) and Endometrial Atrophy (EA) will be collected, maintained under anticoagulant
      solution and after several centrifugations PRP will be obtained. Demonstration of a
      functional endometrium will be proved determining pregnancy and implantation rates as well as
      the number of live pups/pregnant female in our mice model. Also, the uterus histology will be
      analysed in treated and untreated mice
