      screened for patient eligibility. All non-O blood group patients receiving a cumulative
      28-day dose of IVIG â‰¥ 2 g/kg will be approached for enrolment. Exclusion criteria include the
      presence of an alternate cause of anemia, including blood loss, other drug-induced hemolysis,
      anemia associated with chemotherapy for cancer, or hemolysis associated with an underlying
      disease or participation in another ongoing study. Patients receiving repeated courses of
      therapy will be eligible for re-enrollment a maximum of 6 times. There are otherwise no
      exclusions on the basis of age, diagnosis, concurrent treatment, or specific brand of product
      received. Enrolment will occur at multiple Canadian health care facilities.

      Upon enrolment,case report forms documenting the participant's previous medical history, IVIG
      treatments and adverse reactions, and concurrent medication use will be collected. Laboratory
      testing for hemolysis will be performed at baseline, immediately following the completed
      high-dose cycle (usually administered over 1-2 days), and then again at 5-10 days
      post-infusion. IVIG associated. Hemolysis will be defined and graded as per the criteria of
      the Canadian IVIG Pharmacovigilance Group. The pathophysiology of IVIG-associated hemolysis
      will be characterized by tracking changes in serum complement levels, performing extended
      cytokine profiling, and conducting mononuclear phagocyte activity assays using patient
      monocytes. Secretor gene status, ABO zygosity and FcR polymorphisms will also be determined.
      A predictive model incorporating both patient factors (eg., blood group, total dose
      prescribed, presence of pre-infusion inflammation) and product factors (eg., specific lot
      number) will then be developed.
