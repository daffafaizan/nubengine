    
      This is an open-label, Phase II study of post injection pain and inflammation after
      intravitreally administered ranibizumab and aflibercept in 100 subjects with Diabetic Macular
      Edema. Treatment na√Øve and experienced patients will be enrolled. Treatment experienced
      patients with history of anti-vegf injections will be eligible as long as they have not
      received any intravitreal injection in the 3 months prior to the study visit. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either Lucentis 0.3 mg or Eylea 2.0 mg, and followed for a week. A
      non-injecting masked physician who is blinded to the treatment drug will evaluate the patient
      at baseline before the injection and then within 1-2 days and 5-7 days after the injection
      for anterior chamber and vitreous cells using slit lamp examination and indirect
      ophthalmoscopy. Pain will also be recorded at these visits using a standardized pain scale.

      Consented, enrolled subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injection of either 0.3 mg
      ranibizumab or 2.0 mg aflibercept. A standard intravitreal injection protocol will be
      followed. Patients will be revaluated at baseline, 1-2 days and 5-7 days post injections. A
      non-injecting physician will evaluate the patients for anterior chamber and vitreous
      inflammation; this physician will be blinded about the specific treatment. Anterior chamber
      inflammation is described as any cell or flare in the anterior chamber. These will be
      evaluated using Standardization of Uveitis Nomenculature (SUN) working group classifications.
      Pain score will be evaluated using a Numerical Rating Scale.
