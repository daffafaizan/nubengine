      improvement in neuropsychological (NP) performance. We hypothesize that MVC therapy leads to
      (1) decrease in HIV infection of monocytes (MO), particularly of CD16-expressing MO and (2)
      phenotypic and functional secretory changes suggestive of decrease in MO immune activation,
      and that these changes will lead to less HIV infected activated MO trafficking to the CNS,
      less CNS inflammation and neuronal damage, and ultimately improved cognition. We will test
      this in a 48 week trial in 42 HIV infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) with mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction. These individuals will be randomized to
      intensify their ART in double-blind fashion to MVC vs placebo. The primary endpoint will be
      change in NPZglobal. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)/magnetic resonance spectroscopic
      imaging (MRSI) will be conducted to assess potential alterations in inflammatory and neuronal
      brain chemicals.
