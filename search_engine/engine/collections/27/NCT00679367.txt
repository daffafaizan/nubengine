      Primary

        -  To determine the tolerability and safety of melphalan, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone,
           in terms of toxicity, in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

        -  To determine the hematologic response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To assess organ response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21, oral melphalan once
      daily on days 1-4, and oral dexamethasone once on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then annually thereafter.
