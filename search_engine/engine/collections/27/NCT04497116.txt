    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion
      study to:

        -  Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-3500 when administered orally, alone and in
           combination with talazoparib, to establish the dose and schedule recommended for the
           Phase 2

        -  Characterize the PK profile of RP-3500 alone or in combination with talazoparib

        -  Identify anti-tumor activity associated with RP-3500 given alone or in combination with
           talazoparib

        -  Examine biomarker responses and establish a correlation with RP-3500 treatment.

      The initial cohorts will test RP-3500 as monotherapy. Additional cohorts will be enrolled
      with RP-3500 in combination with a PARP inhibitor.

      After the RP2D and schedule is determined, expansion cohort(s) for RP-3500 will be enrolled
      to study the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety, PK, and PD of RP-3500 at the
      RP2D
