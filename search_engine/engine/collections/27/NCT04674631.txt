      healthy controls will be participated in this cross-sectional study. The presence of
      neuropathic pain will be evaluated using Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs
      (LANSS) questionnaire. The impact of pain on health-related quality of life will be assessed
      using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Beck Depression Scale (BDS) will be used to
      evaluate depression status of the patients. Quality of sleep will be assessed using the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
