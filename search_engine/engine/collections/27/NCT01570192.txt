      dosing principles to the antibiotic treatment of hospitalized subjects with
      culture-documented pneumonia (including HABP, VABP and HCAP) requiring mechanical ventilation
      can inhibit the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms during treatment and therefore
      may improve the rate of a satisfactory clinical response. Antibiotic resistance is defined as
      an increase in meropenem or aminoglycoside MIC by two tube dilutions (fourfold) from
      baseline. In animal models of infection, the pharmacodynamic driver for bactericidal effect
      by Î² lactam antibiotics such as meropenem is the proportion of the dosing interval during
      which plasma drug levels are maintained above the MIC of the causative pathogen. The
      hypothesis of this study is that prolongation of time above MIC by increasing total meropenem
      dose and the duration of infusion will counter-select for the emergence of antimicrobial
      resistance during the treatment of hospitalized subjects with pneumonia (i.e. HABP, VABP and
      HCAP) caused by P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species (spp), or other pathogens with
      intermediate susceptibility to meropenem, and that the addition of parenteral aminoglycosides
      (amikacin, tobramycin or gentamicin) and nebulized aminoglycoside (tobramycin) given along
      optimal pharmacodynamic principles will further reduce the likelihood of resistance
      emergence, particularly among the non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The observed incidence of resistance emergence to meropenem
      will be compared across therapeutic regimens.
