      examine the independent and combined effects of decreasing cholesterol substrate availability
      with atorvastatin and decreasing triglyceride substrate availability with fish oils on
      lipoprotien kinetics (apoB, apoA, apoC-III and chylomicron remnants) in insulin-resistant men
      with visceral obesity.
