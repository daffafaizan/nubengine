      clinical treatment of the functional capacity in patients with intermittent claudication. The
      sample will be composed by patients with intermittent claudication of both sexes. The
      patients will be ramdomized in a double-blind procedure to receive during seven days
      (loading) and posteriorly 49 days (maintenance) a creatine (Cr) supplementation or placebo
      (PLA), associated to the clinical treatment. Before ("baseline"), after "loading" period and
      after the maintenance period of supplementation, the patients will go through a functional
      capacity evaluation. The fuctional capacity evaluation will be evaluated by a six
      minute-walking test. For statistical analysis it will be used the ANOVA of two factors for
      repeated measurements, having the (Cr and PLA) group and the time (pre, post-loading and
      post-maintenance), and when needed the post-hoc of Newman keuls. The adopted level of
      significance will be P<0.05.
