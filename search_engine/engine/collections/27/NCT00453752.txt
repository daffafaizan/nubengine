      upon stretch have been found in patients with isolated right ventricular (RV) pressure
      overload. However, limited data suggest that serum BNP may be elevated in patients with
      systemic sclerosis (SSc), especially with RV dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess
      serum N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) in SSc patients and to establish whether it reflects the
      severity of RV overload.
