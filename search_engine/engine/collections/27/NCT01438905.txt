      joint pathology prior to strength training, have elicited greater improvements in muscle
      function and self-reported disability compared to traditional therapies. Preliminary evidence
      suggests ankle joint mobilization can improve contributions of spinal influences on ankle
      muscle activation in individuals with ankle joint pathology, but there is a considerable gap
      in understanding cortical contributions to muscle activation following joint injury. It is
      unknown how joint mobilization concurrently affects cortical and spinal neural motor
      pathways, as well as clinical measures of patient function. The overall aim of this grant is
      to determine the immediate effects of talocrural joint mobilization on cortical and spinal
      muscle activation of the fibularis longus (peroneus) and soleus muscles in individuals with
      chronic ankle instability (CAI). The secondary aims of this study will examine changes in
      ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance. This innovate approach will
      provide the necessary scientific knowledge regarding the potential mechanism and efficacy of
      joint mobilization.
