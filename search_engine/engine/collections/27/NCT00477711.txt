      in Asia. Previous study of ML17032 has proved that XP(capecitabine plus cisplatin)is
      effective in advanced gastric cancer, with the overall response rate of 41%, the median PFS
      of 5.6 month. Recently, the EGFR monoclonal antibody of cetuximab has shown to be successful
      in treating advanced colorectal cancer with or without chemotherapy. Since EGFR also express
      in gastric cancer, A single arm, open, multicenter phase II study of cetuximab in combination
      with cisplatin and capecitabine as first line treatment in patient with advanced gastric
      cancer.If applicable, the value of mutations in k-ras, b-raf, P53, and EGFR copy number to
      predict the clinical response to cetuximab in advanced gastric cancer patients will also be
      accessed.Tumor tissue from study patients will be checked for k-ras, b-raf, and P53 mutation
      by sequencing and for EGFR copy number by chromogenic in situ hybridization. DNA will be
      extracted from paraffin-embedded samples.
