    
      This multi-center study will enroll up to approximately 100 participants who originally
      underwent implantation of a CIED with either CanGaroo®, Tyrx™, or no envelope (up to
      approximately 30-35 participants per cohort) and are returning for a CIED change-out or
      revision procedure at least 12 months or longer from their prior procedure.

      Once enrolled, each participant will have their medical history data collected (baseline
      demographics, medical history, prior CIED exchanges/revisions, and post implant clinical
      events). Prior to the scheduled change-out/revision procedure, there will be an assessment of
      the current healed implant site skin incision independently by both the participant and
      investigator using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), as well as
      photographs taken of the current skin scar.

      During the change-out/revision procedure, additional investigator assessments will include
      photographic documentation of CIED implant pocket lining, classification of the extent of
      lead adhesions in the implant pocket, and biopsies of the anterior and posterior capsule
      walls for histologic analysis. Procedural details and any complications/AEs that occur during
      the change-out/revision procedure will also be captured.
