      has not been previously applied to diagnose periprosthetic joint infections in arthroplasty
      patients. This exploratory prospective study, representing the first of its kind, examines
      the use of 68Ga-citrate as a diagnostic tool of periprosthetic infections aside with 18F-FDG
      tracer as the standard reference.

      The first study group (n=10) will include total hip replacement patients without infection.
      The recruited patients should suffer from pain and/or functional impairment due to adverse
      reaction to metal debris (ARMD) caused by metal-on-metal bearings. The diagnosis of ARMD
      should be based on metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MARS-MRI).
      The patients will undergo the same-day comparison of the two PET/CT tracers.

      The second study group (n=10) will include total hip replacement patients with
      bacteriologically confirmed periprosthetic joint infection. The third group (n=10) will
      include patients with aseptic loosening of total hip prosthesis.
