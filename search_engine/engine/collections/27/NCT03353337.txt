      evidence shows that aerobic exercise might have positive effects in enhancing cognition and
      improving clinical symptoms in patients with mood disorders. This randomized controlled trial
      will investigate short-term (1 months) effects of aerobic exercise on cognition and clinical
      symptoms as well as the long-term (12 months) effects on decreasing the recurrence rate.
