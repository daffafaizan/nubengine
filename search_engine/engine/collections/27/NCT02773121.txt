      During this time, three study visits will be required. The first visit is for informed
      consent and screening, the second visit is for baseline fitness and cognitive testing, and
      the third visit is for follow-up fitness and cognitive testing after a 12-week physical
      activity monitoring program. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms, a
      physical activity monitoring arm and a flexibility and balance arm. Both study arms involve
      wearing a physical activity sensor and monitoring physical activity for a duration of 12
      weeks.
