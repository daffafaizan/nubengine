      participate in the exercise program by a team of experts included in this study.

      Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded before the pulmonary
      rehabilitation program. All cases were evaluated by pulmonary function test, arterial blood
      gas analysis, six minute walking test, MMRC Dyspnea Scale. Causes that prevented program
      adaptation of those who did not participate in the program or who left the program were
      questioned. Patients completing the eight-week PR program will compare with those who did not
      complete the program or who did not start the program at the recommended time.
