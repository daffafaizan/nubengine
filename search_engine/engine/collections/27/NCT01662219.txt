      stay surgery. Postoperative pain is the leading cause of unplanned hospital admissions
      following day surgery, a major source of dissatisfaction and often impairs the quality of
      recovery. Opioid analgesics alone are not always effective and may also worsen the
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and in turn the postoperative recovery. This study is
      designed to find out if an injection of freezing on the side of neck around the nerves
      (superficial cervical plexus block) improves the quality of recovery from anesthesia and
      surgery by reducing the pain, analgesic consumption after anterior cervical spine surgery.

      Primary Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure is the global QoR-40 aggregate score at
      24 hours after surgery.

      Secondary Outcome Measures

        -  Postoperative pain scores (first 24 hours)

        -  Total analgesic consumption (first 24 hours)

        -  Time for first opioid administration

        -  Postop Nausea and vomiting (first 24 hours)

        -  Post operative sedation (first 24 hours)
