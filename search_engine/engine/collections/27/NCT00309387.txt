      age-related cataract is still responsible for about 50% of cases of severe visual impairment
      in developing countries, and for high and growing health care costs in western countries.
      CTNS was designed to complement the U.S. Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) by evaluating
      a much broader spectrum of nutrients at RDA dosages. Whereas about 60% of the AREDS control
      group was taking RDA dose multivitamin supplements, none of the participants in CTNS had
      taken any type of nutritional supplement for at least one year before the qualification
      visit. Therefore, the CTNS will be able to evaluate the effect of RDA doses versus no
      supplementation at all. CTNS and AREDS will use similar procedures, including those for
      grading the presence and severity of lens changes.

      CTNS is a randomized,parallel group, placebo controlled, double blinded, single center,
      intervention trial.

      Primary Outcomes: photographic evaluation of a prespecified increase from baseline in
      nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) opacity grades or cataract
      surgery.

      Secondary Outcomes: increase in type-specific opacity grade, cataract surgery, and visual
      acuity loss from baseline > or = 15 letters.

      Patients will be followed for a maximum of 10 years.
