    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 Day 1

        -  Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 Day 1 and 8

        -  Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Day 1

      Review toxicity every cycle (every 3 weeks) Review for radiographic response every 2 cycles
      (every six weeks)

      Progressive disease = off protocol therapy

      Patients will be treated for up to a maximum of 8 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine (24
      weeks of therapy). If a patient has not progressed by the end of 24 weeks (completion of
      cisplatin and gemcitabine), then patient will be treated with bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg every
      three weeks for a maximum of 12 months of bevacizumab therapy (since study entry).

      If at any time patient has undue toxicity or progressive disease, patient will be removed
      from the study and followed until progression and for survival.

      If the patient has Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity and/or the creatinine rises above 2.0, then the
      cisplatin will be discontinued and the patient continued on study and treated with
      gemcitabine and bevacizumab at the same dose and schedule.

      ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1500 mm/3

        -  Platelet count > 100,000/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL (may be transfused or receive erythropoietin support to maintain or
           exceed this level).

        -  INR < 1.5

        -  No full dose/therapeutic anticoagulation with either low molecular weight heparin or
           unfractionated heparin or coumadin

      Hepatic:

        -  Total bilirubin of <1.5 mg/dL

        -  ALT <5 times upper limit of normal for subjects with documented liver metastases; <2.5
           times the upper limit of normal for subjects without evidence of liver metastases.

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine of < 1.5 mg/dL.

        -  Urine protein:creatinine ratio < 1.0 at screening

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No history of myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months

        -  No uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure of >160 systolic and/or 110 diastolic mmHg
           on medication)

        -  No unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive
           heart failure

        -  No unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication (subjects with chronic atrial
           arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are
           eligible), or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.
