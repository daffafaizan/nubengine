      transforaminal ESI.

      Investigators obtained clinical data including age, gender, duration of symptoms, predominant
      symptoms (axial pain vs. leg pain), severity of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC)
      and degree of depression. Depression was assessed by the Korean version of the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a standardized questionnaire to assess cognitive,
      affective, and somatic symptoms of depression. All data were obtained before performing
      ESI.Data about anterior epidural spreading and presence of concordant pain provocation were
      obtained during fluoroscopic guided parasagittal interlaminar or transforaminal ESI. Also
      total procedure time and amount of radiation exposure were checked. Investigators observed
      the epidural spread pattern after a 2 ml injection of contrast material, confirmed anterior
      epidural spread with a lateral view, and asked the participants if they had any concordant
      pain provocation or not. The participants were asked if the pain was in the same distribution
      as their original pain (concordant) or dissimilar or absent in both quality and location.

      Investigators used the numerical rating scale (NRS) as well as the Korean version of the
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to evaluate clinical efficacy in terms of reducing pain and
      functional improvement at pretreatment and 2 weeks after the ESI series. ESI was performed
      twice with a 2 weeks interval before the final treatment outcome evaluation with the NRS and
      ODI. All patients reported average severity of their symptoms over the previous 1 week. A
      score of 0 on the NRS represents no pain, and a score of 10 represents the worst pain
      imaginable. The Korean version of the ODI (0-50) was used to assess functional improvement.
