    
      The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed as a single-center, open-label, non-randomized study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a two-dose schedule of rBV A/B in
      healthy volunteers at three ascending dosage levels, 5 ug, 10 ug and 20 ug serotype-specific
      antigen (10 ug, 20 ug and 40 ug total immunizing protein) in three dosing cohorts and a
      two-dose regimen (Day 0 and Day 28) of a formulation containing only antigens at the 40 ug
      total immunizing protein dosage level. Approximately 44 volunteers (11 per cohort) are
      expected to be enrolled. Cohorts will enroll consecutively beginning with the lowest dosage
      level. Volunteers in each cohort will receive a two injection series at the assigned dosage
      level given as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (i.m.) injection on Day 0 and Day 28. Potential
      volunteers for study participation will undergo qualification screening for this study during
      the 21 days prior to the date scheduled for vaccination. After successful completion of the
      informed consent process and all screening assessments, volunteers will be scheduled for
      vaccination. Volunteers will report acute adverse events daily for 28 days after each
      vaccination and return to the clinic at regular intervals according to the Schedule of Study
      Assessments with the last scheduled follow-up 168 days (Â± 7 days) after the initial
      vaccination (Day 0).
