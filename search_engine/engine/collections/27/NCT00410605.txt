    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
      with relapsed or refractory stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with bevacizumab,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine time to progression in these patients. II. Determine the toxicity and
      tolerability of this regimen. III. Determine the effect of bevacizumab and lenalidomide on
      markers of myeloma activity in myeloma cells and stromal cells, including interleukin-6,
      macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î±, vascular endothelial growth factor, and STAT3.

      IV. Assess local cytokine milieu using tissue microarrays of bone marrow biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, oral lenalidomide on
      days 1-21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and before courses 2 and 4. Blood samples are
      examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
      polymorphisms by pyrosequencing and VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, interleukin-6, and macrophage
      inflammatory protein 1 by immunoenzyme techniques. Relationships between plasma cell myeloma
      and stroma and the effect of study treatment on these relationships are examined in tissue
      sections of bone marrow before and after treatment utilizing microvessel density
      measurements, VEGF staining, and STAT3 staining (by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in
      situ hybridization [FISH]).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
