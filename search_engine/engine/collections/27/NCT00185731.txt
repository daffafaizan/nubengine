      with murine and human lymphoma cell lines, and administration of statins leads to shrinkage
      of lymphoma in murine models. Therefore, it may be possible for atorvastatin to decrease
      levels of active oncogenes in human lymphomas. Further, upon decrease in levels of active
      oncogenes, human lymphomas may regress. Atorvastatin is a commonly prescribed drug for
      hypercholesterolemia: targeting the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase
      enzyme may also be a way to decrease activation of oncogenes in human lymphoma, with minimal
      toxicity. For human low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, no curative treatment is available;
      therefore new, non-toxic and targeted therapies are sought for this disease.
