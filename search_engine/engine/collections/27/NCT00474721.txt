      patients 5-18 years of age with acute extremity pain received acetaminophen-codeine (1 mg/kg
      as codeine) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg). They provided Color Analog Scale pain scores at baseline
      and at 20, 40, and 60 minutes after medication administration. The primary outcome measured
      was the difference in changes in pain score at 40 minutes, compared against a previously
      described minimal clinically significant change in pain score of 2 cm. Additional outcomes
      included need for rescue medication and adverse effects.
