      relationally and cognitively the hospitalized children, who have to spend a lot of time
      alone, without being educated by teachers with their classmates. There are not many studies
      in the Italian contest about this issue and with the present study the investigators intended
      to implement the acknowledgement about this theme.

      The principal aim of this study is to explore if the school service reduces negative emotions
      experienced by oncological children as well as perceived pain and distress. To evaluate this
      aims, the investigators organized the study in 3 sections: the first is about the emotions
      experienced by oncological children between 8 and 12 years old, who benefit from the school
      service into the hospital; the second is about their parents' opinions and believes about the
      hospital school service; the third is about opinions, training and educational method
      dedicated by hospital school teachers and not hospital school teachers (who previously
      thought to our oncology children sample).
