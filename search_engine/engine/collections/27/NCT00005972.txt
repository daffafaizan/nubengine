      recurrent or refractory small cell lung cancer when treated with gemcitabine plus irinotecan.
      II. Determine the overall and failure free survival of these patients when treated with this
      regimen. III. Determine the duration of response of these patients after this treatment. IV.
      Evaluate the toxicity associated with the administration of this treatment in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior response duration (progression 90 days or
      more after initial therapy vs progression less than 90 days after initial therapy or no
      response to initial therapy). Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan
      IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1
      year, then every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18 months.
