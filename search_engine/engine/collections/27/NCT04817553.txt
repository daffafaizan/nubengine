      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 124 million people worldwide as
      of 23/3/2021. While many COVID-19 patients have been reported to have a milder clinical
      course, old age and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic lung conditions,
      obesity, and diabetes have been associated with a more severe disease course and higher
      mortality. Moreover, patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are at risk
      of viral infections either related to their underlying immune dysfunction or the
      immunosuppressive therapy that they receive for the chronic inflammatory conditions.

      IgG4 related disease is an increasingly recognized immune-mediated condition that may
      resemble many malignant, infectious or inflammatory diseases. It is characterized by
      tumor-like lesions, with histopathological features of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in
      IgG4-positive plasma cells, obliterative phlebitis, storiform fibrosis, and, often but not
      always, elevated serum IgG4 concentrations.

      While studies on the outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (an important
      gastroenterological disease requiring immunosuppressive therapies for treatment) patients
      with COVID-19 have been published recently, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on
      the clinical outcomes and management of IgG4 related disease patients with pancreatobiliary
      involvement. Because the number of IgG4 patients with pancreatobiliary involvement cared by
      individual centers and the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in different geographical regions
      vary, we propose to conduct a multicenter retrospective study to further evaluate the impact
      of COVID-19 on the clinical outcomes and management of IgG4 related disease patients with
      pancreatobiliary involvement.
