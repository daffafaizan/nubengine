      could be an important mechanism to protect gingiva as it is exposed to mechanical, chemical,
      thermal etc. irritation during whole life. It is especially important during flap surgery.
      Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) is novel non-invasive method with high spatio-temporal
      resolution, therefore it allows us to study remote effect of local vasodilation such as
      spreading vasodilation in human gingiva.

      The vasodilatator nitric-oxide (NO) donor will be used to trigger remote effect on gingiva.
      NO donor solutions will be applied in 1 mg/ml and 8 mg/ml nitroglycerin concentrations.
      Solution will be dropped on the gingiva at tooth 12 in a fabricated leakage proof well
      attached to 2mm above the marginal gingiva. The change on blood flow will be monitor at the
      test well with surrounding gingival area spanning 3 tooth and at the contralateral side by
      LSCI.
