    
      A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1
      (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immunopotentiating activity.
      Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed
      on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its
      ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor
      cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells
      (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on
      APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the
      PI3K/Akt pathway.

      This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in
      comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).
