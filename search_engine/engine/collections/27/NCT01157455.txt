    
      Study Device:The XIENCE V速 Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE V EECSS or XIENCE
      V stent system) is a device/drug combination product consisting of either the MULTI-LINK
      VISION速 Coronary Stent System or the MULTI-LINK MINI VISION速 Coronary Stent System coated
      with a formulation containing everolimus, the active ingredient, embedded in a non-erodible
      polymer. Design:A prospective, multi-center, registry that is designed to enroll Chinese
      patients with either Long Lesion, or Small Vessel or Multi-Vessel diseases. Purpose:To
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the XIENCE V速 everolimus drug eluting stent for
      coronary revascularization of patients with either long lesion, or small vessel, or
      multi-vessel diseases. Enrollment:Approximately 1900 patients will be enrolled in at least 45
      but up to 51 centers. Mainland China 41 up to 47 centers, Taiwan China 3 centers and Macao
      China 1 center. This registry is planned to enroll at least 50% of patients with multi-vessel
      disease. Primary Endpoint:Ischemia-driven Target Vessel Failure (TVF) which is a composite of
      cardiac death, myocardial infarction (Q and non-Q wave) and target vessel revascularization
      (TVR) at 12 months post-index procedure. Follow-Up Visits:30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and
      24 months post index procedure.
