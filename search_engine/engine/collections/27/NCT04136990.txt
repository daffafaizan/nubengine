      ligament injury who are undergoing surgery and will be allocated 1:1 to either isolated ACL
      reconstruction (control group) or ACL reconstruction combined with lateral extra-articular
      tenodesis (experimental group). The principal outcome of this work is the sagittal and
      rotational knee laxity analysis and side-to-side and 2-year improvement. The secondary
      outcomes include graft failure (re-tears) and the patient-reported outcome measures (KOOS) at
      2 years follow-up.
