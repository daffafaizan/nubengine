      significant morbidity and mortality.Standard care includes home parenteral/enteral nutrition
      as well as intestinal transplantation, however multiple drugs, vitamins, antibiotics and
      symptom-relieving agents may be required. Little attention has been given to the indications
      and dosage schedules of such drugs, many of which are employed as off-label prescriptions
      because of lack of official guidelines.

      Prescriptional patterns of these drugs will be analyzed in a clinical cohort of home
      parenteral/enteral nutrition patients, registered at the outpatient service of Hospital das
      Clinicas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
