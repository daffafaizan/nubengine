      study, to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of different levels of single-dose and multiple-dose
      of bilastine in healthy Chinese subjects. Total 24 subjects will be enrolled into the study
      and divided into 2 cohorts, 12 subjects in each cohort.

      Single-dose only cohort treatment duration is 1 day and receive a single dose of 40 mg of
      bilastine then collect PK blood sample. Single-dose followed by multiple-dose cohort
      treatment duration of this cohort is 9 days. Subjects will receive a single dose of bilastine
      20 mg on the morning of Day 1; and six doses of bilastine 20 mg in the morning from Day 4 to
      Day 9 and collect PK blood samples. The primary objective of the study is to determine the PK
      properties of orally administered bilastine in healthy Chinese population. The secondary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bilastine administered
      as a single and multiple doses in healthy Chinese subjects.
