      abolish insulin-mediated suppression of C-peptide, attenuating α-cell glucagon secretion
      during hypoglycemia, and that β-adrenergic (hormonal) blockade will have no effect. Glucose
      counterregulatory responses will be measured during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic
      clamps on three occasions with randomized, double-blind administration of the α-adrenergic
      blocker phentolamine, the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol, or placebo. The demonstration of
      neural rather than hormonal regulation of the transplanted islet cell response to
      hypoglycemia is critical for understanding the mechanism for protection from hypoglycemia
      afforded by intrahepatically transplanted islets.

      Glucose counterregulation has not been studied in type 1 diabetic recipients of extrahepatic
      islet transplantation. Comparison of glucose counterregulatory responses measured during
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamps will be compared to those obtained from type
      1 diabetic recipients of intrahepatic islet transplantation studied under the placebo
      condition above.

      Glucose counterregulation has not been directly compared between recipients of intrahepatic
      auto- and allo-islet transplantation. Direct comparison of glucose counterregulatory
      responses under the same experimental conditions is required to understand whether mechanisms
      other than the glucagon response may be important to the reported hypoglycemia affecting
      pancreatectomized recipients of islet auto-transplantation.
