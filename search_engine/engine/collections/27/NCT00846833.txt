      the role of cancer immunotherapy. However, autologous NK cells showed the lack of significant
      clinical effects, because they are inhibited by self MHC class I molecules, based on the
      missing-self hypothesis. Contrarily, haploidentical NK cells with KIR-ligand incompatibility
      can mediate graft-versus-leukemia effect and protect patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
      (AML) from graft-versus-host disease. In addition, adoptive transfer of haploidentical NK
      cells following high-intensity conditioning induced complete remission (26%) in
      poor-prognosis AML patients. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the role of
      adoptive NK cell therapy in patients with refractory or relapsed malignant melanoma using
      CD3+ depleting CliniMACSÂ® system.
