      0/7 weeks, is to administer ampicillin 2gm IV every 6hours for 48hrs followed by amoxicillin
      250mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days, with erythromycin 250mg IV for 48hours followed by
      500mg orally every 8hours for 5 days. Our study design would be a prospective randomized
      trial. Consented, eligible women will be randomized to receive ampicillin as above plus
      either azithromycin 1 gm orally at enrollment or erythromycin 250mg IV every 6 hours for
      48hours followed by 500mg orally every 8hours for 5 days. Those who are unable to tolerate
      the 1gm of azithromycin within the first 30 minutes of administration, a 1000mg powder
      suspension will be given. In conjunction with standard protocol, a course of steroids for
      fetal lung maturity will be administered upon the treating staff's discretion, and all Group
      B Beta Streptococcus positive patients will be treated.
