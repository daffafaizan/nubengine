      I. To determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients with surgically resectable
      esophageal cancer treated pre-operatively with induction chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin
      and irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) followed by concurrent cisplatin/irinotecan and
      radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential response or progression of disease during induction chemotherapy
      with positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of therapy, including surgical morbidity and
      mortality.

      III. To determine the overall survival, disease free survival, and pattern of failure.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY (COURSES 1-2): Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 of courses 1 and
      2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY (COURSES 3-4): Beginning 2 weeks after completion of induction
      chemotherapy, patients receive cisplatin and irinotecan hydrochloride as in induction
      chemotherapy on days 1 and 8 of courses 3 and 4 and undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week
      in course 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
      surgery to remove the tumor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
