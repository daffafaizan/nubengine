      Despite the fact that GAD frequently demands prolonged treatment with medication, very little
      is known about the benefits of long-term treatment. GAD is characterized by 6 months or more
      of exaggerated worry and tension that is unfounded or much more severe than the normal
      anxiety most people experience. People with GAD are unable to relax and often suffer from
      insomnia. Venlafaxine XR, a drug used to treat depression, has been shown to be effective in
      the short-term treatment of GAD. However, its benefits over a course of more than 8 weeks
      have not been assessed. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of venlafaxine XR in
      treating GAD on a long-term basis and preventing the relapse of GAD after 6 months of
      treatment versus 12 months of treatment.

      Participants in this double-blind study will first receive 6 months of open-label treatment
      with venlafaxine XR. Upon completion of this initial phase, participants will be randomly
      assigned to either continue on venlafaxine XR or begin taking placebo. After 12 months,
      participants taking venlafaxine XR will be randomly assigned to continue on the drug or
      switch to placebo. Participants will have 22 study visits over at least 18 months. Follow-up
      visits will occur 24 months after enrollment. Relapse of GAD will be assessed with the
      Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Global Severity and Improvement Scale. A variety of methods,
      including questionnaires and standardized scales, will be used to assess secondary outcomes.
