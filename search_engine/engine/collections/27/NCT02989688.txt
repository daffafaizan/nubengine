      cardiovascular disease, and many of our dialysis population also have diabetes. Malnutrition
      is common in patients undergoing dialysis and causes are multifactorial. Oral nutrition
      support is the first line treatment for malnutrition, and often includes the use of liquid
      nutrition supplements, especially in dialysis patients due to the already restricted diet
      required to maintain electrolyte balance. Oral nutrition supplements (ONS) can raise serum
      blood glucose levels and optimal control for diabetes may be difficult when ONS are required.
      This study aims to evaluate the post-prandial response to a newly re-formulated slow release
      carbohydrate renal specific oral nutrition supplement, compared to standard and
      macro-nutrient matched ONS products, during haemodialysis, using a randomised cross-over
      trial design. 28 patients with diabetes and end stage kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis
      will be recruited to the study, including 8 in the pilot phase and 20 in the study. Patients
      will be randomised in a crossover design to 3 study treatments over 3 weeks - slow release
      CHO ONS, macronutrient matched ONS, and standard ONS. Central blood glucose levels will be
      measured over 3 hours and the peak and mean incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of the
      post prandial blood glucose response will be calculated for each study treatment. Differences
      between treatments will be determined with repeated measures analysis of co-variance
      (ANCOVA). The acute effect of different nutritional supplements on blood glucose will be
      discussed in the context of maintaining optimal blood glucose control during dialysis.
