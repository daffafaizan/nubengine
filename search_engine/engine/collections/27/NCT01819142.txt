      acute care facilities and nursing homes. AutoloGel is a platelet-rich plasma gel used in the
      treatment of non-healing chronic wounds. The results of AutoloGel to date when used to treat
      PUs have been promising. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      complete wound healing in a prospective, open-label, case-matched cohort trial in which
      pressure ulcers will be treated using AutoloGel and standard of care to determine time to
      heal at 16 weeks. Comparison will be made with a case matched concurrent cohort of patients
      receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care.
