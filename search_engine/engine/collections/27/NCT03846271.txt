      employed. A total of 35 healthy male subjects will be recruited which will receive either
      intranasal placebo or oxytocin (24IU) on two separate study days (order counter-balanced,
      washout period at least 2 weeks). 45 minutes after treatment subjects will undergo a
      probabilistic feedback reinforcement learning paradigm with concurrent EEG acquisition.
      During the paradigm subjects will learn the reward probabilities of two different visual
      stimuli from probabilistic feedback provided by social stimuli (positive, negative emoticon).
      The paradigm includes an initial acquisition phase and a subsequent test phase.
