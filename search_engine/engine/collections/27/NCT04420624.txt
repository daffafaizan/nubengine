      reperfused acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of
      heart failure (HF). It induces myocardial denervation predisposing to ventricular rhythm
      disorders and death. This denervation linked to infarction's size occurs by direct ischaemic
      mechanisms during the initial coronary occlusion (initially non-vascularised zone) and
      secondarily by cardiac remodelling in the context of the heart failure (HF). In usual
      practice, cardiac denervation which intensity is correlated with rhythm and mortality risks,
      can be evaluated by scintigraphy. In a murine reperfusion model of ischemia, the direct
      anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine reduces the size of the necrosis and improves
      post-ischemic remodeling. This suggests that colchicine may reduce myocardial denervation.
