      persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus who have failed treatment protocols of higher
      priority. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxic effects of paclitaxel in this group of
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a continuous infusion of paclitaxel once every 3 weeks over 3
      hours. Patients in complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease undergo at least
      3 courses of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel continues until disease progression or adverse effects
      prohibit further treatment. All patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study anticipates an annual accrual of approximately 25 patients over
      2.5 years.
