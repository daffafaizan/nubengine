      DLT, safety and efficacy of AC0010 in patients with B-cell lymphoma. This study includes two
      parts. During Part 1 Dose Escalation, the "3+3" design will be applied. Dose escalation will
      begin at dose level 1 = 400 mg. This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory
      expansion phase in 3 or 4 groups of 15~41 patients each (CLL group, MCL group, non-germinal
      center B cell-like DLBCL group, and/or FL/WM(macroglobulinemia) group). The study will
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AC0010 in these patients in each group
