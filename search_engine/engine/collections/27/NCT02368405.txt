      SCI population. Many individuals with SCI are unable or have a limited capacity to exercise.
      This reality makes good nutrition even more urgent. This study will be the first to test
      whether additional nutrition education can improve nutrition behavior and knowledge, diet
      quality, adiposity, and metabolic CVD risk factors in individuals with SCI and to determine
      the best setting to deliver nutrition education to individuals with SCI.
