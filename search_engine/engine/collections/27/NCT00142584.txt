      (SBP) greater then or equal to 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater then
      or equal to 90 mmHg. To control blood pressure, more than 2 agents are required in many
      patients. The current study is a randomized, titration-to-effect, open-label, multi center
      study. Patients will be randomized to either nebivolol or metoprolol. The dose of the
      randomized treatment can be titrated as needed to achieve blood pressure control. If
      necessary, additional antihypertensive agents (calcium antagonist, diuretic, etc.) can be
      added to achieve control. Patients will be seen every 1-3 months for approximately 18 months
      to assess long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of nebivolol versus metoprolol.
