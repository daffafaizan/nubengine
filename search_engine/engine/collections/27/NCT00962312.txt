      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of lapatinib ditosylate and capecitabine as first-line therapy,
           in terms of overall survival, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the overall response rate (complete and partial responses) in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or stable disease
           for â‰¥ 6 months) of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicity associated with this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  To determine the intra-tumoral expression of ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 (HER2/neu) in these
           patients.

        -  To seek pilot information on the intra-tumoral expression of markers of tumor resistance
           and sensitivity to treatment, including resistance drug pump expression and growth
           factor receptor expression.

        -  To collect pre- and post-treatment serum samples from these patients for proteomic
           analyses to elucidate if any serum cancer marker profiles can be detected.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-21 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 weeks.
