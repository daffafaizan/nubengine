      nocturia, in addition to urgency and frequency. Women with nocturia are prone to suffer from
      a fall and fracture. Beta-3 agonist is an effective treatment for OAB. However, women with
      nocturia may need adjuvant desmopressin to improve nocturia. The aim of this study is to
      elucidate whether night-time dosing can improve nocturia, compared with daytime dosing.

      Patients and Methods: The investigators will perform a prospective randomized controlled
      trial to recruit 90 female OAB patients at the outpatient clinic of Department of Obstetrics
      and Gynecology of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. All OAB women will be treated by mirabegron.
      All enrolled OAB women will be allocated to two groups (group A and B). The women in group A
      will receive daytime dosing of mirabegron treatment; and the women in group B will receive
      nighttime dosing of mirabegron. All OAB female patients will be asked to complete Urgency
      Severity Scales, Overactive Bladder Symptoms Scores questionnaires, King's Health
      questionnaires, 3-day bladder diary before, 4 weeks' and after 12 weeks' mirabegron
      treatment. STATA software is used for statistical analyses.

      Possible Results: The investigators can answer whether night-time dosing of mirabegron can
      improve nocturia, compared with daytime dosing.
