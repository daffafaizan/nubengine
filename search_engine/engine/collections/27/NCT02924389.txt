      different parts of the body: including blood plasma, special blood cells, and rectal tissue.
      Specifically, investigators want to compare how fast dolutegravir lowers the HIV viral load
      in these three different sites. In addition, investigators seek to learn if there are any
      differences in how dolutegravir acts in males and females. Results of this study will provide
      more information about HIV medications and their limitations. In the future, this could help
      create better HIV medications that can get into these hard-to-reach places and eventually
      cure HIV infection.

      The primary aim of this study is to validate the integrated population PK-VD model that
      quantitatively describes the relationship between dolutegravir (DTG) exposure and HIV viral
      decay in blood plasma. The second aim of this study is to develop an integrated population
      pharmacokinetic-viral dynamic (PK-VD) model to describe the relationship between DTG exposure
      and HIV viral decay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue reservoir sites.
      The third aim is exploratory and will investigate sex differences in DTG penetration into
      blood plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue reservoirs reservoirs as
      well as its impact on the rectal microbiome.
