      forms immune complex glomerulonephritis has led to its investigation in the treatment of IgA
      nephropathy. Because IgA class antibodies have comparatively short half-lives and that
      deposition of polymeric forms of IgA contributes to glomerular injury, the researchers
      speculated that the reduction of circulating IgA could reduce proteinuria and injury in
      patients with IgA nephropathy.

      Treatment and Follow-up:

      Subjects were randomly assigned to receive rituximab or to continue standard care. Both arms
      received a Omega-3 Fatty Acid Fish Oil Supplement and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors and/or Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs were
      used to achieve a blood pressure goal of <130/80 mmHg.

      The study was an open-label trial; those assigned to rituximab received a 1 g infusion of
      rituximab followed by an identical dose 2 weeks later. Premedication with corticosteroids (10
      mg dexamethasone intravenously) was also given 30 min prior to the first infusion of each
      series of rituximab. They received an identical 2 g course of rituximab 6 months later.
      Subjects were assessed at least every 3 months or as needed for clinical events. This
      assessment included physical examination, a questionnaire for adverse events, and measurement
      of routine hematology, serum chemistry, timed urine protein excretion, and for those assigned
      to rituximab, B-cell subsets. Follow-up was considered complete at 12 months.
