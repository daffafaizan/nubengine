      action remains unclear, but research suggests that its effects are mediated through a widely
      connected network that is involved in the regulation of mood, behavior, and function of
      physiological systems. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      monitor the effects of manual acupuncture on the brain function of study participants.

      Participants in this study will undergo acupuncture one needle at a time. Researchers will
      then ask participants questions about how they feel and will compare the sensations reported
      by participants to their images of brain response.
