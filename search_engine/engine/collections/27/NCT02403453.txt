    
      A Prospective, open label, multi-center observational study of patients requiring surgical
      treatment at one or two (contiguous) cervical spine levels ( C3-C7). The primary objectives
      of the RHINE Cervical Disc study are to: obtain operative data and feedback on surgical
      instruments and surgical technique; confirm device performance in terms of clinical and
      radiographic outcomes; confirm device performance in terms of safety and to collect original
      data to be compared to published reports of the performance of comparable motion-sparing
      devices, as well as clinical outcomes of fusion devices. Device- and procedure-related
      adverse events, serious adverse events, and secondary surgeries will be monitored throughout.
      AEs will be characterized by severity, seriousness and relationship to device. Investigator
      reports of serious adverse events and any AE trends will be reviewed by a medical monitor.
