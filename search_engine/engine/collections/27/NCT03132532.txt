      diagnosed with stage 2/3 diagnosed with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Patients will be
      randomized in equal proportions (1:1) to a single dose level (60 vs 72 Gy) balanced based on
      the stratification factors. The duration of radiation therapy and chemotherapy will be about
      6-7Â½ weeks. Patient will receive concurrent chemotherapy, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (weekly
      during radiotherapy followed 3-6 weeks later by 2 cycles of consolidation). Duration of trial
      participation is about 5 years. The investigator will permit study-related monitoring,
      audits, and inspections by the IRB, and government regulatory agencies, of all study related
      documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study
      data etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable
      study-related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).

      Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by
      government regulatory authorities and applicable compliance offices. 42 total (n=21 per arm)
      evaluable patients will need to be accrued onto this randomized phase II study unless undue
      adverse events are encountered. Anticipated accruing an additional 6 patients (3 per dose
      level) to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other
      reasons. Maximum projected accrual is therefore 48 patients total.
