      patients will receive tibulizumab (LY3090106) 300mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for a total
      of 12 weeks.

      Primary Sjogren's syndrome was selected as a relevant patient population based on the
      mechanism of action of the molecule and the current understanding of the pathogenesis of the
      disease. An open-label design was chosen based on practical considerations regarding the
      number of patients that could be recruited. Although open-label studies are subject to bias,
      objective primary endpoints were intentionally chosen to minimize this concern.

      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that tibulizumab (LY3090106) treatment improves the
      mean unstimulated salivary flow rate or the salivary gland total ultrasound score (TUS) in
      primary Sjogren's syndrome patients at week 12 compared to the baseline visit.
