      will consume a standardized meal of pork (intrinsically labeled with 58Fe) and a second meal
      of non-heme 57Fe (as ferrous sulfate). Two weeks after ingesting these test meals, a blood
      sample will be collected from each women and the amount of heme (58Fe) and non-heme (57Fe)
      iron incorporated into red blood cells will be measured with magnetic sector thermal
      ionization mass spectrometry. Cord blood samples and placental tissue will be obtained at
      delivery to measure how these two forms of dietary iron were transferred across the placenta
      to the fetus. Maternal and neonatal iron status and placental proteins involved in iron
      transport will also be measured. Data from this study will provide information that aims to
      improve human health by better understanding the iron requirements of a population at high
      risk of iron deficiency.
