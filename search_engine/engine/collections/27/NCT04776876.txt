      I. To evaluate the efficacy of retifanlimab (A12) + telotristat ethyl (TE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of A12 + TE.

      SAFETY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of A12 + TE. II. To evaluate the safety of withholding concurrent
      somatostatin analogue in patients receiving A12 + TE.

      EXPLORATORY BIOMARKER OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify biomarkers that are predictive of response to A12 + TE (i.e., predictive
      biomarkers), are associated with progression to a more severe disease state (i.e., prognostic
      biomarkers), are associated with resistance to A12 + TE, are associated with susceptibility
      to developing adverse events, can provide evidence of study treatment activity, or can
      increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive retifanlimab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and telotristat
      ethyl orally (PO) 3 times daily (TID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
