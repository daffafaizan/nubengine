      be treated with the standard chemo-radiotherapy with the addition of daily zinc. We will
      follow the toxicity, Progression free survival and overall survival of this group of
      patients. We hope to demonstrate the anti-tumor activity of zinc that will enhance the
      activity of temozolomide chemotherapy in adult glioblastoma patients. We will also follow the
      safety and monitor quality of life during treatment. In this study, we will compare results
      of patients receiving zinc to historical patient data. We will review patient portfolios with
      GB tumors that received treatment as the subjects in this study in the last five years before
      the study began. Collecting the data and separating the identified data from the file in a
      way that cannot be retrieved in any way will be done by a staff member from Dr Ruty Shai's
      laboratory who is authorized to open medical files. We will adjust the age and number of
      patients in each gender. Data collected: date of birth, age of disease development, gender,
      data after receiving treatment: Progression free survival and overall survival of this group
      of patients, side effects, and quality of life.
