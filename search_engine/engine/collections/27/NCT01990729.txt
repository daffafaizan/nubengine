      weeks with a pain intensity >3 on a 0-10 point visual analogue scale (VAS). Major exclusion
      criteria were presence of fibromyalgia, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and alcohol and/or
      drug abuse. All patients were treated with ARTRA (combination of glucosamine hydrochloride
      500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 500 mg in tab; Unipharm Inc.) at a dose of 1 tab bid for the
      first month and then 1 tab daily for the next two months. The primary endpoint was pain
      intensity (at rest and movement) as measured on a 0-10 point VAS. Secondary endpoints
      included Oswestry Disability Index, patient global assessment of efficacy (0-5 scale) and
      NSAID consumption.
