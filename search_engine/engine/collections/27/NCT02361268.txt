      hemodialysis to compare the effects of intra-dialysis yoga to an educational program. In a
      sample of 68 patients the investigators will compare the clinical effects of a 12-week
      program of yoga to a 12-week education program during dialysis. Outcome assessment of study
      participants will occur at baseline, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 24 weeks for: disease-related
      quality of life (physical component primary outcome of the study), physical performance,
      blood pressure, fatigue, satisfaction with dialysis, sleep quality, and mood. Among a
      sub-sample of 20 participants, the investigators will measure the potential effects of the
      interventions on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and autonomic tone. The sub-study
      will collect outcomes at baseline and 12 weeks.
