    
      Background/Rationale: Within the setting of metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 negative (HER2-ve) breast cancer limited epidemiological data exist on the prevalence of
      pathogenic mutations of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) and other homologous
      recombination repair (HRR) genes. There are also limited data on the treatments and clinical
      outcomes of patients with such germline and somatic genetic profiles, particularly within
      this setting. This epidemiologic study will estimate the prevalence of germline breast
      susceptibility gene (gBRCA) mutations among metastatic HER2-ve patients who have commenced
      1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and, at that time, are considered to have exhausted
      hormone therapy options (if hormone receptor positive [HR+ve]), per investigator's opinion.
      Among those patients with a gBRCA gene mutation, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes
      will be described. This study may also explore the prevalence of somatic BRCA (sBRCA)
      mutations and other HRR gene mutations among metastatic HER2-ve patients who have commenced
      1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. The treatment patterns and clinical outcomes may be
      described among those patients with a sBRCA gene mutation and those with other HRR gene
      mutations.
