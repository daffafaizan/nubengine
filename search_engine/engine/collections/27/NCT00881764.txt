      had exposure to anesthesia during surgery before 36 months of age (exposed sibling cohorts)
      and who would be from ages 8yr, 0 mo to15 yr, 0 mo at the time of the study; and the other
      who never had anesthesia or surgery less than 36 months of age, is from ages 8yr, 0mo to 15
      yr, 0 mo at the time of the study, and is within 36 months of age range from the exposed
      sibling(unexposed sibling cohort).

      Neuropsychological assessments are administered to the sibling cohorts prospectively and
      parents of the siblings will complete parental interviews/questionnaires. We assess
      individually neurocognitive, behavioral and emotional function for both exposed and unexposed
      siblings. Family function will also be evaluated. We will also obtain complete medical
      history for each participant, including significant perinatal events and social history. We
      also review medical records when appropriate.

      All testing are performed during a one day site visit.
