      Japanese Children and Adolescents who experience acute attack of HAE. This study will look at
      safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of people who take TAK-667.

      The study will enroll at least 3 participants. Participants will take TAK-667 with SC
      administration on the abdomen. The dose of TAK-667 will be dependent on the participant's
      body weight (Up to 30 mg; 10 mg for 12 kg to 25 kg, 15 mg for 26 kg to 40 kg, 20 mg for 41 kg
      to 50kg, 25 mg for 51 kg to 65 kg, 30 mg for >65 kg).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 25 days as a maximum (screening day for initial attack plus 8 days post dose for
      each 3 attacks as a maximum). Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will
      be closely monitored in the hospital/study center for at least 8 hours after administration
      and receive physical examination and assessment to evaluate safety, efficacy and PK.
      Hospitalization may be prolonged until, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant
      is clinically stable and onset of HAE attack is completely resolved.
