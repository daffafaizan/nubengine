      models and patient material have, to date, suggested a role for macrophages and complement.
      This study hypothesized that the underlying mechanism that leads to choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) is similar to those at play in atherosclerosis. If this is the case,
      the investigators believed that CNV treatment should be amenable to new immunomodulatory
      agents directed against specific parts of the immune system.

      After therapy with anti-angiogenic agents not leading to a persistent remission of CNV due to
      AMD, participants were treated with one of three immunomodulatory agents or were observed in
      conjunction with their continued anti-angiogenic therapy. Thus the participant continued with
      the anti-angiogenic therapy they received after randomization. The investigators hypothesized
      that this combination therapy would inhibit progression of CNV associated with AMD.

      This was an open-label, phase II, randomized, single center clinical trial of 18 study
      participants randomized to receive one of three immunomodulatory agents or was observed in
      conjunction with their anti-angiogenic therapy.
