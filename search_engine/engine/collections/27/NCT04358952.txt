    
      A large population of Covid 19 infected patients of different ages and severity levels will
      be explored by transthoracic echocardiography with measurement of myocardial functional
      parameters such as ejection fraction, longitudinal strain and relaxation parameters and will
      be compared to an uninfected population paired for age and sex.

      Patients with biological myocardial involvement will be followed to determine the evolution
      of their myocardial functional parameters during the course of the infection.
