      help with a loved one's activities of daily living. As a result of caring for a person with
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD), many informal caregivers experience caregiver burden. The demanding
      physical, emotional, and financial responsibilities to care for an AD patient can be
      detrimental to the caregiver's health.

      A group of 20 men and women who consider themselves the primary caregiver of a person with AD
      will be recruited and enrolled into the study. Participants will be randomized into one of
      two study arms, (a) the modified-waitlist control arm or (b) the intervention arm. The study
      will explore the effects of an online heart-focused breathing intervention on heart rate
      variability (measured by the Welltory app on their smart device), perceived burden, stress,
      and quality of life in the intervention arm over a two-week period.
