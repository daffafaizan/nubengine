      are potentially eligible for the study. Patients will be categorized as likely or unlikely to
      have UEDVT based on a clinical decision rule (CDR). Patients "unlikely" for UEDVT based on
      the CDR and with normal D-dimer levels will not receive anticoagulant treatment and will be
      followed-up for 3 months. All patients with a likely CDR or patients with an unlikely CDR
      combined with elevated D-dimer levels will undergo ultrasonography. In case of an
      indeterminate ultrasonography result, ultrasonography testing will be repeated 3-5 days
      later. The same applies for patients with a negative ultrasound and the combination of a high
      probability and elevated D-dimer levels. Anticoagulants will be withheld in all patients for
      whom UEDVT will be excluded by the initial diagnostic work-up.
