    
      This is a randomized, crossover feeding study conducted in normal weight and overweight
      individuals. Participants will be given all their food to eat and drink (except water) for
      two 28-day feeding periods (a total of 56 days). The diets will be carefully controlled and
      energy intake will be regulated to maintain weight stability for each participant. The two
      feeding periods will be separated by a 28 day "washout" period when participants will eat
      their own food. Dinner will be eaten at the Hutchinson Center Monday through Friday. Each
      evening, breakfast, lunch and snacks will be brought home for the next day. On Friday
      evenings all the food will be taken home for the weekend.

      Samples of blood will be collected after an overnight fast at the beginning and the end of
      each feeding period. All urine will be collected for 24 hours at the end of each feeding
      period. A number of questionnaires will also be completed during each diet period. A small
      stool sample will be collected in your own home, before the first feeding period, and once
      during each feeding period. The stool sample collection is optional. One can decide not to
      provide a stool sample and still participate in the study.
