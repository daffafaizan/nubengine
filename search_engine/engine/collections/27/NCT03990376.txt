      surgeons and anesthesiologists to know how much blood a patient has lost during surgery in
      order to care for them in the best way possible. Different methodology has been employed to
      estimate how much blood is lost during surgery, but unfortunately none of the methods used
      have been reliable. The study will calculate surgical blood loss by determining perioperative
      change in red cell volume that is directly measured by using a special method that relies on
      radioisotope I-131-labeled albumin administration (BVA-100) during the surgery. This
      benchmarked blood loss estimate will then be compared to estimates calculated using the Gross
      equation, the Bourke and Smith equation, and the Camarasa formula. In addition, blood loss
      will be estimated volumetrically by utilizing formulas based on the amount of salvaged blood
      produced by an intraoperative salvaging system (Cell SaverÂ®). Blood loss estimates based on
      salvaged blood volume will also be compared to the benchmark.
