    
      One hundred and forty adult female participants scheduled for elective unilateral modified
      radical mastectomy under general anesthesia are randomly allocated to receive either general
      anesthesia plus Pecs block(Pecs group, n=70) or general anesthesia alone (control group,
      n=70).

      After arrived in the operating room，the participants in the control group are accepted the
      general anesthesia.Whereas，after anesthesia induction，the participants in the Pecs group
      receive an ultrasound-guided Pecs block and a 15 minute observation time prior before the
      start of the operation.

      Pecs block technology： A broadband (5-12 hertz) linear array probe of Sonosite Edge portable
      ultrasound system (Sonosite Inc,Bethel,Washington) is used, with an imaging depth of 4 to 6
      cm. After cleaning the infraclavicular and axillary regions with chlorhexidine, the probe is
      placed below the lateral third of the clavicle, similar to what is done when performing
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block. After recognition of the appropriate anatomical
      structures, the skin puncture point is infiltrated with 2% lignocaine, then the block is
      performed by using a 20-gauge Tuohy needle. The needle is advanced to the tissue plane
      between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscle at the vicinity of the pectoral
      branch of the acromiothoracic artery, and 10 mL of 0.35% ropivacaine deposited. In a similar
      manner, 20 mL is deposited at the level of the third rib below the serratus anterior muscle
      with the intent of spreading injectate to the axilla.
