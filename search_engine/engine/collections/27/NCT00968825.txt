      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single administration of RT001 compared to placebo
      applied as a bilateral application in at least 72 subjects with moderate to severe Lateral
      Canthal Lines. Subjects will be randomized within each site to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a
      1:1 ratio. The efficacy and safety of RT001 compared to placebo will be evaluated. Study
      follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4 and 6.
