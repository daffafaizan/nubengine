      coordination and information's exchange between professionals. This research project aims to
      reach this important objective of exchange development and the amelioration of the
      coordination concerning breast cancer women. Breast cancer requires the integration of
      aggressive treatments implying physical, psychological and social consequences. That's why an
      optimized care pathway needs a coordinated and multidisciplinary organization, and more
      particularly a personalized approach taking into account the whole patients' needs in
      physical, psychological and social perspectives. To reach this goal, it is important to
      support those patients, to answer their needs for a better disease management in their own
      health pathways. The research issues lie in this outcome.

      The project is imbued with the whole problematic of patient follow-up and patient support,
      taking into account the experiences and needs of breast cancer patients. It concerns the
      dissemination of knowledge through the implementation of a specific clinical innovation
      designed to optimizing breast cancer patient pathway.

      The " Patients en réseau " association offers us to participate at the web platform evolution
      Mon Réseau Cancer du Sein in adapting it. The feasibility study focuses on (1) the platform
      utilization and (2) sources and obstacles to its utilization in the French context
