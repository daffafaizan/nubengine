      needed to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine (phe). When eating a normal diet
      they show an elevated level of phe in blood that is toxic to the brain. In order to prevent
      brain damage and cognitive impairment, individuals with PKU must follow a lifelong, low-phe
      diet that is restricted in natural foods and requires ingestion of a phe-free amino acid (AA)
      formula. Most adolescents and adults with PKU find the AA formula unpalatable and go off the
      diet resulting in elevated blood phe levels and neuropsychological deterioration.
      Glycomacropeptide (GMP), an intact protein produced during cheese making, is uniquely suited
      to a low-phe diet because it is the only known dietary protein that contains minimal phe.
      Foods and beverages made with GMP are a palatable alternative to AA formula. The long term
      goal is to assess the safety, efficacy and acceptability of GMP for the nutritional
      management of PKU. The specific aim is to conduct a randomized, two-stage, 11-wk, crossover
      trial comparing the GMP diet with the AA diet in 30 subjects with PKU â‰¥12 years of age
      treated since birth with a low-phe AA diet. The sites are: University of Wisconsin-Madison,
      Waisman Center (primary) and Harvard University, Children's Hospital Boston. Subjects will be
      recruited and randomized to begin the first 3-wk of the study with either a low-phe diet in
      which the majority of dietary protein is provided by GMP or AA medical foods and then, after
      a 3-wk washout with intake of their usual diet, begin the second diet for 3-wk. Dietary
      education will be provided in a 1-wk base period preceding initiation of each diet.
