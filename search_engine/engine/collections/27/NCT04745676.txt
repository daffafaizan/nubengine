      utilize hospice at the end-of-life. Advance care planning (ACP) intervention delivered
      through telehealth may improve patient-reported outcomes and end-of-life care in this
      population. This pilot study seeks to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a
      telehealth-delivered advance care planning intervention. We will adapt the Serious Illness
      Care Program.
