      observational (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure
      their outcomes) study. The total duration of the study will be 3 years, and approximately 60
      patients who would use rilpivirine hydrochloride in routine clinical practice with a dosing
      regimen stipulated in the product insert (ie, 25 mg once a day) will be enrolled. As this is
      an observational study, assessment of patients will be based on the accepted clinical
      practice in the Philippines. Patients will be monitored from baseline and throughout the
      48-week (2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 24th, 36th and 48th weeks) treatment period of rilpivirine
      hydrochloride.
