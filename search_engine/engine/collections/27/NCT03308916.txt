      Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. The investigators will use liver stiffness
      measurements with transient elastography to screen 3000 patients from at-risk populations and
      1000 participants from the general population for advanced liver fibrosis. At-risk is defined
      as either (A) a prior or current alcohol overuse (≥21 units/week for men and ≥14 units/week
      for women) for more than 5 years, or (B) presence of the metabolic syndrome with or without
      concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The study goal is to evaluate the aptitude of transient elastography as a screening tool for
      advanced liver fibrosis, based on analyses of benefit, harm, detection rate, technical
      applicability and prognostic potential. Secondary aims are to compare novel serum markers of
      liver fibrosis as potential screening tools against transient elastography: The Enhanced
      Liver Fibrosis test, neoepitope markers of extracellular matrix turnover, cytokeratin-18
      based markers and indirect indices of fibrosis from algorithms combining routine liver blood
      test. Screened patients with elevated liver stiffness (≥8.0 kiloPascal; estimated 200
      patients with alcoholic liver disease, 400 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      and 80 patients from the general population) will be investigated with 2-dimensional
      shear-wave elastography and abdominal ultrasonography and a liver biopsy to confirm or reject
      presence of advanced fibrosis. Participants with a positive screening elastography will be
      followed for disease progression with repeated liver stiffness measurements and serum
      fibrosis markers after one year. All participants will be followed for 10 years to assess
      liver-related outcomes and all-course mortality.
