    
      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the 3-month central nervous system (CNS)-progression free survival (PFS) for
      patients with metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases treated with eribulin mesylate.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      1. Estimate CNS complete and partial response rates (CR and PR) and duration of CNS response
      in this patient population.

      2 Evaluate toxicity in patients with breast cancer with brain metastases treated with
      eribulin mesylate.

      3 Estimate clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 3 months in breast cancer patients with brain
      metastases treated with eribulin mesylate. (CBR is the sum of CR, PR and stable disease at 3
      months).

      4 To estimate systemic disease (extra cranial) response rate and duration of systemic
      response in this patient population.

      5 Overall survival in this patient population.

      Design:

      This is a phase II study that will require patients to evaluate the primary objective (CNS
      PFS at 3 months). Study patients will have a baseline brain MRI and a second MRI at 12 weeks
      to evaluate disease.
