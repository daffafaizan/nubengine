      undergoing a laparoscopy for at least 60 minutes were randomised to a pneumoperitoneum with
      either 100% carbon dioxide or 96% carbon dioxide plus 4% of oxygen. Insufflation pressure and
      Trendelenburg were standardised at 15 mm Hg and 30° respectively. In a second trial women
      were randomized to either 100% carbon dioxide or 86% carbon dioxide plus 4% of oxygen + 10%
      nitrous oxide + humidification and set temperature of 32°C of the peritoneal cavity.
