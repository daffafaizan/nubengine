      changes in adherence levels over time remain unclear. Changes in HRQOL data could serve as
      surrogate markers for changes in hydroxyurea adherence over time, and could suggest when
      patients might or might not need or benefit from an intervention based on worse or better
      HRQOL scores, respectively.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that the assessment of patients' HRQOL at home using a
      SCD smartphone application platform (app) is feasible and acceptable, and that less frequent
      assessments of HRQOL at home will have an overall higher completion rate when compared to
      more frequent ones. We plan to assess HRQOL using the NIH-developed patient reported outcomes
      measurement information system (PROMIS速) with computerized adaptive testing (CAT) approach.
      PROMIS速-CAT approach is a reliable and valid PROs assessment platform that has been used in
      limited studies in SCD.

      The study will include the following specific aims:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the assessment of patients HRQOL at
           home using smartphones with PROMIS速-CAT measures integrated into a SCD-app.

        2. To examine the effect of the frequency of required HRQOL assessments on participants'
           completion rate over 24-week period with HRQOL evaluated every 2 weeks (Group 1) versus
           every 4 weeks (Group 2).

        3. To explore participants' experience and preferences with the process and the frequency
           of HRQOL assessment at home using their smartphones with PROMIS速-CAT measures integrated
           into a SCD-app.
