      (including pathological CR rate), TTP, and complications of treatment in patients with rectal
      cancer treated with FOLFOX bevacizumab, the alteration of tumor blood flow (assessed by
      DCE-MRI as percentage change in Ktrans) after 1 cycle of bevacizumab therapy compared to
      baseline value in patients treated with FOLFOX alone and those treated with bevacizumab at 5
      mg/kg., the degree of hypoxis (measured by tumor uptake of the 2-nitroimidazole EF5) induced
      by bevacizumab treatment and its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow, and the degree
      of apoptosis (measured by tumor uptake of di-annexin V) induced by bevacizumab treatment and
      its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow. The secondary objectives of this study is to
      determine in an exploratory fashion the relationship between tumor blood flow, hypoxia
      induction, and apoptosis induction , and time to progression in patients continuing on to
      receive Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg, to analyze archival tumor from the patients treated in this
      trial for mutations in the MKK7 and SEK1 genes, and by semi-quantitative IHC for these and
      other relevant proteins, to determine the relationship between vascular proliferation as
      measured by DCE-MRI and markers of endothelial cell proliferation, and to obtain pilot data
      on whether assays that measure vascular endothelial cell mitogenic stimulation and mitogenic
      activity may predict response to therapy, time to progression and overall survival in
      patients receiving bevacizumab 5 mg/kg.
