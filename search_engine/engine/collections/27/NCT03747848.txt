      typically classified as a movement disorder, the non-motor symptoms (NMS) also have a
      negative impact on quality of life. Among the NMS, fatigue is one of the most reported and
      bothersome symptoms, even at the early stage of the disease. Currently there are not any
      clear pharmacological or rehabilitative recommendations for managing PD related fatigue.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a developed
      treatment protocol specifically adapted to the Parkinson's population to address fatigue
      symptoms based on the best available evidence. This is a one-group, pre-post, feasibility
      study. It is hypothesized that an establishment of a proper sleep hygiene routine and a
      moderate- to intensive-exercise routine three times a week will decrease Parkinson's disease
      (PD) related fatigue and improve health-related quality of life. The treatment protocol
      focuses on assisting individuals with PD experiencing fatigue to improve sleep hygiene habits
      and establish physical exercise routine using cognitive behavioral therapy in a group format.
      Through this study, the designed program will be evaluated to determine if it will decrease
      self-perceived fatigue level and to improve health-related quality of life among community
      dwelling people with PD.
