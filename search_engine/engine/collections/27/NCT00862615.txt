      and protein metabolism and on bone status, two groups of 16 subjects each will be selected
      according to their inflammatory status ie non-inflamed versus micro-inflamed. The volunteers
      will be sampled twice at week 0 and week 6 in order to quantify plasma concentration of C
      reactive protein (CRP) using the ultra sensitive assay. The subjects exhibiting CRP lower
      than 1 mg/l twice will be included in the non-inflamed group and the subjects exhibiting CRP
      higher than 3 and lower than 15 mg/l will be included in the micro-inflamed group.

      During the two weeks before the metabolic studies dietary intakes, DEXA, muscle function, VO2
      max and biomarkers of bone remodelling will be assessed. Volunteers will then be submitted to
      a diet controlled for its protein content, for 4 days (1 g protein/kg/day and 30 kcal/kg/day)
      before metabolic investigations. One day before, urine will be collected for metabolomics. On
      the day of metabolic investigations, after an overnight fast, blood samples will be collected
      for albumin, fibrinogen, inflammatory cytokine and adipokine determination. Then, the
      subjects will be perfused with L-[1-13C] leucine for 8 hours (post absorptive sate then post
      prandial satte) during which expired gas and blood samples will be taken, as well as 2 muscle
      biopsies. Isotopic enrichments in expired gas, in plasma cetoiscaproate and in free or
      protein-bound leucine in muscle will be measured to determine proteolysis and proteosynthesis
      rate of muscle proteins.
