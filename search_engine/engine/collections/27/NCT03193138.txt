      cardio-vascular side effects, particularly thrombo-embolic disorders and ischemic heart
      disease. The difference of incidence and type of cardio-vascular events between men and women
      are strongly related to sex hormones. Androgenic agonists and antagonists are used in various
      indication including prostate cancer or hormone replacement therapies. This study
      investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by cardiovascular side effects (of
      which ventricular arrhythmia's, QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointe) imputed to drugs
      classified as G03, H01C and L02 according to ATC. A causality assessment according to both
      Begaud's method and the World Health Organization-The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) is
      systematically applied.
