    
      This is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, dose escalation, Phase I trial of the
      combination of the FAK inhibitor, VS-6063, and the dual RAF/MEK inhibitor, RO5126766 in
      patients with advanced solid tumours. RO5126766 is the same compound to CH5126766.

      There are two parts to this study, the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase. In
      the dose escalation phase, cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Up to 24 patients with
      solid tumours will be treated in the dose escalation phase of this study.

      This will be followed by a dose expansion phase of 56 patients to further characterise the
      safety and tolerability and to assess the pharmacodynamic activity of the combination.

      The dose expansion phase will be made up of 4 cohorts: 20 patients with KRAS mutant
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 6 patients with solid tumours (enriched for those with
      RAS mutations) willing to undergo biopsies at three time points throughout the study; 20
      patients with low grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) and 10 patients with colorectal cancer
      (CRC) that have consented.

      Patients will take the two investigational medicinal products (IMPs) as follows:

      RO5126766 will be administered orally twice a week on Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday at
      least one hour prior or two hours after a meal. The starting dose of RO5126766 will be 3.2mg
      once a day, twice a week and can be escalated to a maximum of 4mg once a day, twice a week.

      VS-6063 will be administered orally twice a day immediately after a meal. The starting dose
      of VS-6063 will be 200mg twice daily and can be escalated to a maximum of 400mg twice daily.

      A cycle length is 4 weeks (28 days). Combination dosing (RO5126766 and VS-6063) will commence
      on Cycle 1 Day 1 for 3 weeks followed by one week without either drug in week 4 (i.e. 3 weeks
      on, 1 week off).

      For patients consenting to optional biopsies, a run-in dose of RO5126766 will be administered
      on a single day anywhere between Days -7 to Day -3 in order to facilitate pharmacodynamic
      (PD) biomarker analysis. Therefore, for patients undergoing biopsies the first cycle will be
      5 weeks long and subsequent cycles will consist of 4 weeks.

      If this schedule is not tolerated, alternative schedules may be explored following discussion
      by the Safety Review Committee.
