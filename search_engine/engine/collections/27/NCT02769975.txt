    
      This protocol is designed to allow endocrine-related evaluations of children with known or
      suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders. Children with endocrine or metabolic-related
      condition(s) who may or may not be eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, may be
      evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance the clinical skills of physicians
      participating in NICHD clinical research and training programs, and to provide stimuli for
      new clinical research initiatives. Standard medically-indicated laboratory or radiological
      studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient.
      In some cases, the child participant may receive medical or surgical treatment for their
      disorder at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) according to current
      clinical practice. The overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to
      support our clinical training and research missions. Family members of children evaluated on
      this protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index
      case) may be enrolled in the genetic/DNA testing part of the protocol.
