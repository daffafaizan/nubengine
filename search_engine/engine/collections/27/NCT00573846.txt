      characteristics in patients with origins from the Indian sub-continent. Patients will be
      selected from the IBD registry maintained at respective institutions. Subjects from the
      Indian sub-continent will be identified using their country of birth, parents' ethnicity,
      number of years since leaving the country of birth, and number of years residing in the
      United States.

      Using both electronic and paper databases, demographic information regarding age, gender,
      body mass index, smoking history, dietary habits; medical history such as type of IBD, IBD
      symptoms, location and behavior, medication use (past and current), history of other
      autoimmune disorders; surgical history (IBD and non-IBD related); laboratory indices such as
      IBD serology, Thiopurinemethyltransferase (TPMT), and infliximab levels will be collected.

      Demographics will be compared between groups using descriptive statistics. Using univariate
      analysis, variables that are significantly different will be identified. Conditional logistic
      regression will then be performed to identify those clinical variables that are statistically
      significant.

      The study duration will be one year from IRB approval.
