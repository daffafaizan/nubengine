      extension and severity. Periodontal disease is considered the sixth complication of diabetes.
      There is a global epidemic of diabetes, including an increase of type 1 diabetes incidence in
      younger patients. Adjuvant treatments to scaling and root planing as antimicrobial
      photodynamic therapy show improved clinical outcomes. Thus, the aim of this randomized
      clinical trial is to evaluate adjuvant effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in
      periodontal treatment and salivary status of type 1 diabetes patients.
