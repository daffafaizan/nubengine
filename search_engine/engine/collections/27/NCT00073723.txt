    
      ABI-007, a unique protein formulation of paclitaxel, has been developed to reduce the
      toxicities associated with Taxol and Cremophor EL/ethanol vehicle while maintaining or
      improving the chemotherapeutic effect of the drug.

      The activity of ABI-007 in other malignancies is not yet well established. This open-label
      Phase I/II study is being conducted to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of ABI-007, and evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of
      ABI-007 in patients with advanced Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
