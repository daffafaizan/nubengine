      clinically significant anxiety or depression. In Phase I, the investigators will complete the
      development of a new treatment protocol (Unified Protocol for Smoking Cessation Treatment;
      UP-ST) that integrates current best practices of cognitive behavioral smoking cessation
      treatments and nicotine replacement therapy with the recently developed UP treatment protocol
      that has been shown to effectively treat both anxiety disorders and depression and to impact
      specific mechanisms (e.g., neuroticism) that are relevant to both smoking and
      anxiety/depression remission. In Phase II, 60 smokers with clinically significant anxiety or
      depression will be recruited and randomly assigned to either: (1) the UP-ST or (2) standard
      smoking cessation treatment (ST) based on the most recent clinical practice guideline from
      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The investigators will examine the UP-ST
      relative to ST on smoking, anxiety/depression, and mechanisms of change. Demonstrating that a
      single treatment protocol can effectively address both smoking and the complex emotional
      comorbidities that are widespread in smokers will provide a novel, impactful, and highly
      disseminable treatment option missing from today's smoking cessation arsenal.
