      Study. The study will involve three treatment groups. Eligible patients will be randomized to
      receive either FXFM244 - 1%, FXFM244 - 4% or Placebo, in a blinded fashion. Patients will be
      treated twice daily for 12 weeks. Following the screening period and baseline visit, study
      subjects will return at Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12. A follow up visit will take place at week 16.
      At each visit, patients will be evaluated via lesion count, global assessment tolerability
      and safety.
