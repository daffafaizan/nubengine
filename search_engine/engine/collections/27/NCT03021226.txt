      behaviors than the control group relative to the following:

        1. Improved healthy relationship and marriage skills.

        2. Improved co-parenting skills

        3. Increased frequency of father/child engagement

        4. Increased financial responsibility of fathers

        5. Progress toward a greater economic stability, including skill attainment and employment.

        6. Reduce recidivism?

      This reflects intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis where all participants who are enrolled and
      randomly assigned to treatment are included in the analysis regardless of their adherence
      with the entry criteria, regardless of subsequent withdrawal from treatment or deviation from
      the protocol. This will preserve the pragmatic balance generated by the original random
      treatment allocation.

      Also, "per protocol analysis" will be conducted to evaluate if full project participation
      results in more positive self-reported attitudes and behaviors than the control group
      participants.

      What personal characteristics and other external factors are related to achieving successful
      outcomes in the program?
