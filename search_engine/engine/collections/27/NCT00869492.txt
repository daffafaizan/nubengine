      in our country. Only a few studies on its use and effectiviness could be found in the
      literature. Nadifloxacin may be an alternative to other topical antibiotics and benzoyl
      peroxide or its use along with benzoyl peroxide may be more effective and rational to prevent
      possible future resistance.
