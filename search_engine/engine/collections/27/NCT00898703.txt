      Primary

        -  To compare peripheral blood (PB) concentrations of circulating endothelial cells (CEC)
           in women with measurable, active breast cancer to PB concentrations of CEC in a control
           population of women with a history of breast cancer who are currently without evidence
           of active disease.

      Secondary

        -  To compare in women with measurable breast cancer the relationship between PB
           concentrations of CEC prior to and at 3 and 6 weeks following initiation of a new
           chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, and correlate these values with clinical response to
           treatment to determine if CEC can be used as a tumor marker or indicator of disease
           burden.

        -  To compare PB concentrations of CEC to levels of plasma proteins associated with
           angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor, in women with active or a
           prior history of breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood and plasma samples are collected for analysis of circulating
      endothelial cells (CEC) and angiogenic growth factor levels. Blood samples from patients
      initiating a new chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer are collected at baseline
      and at 3 and 6 weeks following the start of treatment. CEC are quantified via flow cytometry
      and plasma angiogenic markers are assessed via ELISA.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients with active, measurable breast cancer and 100
      patients with a prior history of breast cancer will be accrued for this study.
