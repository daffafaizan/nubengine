      perioperative immunosupplementation on immune function following resection of pancreatic or
      periampullary adenocarcinoma. Two variations of immunosupplementation will be compared to
      control nutritional supplement containing whey protein with an additional teaspoon (tsp) of
      placebo oil. These variations will be 1) a powdered formula containing whey protein and
      arginine (Active A) with an additional tsp of lipid bolus containing omega-3 fatty acids, and
      2) a powdered formula containing whey protein and arginine (Active A) with an additional tsp
      of placebo oil which does not contain omega-3 fatty acids. The control nutritional supplement
      will be a powdered formula containing whey protein with an additional tsp of placebo oil.
