    
      Sphenoid sinus is located in the body of sphenoid bone, closed with a thin plate of bone
      tissue that separates it from the surrounding important structures such as the optic nerve,
      optic chiasm, cavernous sinus, pituitary gland, and internal carotid artery. Detailed,
      meticulous preoperative radiological study of sphenoid sinus variations as in Onodi cells
      (Sphenoethmoidal air cell) is an anatomical variant of the paranasal sinuses, important due
      to its close proximity to the optic nerve and internal carotid artery. , Pnumatization
      pattern as the extent of pneumatization is highly variable and potentially jeopardizing to
      surrounding vital structures , Septation pattern , Intercarotid distance (in millimeters),
      Bony covering of carotid artery, Bony covering of optic nerve.is the key to successful and
      safe functional endoscopic sinus surgery and transsphenoidal surgery. The purpose of the
      study is to delineate the sphenoid sinus radiologically using the multislice computed
      tomography and to decrease morbidity and mortality during skull base surgeries as the
      sphenoid sinus is one of the most variable of all sinuses and its relation to vital vascular
      and nervous elements make its approach a challenge for endoscopic surgeons
