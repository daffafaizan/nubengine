      method. Firstly, the cap added to the front of colonoscope can fully expose the operating
      field. Secondly, before or during the opportunity of CAES, endoscopist can perform endoscopic
      differentiation diagnosis (such as tumors, inflammatory bowel disease and others induced
      hematochezia), endoscopic therapy within lower-gut based on the same colon preparation, thus
      saving patients' medical cost, physical and mental pain. The last but not least, specially
      designed length of endoscopic injection needle (eg.10-20 mm) was used in CAES could be
      helpful for accurately controlling the injection angle, direction, depth under direct vision
      and to avoid iatrogenic injury due to ectopic injection.The core value of CAES for internal
      hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse is to provide precise therapy, reduce the iatrogenic
      injuries, avoid pain during and after therapy. Our pilot studies demonstrated that CAES based
      on long injection needle is an effective, safe, convenient operation technique. 100% of
      participants underwent CAES showed sustained clinical efficacy within the 3-month follow-up,
      with no severe or obvious complications related to CAES. However, the long-term efficacy and
      safety of CAES in the treatment of internal hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse need to be
      confirmed by further large sample real world studies.
