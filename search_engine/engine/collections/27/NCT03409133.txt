      stimulation device will send pulses to the electrodes. The participant will be asked what
      they feel, and to draw the location of any perceived sensation on schematic maps. A
      sensorized prosthesis will be worn and stimulation will be administered while the participant
      is engaging in various functional tasks, such as standing, walking or climbing stairs or with
      visual or mental distractions.
