      Tuberculosis and Malaria. But given all the international efforts geared to curing and
      containing these diseases, and with progress made in various countries, Sub-Saharan Africa is
      now heading into another type of epidemic, cardiovascular disease (CVD). Predicted statistics
      have shown that cardiovascular diseases will become the leading cause of death in developing
      countries within the next 10 to 15 years, however relatively few population-based studies
      have examined CVD in Africa .

      Although control of communicable ,childhood ,and maternal diseases has benefited from an
      international efforts on clinical care, policy and implementation,such large scale effort are
      lacking for CVD and have left both policymakers and individuals with decisions on health
      issues without adequate information.

      Prior to the commencement of the study,series of community meetings and focus groups
      discussions will be held to identify ways to enhance participation. An extensive examination
      will include a series of questionnaires dealing with lifestyle habits, medical history,
      social and cultural factors, physical assessments which include height, weight,central blood
      pressure assessment of arterial stiffness and autonomic function and laboratory measurements
      for cholesterol, other lipids, glucose ,c-reactive protein among others.
