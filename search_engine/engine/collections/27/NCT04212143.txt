        1. Using an oscillometric blood pressure monitor, the investigators aim to non-invasively
           obtain the central blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV), or arterial stiffness,
           of children with kidney disease.

        2. Measure oscillometric central blood pressure and PWV in age and race matched healthy
           children.

        3. Measure PWV by standard arterial tonometry method in a subset of patients, and compare
           these measurements to the PWV measured using the oscillometric device.

        4. Measure body composition of patients and controls (Body Mass Index, Waist-to-Height
           ratio, %body fat, and mid-arm muscle circumference) to see how this relates to central
           blood pressure and PWV.
