      United States, Americans have yet to widely adopt evidence-based dietary modifications
      necessary to reduce CVD risk factors. Encouraging evidence from the Prevención con Dieta
      Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial indicates that adding olive oil and nuts to the diets of older
      adults in Spain substantially impacted CVD risk factors and events.

      A large trial testing EVOO and nuts in a U.S. population is needed to determine if
      supplementing with EVOO and nuts can reduce risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in
      adults living in the U.S. Prior to launching a large trial, it is important to assess whether
      adults 55 and older would be interested in participating in a supplementation trial such as
      PREDIMED. Additionally, it is important to assess if they are willing to consume the nuts and
      EVOO and attend study related-data collection visits.
