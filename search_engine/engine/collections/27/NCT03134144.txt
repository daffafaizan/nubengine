        -  Standing without the exoskeleton

        -  Sitting with the exoskeleton

      For both experimental conditions, the working height was adjusted to the individual to become
      optimal. The working distance to the simulated assembly tasks was also adjusted to the
      individual to become optimal. Both the working height and distance were based on textual
      guidelines provided in DIN EN ISO 14738:2009-07.

      Each work cycle consisted of assembling and disassembling the following three tasks:

        -  Screwing

        -  Clip fitting

        -  Cable mounting

      In addition, we investigated suboptimal working heights and distances. The results of these
      suboptimal conditions will not be reported in the results on this website, but in a separate
      publication.
