      Treated by Watchful Waiting" study, referred to as the TAPG study. It is a retrospective
      population-based tissue sample study in men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer
      1990-2006, inclusively. Initially the cohort comprised men diagnosed with prostate cancer
      with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and needle biopsies 1990-1996, but was
      expanded from 2005 to include men diagnosed with prostate cancer 1990 - 2006. Data was
      collected from six regional cancer registries and eligibility was confirmed via hospital
      sites, which sent the relevant tissue samples to the TAPG Central Coordinating Office (CCO).
      Selection of eligible patients for the study completed in 2010. Since this year the TAPG CCO
      has been collecting cancer registration and mortality updates on the cohort members from
      regional cancer registries.
