    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate of patients with Multiple
      Myeloma to the combination of Daratumumab, Ixazomib, Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone.

      The drugs being used in this study are daratumumab ixazomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone.
      Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer by interfering with proteasomes (the protein breakdown
      mechanism in the cells). Pomalidomide, and dexamethasone are standard drugs that can change
      and regulate the immune system and may stop cancer cells from growing. Both Ixazomib and
      Daratumumab are approved for use in Multiple Myeloma, but not in this combination.
