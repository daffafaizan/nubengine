      PICU. However, research suggests that some children will go on to develop psychological
      difficulties, such as problems with emotions, behaviour, and learning. In addition, parents
      themselves may suffer with emotional difficulties. Although the follow-up of survivors is
      recommended, there are currently no specific guidelines in place. Intervention in the early
      stages of recovery could help families pull through without long lasting after-effects.
