    
      This is a 2-stage food effect (timing of the meal) study. A total of 48 subjects will be
      dosed if Stage 2 is conducted.

      Stage 1 will be conducted as an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study. On Day 1 of
      each period, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of entinostat under fasting or fed
      conditions.

      If preliminary results in Stage 1 indicate that the timing of a meal exhibits significant
      effect on the bioavailability of entinostat, then Stage 2 will be conducted which will
      investigate the effect of a meal either before or after dosing of entinostat on entinostat
      PK.

      Stage 2 will be conducted as an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study. On Day 1 of
      each period, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of entinostat under fasting or fed
      conditions.
