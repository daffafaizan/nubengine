      3D movements of both proximal and distal arm joints. Combined with an audiovisual display,
      this device allows virtual training of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and therapeutic
      gaming. A patient-responsive controller enables the assistance of the device only as needed.
      Chronic stroke patients (>6 months post stroke) will be randomly assigned to either an
      experimental or a control group. The experimental group will perform task-related intensive
      therapy with the support of ARMin. Therapists will treat the patients of the control group
      with standard motor relearning therapy.
