      bucco-lingual (BL) alveolar bone width (<4 mm) were included in the study. Patients received
      autogenous cortical plates (ACP) of either porcine xenogeneic (XCP). The aforementioned
      groups were compared in regards to bone augmentation using General Estimating Equations (GEE)
      and logistic regression. Demographic data, trabecular bone density, graft site, postoperative
      pain, and time consuming were also analyzed
