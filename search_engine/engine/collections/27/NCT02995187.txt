      etoposide(CE)and second-line therapy with topotecan has been given, patients with extensive
      small cell lung cancer(ED-SCLC) still relapse and 2-year survival is less than 10%. There is
      no standard treatment recommendation for this group of patients who failed to second-line
      therapy and had good performance status. Apatinib has been approved as a second-line
      treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell
      lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less
      toxic side effects and better patient tolerance. However, the clinical application of
      apatinib in small cell lung cancer is still lack of evidence-based medicine. And this
      clinical trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib
      in recurrent SCLC patients in our center.
