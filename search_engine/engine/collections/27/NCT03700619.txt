      intrauterine growth retardation, antenatal or postnatal steroid use, breastfeeding, cerebral
      injuries and socio-economic status. After a couple of weeks, parents are contacted by a study
      manager, by phone call, to collect parental consent and answer some parental questions. After
      consent collect, BRIEF questionnaires are sending. If they wish, parents could give the BRIEF
      teacher questionnaire to the mean teacher. Teachers send by themselves their response. An
      informatic version is available with a personal link given especially by mail for each child.

      domains: behavior and metacognition. Twenty minutes are necessary to complete questionnaire.
      In case of no questionnaire return after one month, parents are contacted by phone. The
      investigators hypothesize a lost to follow-up at 0.25 and no response at 0.35. The response
      expected is 300 questionnaires.
