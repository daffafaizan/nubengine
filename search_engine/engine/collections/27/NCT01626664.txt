      with shorter survival compared with CCR4-negative patients. KW-0761, a monoclonal antibody
      targeted to CCR4, has been shown to be safe and tolerable in several clinical trials in
      subjects with a variety of T-cell malignancies, including ATL, mycosis fungoides and SÃ©zary
      syndrome. The objective of this study is to estimate the overall response rate of KW-0761 for
      subjects with relapsed or refractory ATL.
