    
      Participants (parents of 16-23 year old teens and young adults, high school and college
      students 16-23 years old, and health care professionals for 16-23 year olds) will be asked to
      share their thoughts on the completeness of nationally recommended and publicly available
      MenB vaccine educational materials in addressing hesitations to receipt of the MenB vaccine.
      There is no risk in discussing reactions to educational materials. The biggest risk is
      disclosure of information provided in the study which will be reactions to health-promotion
      material.
