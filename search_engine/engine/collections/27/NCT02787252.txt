      patients will receive a Freedom SCS System. Subjects will have chronic, intractable pain of
      the trunk and/or lower limbs refractory to standard medical treatment; including unilateral
      or bilateral pain. Stimulators will be placed in the epidural space and over exiting nerve
      roots at vertebrae levels:

      A. Bilateral T9-T10 epidural; B. Bilateral L1-L4 epidural. All Patients will be treated below
      perception threshold with High Frequency settings (10.000 Hz, 30 Î¼s).
