      the ability to target patients outside the normal treatment window is wanted.

      Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) treatment has long been recognised as a treatment of patients
      with global ischemia following caridac arrest.

      This trial is designed to address the safty and feasibility of TH in acute stroke patients.

      Patients arriving in our stroke ward are observed for 3 hours. Only non-remitting patients
      are allowed into the trial.

      Patients are randomized to either therapeutic hypothermia with endovascular catheter +
      nasopharyngeal induction or endovascular catheter alone in the intensive care unit (ICU) (in
      Copenhagen, Denmark) or intravenous cold saline infusion followed by surface cooling (in
      Malm√∏, Sweden)versus standard treatment in a stoke unit.

      Patients brought to the ICU are sedated and mechanically ventilated.

      Therapeutic hypothermia is induced with a endovascular catether and a nasopharyngeal
      catheter. Body temperature is lowered to 33 degrees and sustained for a period of 24 hours.
