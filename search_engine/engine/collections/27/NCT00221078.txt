      contractions. If the muscle contractions are sequenced properly one can generate various
      functions such as grasping, standing, and walking. Recent studies of others and our pilot
      study indicate that a neuroprosthesis can be successfully applied as a training device to
      help stroke patients who have hemiplegic arm to relearn how to reach and grasp various
      objects. The objective of this research program is to confirm these preliminary results with
      the broader population of stroke patients, and if successful to propose a method to introduce
      this rehabilitation treatment into Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Stroke Unit as a primary
      intervention for hand function recovery. Specifically, our aim is to1)develop an exercise
      protocol that uses a neuroprosthesis for reaching and grasping developed by our team in
      combination with the standard physiotherapy treatments to enhance recovery of hemiplegic arm
      and hand; and 2) assess qualitatively and quantitatively improvements in the reaching and
      grasping functions achieved with standard rehabilitation treatment.
