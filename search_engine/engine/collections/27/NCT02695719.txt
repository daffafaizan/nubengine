      treat people who have chronic idiopathic constipation. This study will look at the frequency
      of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in people who take lubiprostone compared to placebo.

      The study will enroll 150 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) equally to one of the two treatment groups, which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Lubiprostone 24 Î¼g

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule with breakfast and one capsule with dinner
      each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record each time they have a
      SBM and all details of each SBM (including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty
      they have in passing it) in a diary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea. The overall time to participate in
      this study is 8 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
