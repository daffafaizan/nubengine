      anesthesia literature, aim 1 is to obtain preliminary data regarding quantity of mean
      morphine equivalents received by control and experimental groups for an initial subset of 50
      patients to improve sample size calculation and better power the study.

      Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of ED performed ultrasound guided ESP block in delivering analgesia
      by evaluating difference in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) as well as pain scores
      during ED stay and hospital admission between the experimental and control groups.

      Aim 3: Evaluate adverse event rates related to ultrasound guided ESP block placement as well
      as rates of rib-fracture related complications between control and experimental groups.
