      Auditory stimulation during pregnancy has been found to influence foetal behaviour with a
      potential of being carried forward to neonatal period. This study evaluated the effect of
      ante-natal music exposure to primigravida healthy mothers on the behaviour of their term
      appropriate-for-date newborns assessed using Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
      (BNBAS).

      Methods:

      This was a single centre, randomized, open-label controlled trial. Primigravida mothers aged
      19-29 years, free of chronic medical diseases or significant deafness, with singleton
      pregnancy, with a gestation of 20 weeks or less were randomized to listen to a pre-recorded
      music cassette for approximately 1 hour/day in addition to standard ante-natal care
      (intervention arm) or standard care only (control arm). Peri-natal factors with adverse
      effect on neonatal behaviour were deemed as protocol violations. Outcome measure included
      scores on 7 clusters of BNBAS. Primary analysis was per protocol.

      Results:

      One hundred and 26 newborns in the music group and 134 in the control group were subjected to
      BNBAS assessment. The infants born to mothers exposed to music during pregnancy performed
      significantly better on 5 of the 7 BNBAS clusters. The maximal beneficial effect was seen
      with respect to orientation (ES 1.13, 95% CI 0.82-1.44, p<0.0001) and habituation (ES 1.05,
      95% CI 0.53-1.57, p=0.0001).

      Conclusion:

      Music exposure to mother during pregnancy significantly influences neonatal behaviour.
