      primary and metastatic liver cancer. Animal studies have demonstrated that RF can fully
      ablate lung tumors in animal models. We set up a prospective study to evaluate the local
      efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of lung neoplasms with a minimal follow-up of one year.
      The primary endpoint was to determine the rate of incomplete local treatment at 1 year. The
      secondary endpoints were to evaluate tolerance, survival, disease-free survival and lung
      tumor-free survival. Patients are followed-up by CT scan examination at day 1 or 2 before
      discharge from the hospital, then at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months and then at 2 years
