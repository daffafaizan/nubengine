      efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in qualified patients with Alport syndrome. The Phase 2
      portion of the trial will be open-label and enroll up to 30 patients. The Phase 3 portion of
      the trial will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and will enroll up to 180
      patients.

      Patients in the Phase 2 cohort will receive bardoxolone methyl throughout the study. Patients
      in the Phase 3 cohort will be randomized 1:1 to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo and
      randomization will be stratified by baseline albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). Patients
      randomized to placebo will remain on placebo throughout the study, undergoing sham titration.

      All patients in the study will follow the same visit and assessment schedule. Following
      randomization on Day 1, patients will be scheduled to be assessed during treatment at Weeks
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 52, 64, 76, 88, 100, and 104 and by telephone contact on Days
      3, 10, 21, 31, 38, and 45. Patients will not receive study drug during a 4-week withdrawal
      period between Weeks 48 and 52. They will re-start treatment at Week 52 at the same dose they
      received at Week 48 and will continue study drug treatment through Week 100. Patients will
      also be scheduled to be assessed at an in person follow up visit at Week 104, four weeks
      after the end of treatment.
