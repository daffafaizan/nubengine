      minor surgical procedure and are inseminated with sperm in order to create embryos. The
      insemination process can be via standard IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI.)
      Standard IVF is the process of placing thousands of sperm in a culture dish with one or more
      eggs and allowing them to interact on their own. ICSI is the process by which one sperm is
      directly injected into each egg.

      Prior to using the sperm for insemination, a semen sample is processed and washed in order to
      obtain the healthiest sperm. A standard sperm preparation procedure is density gradient, in
      which the sperm is spun via centrifugation and separated from the seminal fluid. An alternate
      method is via microfluidics, by which the sperm swim up a microfluidic gradient created by a
      microporous filter between two chambers of a device. Sperm that are capable of navigating
      through this filter and reaching the end chamber are presumed to be the healthiest sperm.
      There is some data revealing that ZyMot microfluidics yields healthier sperm compared to the
      density gradient technique.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate whether good quality embryo formation is any different
      following insemination with sperm separated by microfluidics compared to density gradient.

      On the day of oocyte retrieval, the sperm sample will be split between the two different
      processing methods: density gradient and ZyMot microfluidics. In the event that there are 6
      or more mature oocytes and ICSI will be used for insemination, half of the oocytes will be
      inseminated with sperm processed by density gradient and half with sperm processed by ZyMot
      microfluidics. The percentage of good quality embryo formation will be compared between the
      two groups.
