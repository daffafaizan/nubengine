      atherosclerotic vascular disease. Cardiac and cerebrovascular adverse events and progression
      of atherosclerosis are, indeed, reduced in proportion to the achieved LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)
      levels.In addition, regression of atherosclerotic plaques with optimal LLT has been observed.
      However, optimal LLT with statin and ezetimibe, might be limited by the onset of adverse
      effects (i.e. disabling myalgias, diarrhea) with are usually dose -dependent, and the maximum
      tolerated statin dose might be insufficient to reach the recommended LDL-C goals. The advent
      of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) has allowed the
      achievement of very low LDL-C levels, and the fulfillment of the recommended LDL-C targets.
      However, while the experience with PCSK9i in patients with coronary artery disease has been
      wide, and coronary plaque regression has been documented, little is known regarding carotid
      plaque regression following therapy with PCSK9i. Only a few case reports have been published,
      and no observational study has been carried out so far. Furthermore, morphological carotid
      plaque stabilization has a prognostic role, and the possibility of its early achievement with
      PCSK9i may be relevant, especially in the context of percutaneous or surgical carotid
      interventions.
