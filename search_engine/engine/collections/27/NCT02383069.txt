      tolerance. Thus, the treatment of these individuals should be extended to pulmonary
      rehabilitation. Randomized clinical trials have shown interesting results, whether in
      cardiopulmonary conditions, quality of life or in the number of crises, after applying
      pulmonary rehabilitation program in asthmatic children and adolescents. In a systematic
      review on physical training with asthmatic children and adolescents the authors concluded
      that physical activity should be recommended to this population, although some issues have
      not yet been clarified due to limitations in the clinical trial. The control of the disease
      has not been evaluated by specific questionnaires in any study. The assessment of
      inflammatory markers was rarely addressed and the same occurred in the quality of life after
      physical training. In addition, it is possible to question the intensity and frequency of
      training, factors that can significantly contribute to the intervention results. All these
      information let us know that is necessary a randomized control trial to answer questions
      about physical characteristics, quality of life, inflammatory markers, and muscles strength.
