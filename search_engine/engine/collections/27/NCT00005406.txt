      Epidemiologic studies of coronary risk factors have been performed primarily in populations
      of middle-aged adults, children, and adolescents. Relatively little is known about these risk
      factors in men and women 20-29 years of age.

      This study provided important insights into the determinants of coronary heart disease risk
      factors in young adults and bolstered the argument of those who favor the early
      identification of and intervention in the young coronary candidate.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Three cross-sectional examinations had been carried out: 1) 1972-1973; 2) 1980-1981; and 3)
      1988-1989. The study examined the predictors of change in total cholesterol (from examination
      1 to examination 3, and change in LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides between examinations 2 and
      3. It also investigated the stability in several health habits and behaviors such as
      cigarette smoking, alcohol use, adherence to a low fat/low cholesterol diet, and physical
      activity. Weight gain and oral contraceptive use had been shown in previous analyses to be
      strong predictors of several lipids and lipoproteins.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
