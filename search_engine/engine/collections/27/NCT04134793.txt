      atrial fibrillation (AF), changes in plasmamiRNA expression in pre-and
      post-operativeAFpatients who have received catheterisation . The correlation of atrial
      fibrillation recurrence and above-mentioned microRNA after bipolar radiofrequency ablation
      remain poorly characterized.

      This study aimed to reveal disease-related biomarkers by detecting plasmamiRNA expression in
      AF patients, and examining the levels of AF-specific miRNAs in patients after bipolar
      radiofrequency ablation, in order to help gauge therapeutic effects and assess prognosis.

      A total of 50 Han Chinese patients with AF who had received bipolar radiofrequency ablation
      recruited to the study. Atrial fibrillation-specific plasma miRNAs were detected by
      sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. According to AF
      recurrence rate of about 30%, the expression levels of AF-specific miRNAs were investigated
      in15 post-operative AF patients and 35 patients with normal sinus after ablation,to explore
      changes in miRNA expression.
