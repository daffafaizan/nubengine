    
      A prospective follow-up was arranged for the 18 pregnant women with excessive iodine status.
      History of iodine exposure (including hysterosalpingography (HSG) using an oil-soluble
      iodinated contrast medium, examination by computed tomography scan with contrast,
      administration of amiodarone, history of receiving radioiodine therapy, etc.) was collected
      from all participants. Evaluation of dietary iodine intake was performed through a 72-hour
      dietary recall.The serum iodine concentration (SIC) and urinary iodine concentration (UIC)
      were monitored continuously in the whole course of pregnancy. All subjects with excessive
      iodine load were recommended by nutritionists to have their dietary iodine intake restricted,
      and resume iodine-containing supplements and foods until the UIC<250 μg/L and SIC≤90 μg/L.
      After delivery, maternal colostrum iodine concentration and neonatal iodine status (including
      neonatal UIC, condition of congenital hypothyroidism screening tests, and thyroid physical
      examination) were also assessed.
