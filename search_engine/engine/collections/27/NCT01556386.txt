      relapse are remaining problem in ALL treatment. One of the explanations of drug resistance
      and toxicities is the pharmacogenetic effect. Germline polymorphisms in genes that code for
      proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents are
      various, and inter-patient variability is the main factor for pharmacogenetic difference.
      Since multiple chemotherapeutic agents are involved in treating ALL, many genes related to
      the metabolic pathways of those drugs have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of patients with
      ALL. In Korea, pharmacogenetic study including multiple genetic loci for pediatric ALL has
      not been reported.In this study, the distribution of genetic polymorphisms and genes related
      to antileukemic drugs were analyzed, and their relations to the outcome of treatment and
      relapse rates were assessed.
