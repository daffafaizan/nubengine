      anaesthesia. It is proposed that using music played on noise cancelling headphones will
      reduce the requirements for intravenous sedation in a randomised controlled trial of twenty
      patients. Spinal anaesthesia is commonly used for knee replacement. It provides loss of
      feeling from the operated limb but the patient remains awake. Orthopaedic surgery is very
      noisy. It is usual for patients to receive intravenous sedation with midazolam to reduce
      their awareness of surgery. Intravenous midazolam is effective but it depresses both the
      breathing and the circulation and may cause low blood pressure and reduced oxygenation. It is
      expected that by using noise cancelling headphones to reduce the awareness of noise during
      surgery, there will be a reduced requirement for intravenous midazolam. The study will
      measure the dose of midazolam required by patients randomised to receive either noise
      cancelling headphones playing music (intervention) or no headphones (control group). Patients
      will be followed up prior to hospital discharge to assess their awareness and recall of intra
      operative events and their satisfaction with intravenous sedation. This is a novel
      application of sound reducing technology capable of improving the patient experience during
      surgery whilst potentially reducing complications of intravenous midazolam sedation. Noise
      cancelling technology is readily available in commercially available headphones and it has
      the potential to eliminate background noise of surgical procedures. This study findings will
      be of interest for health professionals and patients involved in surgery or investigative
      procedures normally carried out with intravenous sedation.
