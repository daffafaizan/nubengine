      ketamine together, at a high enough dose to induce general anesthesia (make study
      participants "fall asleep"). During one visit participants will receive only sevoflurane;
      during another visit participants will be given both sevoflurane and ketamine together. The
      investigators will record EEG the entire time. The investigators will also ask some questions
      related to pain and cognitive function.
