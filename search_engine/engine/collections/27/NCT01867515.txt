      involves prospective data collection from three types of listeners. The experimental
      listeners will be people with sensorineural hearing loss and the control listeners will
      either be subjects with normal hearing or normal-hearing listeners for whom hearing loss will
      be simulated through the use of a spectrally-shaped broadband noise. The tasks of the
      subjects in this study involve either listening to synthesized sounds over earphones while
      seated comfortably in a sound-treated booth, and making responses indicating the subject's
      auditory perception of these sounds by touching specific areas on a touch-screen terminal;
      or, listening to recorded, acoustically modified syllables, words, or sentences over
      earphones and making responses indicating the subject's identification.
