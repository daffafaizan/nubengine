      patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic lesions not eligible for surgical resection,
      transplantation, or local ablative therapy. Among the various options of transarterial
      therapy including chemoembolization (TACE), bland embolization, radioembolization, and TEA,
      chemoembolization is the only one that has been proven to be of survival benefits versus best
      supportive care in randomized controlled trials. TEA is a hybrid of bland embolization and
      chemical ablation. Utilizing a liquid agent of Lipiodol-ethanol mixture consisting of 33%
      ethanol by volume, TEA offers complete and long lasting embolization of both the arterioles
      and portal venules supplying the tumor and could possibly be more effective than particulate
      embolic agents in tumor vessel embolization. The component of ethanol very likely offers
      synergistic effect to embolization and causes tumor ablation.
