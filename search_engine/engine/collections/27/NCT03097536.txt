      trigger migraine and can provide analgesia. This information will provide a vital basis for
      the mechanism of migraine and offer insights into better treatments as well as prevention.

      This is a pilot unblinded randomized trial with two independent components, Aims 1 and 2. It
      is not possible to blind the current protocol both in terms of the blood sugar readings and
      the luna bar, non-luna bar intervention.
