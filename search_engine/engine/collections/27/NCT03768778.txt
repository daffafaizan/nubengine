      mortality may be caused by hemorrhages, major vascular injury or contusions; while epileptic
      seizures and infections are among the possible complications in later stages. Complete
      excision of the foreign object should be done for all patients and any dural and/or vascular
      injuries should be repaired during surgical treatment.

      Neurological level, hemodynamic and respiratory status at hospital admission, type of
      penetrating the object, pupil size, and reactivity, as the CT findings, all these factors
      will affect the prognosis so they should be evaluated carefully before the decision of the
      line of management. Intracranial infection, CSF leak and recurrent attacks of convulsions are
      the most common complications.

      Our goal in this study to report cases with non-missile penetrating head injuries and
      evaluate the possible predictive factors in a series of 18 patients sustaining penetrating
      head injuries, admitted to our hospital over a period of 2 years, to be used as a guide for
      the surgical management.
