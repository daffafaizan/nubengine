      effect on satiety as the same volume of a reference normal energy foam, by testing for
      equivalence of these two foams. Treatment equivalence, is met if the 90% confidence interval
      (CI) of between-treatment differences in appetite AUC is within the range of -5 to +5 mm/min
      of the reference . Two other normal energy foams with slightly different compositions are
      also compared to the reference foam to test for possible effects of differences in
      composition (carbohydrate type, emulsifier) other than energy per se.

      On each test day, volunteers will arrive at the clinic in a fasted state where they consume a
      standardized 250 kcal breakfast. Subjects receive one of the four test products 2.5 hours
      after start of breakfast and consume 400 ml of the test products with a spoon within 10
      minutes. Each subject will be randomized to a treatment order according to a balanced
      (Williams type) design, and receive one of four test products each week for 4 weeks,
      separated by a one-week washout period (consumed on the same week day).
