      mg (hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg/ promethazine 12.5 mg), hydrocodone 5 mg/
      acetaminophen 325 mg, or placebo under double-blind conditions. Over 48 hours they will use
      the assigned study medication and assess pain intensity, nausea, and vomiting. Uses of
      supplementary analgesic and antiemetic medications will be documented. Patient responses and
      adverse effects will also be documented during the 5-day outpatient period, too.
