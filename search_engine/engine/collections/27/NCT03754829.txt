      of mentally ill patients, lack of psychologists and inadequate psychosocial and
      rehabilitation options for patients and their relatives are important prohibiting factors
      that reduce patients' outreach for getting help. While depression is highly prevalent (4.4%),
      only a small number of people seek professional help (18%) in Turkey. Innovative solutions
      are needed to overcome this treatment gap. Online Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) is a brief
      intervention proven to be effective in the treatment of depression, although little is known
      about its clinical effects in Turkey.

      The aim of this study is to test the clinical effects of a web and mobile application of PST
      for depressive symptoms among the general population in Turkey.

      Participants will be recruited through announcements in social media and the Middle East
      Technical University. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 444 participants
      randomized across three groups will be utilized. The first experimental group will receive
      direct access to the web version of the intervention; the second experimental group will
      receive direct access to the mobile app of the intervention as well as automated supportive
      text messages based on PST. The control group consists of a wait-list and for ethical
      reasons, participants in this group will gain access to the intervention (either web or
      mobile application) four months after the baseline. The intervention is based on an existing
      PST for the Turkish population, "Her Sey Kontrol Altinda" (HSKA).
