    
      Trans rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy remains the standard for prostate
      cancer diagnosis. However, the standard protocols miss 15 to 30% of cancers, leading to a
      variable number of repeat biopsies.

      In 2005 the Vienna nomogram was introduced, defining the number of cores to be obtained in a
      prostate biopsy in relation to age and prostate volume in patients with a serum PSA level of
      2-10 ng/mL.

      The objective of the study is to determine if the Vienna nomogram increases the detection
      rate of trans rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies, compared to a 10-core biopsy.

      This prospective randomized study enrolled men eligible for a prostate biopsy were randomized
      to a Vienna nomogram protocol or a 10-core protocol. They were further stratified according
      to age (≤65; >65 and ≤70; >70 years) and prostate volume (≤30; >30 and ≤50; >50 and ≤70; >70
      cc).

      A subgroup analysis for patients with serum PSA values between 2 and 10 ng/mL was performed.
