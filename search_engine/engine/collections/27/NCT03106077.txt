    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. Determine if mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single agent is likely to induce response
           in at least 20% of patients with metastatic folate receptor (FR) alpha+ triple negative
           breast cancer (TNBC).

        -  II. Determine if mirvetuximab soravtansine as a single agent in the neoadjuvant setting
           will improve rates of excellent pathologic response (pathologic complete response
           [pCR]/residual cancer burden [RCB]-0 or RCB-I) from 5% to 20% in patients with high
           risk, chemotherapy insensitive, FRalpha+ TNBC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. Determine the radiographic response rate as measured by ultrasound and/ or magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) (partial response + complete clinical response) for mirvetuximab
           soravtansine in chemotherapy insensitive, FRalpha

           + localized TNBC or using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
           in patients with FRalpha+ advanced TNBC.

        -  II. Determine toxicity of 4 cycles of mirvetuximab soravtansine given in the neoadjuvant
           setting following anthracycline based therapy (Cohort B) and unrestricted cycles in
           patients receiving therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting (Cohort A).

        -  III. Determine disease free survival (DFS) at 3 years for patients treated with
           mirvetuximab soravtansine given in the neoadjuvant setting; progression free survival
           (PFS), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival at 3 years (overall survival [OS]
           at 3 years) in patients receiving therapy for advanced/ metastatic TNBC.

        -  IV. Compare disease response (as measured by pCR/RCB-I) in patients with FRalpha+
           chemotherapy resistant disease treated on clinical trial with mirvetuximab soravtansine
           in the neoadjuvant setting to those with similar molecular features who receive standard
           taxane-based chemotherapy as the second phase of their NACT.
