      AML patients. The SIERRA trial has a primary endpoint of durable Complete Remission (dCR) at
      six months and a secondary endpoint of overall survival following randomization to Iomab-B,
      as well as Event-Free Survival. Iomab-B is intended to prepare and condition patients for a
      bone marrow transplant, also referred to as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in a
      potentially safer and more efficacious manner than intensive chemotherapy conditioning that
      is the current standard of care in bone marrow transplant conditioning.
