      acute respiratory failure requiring orotracheal intubation in intensive care units. The
      results suggest that high flow oxygen could be superior to bag reservoir face mask in term of
      occurrence of severe hypoxemia during the intubation procedure.

      At the present time its use for preoxygenation before the induction of general anaesthesia in
      operating room has never been evaluated in term of end tidal oxygen fraction which is the
      gold standard measurement ensuring that the functional residual capacity has been filled with
      oxygen.

      We planned a randomised cross over study in healthy volunteers studying efficacy and
      tolerance of preoxygenation using spontaneous ventilation with 100% inhaled oxygen through a
      face mask connected to the anaesthesia machine and preoxygenation using high flow nasal
      cannula oxygen (60l/min).
