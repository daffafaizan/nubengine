      their surgery and will be randomized to either have the epidural placed with a loss of
      resistance technique alone or loss of resistance technique with confirmation by nerve
      stimulation. In the traditional loss of resistance technique group, the epidural catheter
      will be placed after achieving loss of resistance to air. In the electrical stimulation
      group, following the location of the epidural space with a loss of resistance technique
      (using air), nerve stimulation will be utilized to elicit a myotomal contraction of the
      abdominal or thoracic wall. Nerve stimulation will be started at a pulse width of 0.3 ms and
      a frequency of 1 Hz and a current of 0.2mA.
