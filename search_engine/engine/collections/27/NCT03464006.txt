      patient-centred approach to assist in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) self-management in
      home and work environments, in collaboration with patient circles of care (patients,
      care-givers, physicians, and allied healthcare professionals). This program involves online
      modules tailored to the needs of specific patients and diseases, oriented to education,
      training, monitoring, and continuing support for lifestyle changes (smoking cessation,
      exercise, healthy diets, weight loss, etc.) and psycho-social needs such as social isolation
      and loneliness. The investigators have tested an online desk-top version for over 30
      out-patients with PAD at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The investigators propose to test
      its ability for improved outcomes and healthcare quality of life through a multi-centre
      randomized controlled trial for PAD and a frequently co-occurring chronic illness, high blood
      pressure.
