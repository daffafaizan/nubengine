      surgery, the efficacy and safety of perioperative pain care organized by ComfortSafe Pyramid
      approaches will be evaluated. In addition, patient satisfaction with this care will be
      evaluated. Post-operative pain and opioid-related outcomes will be operationalized using
      standardized symptom (nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, confusion, acute and chronic
      pain) severity measures, prn analgesic (opioid and non-opioid) consumption, and urine
      toxicology. Together, these original data will have important implications for the clinical
      management of post-operative pain utilizing opioid-sparing and multi-modal approaches.

      A total of 60 self-selected surgical patients will be enrolled in the study, 20 undergoing
      breast surgery, 20 undergoing caesarian-section, and 20 undergoing abdominal surgery. All
      will receive anesthesia and pain management consistent with the ComfortSafe Pyramid which
      emphasizes opioid-sparing and multimodal approaches. Side and adverse opioid-related effects
      and post-operative pain will be assessed at regular intervals during the immediate
      post-operative period (24 hours). To evaluate the incidence of opioid misuse/abuse and the
      development of chronic pain, an opioid use history, urine toxicology and Brief Pain Inventory
      will be collected at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months following discharge. Patient satisfaction
      measures will be obtained at discharge, 1 month, and 3 months follow-up timepoint.
