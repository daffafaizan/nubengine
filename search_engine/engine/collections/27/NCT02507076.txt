      I. This prospective trial will evaluate total response rate, including complete and partial
      response, in patients with unresectable extremity melanoma (or other skin cancer including
      but not limited to Merkel cell carcinoma) or soft tissue sarcoma treated with
      hyperthermic-isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with melphalan.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the technical parameters including achievement of regional hyperthermia,
      arterial blood gas (ABG), tourniquet time, and their association with tumor response.

      II. To evaluate time to recurrence and progression free survival (PFS) for patients with
      advanced extremity melanoma or sarcoma who achieved complete response after treatment with
      ILP with melphalan.

      III. To evaluate overall survival rate and duration of survival for patients with advanced
      melanoma or sarcoma limited to extremity undergoing ILP with melphalan.

      IV. To assess quality of life (QOL) score for patients undergoing ILP with melphalan.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ILP with melphalan intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then periodically thereafter.
