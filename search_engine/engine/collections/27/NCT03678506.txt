    
      This prospective cohort study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a management
      procedure to decide on giving or not an extended anticoagulation (administering apixaban 2
      2.5 mg twice daily ) to outpatients with a single episode of proximal deep vein thrombosis of
      the lower limbs and/or pulmonary embolism who had received 12-15 months of anticoagulation
      (whatever the anticoagulant drug used). The study seeks to assess whether a management
      procedure involving D-dimer testing assessment can identify a subset of subjects at low risk
      of recurrence in whom an extended anticoagulation can be safely avoided.
