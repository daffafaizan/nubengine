      factors and promotes adaptive eating attitudes and behaviors. It has three central tenets: 1)
      unconditional permission to eat when hungry, 2) eating for physical rather than emotional
      reasons, and 3) eating according to hunger and satiety cues. Intuitive Eating has ten
      principles that focus on rejecting the dieting mentality, honoring hunger cues, decreasing
      restrictive behaviors that lead to deprivation and bingeing, challenging rigid food rules,
      increasing awareness of satiety, discovering the satisfaction of food, coping with emotions
      without food, respecting and accepting one's body, using exercise as self-care, and balancing
      nutrition with satisfaction.
