      comatose. The longer it lasts, the lower chances of recovery. The evaluation of the
      neurological prognosis of these patients is an important issue. Indeed, 72% of patients
      admitted to an intensive care unit after resuscitation from CA will give rise to an ethical
      discussion with the family. The prognostication strategy is usually based on a multimodal
      process involving clinical examination, electro-neurophysiological and biological
      examinations. We plan to study the relevance of early neurological prognostic tests in the
      aftermath of CA and in particular the most recent techniques such as the use of a clinical
      score (CAHP for Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis), automated infrared pupillometry
      (NEUROLIGHT ALGISCAN, IDMED) for pupillary reflex measurement and quantitative analysis of
      the continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) BRAIN QUICK ICU LINE,
      MICROMED. These new prognostic criteria for CA (CAHP score, pupillometry and aEEG) developed
      separately have not yet been integrated into a multimodal strategy.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of CAHP score, infrared automated
      pupillometry and aEEG to predict as early as 24h from ROSC the neurological prognosis
      (Cerebral Performance Categories) at hospital discharge.
