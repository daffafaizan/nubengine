    
      We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy of an
      ACE-inhibitor (perindopril) or a beta blocker (bisoprolol) for the prevention of LV
      remodeling among women with early breast cancer scheduled for chemotherapy and one year of
      trastuzumab. Participants will undergo cardiac MRI at baseline and 3 and 12 months, replacing
      the usual MUGA, as well as a post-treatment cardiac MRI at 24 months to evaluate long-term
      effect.
