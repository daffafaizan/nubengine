    
      In response to RFA-DA-18-005 (Expanding Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use
      Disorders in the Context of the SAMHSA Opioid STR Grants, R21/R33), this project will develop
      and test a patient decision support tool called Patient Decision Aid for Medication-Assisted
      Treatment (PtDA-MAT) for use in the CA H&SS. The PtDA-MAT is designed to (1) improve patient
      knowledge and involvement and to subsequently improve treatment adherence and outcomes and
      (2) to support clinicians in informing and communicating with their patients with OUD along a
      continuum of care. The 3 year project will assess the effectiveness of the PtDA-MAT in a
      stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in CA H&SS (stratified by rural vs. non-rural areas)
      for adults with OUD. Patient outcomes will be tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline,
      3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose, healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and
      administrative records (over an average of 24 months): drug treatment status and retention,
      physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest, incarceration, controlled substance use, and
      mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to test the intervention effects, controlling
      for possible temporal trends.
