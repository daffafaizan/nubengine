      presents no significant risk, so that FDA clearance is not required.

      Several findings suggest that Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) may be particularly
      effective if it is aligned with ongoing brain activity. One condition of the present research
      is an open-loop design, in which TES pulses (0.75 Hz pulses; 2.0 mA) are presented during
      slow wave sleep. The other condition is a closed-loop design, using identical pulses, but
      these will be phase aligned with the slow waves of sleep, measured by the
      electroencephalogram (EEG). The hypothesis is that closed-loop TES will be more effective in
      enhancing the amplitude and duration of slow wave sleep than open-loop TES.
