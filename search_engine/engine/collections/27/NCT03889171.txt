      strongest identifiable risk . It enables to offer people at risk an appropriate medical care
      (screening, prevention ) the clinical benefit is validated today. The person with whom a
      predisposing mutation has been identified must communicated its related information on the
      risk of cancer and the ability to perform genetic analysis. It appears that this
      dissemination of information is not always optimal, as shown in figures from the National
      Cancer Institute joined the project; the purpose of the study was to analyze the
      psychological and emotional determinants of domestic dissemination of information about
      genetic risk of cancer and to compare the level of diffusion syndromes in breast/ ovarian
      cancer ( BRCA1 / BRCA2) and colon/endometrial ( HNPCC )
