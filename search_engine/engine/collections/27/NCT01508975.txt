    
      This study is an acute, randomized, repeated measures design with 20 subjects. Subjects will
      consume 3 test breakfasts, white rice, brown rice, or glucose control, each containing 400
      calories. Treatments will be one week apart. After consumption of the controlled breakfast,
      subjects will complete visual analogue scales (VAS) for satiety response. Additionally, they
      will consume a pizza lunch and record food intake for the next 24 hours. Breath gas samples
      will be collected to estimate fermentation of fiber in the large intestine. Also, subjective
      data on gastrointestinal tolerance will be collected.
