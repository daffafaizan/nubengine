      extensor muscles, to investigate the presence of cervical dysfunction and temporomandibular
      dysfunction, as well as to verify the effects of cervical stabilization in individuals with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The research will be carried out at the Orofacial Motricity
      Laboratory of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) and the University Hospital of
      Santa Maria (HUSM). Men and women between 20 and 60 years of age with a diagnosis of OSA will
      be invited to participate in this study, confirmed by polysomnography. The sample will
      consist of 22 patients with OSA, 11 subjects in the OSA group (OSA G) and 11 in the control
      group (CG) randomly. At the initial evaluation, an anamnesis will be performed and
      participants will respond to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index (PSQI) and STOP-Bang questionnaire. The craniocervical posture will also be evaluated
      through photogrammetry (SAPo); The presence and severity of temporomandibular dysfunction
      (TMD) by the instruments Diagnostic Criteria in Research for Temporomandibular Dysfunction
      (RDC / TMD) and Temporomandibular Index (TMT); The presence of cervical dysfunction by the
      Craniocervical Dysfunction Index (CCID); The pressure pain threshold and the strength of the
      cervical flexor and extensor muscles, by pressure algometry and dynamometry, respectively.
      The OSA G will be submitted to cervical stabilization using the pressure biofeedback device
      (Stabilizer) and, after six weeks will be reassessed by the same questionnaires and
      instruments of the initial evaluation. The CG after six weeks will be reevaluated and the
      same treatment protocol will be offered.
