      reduced quality of life, and increased health-care costs. The proposed study may provide
      useful information about optimal models for integrating behavioral and pharmacological
      therapies for the clinical management of insomnia.

      Participants are randomly assigned to CBT or CBT plus medication. After the 6-week acute
      treatment phase, participants enter into a 6-month extended treatment phase. Of those treated
      with CBT alone initially, responders are randomized to extended CBT or no treatment. Of those
      receiving the combined CBT plus medication approach initially, responders are randomized to
      an extended treatment consisting of either CBT plus medication (used on an as needed
      schedule) or CBT alone (plus medication tapering). Outcome is evaluated across measures of
      sleep, clinical ratings, and several indices of daytime functioning. The measures are
      administered at baseline, at the end of the acute and extended treatment phases, and at 6,
      12, and 24-month follow-up.
