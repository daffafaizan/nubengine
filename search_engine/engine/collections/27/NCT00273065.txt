      neuronal level. Its activity is express as blocking the axonal conduction, stopping the
      propagation of the nerve impulse. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the
      neosaxitoxin efficacy and safety as local anesthetic in a human trial

      Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with 10 healthy volunteers. The
      anesthetic effect will be evaluated using a standardized human sensory and pain model. TSA
      Neurosensory analyser and Von Frey Technique will be used to evaluate five parameters:
      sensory threshold for warm and cold, pain thresholds for heat and cold and mechanical touch
      perception threshold.
