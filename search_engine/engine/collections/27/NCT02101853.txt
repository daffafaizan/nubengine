    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare disease free survival (DFS) of high-risk (HR) and intermediate-risk (IR)
      relapse B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients who are randomized following
      induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two
      5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR randomization). (Closed to enrollment effective
      September 18, 2019) II. To compare the DFS of low risk (LR) relapse B-ALL patients who are
      randomized following block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or
      chemotherapy plus blinatumomab (LR randomization). (Closed to enrollment effective September
      30, 2019)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) of HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized
      following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks
      or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR randomization).

      II. To compare OS of LR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following block 1
      chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab (LR
      randomization).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) >= 0.01% at the end of block 2 and
      block 3 for HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients in HR/IR randomization.

      II. To estimate, for treatment failure (TF) patients not previously receiving blinatumomab,
      the hematologic complete remission rate (CR), rate of MRD < 0.01%, and proportion able to
      proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in CR after treatment with blinatumomab.

      III. To assess the feasibility and safety of rapid taper of immune suppression for the subset
      of HSCT patients with MRD >= 0.01% pre- and/or post-HSCT with no acute graft versus host
      disease (aGVHD).

      IV. To evaluate blinatumomab pharmacokinetics (PK) and explore exposure-response
      relationships for measures of safety and effectiveness.
