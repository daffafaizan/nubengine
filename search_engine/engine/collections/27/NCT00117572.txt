    
      TRIAL DESIGN:

      Phase III trial of induction therapy with docetaxel followed by chemoradiotherapy versus
      chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with nodal stage N2 or N3 head and neck cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the effect on overall survival when induction chemotherapy is administered
           prior to chemoradiotherapy in patients with N2 or N3 disease.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effect of induction chemotherapy when administered prior to
           chemoradiotherapy on distant failure-free survival, failure pattern, progression free
           survival and quality of life.

      TREATMENT PLAN:

        -  After eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment
           arms:

      Arm A - Induction + chemoradiotherapy

      Arm B - Chemoradiotherapy alone

        -  Induction therapy: Two 21-day cycles of chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (day 1),
           cisplatin (day 1), and 5-fluorouracil (days 1-5). Total duration of 6 weeks.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Five 14-day cycles of docetaxel (day 1), 5-fluorouracil (day 0-4),
           and hydroxyurea (days 0-4) with twice daily radiation (days 1-5). Total duration of 10
           weeks.

        -  All patients will undergo surgical evaluation after chemoradiation for possible neck
           dissection.

        -  Upon completion of treatment, patients will be monitored every three months during the
           first year, every six months during the second and third years, and annually thereafter,
           up to seven years.

        -  Patients will be followed for Quality of Life (QOL) during the course of treatment, as
           well as annually thereafter, up to five years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

        -  An expected sample size of 400 patients will be enrolled for this study (200 per
           treatment arm).
