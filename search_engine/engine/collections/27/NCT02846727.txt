      resulting in either capillary leak into the interstitium or profound vasodilatation.
      Currently, diagnosis of hypoperfusion depends on indirect markers of perfusion such as
      lactate, blood pressure, creatinine, urine output, and mental status. These are all late
      signs of hypoperfusion as they are precursors to impending system failure. In this study, the
      focus will be on one of the most common causes of hypoperfusion in the surgical population;
      sepsis and septic shock.
