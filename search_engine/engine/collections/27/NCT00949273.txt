      than 6 cm from the anal verge. The perineal phase of APR is a difficult part of the
      operation, often done with the patient in the supine position.The risk of inadvertent bowel
      perforation is high, the resulting specimen frequently has a waist at the lower border of the
      mesorectum, and the circumferential resection margin (CRM) is often close to the rectal
      muscle tube. The cylindrical APR may be performed via an extended posterior perineal
      approach, that aims to create a more cylindrical specimen without a waist. The potential
      benefit of this technique is a reduction in the risk of bowel perforation and tumour
      involvement of the CRM, and thus in the risk of local recurrence.

      Perineal wounds in patients following APR are at considerable risk for infection, dehiscence
      and delayed healing when closed primarily. This can be further increased in patients who have
      received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The adoption of extended resection, such as the
      cylindrical APR, may cause additional risks. The use of acellular biomaterials, including
      human acellular dermal matrix (HADM) has drawn great interest for the complex abdominal wall
      reconstruction.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cylindrical abdominoperineal resection is
      effective in the treatment of advanced very low rectal cancer, and to determine the initial
      results of pelvic reconstruction using human acellular dermal matrix after cylindrical
      abdominoperineal resection.
