      reperfusion in regard of incidence and severity of early allograft liver dysfunction.

      Chi-square method of sample size estimation with a=0,05, b=0,20 and P1-P2 = 0,25 required a
      41 subject per group (Stephen B Hulley, Steven R Cummings, Warren S Browner, Deborah G Grady,
      Thomas B Newman.-4th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2013).

      After signing the informed consent 90 patients will be randomized to study and active-control
      group (45 each).

      Only patients undergoing classical technique (retrohepatic IVC resection) of liver
      transplantation without vena-venous bypass will be enrolled to the study.

      In the study group after completion of both caval anastomoses (super and infra-hepatic) the
      infra-hepatic cava-clamp is released and removed allowing the filling and flushing the liver
      retrogradely through the hepatic veins. 300 ml of blood is drained via donor portal vein and
      the vein will be clamped.

      Suprahepatic cava-clamp is released and removed allowing venous return to the right atrium.

      Portal vein anastomosis will be constructed. Before the last 2-3 stitches another 100 ml will
      be drained retrogradely. Recipient portal vein clamp is removed and liver will be reperfused
      antegradely. After that arterial and biliary anastomoses will be constructed.

      In the control group cava-clamps are not removed until completion the portal vein
      anastomosis.

      Chi-square test and regression analysis will be used to test the difference in incidence of
      early allograft liver dysfunction in the study groups.

      Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare the median of highest aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 24 and 48 hours post-reperfusion.
