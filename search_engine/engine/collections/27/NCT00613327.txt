      research study), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective
      (study following participants forward in time) Phase 4 study of oxybutynin chloride OROS in
      participants with overactive bladder. The total study duration will be 12 weeks and will
      include following visits: Screening (Week -2), Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6 and 12. Participants
      will receive oxybutynin chloride OROS tablet at starting dose of 10 milligram (mg) orally
      once daily. The dose will be adjusted by 10 mg every 2 weeks up to first 6 weeks, based on
      the criteria for evaluation of optimal dose. The optimal dose obtained in first 6 weeks will
      be continued up to Week 12. Maximum allowed dose will be 30 mg per day. Efficacy will
      primarily be evaluated by assessment of goal achievement (percentage of participants who show
      a score 4 or 5 in the Likert scale for treatment goal) at Week 12. Participants' safety will
      also be monitored at each visit.
