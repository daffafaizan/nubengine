    
      Aim: To develop and assess a three-month, group-based community peer support program for
      Malaysian adults with MetS.

      Method:

      The PERSUADE module will be constructed using the Health Belief Model (HBM) to address
      relevant health messages from the appropriate guidelines and recent literature evidence on
      MetS among Malaysian adults. Following that, a minimum sample of 96 Malaysian adults with
      MetS will be randomised, either to the control group, who will receive one-time standard
      nutrition and lifestyle advice or the intervention group, who will participate in a
      three-month peer support program using the PERSUADE module. The participants will be followed
      up for three months post-intervention with data collection scheduled at baseline, 3-month and
      6-month.

      PERSUADE is thoroughly designed using the current available guidelines informed with gathered
      inputs on motivations and barriers towards healthy lifestyle among Malaysians. The program
      aims to improve the clinical outcomes of MetS component among participants of the
      intervention group, besides the impact of the peer support intervention on the dietary
      practices, physical activity levels and lifestyle behaviours of those participants. The
      successful outcome of this study can be an initiator for policy makers to encourage more
      rigorous promotion of such community-based programmes in the country.
