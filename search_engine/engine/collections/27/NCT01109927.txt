      antibodies. Patients clinically classified as Type 2, not insulin requiring at diagnosis and
      positive for at least one autoantibody are eligible for inclusion. After randomisation to
      insulin treatment or diet and/or OHA, the patients are followed up with fasting C-peptide
      every third month. A glucagon test is performed, and stimulated C-peptide and HbA1c, +
      clinical data and body weight are recorded at baseline and after 12, 24 and 36 months. The
      final outcome of the study is C-peptide, and change in C-peptide compared to baseline level,
      and HbA1c, after 36 months.
