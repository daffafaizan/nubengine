      pemetrexed for 4-6 cycles followed by pemetrexed maintenance until progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, OR receive SHR-1210 combined with carboplatin and pemetrexed
      chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles followed by pemetrexed maintenance with SHR-1210 until
      progression or unacceptable toxicity (SHR-1210 for a maximum of 2 years).

      Subjects assigned to the chemotherapy arm will have the opportunity to crossover to receive
      SHR-1210 monotherapy once they experience progression of disease (PD) defined by RECIST 1.1
      and meet all the crossover criteria.
