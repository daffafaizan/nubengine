      followed by an 8-week period of supervised home-based telerehabilitation and a weekly group
      exercise in an outpatient clinic. The effects on mobility, upper extremity motor functions
      and activities of daily living will be assessed using FAC, hand grip force, shoulder
      elevation test, WHODAS 2.0 and PROMIS scales. The costs incurred from social and health care
      services over 6 months will be compared to the control group receiving conventional
      rehabilitation. Patients aged 18 or more with their first stroke and stable cardiopulmonary
      condition will be consecutively recruited first into the control group (n=20) and thereafter
      into the experimental group (n=20). Patients with a severe cognitive deficit or aphasia will
      be excluded.
