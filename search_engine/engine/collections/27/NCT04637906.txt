    
      Preliminary experiences conducted in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection by adding the
      daily oral administration of two vials of Bioarginina® to the standard therapy have shown
      favorable effects on discharge times, on the recovery of the number of lymphocytes and on the
      P \ F ratio between arterial pO2 and FiO2 breathed. In particular, for the latter parameter
      there is almost a doubling of the recovery speed.

      The investigators therefore, decided to undertake the present spontaneous, single-center
      study with a parallel group scheme, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled to evaluate
      whether the addition to the standard therapy of two vials per day of Bioarginina® in subjects
      of our hospital suffering from SARS-CoV-2 is useful for the treatment of this pathology.
