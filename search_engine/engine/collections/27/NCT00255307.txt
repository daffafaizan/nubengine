      of three groups (standard dose, low dose, or placebo). The standard dose group will receive
      an oral aqueous solution using the standard dose of CVT-E002, adjusted according to the
      child's weight. The second group will receive an oral aqueous solution with half of the
      standard dose of CVT-E002, adjusted according to the child's weight, and the third group will
      receive a placebo as an aqueous solution of starch that does not contain any CVT-E002 or
      active medication, volume adjusted for the child's weight. Parents will be provided with a
      3-day supply of study medication according to the randomization schedule. CVT-E002 will be
      administered by the parent to the child three times daily for three consecutive days
      following the onset of a URTI. Severity and duration of URTI will be measured using the
      reliable and valid Canadian Acute Respiratory Infection Flu Score (CARIFS).
