    
      Open label randomised controlled multicentre clinical trial with masked outcome assessment
      (PROBE design) comparing 3 strategies (1:1:1): anticoagulation with a Direct OAC (Apixaban
      5mgx2/day) vs avoid anticoagulation with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) compared to
      usual care (avoid anticoagulation).

      Primary outcome: the net clinical benefit (composite outcome of major ischaemic and
      haemorrhagic events) during a follow-up of 24 months (adjudication committee masked to the
      randomisation arm

      The results of A3ICH will help the clinician to decide which strategy is the most effective
      in terms of benefit/risk ratio to prevent the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients
      with a history of ICH and AF. A3ICH will address this increasingly common dilemma and could
      affect clinical practice.

      Data from A3ICH will contribute to an international individual patient data meta-analysis.
