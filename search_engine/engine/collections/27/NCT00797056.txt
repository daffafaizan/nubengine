      severe symptomatic disease and 1-2% have critical limb ischemia (CLI). In patients with CLI,
      the risk of limb amputation at 1 year is 50%. In addition, patients with CLI often have rest
      pain, non-healing ulcers and severe limitations of ambulation. Revascularization procedures,
      including bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and angioplasty with
      stenting, are currently the only treatment options. However, many patients are not eligible
      for a revascularization procedure due to small vessel disease or coexisting medical problems.
      Moreover, restenosis rates are high.

      There is currently no effective non-invasive treatment for critical limb ischemia. We
      hypothesize that mobilization of angiogenic cells into the blood by granulocyte colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) may stimulate angiogenesis in areas of ischemia and result in a
      sustained improvement in blood flow in patients with severe PAD.
