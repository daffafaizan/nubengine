      least one-third of patients experience progression or relapse. Second-line regimens such as
      rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (RICE) are administered with the goal of
      cytoreduction prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in eligible patients.
      However, half of patients who receive salvage treatment and ASCT are still not cured.

      Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE compound, which is a new class of
      molecule. SINE compounds have been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in pre-clinical
      models of AML, CLL, T-ALL, and Ph+ ALL as well as B and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
      Preliminarily, selinexor has demonstrated promising single-agent clinical activity in
      patients with previously treated NHL including DLBCL, warranting further investigation. Based
      on promising preclinical and clinical data, selinexor is currently under evaluation in
      combination with chemotherapy for solid tumors.

      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of selinexor plus RICE will be
      well-tolerated and clinically active in participants with previously treated aggressive
      B-cell lymphomas and propose a phase I trial to evaluate this combination. Moreover,
      Investigators will evaluate primary patient samples before and after selinexor to investigate
      the mechanisms of action of selinexor, including the mechanisms by which selinexor sensitizes
      cells to chemotherapy, and evaluate other novel drug combinations in aggressive B-cell
      lymphomas.
