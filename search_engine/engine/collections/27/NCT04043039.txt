      full thickness palatal graft donor site healing acceleration and in the patient's morbidity
      reduction. Eighty patients, with at least one gingival recession will be treated by a
      coronally advanced flap (CAF) with connective tissue graft(CTG) resulting from the
      de-epithelialization of a free gingival graft. In the test group (20 patients) a quadruple
      layer of PRF membrane will be placed over the palatal wounds; conversely, the control groups
      patients will be treated by an absorbable gelatin sponge. Patients will be monitored at 1, 2,
      3 and 4 weeks after surgery for the complete re-epithelialization of the palatal wound (CWE),
      the alteration of sensibility (AS) around the wound area, the post-operative discomfort (D),
      and the changes of feeding habits (CFH) by a visual analogic scale (VAS) evaluation.
      Furthermore, the analgesics consumption and the existence of delayed bleeding from the
      palatal wound (DWB) during the first post-operative week will be assessed.
