      discectomy, and they are divided into four groups depend on whether the defect is repaired
      with Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge or not and whether the defect is
      sutured or not. In the first group,the defect of intervertebral disc is repaired with
      Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge and sutured. In the second group, the
      defect of intervertebral disc is repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell
      (BMSC)/gelatin sponge but not sutured after discectomy. In the third group, the defect of
      intervertebral disc is sutured but not repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell
      (BMSC)/gelatin sponge after discectomy. In the four group, the defect of intervertebral disc
      is neither sutured nor repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge
      after discectomy.
