    
      This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in 100 patients with
      recently-diagnosed T2DM. Participants will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: (a) a 12-week
      course of treatment with sitagliptin, metformin, insulin glargine and lifestyle therapy, or
      (b) standard diabetes therapy, and followed for a total of 64 weeks (1 year and 3 months). In
      all participants with HbA1C < 7.3% at the 12 week visit, glucose-lowering medications will be
      discontinued and participants will be encouraged to continue with lifestyle modifications and
      regular glucose monitoring. Participants with HbA1C â‰¥ 7.3% at this visit or who meet criteria
      for hyperglycemic relapse after stopping drugs will receive standard glycemic management as
      informed by the current Canadian Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines
