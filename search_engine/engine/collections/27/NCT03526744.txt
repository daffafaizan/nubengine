      health benefits than a regular white fish meal, can be regarded both cost-effective,
      environmental friendly and sustainable.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential effect of increasing/different doses of
      MPH supplement on glucose metabolism, hunger and appetite hormones in healthy elderly, to
      provide a basis for the optimalization of the daily dose for further use of MPH in clinical
      study protocols in elderly patients with sarcopenia, other inflammatory conditions or
      abnormal glucose metabolism.
