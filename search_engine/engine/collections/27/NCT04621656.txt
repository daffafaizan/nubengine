      impact of lifestyle (i.e. food choices, physical activity and sleep patterns), genetics and
      personalized lifestyle recommendations on blood glucose levels, blood pressure, immune system
      status, stress hormone levels and microbiome composition. The purpose of this 10-day
      observational study was to primarily elucidate the impact of food choices, physical activity,
      and sleep patterns on an individual's blood glucose. In addition, we probed if continuous and
      personalized feedback to participants would improve glycemic control acutely through better
      decision making. Multiple investigations may be performed over an indefinite period of time
      to improve the understanding of these interconnected relationships. For example, we will
      perform studies to understand an individual's blood glucose response to an oral glucose load
      or mixed meal. We will also perform studies to determine the phenotype (clinical, metabolic,
      or immunologic) associated with a particular genotype. The data collected will be analyzed
      using proprietary machine learning methods.
