      necessary for this infection for patients treated with continuous veino-veinous hemodialysis.
      The pharmacokinetic variability expose to over and underdosage leading to toxicity or
      therapeutic failure. The aim of this study is to define if beta-lactams doses used in
      pneumonia for patients with acute kidney injury treated with our hemodialysis conditions lead
      to beta-lactam therapeutic plasma levels.

      This prospective observational multicenter study will include all patients with pneumonia
      treated by beta-lactam and continuous veino-veinous hemodialysis in 5 ICU. Blood sampling
      will be done at assumed pharmacokinetic steady state. Protocol sample concentrations of
      beta-lactams immediately prior to re-dosing, after 24 hours of association of intraveinous
      beta-lactam and continuous veino-veinous hemodialysis. Another sample will be done after 48
      hours. The ICU measured bacterial MICs routinely when the pathogen will be determined.
      Surveyed ICUs will adopt SFM-EUCAST breakpoints for the targeted (or suspected) bacteria to
      determine pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets when a mesured MIC (Minimum inhibitory
      concentration) is not available. Local hospital antibiogram data can also be used to describe
      likely pathogen susceptibility. Target attainment is defined as 100% fT> 5 MIC. Due to the
      long delay to receive therapeutic drug monitoring results, doses could not be ajusted.
      Factors which could cause concentrations variations will be registered. When neurotoxicity is
      suspected, a sample will be realized to know beta-lactam concentration and the adverse event
      will be notified.
