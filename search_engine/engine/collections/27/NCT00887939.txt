      and chronic forms. It may occur spontaneously or on exposure to a physical factor. In the
      latter case, the urticaria is classified as a physical urticaria . Physical urticaria may be
      induced by mechanical and applied pressure, exercise, or exposure to cold, heat, sun, water,
      or vibration. The urticarial lesions are generally thought to be the result of mast cell
      activation and degranulation, which is supported by the finding of increased levels of serum
      histamine during some urticarial flares. Passive transfer experiments, whereupon serum from
      affected donors is transferred into recipient s skin followed by physical stimulation with
      resultant urticaria at the site of challenge, have been positive in some instances. This
      suggests the presence of an intrinsic factor in serum, such as IgE, which then mediates
      activation of tissue mast cells. However, the pathogenesis in general remains unclear and a
      genetic basis for these disorders has not been elucidated.

      The goal of this protocol is thus to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of
      physical urticaria through the investigation of subjects with severe and unusual phenotypes
      and/or inherited patterns of disease. Subjects will undergo a clinical evaluation that will
      include verification of their urticaria. Blood and tissue samples, if available, will be
      collected for analysis. The analysis will be targeted toward the determination of novel serum
      mediators, mast cell activation and mutational analysis in families with inherited patterns.
