      application of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in PD gait rehabilitation. The
      investigators will enroll 30 patients with PD. They will be randomized into two groups: (A)
      gait training with Music; (B) conventional treadmill gait training. The experimental group
      will perform training by means of GT3 (Biodex), where the patient is able to walk (on a
      treadmill) following specific musical beets and rhythms. The control group will perform only
      gait treadmill training.

      Subjects will attend 3 sessions a week for at least 4 weeks. Each session will last 45-min.

      The investigators will assess the gait performance and pattern by using System BTS Smart for
      gait and the sensorimotor functional connectivity by using EEG, both before and after the
      therapy cycle. The patients will be clinically evaluated by means of Time up and go test, and
      ten meters. The overall motor function will be evaluated through the UPDRS III.

      Power calculation by Cohen (1992) methodology will be utilized for this pilot study.
      Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess the normality of distribution. Thus, parametric and
      non-parametric tests will be employed for all comparisons (Wilcoxon test, ANOVA).
      Mann-Whitney test or ANOVA will be utilized to evaluate the level of significance in
      differentiation between the examined groups.
