      multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains which have a worse prognosis being associated
      with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. The main
      problem with MDR strains is their limited treatment options, posing a major challenge for
      health care providers.The increasing utilization and immense studies of nanoparticles have
      brought new perspectives towards new antimicrobial material that could hinder the MDR
      bacteria pandemic currently faced. Particularly, metallic nanoparticles exhibit strong
      biocidal properties on different bacterial species, including MDR bacteria. Another important
      aspect of the antimicrobial properties of metallic nanoparticles is their potential to
      eradicate or inhibit microbial biofilm formation, which is an important virulence factor in
      many localized chronic infections.
