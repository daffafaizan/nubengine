    
      2 groups of 30 patients with severe lower limb ischemia requiring femoropopliteal bypass
      revascularization participate in the study. The control group (placebo isoosmotic saline)
      will be compared to the treated group (femoral arterial infusion of 2 g L-Arginine for 30
      min).

      Heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature will be monitored continuously. The
      gastrocnemius muscle is biopsied before and 30 minutes after revascularization to analyze
      mitochondrial respiration and its control. Both femoral and brachial concomitant venous
      samples will judge the importance of muscle damage (lactate, muscle enzymes) and released
      mediators (cytokines, NO and endothelin) on the local and general.

      Main clinical implications: L-arginine supplementation in atherosclerotic patients requiring
      femoropopliteal bypass to limit the initial deleterious effects of reperfusion and improve
      their walking distance and therefore their quality of life. Then extending this treatment to
      other patients with peripheral arterial disease.
