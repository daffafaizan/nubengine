      ability to recognize signs of stress and the implementation of embedded strategies to reduce
      stress and enhance emotional well-being, we conduct a mixed-methods research study using
      pretest-posttest surveys (assessing knowledge, beliefs, and actions) and qualitative analysis
      of written reflections about the meaning and use of the Calm Moments Cards. The focus of the
      intervention is on prevention of stress and anxiety based on situational stressors (e.g.
      taking a test, completing an assignment) so that students can focus on and succeed in doing
      their schoolwork. Occupational therapy practitioners oriented school personnel to the signs
      of stress and the use of the 17 Calm Moments Cards using a 1 hour inservice. This was
      followed by informal coaching to foster implementation.
