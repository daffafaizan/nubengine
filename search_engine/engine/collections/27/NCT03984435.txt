      discomfort during the procedure, especially those who require radiotherapy with extended
      treatment times. This problem was explored by informal questioning of patients who revealed
      that this is a problem and causes distress and discomfort but that it was being accepted as
      being part of the treatment. In healthcare, several interventions have been used to improve
      the comfort of patients. In radiotherapy, there have been examples where positioning or
      relaxation has improved the patient's comfort. Literature searches have revealed some comfort
      interventions that can be used during radiotherapy treatment which may be possible
      interventions.

      With the consent of the patient, it is intended to establish the patients' experience and
      views of comfort and comfort management during radiotherapy. Radiographers' experiences and
      views of managing patient comfort during radiotherapy will also be explored. It will also be
      essential to explore what would be the most ideal solution to comfort management, or how
      comfort could be improved, from the perspective of both patients and radiographers.
