      symptom-triggered administration of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines and use of a
      symptom-triggered approach has several drawbacks such as over administration of medication
      due to many subjective patient reported symptoms. Benzodiazepines may contribute to a
      drug-induced delirium or high dosage may necessitate transfer to an ICU setting. Abrupt
      withdrawal of benzodiazepines also contribute to cravings, rebound insomnia, and anxiety that
      have been shown to increase the risk of a return drinking.

      Clinical use of gabapentin for alcohol withdrawal has been presented by Maldonado at Stanford
      University Hospitals. (Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine Annual Meeting, 2013-2015) At Mayo
      Clinic, the Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison hospital service has been recommending the use of
      a modified gabapentin protocol since January 2015, which has been clinically accepted on
      medical, surgical, and psychiatric hospital services. The purpose of this research is to
      investigate the reactive benzodiazepine versus proactive gabapentin approaches to AWS in a
      prospective, randomized, open-label study.
