      and medical costs, the developmental delays, and the impact on the family are profound.
      Twenty to 30% of survivors of brain injury have some long-term neurologic sequelae.

      This randomized controlled trial will enroll 120 term and near-term neonates with a history
      of asphyxia to 1-year of a standard follow-up program (provided by the Los Angeles Regional
      Centers) or a home-based intervention program (Utah State University's Developmental
      Curriculum and Monitoring System, CAMS). The experimental intervention will include
      individualized cognitive/neuromotor stimulation given by the child's parents under the
      guidance of public health nurses. Following the intervention, measures will be used to
      determine functional capacity (Bayley II scale and neurologic examination), behavioral
      outcomes (HOME and NCAST by developmental specialists), and maternal outcomes (including
      parent-infant interaction and perceived stress). Infants will be assessed after the 1-year
      intervention by psychologists and physicians masked to the intervention. Functional MRI brain
      studies will be conducted at discharge and 18 months of age at UCLA to assess qualitative and
      quantitative sensorimotor representation. Secondary outcomes include care stress and social
      support as reported by parents, and demographics and medical factors obtained from the
      hospital records.
