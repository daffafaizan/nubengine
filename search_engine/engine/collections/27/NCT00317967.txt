      thickened, fibrotic myocardium, with or without a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract
      gradient. It is a common heritable cardiovascular disease, with a population prevalence of
      0.1% to 0.2%. Symptoms of congestive heart failure are extremely common in patients with HCM.
      Progression to disabling and debilitating symptoms [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
      III and IV] is relatively common, occurring in 15% to 20% of unselected populations. The rate
      of progression to NYHA class III or IV or death from heart failure or stroke is high, with a
      relative risk 2.7. Management of symptoms can be very challenging, involve multiple
      medications, and 5% of patients may develop drug refractory heart failure, requiring invasive
      intervention. HCM is the most common cause of sudden death among young competitive athletes.
      Ventricular tachyarrhythmias appear to be the primary mechanism; however, other arrhythmias
      involved include asystole, rapid atrial fibrillation, and electrical mechanical dissociation.
      Patients may develop progressive myocardial wall thinning, a reduction in systolic
      performance, and an increase in left ventricular dimensions. Progressive wall thinning may be
      especially common in patients with initially severe hypertrophy. There is no cure for this
      condition. There is now evidence from both animal and human studies of a treatment that
      promises to reverse hypertrophy - HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Clearly, studies of
      treatments that might cause regression of hypertrophy are timely and important.
