      initially with our standard radiochemotherapy, which consists of doxorubicin 20mg fixed
      dose/week and hyperfractionated radiotherapy 1,6 Gy twice daily up to 46 Gy in total. The
      first week during radiotherapy, they will also receive Avastin 15mg/kg. 1-2 weeks after
      radiotherapy patients will undergo surgery of their primary tumor. After this "standard"
      therapy patients can be included in this study. Treatment is 20 mg fixed dose doxorubicin q1w
      and avastin 15mg/kg q3w. Treatment will continue maximum 6 months or until progress or until
      intolerable side effects occur.
