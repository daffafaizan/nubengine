      of VBI-S in elevating the blood pressure of septic shock patients with absolute or relative
      hypovolemia.

      STUDY TREATMENT Sepsis is a serious condition resulting from the presence of harmful
      microorganisms in the blood or other tissues and the body's response to their presence,
      leading to the malfunctioning of various organs. When hypotension due to sepsis cannot be
      reversed with the infusion of fluids the patient is in a state of septic shock. Septic shock
      is therefore an acute medical emergency and delayed therapy can lead to organ injury. VBI-S
      is intended to raise blood pressure in patients with septic shock.

      Randomization and blinding: This is an open label study, randomization and blinding are not
      applicable to this study. All patients entering this study will be treated with VBI-S.

      Data Safety Monitoring Board: A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the study
      data.

      Analysis Populations: * Safety Analysis Set (SAF): all patients who have received any amount
      of VBI-S. * Intent to treat (ITT) population: all patients who have received any amount of
      VBI-S
