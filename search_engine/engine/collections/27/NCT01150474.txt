      control may result in nausea, vomiting, an extended hospital stay, and reduced patient
      satisfaction. Oral and parenteral narcotics are commonly used for pain relief and their use
      may exacerbate the incidence of sedation, nausea, and vomiting; ultimately delaying
      convalescence. Previous studies have demonstrated that rectal analgesia following surgery
      results in lower pain scores and less intravenous morphine consumption. Belladonna and opium
      suppositories are routinely prescribed at our institution and their efficacy has not been
      confirmed.

      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be undertaken using
      belladonna and opium rectal suppositories following vaginal surgery. Treatment will begin
      immediately following surgery and continue every 8 hours for a total of 3 doses.
