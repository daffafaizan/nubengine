      of any chronic disease, sedentary), 20 endo-ACAB patients, and 20 CABG patients (matched for
      age, gender and BMI) undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test after hospital discharge
      (for patients only).During this exercise test, following parameters are assessed at peak
      effort and at the second ventilatory threshold (determined by VE/VCO2 slope method): oxygen
      uptake (VO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), resoiratory gas
      exchange ratio (RER), expiratory volume (VE), ventilatory equivalent for VCO2 (VE/VCO2),
      ventilatory equivalent for VO2 (VE/VO2), end-tidal O2 pressure (PETO2), end-tidal CO2
      pressure (PETCO2), heart rate (HR), oxygen pulse (VO2/HR), cycling power output (W), tidal
      volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure
      (DBP), rate pressure product (RPP). Peak exercise effort is validated by RERpeak.
