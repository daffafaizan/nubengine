      collecting all the data desired: periodontal parameters of Probing Pocket Depth (PPD),
      presence of recession of the gingival margin (Rec) and full mouth plaque score (FMPS) will be
      recorded on six sites/tooth by a single calibrated examiner using a University of North
      Carolina (UNC) 15-mm periodontal probe by a calibrated examiner blind to group allocation.

      Gingival index (GI) and angulated bleeding score (AngBS) will be recorded at four
      sites/tooth.

      For GI the following scale will be used:

      0 normal appearance of gingiva, no bleeding, no inflammation;

        1. slight change and moderate edema with slight change in texture, no bleeding, mild
           inflammation;

        2. redness hypertrophy, or edema and glazing, bleeding on probing, moderate inflammation;

        3. marked redness, hypertrophy, or edema, ulceration, spontaneous bleeding, severe
           inflammation.

      For AngBS the following scale will be used:

      0: no bleeding;

        1. bleeding upon probe stimulation;

        2. spontaneous bleeding

      Consequently, interdental plaque score (IPS), interdental gingival index (IGI), and
      interdental angulated bleeding score (IAngBI) will be calculated.

      Patients will be followed through a five-week period. The timepoints will be the following: T
      -7 (oral hygiene instructions), T0 (professional supragingival scaling and polishing), T14,
      T28.
