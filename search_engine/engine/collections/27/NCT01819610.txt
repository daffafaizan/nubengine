    
      This is a study of intranasal (IN) ketorolac tromethamine (SPRIX) in pediatric subjects age
      12-17 years vs. adults ages 18-64 years undergoing open surgical procedures that are expected
      to result in at least a moderate level of pain (i.e., 40 or above on a 0-100 Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) in which 0 is no pain and 100 is the worst pain imaginable). Following surgery
      subjects will receive their 1st dose of SPRIX, if and when pain reaches a VAS of 40 or more,
      followed by SPRIX administration every 6 hours. Blood samples for PK assessment will then be
      collected for PK assessment pre-dose, at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first
      dose, at 6 hours (immediately before the 2nd dose), and immediately before each of the next
      several subsequent q6h doses up to the dose to be administered on the morning of
      post-operative day 2. Blood samples will then be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours
      after receiving the morning dose on day 2 (i.e., last blood sample for PK will be collected
      on the morning of post-operative day 3). Pain intensity (PI) will be assessed using the 0-100
      VAS at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose, at 2 hours after the 2nd dose, and then
      immediately prior to each dose at 12, 18, and 24 hours from baseline. Patients may elect to
      continue taking SPRIX for a total of 5 days with daily assessments of pain intensity using a
      diary. A final follow-up phone interview will be conducted 14 days after the final dose of
      study drug. Thus, each subject's study participation will consist of a screening visit, a
      treatment/assessment period of up to 5 days, and a follow-up interview.
