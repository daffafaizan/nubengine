    
      This is a prospective process intervention study that will compare historical pre-process
      intervention data to post-intervention data from study providers within participating
      community obstetrics and gynecology practices. This study will begin with a process
      intervention at the participating practices during which Myriad Genetics personnel
      experienced in implementation of hereditary cancer risk assessment programs will provide
      training to practice providers. The training will be followed by a 4-week practice period to
      allow for incorporation of the recommendations of the intervention process into the practice.
      During a subsequent 8-week Observation period, women who present for an office visit (new
      patient visit, well women visit, or problem visit) will be screened for common hereditary
      cancer syndromes following the process established during the process intervention. Patients
      who meet NCCN/ACOG testing guidelines will be offered genetic testing. Patients and study
      providers will be surveyed about their satisfaction with the hereditary cancer risk
      assessment process.
