      stapling device. Double chest tubes after lobectomy is a well established method for drainage
      of the pleural cavity to allow adequate expansion of the remaining lung.

      FORESEAL has been developed to reduce air leaks by buttressing the staple line. It is a
      absorbable vegetal biopolymer in the form of sleeves, CE marked and indicated for prevention
      of air leakage after pulmonary resection with stapling device. It acts as a suture
      reinforcement as well as a sealant thanks to its jellification.

      Sealants are also commonly used in addition to stapling to prevent air leakage. The aim of
      this study is to compare the efficacy of FORESEAL with stapling alone or associated with
      sealants.

      This is a multi centre, prospective controlled and randomised clinical study.
