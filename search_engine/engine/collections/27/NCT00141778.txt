      Americans. Post-operative atrial fibrillation(AF), which leads to significant morbidity and a
      prolonged hospital stay, complicates 20% to 40% of CPB surgical procedures. While recent
      studies indicate that interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by either
      angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibition or angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor
      antagonism decreases the incidence of AF following a heart attack or cardioversion (electric
      shock to the heart), its effect on the incidence of post-operative AF has not been throughly
      studied. Studies in both animals and humans suggest that inflammation-induced atrial
      remodeling plays an important role in the cause of AF. Recent studies also provide evidence
      that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system induces inflammation, myocyte
      injury, proarrhythmic electrical remodeling, and fibrosis through aldosterone.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of ACE inhibition and aldosterone receptor
      antagonism at decreasing inflammation and AF following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery.
