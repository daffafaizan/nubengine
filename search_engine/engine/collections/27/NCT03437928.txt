      lifetime prevalence of ~15% across developed countries. Up to a third of patients fail to
      respond adequately to evidence-based treatments, including pharmacological, behavioral, and
      electroconvulsive therapy. The investigators employ an innovative approach, including
      subacute invasive neurophysiological monitoring with which they aim to gain insight into the
      networks underlying depression symptomatology, confirm the ability to predict the effects of
      precision DBS on network activity, and harmonize these insights to implement network-guided
      DBS for TRD.
