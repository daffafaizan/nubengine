      patients with clinically node negative T1 and T2 breast cancer treated with systemic
      chemotherapy and whole breast irradiation in whom biopsy of the sentinel node is not
      performed. A locoregional recurrence is defined as any recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary
      nodes or in the supraclavicular nodes.

      After surgery, a patient will receive standard of care radiation on her affected breast and
      chemotherapy. A physical examination of the affected breast and regional lymph nodes will be
      conducted every six months for the first two years of follow up and then yearly for the last
      3 years of follow up. Imaging of the affected breast will occur every 12 months after surgery
      per standard of care.
