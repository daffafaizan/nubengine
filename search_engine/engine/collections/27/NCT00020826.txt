        -  Determine the scale structure, reliability, and validity of the tumor-specific
           questionnaire, QLQ-STO22, in assessing the quality of life of patients with gastric
           cancer.

        -  Determine the questionnaire's sensitivity to change in clinical health status in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of treatment (potentially curative vs
      potentially palliative), disease stage (local and locoregional vs metastatic), Karnofsky
      performance status (less than 80% vs more than 80%), and initial weight gain (none vs less
      than 10% of total body weight vs 10% or more of total body weight).

        -  Curatively Treated Group: Quality of life is assessed at 4 weeks prior to surgery and 3
           months after surgery in patients receiving total or partial gastrectomy with curative
           intent; at 4 weeks prior to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, 4 weeks prior to surgery,
           and 3 months after surgery in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or
           radiotherapy followed by total or partial gastrectomy with curative intent; at 4 weeks
           prior to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and 6 weeks after completion of therapy in
           patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy following total or partial
           gastrectomy; and at 4 weeks prior to therapy and 3 months after completion of therapy in
           patients receiving endoscopic mucosal resection or laparoscopic wedge resection.

        -  Palliatively Treated Group: Quality of life is assessed at 3 weeks prior to palliative
           therapy and 4 weeks after beginning palliative therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 220 patients (110 per group) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
