      with MM in any stage of the disease and treated in specialized oncology centers in 2 public
      hospitals in Northwestern France. Any such patient providing a signed informed consent is
      included. All subjects are followed up until refusal to participate in the study, emigration
      or death. The MYRACLE follow-up is continuous and collects data on socio-economic status,
      medical status, MM therapies and associated events (resistance, side effects). Participants
      also complete standardized quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. In addition, participants
      are asked to donate blood samples that will support ex vivo analysis of expression and
      functional assays required to uncover predictive biomarkers and companion diagnostics. If
      diagnostic biopsies are performed during the course of the disease, extracted biological
      samples are kept in a dedicated biobank.
