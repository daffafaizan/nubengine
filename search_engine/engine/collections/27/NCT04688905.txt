    
      Multiple diagnostic tests, including stress tests and the invasive conduction of left
      ventricular pressure-volume loops via conductance catheter (as gold standard) will be
      performed in patients with unexplained dyspnea NYHA II-III in order to identify patients with
      a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The results will be compared to
      previously reported diagnostic scores such as the H2FPEF and the HFA-PEFF score.
