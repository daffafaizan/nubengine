      fibrillation with prospectively and consecutively. A contact force-sensing catheter will be
      used. Ablation will be performed with point-by-point technique using Visitag automated
      annotation criteria as below;

      Ablation Index(AI) target:

        -  Anterior/roof : 450 AI

        -  Anterior near carina area : 500 AI

        -  Posterior/inferior/carina : 350 AI

        -  Posterior near carina area : 400 AI

        -  Area near esophagus :25W, 15sec or 300 AI (no further ablation if esophageal temperature
           increase more than 39°C)

        -  Interlesion distance ≤ 4.5mm

      VISITAGTM settings

        -  2.5mm stability range

        -  7 sec stability time

        -  FOT 25%, 3g force

        -  Tag size 2mm

      Ablation parameters are preset as below;

        -  RF power range: 40W at anterior/roof, 30W at posterior/inferior, 25W at near esophagus
           area (decrease power 5W by operator decision)

        -  Target contact force range: 10-20 g

        -  Flow rate:

        -  8 ml/min for STSF < 30W

        -  15 ml/min for STSF ≥ 30W

      Acute reconnection will be analysed according to predefined segments.

      Subgroup analysis will be performed according to type of AF. Data of patients with paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation will be analysed separately, and
      investigate whether this new ablation strategy is effective in both group of patients. To
      compare outcomes with OPITMUM phase 2 study, the proportion of patients with paroxysmal and
      persistent atrial fibrillation would be 75% and 25%. Therefore, 53 patients with paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation and 17 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation will be enrolled in
      this study.
