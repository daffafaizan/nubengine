    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single site, 8-week
      trial of add-on ramelteon in outpatient adults (18-65 years old, inclusive) with lifetime
      bipolar I disorder, with mild to moderate manic symptoms, and currently experiencing a
      clinically significant sleep disturbance. Approximately 60 subjects will be screened to
      obtain 30 subjects who enroll in the 8-week trial. Subjects will be randomized to ramelteon
      or placebo in a double-blind manner as add-on to current treatment. Any other psychotropic
      medications that the subject is taking at the initiation of participation in this protocol
      should be continued unchanged throughout the course of this study, except in instances in
      which these medications require dose reduction for management of side effects. Efficacy and
      safety assessments will be performed weekly, and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse
      events will be monitored and recorded.
