      suppress tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model, we propose to determine its effect on
      prostate cancer cells in human patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. In this pilot study
      we plan to assess the toxicity of lithium administration in patients prior to radical
      prostatectomy. This will include any clinical toxicity as well as any increase in intra-,
      peri- or postoperative complications.
