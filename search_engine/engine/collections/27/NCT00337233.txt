        -  Determine the feasibility of implementing a restorative yoga intervention as a
           complementary supportive therapy for women with ovarian or breast cancer.

        -  Measure changes in fatigue, psychosocial distress (anxiety, depression), psychological
           well-being (positive emotions), and overall quality of life from baseline to completion
           of the study treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo a 75-minute restorative yoga session once a week for 10 weeks.

      Patients complete questionnaires regarding fatigue, psychological distress (anxiety,
      depression), positive affect, and quality of life at baseline, immediately after the final
      yoga session, and then at 2 months after the final yoga session.
