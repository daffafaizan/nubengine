    
      This study is a Phase 1/2a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, dose-escalation
      study to evaluate the safety and proof of concept of Antiplaque Chewing Gum. This is a 2-part
      trial with 9 dosing cohorts in Phase 1 and 7 dosing cohorts in Phase 2a. For both phases, the
      oral soft (OST) and oral hard tissues (OHT) will be examined. Changes from baseline, such as
      soft tissue erythema, ulceration and sloughing, will be noted and assessments will be made by
      the principal investigator as to whether they might be attributable to the antiplaque chewing
      gum.

      In the Phase 2a portion of the study, the efficacy of the antiplaque chewing gum in reducing
      existing supragingival plaque and gingivitis will also be assessed. Plaque will be assessed
      using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (PI, Turesky et al-1970) and
      gingivitis will be assessed using both the Modified Gingival Index (MGI, Lobene et al-1986)
      and the percent of bleeding sites on gentle probing (BOP) using the methods described in
      Ainamo and Bay-1975.
