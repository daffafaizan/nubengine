      L3 to L5 spinous process is most commonly applied for determination of epidural insertion.
      However, the precision of epidural catheter insertion site was affected by physiological and
      anatomical variations in pregnant women and positions such as sitting or lateral decubitus.
      Previous study showed the clinical estimation would be â‰¥ 1 vertebral level higher than the
      anatomical position determined by ultrasound at least 40% of the time in sitting position
      among western pregnant women. For asian parturients, epidural analgesia is commonly performed
      in lateral decubitus position because of smaller stature. In addition, it remains uncertain
      whether the landmark epidural insertion level congruent or ingruent is associated with
      different analgesia profiles such as the dosage requirement and the frequncy of adjustment.
