    
      Chronic pain patients who are going to the physiotherapy clinic to receive tDCS treatment
      sessions are evaluated in order to assess the efficacy of tDCS in clinical settings.
      Physiotherapists prescribe physical exercises adapted to the patients conditions. Patients
      performed their physical exercises every time they received a tDCS treatment, but were also
      recommended to continue their physical exercises program at home after completion of
      physiotherapy visits.

      Concerning tDCS treatment, patients were encouraged to receive 1 tDCS session per day for 5
      consecutive days.
