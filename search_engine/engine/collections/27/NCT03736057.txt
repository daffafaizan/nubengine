      Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as a novel electronic health
      record (EHR) -compatible means of assessing treatment response. To date, there has been
      limited investigation of pharmacogenomic testing among people with dementia. Testing has
      mostly been focused on testing a single Cytochrome P450 (CYP)polymorphism to guide treatment
      decisions for cognitive enhancing cholinesterase inhibitor medications in patients with
      Alzheimer disease. Pharmacogenomic guidance of prescribing decisions for psychotropic
      medications has not been studied for BPSD but there is growing evidence that such analyses
      can assist in effective prescription decisions for treatment of depression. Since affective
      symptoms are among the most prominent drivers of BPSD and associated distress, and the
      highest level evidence for successful treatment of BPSD is with the antidepressant drug
      citalopram, investigators believe that pharmacogenomic guidance for selection of drugs to
      treat BPSD is truly innovative, and will provide new insights on implementing safer and more
      effective treatment for BPSD.

      Additionally, investigators will explore the use of the NIH-sponsored Patient Reported
      Outcomes measurement Information System (PROMIS) as an outcome measure for BPSD. PROMIS is a
      system of highly reliable, valid, flexible, precise, and responsive assessment tools that
      measure patient-reported health status. PROMIS measures are available for typical BPSD like
      anger, anxiety, and depression, but their utility has not been studied in a sample of
      dementia patients. They offer the potential, through patient-portal EHR interfaces, for
      clinicians to track treatment responses in a more timely and efficient manner than
      traditional clinic-based instruments, placing less burden on patients and families to present
      for in-clinic assessments.
