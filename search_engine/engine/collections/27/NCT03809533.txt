    
      This is a prospective, single center, pilot, open-label study of transplantation of kidneys
      of HCVAb+ donors to HCVAb- recipients with subsequent therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®). Recipients of a kidney from HCVAb+/NAT- donors will be in arm 1 (the
      transmission-triggered arm) of the study. In this arm, the study will monitor HCV by
      measuring HCV RNA in renal transplant recipients. If HCV RNA is detected, indicating
      transmission of HCV, recipients will be treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa®) for 12
      weeks. Virological response will be assessed at 4 weeks, end of treatment and 12 weeks after
      completion of therapy.

      Recipients of a kidney from HCVAb+/NAT+ donors will be in arm 2 (the prophylaxis arm) of the
      study. In this arm, patients will be started on a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®) immediately post-operatively and will undergo close monitoring of HCV RNA for
      evidence of transmission.

      To be eligible for the study, subjects need to be listed for renal transplantation, be not
      infected with HCV, HBV or HIV, and sign informed consent.
