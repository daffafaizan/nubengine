      as dominant trait. VWD is due to deficiency/abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). The
      prevalence of VWD is unknown, but estimated as 0.1% to 1% of the general population. Although
      the autosomal inheritance pattern would suggest an equal distribution of male and female
      patients, the disease is diagnosed in more females because of female-specific hemostatic
      challenges: menses, ovulation, pregnancy and childbirth. Diagnosis of VWD is made by
      assessing personal and family history of bleeding, physical examination and completed with
      specific laboratory tests.

      There is limited information on the epidemiology of VWD in developing countries. Some
      countries in Latin America have registries of severe disease that, although it is the rarest
      form, carries the highest costs for regional health systems. So that the prevalence of
      clinical symptoms and laboratory features of the disease as well as the management of the
      disease in Latin America is unknown.

      The present project aims to establish a network of centers and professionals with the
      objective to register and investigate all patients with VWD in Latin America, using a
      database available online common to all, to gain understanding about phenotype, genotype and
      management of VWD in the region.
