      of BO-112 will be performed once weekly (QW) for the first 7 weeks and then once every three
      weeks (Q3W); pembrolizumab Q3W will be administered IV. After enrolment of 40 patients, the
      sponsor and investigators will review the overall response rate (ORR), durability of response
      (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety profile, and will decide whether to initiate a
      subsequent randomized phase of the trial.

      The order of administration should be pembrolizumab then IT BO-112. BO-112 will be
      administered IT at a total dose of 1-2 mg at each administration to 1-8 tumor lesions using
      tuberculin (TB) syringes (or equivalent) with 20- to 23-gauge needles. The needle type can
      also be per the investigator's discretion, to best distribute the study drug within the
      lesion. Repeat IT dosing may occur if the lesion(s) remain(s) palpable or detectable by
      ultrasound, after which, only pembrolizumab infusion will continue.

      BO-112 can be administered IT into multiple accessible lesions amenable to repeat
      administration using an appropriate syringe and needle type for the location of the
      lesion(s). The rationale for dosing multiple lesions is to produce an immune response against
      a wider range of genetic mutations and antigenic diversity than may occur within a single
      lesion, which in turn is expected to reduce the chance of immune escape by the tumor.
