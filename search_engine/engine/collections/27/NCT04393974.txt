      transmitted from animal to human. On 12th March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
      declared this particular coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.

      How COVID-19 affects people is still not widely understood. Some people who have tested
      positive for the virus have been asymptomatic while others, who were otherwise well and
      healthy before infection, have died. Currently, information obtained so far suggests that
      most COVID-19 illness, however older people and people with severe comorbidities such as
      heart and lung disease and diabetes, seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19
      illness.

      This research is a retrospective, non-interventional study whose aim is to describe the
      features of COVID-19 infection specifically in cancer patients; to investigate its severity
      in this particular population and evaluate the long-term outcomes by means of medical charts
      review of consecutive patients co-diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and malignancy.

      Patients will be identified from electronic medical records and entered into a pre-designed
      database. All information used will have been previously collected as part of routine
      standard of care and will involve but is not limited to: blood test results, prior and
      current anti-cancer therapy, medical history and most importantly clinical outcomes, such as
      response to any treatment provided for COVID-19 and patients' survival in relation to
      baseline clinic-pathologic profile. All data will be collected by each patient's team and
      will be anonymised and stored in a password-protected NHS computer.
