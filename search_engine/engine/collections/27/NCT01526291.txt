      the FDA, the Department of Defense, and the National Eye Institute (NEI). This project
      examines patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following LASIK. This three-phased project is part
      of FDA's ongoing effort to better monitor and improve the safety and effectiveness of lasers
      used in LASIK surgery. PROWL-1 is the second phase of the larger LQOLCP project. This
      prospective, questionnaire-based study will be conducted by the Navy Refractive Surgery
      Center San Diego in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Center
      for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the National Eye Institute (NEI). The primary
      purpose of this study is to explore the psychometric properties of a newly developed
      questionnaire assessing satisfaction and ophthalmic-related quality of life (QOL) in 550
      active duty patients over a period of six months prior to and following state-of-the-art
      laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Specific topics of interest include: functional
      limitations, dry eye symptoms, pre-operative expectations, depression, anxiety,
      post-operative symptoms, dispositional optimism, and satisfaction. Additionally,
      standard-of-care, non-invasive clinical data will be collected pre- and postoperatively
      (e.g., best corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction, wavefront aberrometry, corneal
      topography, and other clinical assessments), and analyzed. The questionnaire in this study is
      a newly developed instrument which, once psychometrically evaluated in this U.S. Navy/FDA/NEI
      collaboration, will be used in future large-scale, multicenter FDA clinical studies that
      include civilian refractive surgery centers throughout the United States.
