      (mCIMT)are both promising approaches to enhance recovery after stroke. However, the combined
      application of the two modalities has rarely been studied. To date, only a single case report
      addressed this issue. Theoretically, application of a mCIMT program with intensive functional
      tasks practice after spasticity reduction by BtxA may improve affected upper extremity
      function in patients with poststroke spasticity. The aim was to investigate whether combined
      BtxA and mCIMT would produce greater improvements in spasticity and upper extremity function
      than BtxA plus conventional rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients with upper extremity
      spasticity.
