      controls and 9 patients to assess the imaging parameters of BAC TWO over human
      autofluorescence and to assess if gram-negative bacteria can be detected in vivo in situ
      within the distal lung. The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of
      BAC TWO and assess imaging parameters in;

        -  3 mechanically ventilated patients to provide a control population (cohort 1)

        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-negative bacteria
           (cohort 2)

        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-positive bacteria
           (cohort 3)

        -  3 patients with suspected pneumonia and pulmonary infiltrates in ICU (cohort 4)

      For all cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written
      informed consent has been obtained. For all cohorts, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be
      performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE)
      will be performed on up to three areas and up to 80μg (± 25%) in total of BAC TWO will be
      instilled in up to 3 sites.

      Participants will be asked to provide additional blood and urine samples with the intention
      of examining for systemic uptake of the BAC TWO probe. Routine blood investigations will be
      performed 4-6 hours following the administration of BAC TWO. The completion of all
      assessments at 4-6 hours post dose marks the end of the participant's participation in this
      study unless there are ongoing adverse events requiring resolution. The primary aim will be
      measured during bronchoscopy and all routine investigations will have been completed 6 hours
      post dose.
