      treatment with chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy (RT) is administered to all
      patients accord to the referring institutions protocol. Some patients will have undergone an
      attempted resection prior to inclusion. It is expected, that a substantial number of patients
      are participants in the LAPC-03 protocol (FOLFIRINOX followed by local therapy (resection, RT
      and/or IRE) in patients with LAPC).

      After completion of initial therapy, potential study participants are restaged with a PET-CT
      scan and serum tumor markers. Patients found on restaging to be free of metastatic disease
      and without significant primary tumor progression will be candidates for IRE therapy. IRE
      therapy will be administered not earlier than 2 weeks after completion of initial therapy.

      IRE will be done under general anesthesia as an in-patient procedure. Patients will attend
      study specific visits with PET-CT scan 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post-IRE. Patients will
      attend the out-patient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months. During this we
      will monitor pain, quality of life, global functioning and nutritional status.

      In patients who, at any time during the study, are assessed as candidates for resection, a
      more detailed re-evaluation of resectability is performed according to local preferences
      (e.g. EUS and/or LAP/LUS and/or CT and/or MR).
