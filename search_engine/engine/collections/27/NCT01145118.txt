      Characterize the unilateral PF syndrome using functional outcome measures, while comparing
      them to the healthy foot of the same patient. In addition the study will investigate the
      reliability of these functional outcome measures in PF patients.

      Methodology:

      Individuals referred to physiotherapy for PF will be assessed for eligibility and consent for
      the study. They will undergo two evaluations on the same week to evaluate the test- retest
      reliability of the functional measurements.
