      affect the patient's quality of life. Even if these side effects are ambulatory manageable,
      they require to be treated promptly and tends to increase the active list of patients of the
      thoracic oncology.

      Due to the alteration in the care provided to lung cancer patient, there is a need to
      coordinate the available means, inside and outside the hospital, to improve the quality of
      care and the quality of life of the patient.

      Every patient of the thoracic oncology department receives a personalized care program as a
      routine practice. In this study, a coordinating nurse (CN) will be added to the personalized
      care program. Patients newly diagnosed with a lung cancer will be randomized either in the
      group with a CN or in the group without a CN.

      The study will last one year maximum for each participant. Their quality of life, their
      satisfaction of the quality of the personalized care program - and their general
      practitioner's satisfaction - will be evaluated throughout the study.
