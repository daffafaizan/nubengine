      design. Dose escalation will occur if fewer than 33% of subjects within the dosing group
      experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. The starting sacituzumab govitecan dose will be 5
      mg/kg. If the starting dose is not acceptably tolerated, a lower dose of sacituzumab
      govitecan may need to be evaluated. Sacituzumab govitecan doses to be studied will be 5, 7.5,
      and 10 mg/kg Dose escalation will only occur if it is deemed to be acceptable after review of
      safety data up to Day 22. Once the recommended dose is determined, additional subjects with
      moderate hepatic impairment will be added, for a total of 8 subjects receiving the
      recommended dose. In addition, 8 subjects with normal hepatic function will receive
      sacituzumab govitecan 10 mg/kg. Serial blood samples will be collected on Day 1 and Day 8 for
      up to 7 days after dosing for PK assessments. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study.
      Subjects may be confined in the study center from the evening of Day 1 to Day 4 and Day 8 to
      Day 11 at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects will report to the study center on the
      study days for study procedures. Subjects will exit the study on Day 38. At the completion of
      the study, subjects who are deriving benefit from sacituzumab govitecan may continue to
      receive treatment in a rollover study (IMMU-132-14). Otherwise, all subjects must complete an
      End-of-Study (EOS) visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.
