      non-invasively and continuously with a high temporal resolution (0.1-0.2 Hz):

        -  Cerebral blood flow index (CBFi), i.e. an index that is proportional with CBF

        -  Concentration of oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb)

        -  Concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin (dHb)

        -  Total haemoglobin concentration (tHb)

        -  Tissue oxygen saturation (rStO2)

        -  Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen index (CMRO2i), i.e. an index that is proportional
           with CMRO2 Hence, the BabyLux device allows assessment of key parameters of cerebral
           haemodynamics and, in particular, to examine if the percentage change of cerebral
           metabolic rate for oxygen is close to the expected zero, as an external quality control
           of the separate NIRS parameters.

      There are no studies on RBC transfusion in neonates evaluating cerebral haemodynamic
      utilizing DCS and TRS combined.

      Hence, primary aim of this study is:

      - to assess the effect of RBC transfusion on cerebral haemodynamics and oxygenation as
      measured by the Babylux device.

      Secondary aims are:

        -  to quantify the effect of estimated âˆ†[Hb] on the differential path length factor (DPF);

        -  to compare two different NIRS devices and techniques. BabyLux measurement will be
           performed before and after RBC transfusion, whereas during RBC transfusion cerebral
           oxygenation will be monitored with a spatially resolved continuous wave (CW) NIRS.
