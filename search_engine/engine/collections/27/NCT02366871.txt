      thromboembolic events. It is advantageous as there is no need to perform routine blood
      monitoring tests including, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time
      (PTT) and Factor Xa, to determine clotting in participants receiving treatment. Several
      studies have shown the efficacy of apixaban for the treatment and prevention of a venous
      thromboembolism (VTE).

      We anticipate that the same efficacy could be replicated in the prevention of VTE in women
      undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer. An oral-anticoagulant for standard treatment for
      prevention of VTE outcomes following surgery could help improve the surgical mortalities
      associated with gynecologic oncology surgical patients, improve patient adherence for
      outpatient treatment, and reduce VTE surveillance and outcomes.
