      patients receiving colonoscopy for the different indications. All patients will receive low
      volume 2L alpha peg split preps given 8 hours apart at a rate of 1 cup q 30 minutes with
      addition of 1 L of pure water post each liter with the addition 10mg of bisacodyl the night
      before.

      In the trial, all adult inpatients (range, 18 to 80 years old) undergoing colonoscopy for CRC
      screening In MGH or with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms will be candidates for
      inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: outpatient status; serious
      medical condi¬tions, such as severe cardiac, renal, liver, or metabolic disease; stroke or
      dementia; major psychiatric illness; known allergy to polyethylene glycol (PEG); a previous
      colon resection; incomplete colonoscopy examination (failure of cecal intubation); or
      functional constipation defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria.

      Patient information was collected before procedure which included age, gender, weight,
      height, body mass index (BMI), indications for colonoscopy, and history of previous operation
      and colonoscopy, as well as bowel frequency. Patients will complete a questionnaire before
      colonoscopy regarding their preparation experience (the start and end time for PEG solution
      ingestion; the amount of PEG solution ingested; any associated adverse effects, includ¬ing
      abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and others; and willingness to repeat
      the same preparation in the future) with the help of an endoscopy nurse who will be blinded
      to the dietary randomization.

      Participants were categorized into subgroups with regard to compliance; good compliance was
      defined as less than 25% of the PEG solution remaining, and poor compliance was defined as
      25% or more of the PEG solution remaining. The subjects were randomly assigned to either eat
      Regular diet (RD), clear fluid diet (CLD) or low-residue diet (LRD) explained to each
      randomized case by in-hospital dietitian. In all three groups the offered diet was given at
      breakfast and lunch with fluids only given at dinner.
