      Organization (WHO), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), Western Consortium for Cancer
      Nursing Research WCCNR, and the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC)
      and others However, all of these oral mucositis grading systems rely on visual examination
      and are therefore subjective and operator-dependent tools and suffer from significant
      interpersonal variability (6). With the current improvements in medicine and technology,
      there is definitely a need for a more objective, easy to perform, non-invasive, affordable,
      quantitative and reproducible tool that is operator-independent to assess the severity of
      oral mucositis. The introduction of such a tool would greatly improve our ability to compare
      the oral mucosal toxicity of antineoplastic therapies and the efficacy of various
      mucoprotective therapies. Furthermore, the use of such a tool can be extended to patients
      undergoing radiation treatment with or without chemotherapy for various malignancies
      including head and neck cancers.
