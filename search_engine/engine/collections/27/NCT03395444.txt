      new drugs and new techniques in the postoperative management, pain after total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is still an unresolved issue. It affects the quality of life and
      rehabilitation of an important percentage of patients undergoing TKA. A recent study looked
      at the percentage of patients with chronic knee pain after knee replacement at a minimum of
      one year following surgery in 272 patients, 107 patients (nearly 40%) reported that they
      still had persistent pain at one-plus year following surgery. Central sensitization is now
      well established as an integral factor in many chronic pain states, including the commonly
      occurring knee and back pain. Many patients undergoing TKA are likely to have a significant
      degree of Central Sensitization, therefore the likely hood of high pain levels postoperative
      and persistent long standing pain after TKA is increased in this patient population.

      Pulsed shortwave therapy negates central sensitization by imputing new
