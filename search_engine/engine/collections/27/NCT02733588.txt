    
      This is a Phase 2a, single-center, open-label, proof-of-concept study designed to test the
      ability of the control algorithm to detect and direct timing of G-Pump™ glucagon infused from
      an OmniPod® pump to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia
      syndrome. While the algorithm will provide an alert as to when glucagon should be dosed to
      prevent hypoglycemia, there will be no automation in this clinical trial and it will
      ultimately be up to the physician to initiate dosing via the OmniPod® controller.

      Participant on continuous glucose monitoring will arrive at the clinic and IV line will be
      inserted for venous access. Subject will then be asked to drink a liquid mixed meal
      containing 60 g of carbohydrates, e.g. Boost® Nutritional Drink, over 10 minutes. Blood
      samples will be collected for glucose and hormone measurement.

      The open-loop system will be set to recognize low sensor glucose values, triggering an alert
      to the physician, who will deliver a bolus of 150 or 300 µg of glucagon via the pump, with
      the goal of preventing further decline in glucose values. Depending on response, a second
      bolus dose of 150 or 300 µg of glucagon may be administered. Plasma glucose will be measured
      after glucagon administration to ensure successful treatment and glucose stability, and
      glucagon levels will be analyzed concurrently to determine magnitude of increase above
      baseline. Sensors will be downloaded for subsequent analysis of appropriateness of alert
      timing and trigger for glucagon bolus delivery.
