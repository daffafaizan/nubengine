    
      This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study in Taiwan. Data will be collected by trained
      interviewers at the baseline (T0), 3-month follow-up (T1), 6-month follow-up (T2), 12-month
      follow-up (T3), 18-month follow-up (T4), and 24-month follow-up (T5). Via home visits,
      interviewer-administered questionnaires (informed consent, contact/follow-up information,
      background information, health condition, physical functioning, cognitive function, etc.)
      will be used. It estimates that the home visit will take up to 2 hours.

      The investigators will recruit at least 1200 eligible patients and caregivers (600 dyads)
      from at least 15 institutions (e.g., home clinics and hospitals) which provide home health
      care. Trained research assistants will touch based with eligible participants recommended by
      institution staff and invite them to take part in the study. To ensure the study are
      achieving the target sample the investigators will examine the distribution of living area
      and number of participants in each type of home health care unit during recruiting. Moreover,
      the investigators have estimated an attrition rate of 20% over the study. Higher drop-off
      rates in certain sub-groups may be problematic, so the investigators will monitor
      participants' attrition.

      In addition, the cohort the investigators enrolled will be linked to their data in Taiwan's
      National Health Insurance Research Database to analyze the medical resource utilization of
      participants in our study. The results will show the health status and resource utilization
      as well as quality of home health care in Taiwan for clinical practices, research and future
      policy making.
