    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate non-inferiority in the number of days to discharge readiness after a
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) + plerixafor-mobilized autologous stem cell
      transplant in patients receiving versus not receiving post-transplant growth factor support.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare days to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500, days to platelet engraftment,
      febrile days, days of febrile neutropenia, documented infections, and number of antibiotic
      days in patients receiving versus not receiving post-transplant growth factor support.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate immunological recovery (lymphocyte number including CD 3/4 and CD3/8 T cell
      subsets) at day + 60 in patients receiving versus not receiving post-transplant growth factor
      support.
