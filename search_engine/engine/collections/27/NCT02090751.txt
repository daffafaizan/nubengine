      bright light and then measuring their sensitivity to a flickering light. This sensitivity
      recovery has a typical appearance; an early rapid recovery mediated by the colour vision
      system (cone photoreceptors) and a slower recovery of the low light system (rod
      photoreceptors).

      If the measurements are made against a black background then a bi exponential model is
      suitable, however if a dim luminous background is used then the recovery is better modelled
      by a exponential bi linear model. We will use the exponential bilinear model, which has seven
      parameters. The parameters are as follows; the exponential cone phase is modelled by the cone
      threshold, cone coefficient, and cone time constant. The S2 rod phase is modelled by its
      commencement time. This is the time when the rod system becomes more sensitive than the cone
      system, sometimes called the cone-rod break point (alpha) and the slope of the subsequent
      thresholds. The late rod phase (S3) is similarly modelled by a transition time or rod-rod
      breakpoint (beta) and its slope.

      If the initial bright light is sufficiently intense then the recovery of the rod phase (S2)
      is termed rate limited. There is evidence that this recovery rate is a useful measure of the
      health of the light sensing layer of the eye an adjoining tissues, the retina, retinal
      pigment epithelium and choroid. It is these tissues that are thought to be affected in age
      related macular disease.

      In this study we will measure rate of rod recovery sometimes called the S2 phase. We want to
      see whether this measurement can be used to identify patients with and without early macular
      disease.
