      I. To evaluate the tumor response rate and response duration of treatment with Col-3 at two
      different dose levels- 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day in subjects with HIV related KS.

      II. To evaluate the biologic activity of Col-3 by measuring percent apoptotic cells on tumor
      biopsies pre- and post-treatment.

      III. To evaluate the effect of Col-3 on serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of Col-3 at two different dose levels in HIV related
      KS.

      II. To evaluate the effect of Col-3 on overall quality of life. III. To evaluate the
      relationship between clinical response and quantitative measures of KSHV/HHV-8 and HIV viral
      load.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive low-dose oral COL-3 once daily.

      Arm II: Patients receive high-dose oral COL-3 once daily.

      Treatment on both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed.

      Patients are followed for at least 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1.75 years.
