      reminiscence therapy manual proposed by Watt and Cappeliez (2000). According to the manual,
      the group consisted of six weekly sessions of 90 min each. During each weekly session, the
      memories recalled focused on a different theme.

      Data collection will occur on screening (as for baseline or pre-test), after intervention
      immediately (as for post-test), and three months after the intervention (as for follow-up).
      And outcome measures use standardized instruments with demonstrated validity and reliability:

      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Rosenberg self-esteem scale (SES) Life Satisfaction Index A
      (LSI-A) Russell's UCLA Loneliness Scale
