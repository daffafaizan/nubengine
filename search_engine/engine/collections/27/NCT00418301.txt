      exists that SCS may cause changes in cerebral blood flow. This study will be a novel PET
      examination of activity in brain regions affected by SCS. This activity will be compared with
      the pain intensity and distribution. Further, by examining cerebral blood flow at different
      doses of stimulation, relationships between SCS, brain perfusion, and pain relief can be
      drawn. This study will contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of action of SCS.
