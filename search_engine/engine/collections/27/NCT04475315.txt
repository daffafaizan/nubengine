      muscles. This technique has previously been used in conjunction with mitral valve surgery,
      and has shown significant benefits for the patients.

      The reduction in the lateral inter-papillary muscle separation and in the left ventricular
      volume provided by this technique is expected to improve ventricular function, limit
      progression of ventricular dilation, and avoid progression of MR when performed without
      mitral valve surgery in patients with symptomatic ventricular dilation.
