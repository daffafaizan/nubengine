      increased risk of ischaemic diseases. Around 40-50% of patients use, or have an indication,
      for antithrombotic drugs at the time of ICH. However, little is known about the benefits and
      harms of using antithrombotic drugs for prevention of ischaemic events in patients who have
      had an ICH.

      There are only observational studies addressing this question. Because of the lack of
      randomised-controlled trials and the inconclusive findings of the observational studies,
      guidelines have variably endorsed both starting and avoiding antithrombotic drugs after ICH.

      The investigators therefore want to study the effect and safety of using antithrombotic drugs
      after ICH. Furthermore, since findings on MRI can be biomarkers for subsequent bleeding,
      there will also be performed a sub-study of the association between such findings on MRI and
      risk of recurrent ICH during treatment with antithrombotic drugs.

      Patients with ICH during the last 6 months and with an indication for antithrombotic drugs
      will be included. Patients with vascular disease and indication for antiplatelet drugs will
      be randomised to antiplatelet treatment vs. no antithrombotic treatment. Patients with atrial
      fibrillation and indication for anticoagulant treatment will be randomised to anticoagulant
      treatment vs. no anticoagulant treatment. The follow up period is 2 years, and the primary
      effect variable is new ICH. The investigators will also assess new intracranial haemorrhage,
      extracranial haemorrhage and ischemic events, and functional and cognitive outcome.
