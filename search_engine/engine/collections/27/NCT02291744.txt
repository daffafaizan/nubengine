      progression time after induction therapy by the use of XELOX regimen, comparing XELOX regimen
      chemotherapy combined with or without surgical resection of the primary lesion from the time
      of randomization to maintenance therapy and reapplication of induction therapy, or time to
      the use of second line strategy (if no reapplication of induction therapy) or time to no
      further treatment.
