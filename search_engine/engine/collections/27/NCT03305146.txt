    
      Multicenter study to determinate the feasibility of intra-cystic fluid DNA molecular analysis
      in patients with suspected cystic tumours of pancreas in whom EUS FNA is clinically
      indicated.

      Morphological criteria obtained by MRI and computerised tomography (tumor characterization
      (size, metastases presence, dilatation of bile ducts), etiologic diagnosis, serious
      symptoms), biological exams (biomarkers), cytological analysis will lead to a diagnosis and a
      treatment.

      The goal of this study is to compare this standard diagnostic modalities to diagnosis
      obtained by intra-cystic fluid DNA molecular analysis.

      Is the DNA molecular analysis improve the diagnosis accuracy.
