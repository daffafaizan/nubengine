      Primary objective:

      To determine if pre-washing the catheter before insemination improves the pregnancy outcome
      in women undergoing IUI.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the ectopic
           pregnancy rate in women undergoing IUI.

        2. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the
           miscarriage rate in women undergoing IUI.

        3. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the multiple
           pregnancy rates in women undergoing IUI.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      The study will be a prospective double blind trial among women undergoing IUI at the MUHC
      reproductive centre using a cluster randomized design. The week will be defined as the unit
      for the clusters of randomization. Weeks will be allocated to one of the following groups:

        -  Group 1 = pre-washing group (patients will have the IUI with a pre-washed catheter
           during that week)

        -  Group 2 = control group (no pre-washing before IUI during that week)

      A random block size will be used to minimize the risk of non-blinding. The study is
      double-blind, neither the patients nor the physicians performing IUI will know whether the
      catheter was washed or not, as both the sample and the catheter will be prepared by the
      andrology lab technician. The cluster randomization design is justified since the management
      of the unit will not allow us to perform a randomization at the patient level.

      However a very low Intra-Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between patients is expected.
