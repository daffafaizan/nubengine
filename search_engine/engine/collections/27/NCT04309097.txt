      decision of school closure after the confirmation of coronavirus cases in the general
      population. In China, the burden of COVID-19 is among the highest in the world, with more
      than 80,000 cases confirmed by 11th March 2020. An estimate of 220 million children and
      adolescents are confined at home for weeks with inadequate level of physical activity and
      more susceptible to anxiety. There is also a concern of digital eye strain for many children
      who spend hours daily in front of a computer screen for recreation or learning purposes.

      Recess represents an essential scheduled period in a school day for psychological and
      physical relaxation. During the unusual period of home confinement, many schools have already
      issued physical activity requirement and policy recommending recess and physical activity
      breaks. However, recess could be easily skipped by students during online learning at home.

      Mobile health intervention offers a potential opportunity for capitalizing on digital
      technology as a feasible modality to encourage recess activities, especially in regions where
      social distancing is implemented as an emergency measure. The primary aim of the current
      study is to conduct a cluster-randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      novel digital intervention during recess in reducing anxiety and digital eye strain compared
      to usual care among Chinese children during the period of home confinement.
