      Epidemiologic studies have identified Factor V Leiden as the most common cause of heritable
      thrombophilia, a prothrombotic mutation associated with a 5 to 7-fold increase in the risk of
      venous thromboembolism (VTE). In pre-menopausal women, the use of oral contraceptives is
      associated with a 4-fold increase in VTE risk, and the joint effects of oral contraceptive
      use and Factor V Leiden carriership increase the VTE risk of by a factor of 35. Recently, the
      results of several observational studies and randomized clinical trials suggest that in
      post-menopausal women, the use of hormone replacement therapy is associated with a 3-fold
      increase in VTE risk. Whether post-menopausal women with prothrombotic mutations experience a
      similar 20-fold increase in risk when they take post-menopausal hormones remains unknown.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this case-control study, post-menopausal women with a first episode of objectively
      confirmed venous thromboembolism, and population-based controls were identified and recruited
      from the GHC enrollment files. Controls were frequency matched to the cases on age and
      calendar-year. Data collection included a review of ambulatory medical record and a telephone
      interview. The GHC computerized pharmacy database was used to assess exposure to hormone
      replacement therapy. A venous blood specimen was obtained from consenting subjects, processed
      into aliquots of white cells, plasma, and red cells, and stored at 70 degrees C prior to
      laboratory analysis. DNA was extracted from white cells, and molecular genotyping assays were
      conducted to assess carriership of prothrombotic mutations.
