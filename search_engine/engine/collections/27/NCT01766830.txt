      aims at developing integrated, evidence-based syndromic approach to improve management of
      NTD-related clinical syndromes. NIDIAG targets three non-specific clinical syndromes: the
      persistent fever, neurological, and intestinal syndrome. The objective of the project is to
      establish diagnostic guidelines for each of this syndrome, with a particular focus on severe
      and treatable neglected infectious diseases. The developed guidelines should integrate
      relevant Point-of-Care (POC)tests.

      The persistent fever syndrome targeted by NIDIAG is defined as presence of fever for at least
      one week. The list of diseases - both NTD and other Infectious Diseases (ID) - that
      frequently cause persistent (â‰¥1 week) fever in the study countries includes: Visceral
      Leishmaniasis (VL), Human Africa Trypanosomiasis (HAT), Enteric (typhoid, paratyphoid) fever,
      Malaria, Brucellosis, Melioidosis, Tuberculosis, Amoebic liver abscess, Relapsing fever, HIV,
      Rickettsial diseases, and Leptospirosis. The study will try to identify clinical and
      laboratory predictors of these diseases as well as validate existing RDTs.
