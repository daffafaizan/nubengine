      part of standard medical care. No additional patient procedures or activities are mandated by
      this study. The specific data to be collected at each visit and the schedule of data
      collection are listed in a schedule of assessments.

      The collection of safety events is considered essential to the Registry. The website will
      provide the opportunity to report the occurrence of targeted adverse events (AEs), other
      important events considered to be related to Increlex administration and serious adverse
      events (SAEs).
