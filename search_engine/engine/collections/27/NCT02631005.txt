      moderate-intensity exercise program, on pain, stiffness, and fatigue caused by lupus.
      Participants will receive a copy of the "Walk With Ease" workbook, a publication of the
      Arthritis Foundation. Participants will complete self-reported outcomes questionnaires prior
      to beginning the program and six weeks later at completion of the program. The questionnaires
      will include visual analog scales for pain, stiffness, and fatigue as well as a FACIT-Fatigue
      form. Participants will also complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the program.
