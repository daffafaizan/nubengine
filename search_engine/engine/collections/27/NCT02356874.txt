      the typical features of SpA with reduced spinal mobility, the main focus for exercise has
      been flexibility exercise. Exercise trials for this patient group have mainly aimed at
      improving spinal mobility and there is limited evidence of the potential effects of exercise
      on disease pathogenesis and CVD risk factors.
