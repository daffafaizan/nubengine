      COPD exacerbation are poorly understood, but airway innate immune system has been implicated
      in its development. Air pollution contributes to development of COPD exacerbation, and
      exposure to ozone, a major component of air pollution, is associated with increased
      healthcare utilization among patients with COPD. Inhalation of ambient levels of ozone is
      known to affect airway innate immune system. This proposal sets out to characterize and
      investigate the role of innate immune system and in particular airway macrophages in
      ozone-induced COPD exacerbation through establishing an experimental model that employs
      controlled ozone exposure and longitudinal sampling via bronchoscopy. The research plan
      proposes to examine human immune cells trafficking in airways during the process of
      ozone-induced airway injury and inflammation in patients with COPD. The investigator's
      overall hypothesis is that inhalational challenge to a high ambient level of ozone in
      patients with COPD provides a safe human model of airway injury with resulting intraluminal
      shifts in the population and polarization of macrophages to study innate immunity processes
      relevant to ozone-induced COPD exacerbation.
