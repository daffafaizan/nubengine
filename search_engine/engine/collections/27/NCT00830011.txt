    
      Research Design: A randomized mixed factorial controlled design will be employed in which CBT
      plus standard pharmaceutical care (CBT/SC) is compared to a standard pharmaceutical care (SC)
      treatment condition. Participants will be randomized in equal numbers to the two conditions.
      Repeated assessments of key outcome domains will occur at pretreatment/baseline and at 12, 24
      and 36 weeks following baseline.

      Methodology: Study participants will be evaluated pre-treatment (baseline), 12 weeks
      post-baseline (post-treatment) and at 24 and 36 weeks post-baseline (follow-up). Baseline
      assessment will include a neurological examination with a nerve conduction study to confirm
      the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity.
      Secondary outcome measures will be pain quality, pain-related disability, physical and
      emotional functioning. Measures of treatment feasibility will also be examined. Participants
      receiving CBT will attend 10 weekly, group treatment sessions of 90 minutes. A target sample
      size of approximately 120 participants will be recruited.
