      TIGRIS System, in cervical cancer screening programs. This will be achieved by determining
      the performance of the assay for detecting high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types in
      women with known cervical disease status. The assay will be evaluated in sample populations
      of women with ASC-US Pap test results ("ASC-US results") and women 30 years of age or older
      ("30+ years of age") with negative (NILM) cytology results.
