    
      In four groups of allergic children (peanuts, wheat , milk and egg), a reintroduction of 4
      small increasing doses of allergen is carried out progressively double-blind placebo- cons ,
      randomized, during a hospitalization.

      The procedure for reintroduction of small doses (MPD) is stopped at the appearance of
      intolerance (in taking a dose of allergen or placebo) defined by the onset of allergic
      symptoms or objective severe abdominal pain within 45 minutes of taking.
