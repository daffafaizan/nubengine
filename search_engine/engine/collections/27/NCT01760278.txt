           cultured in the Embryoscope. The control arm in which the embryos of patients will be
           cultured under conventional conditions.

        2. Embryos to be transferred will be identified by the Embryoviewer in the Study arm and
           the ones in the control arm will be identified by established subjective morphological
           criteria.

        3. Embryos with definite implantation potential will be transferred in both arms.

        4. Embryos not transferred will be frozen and/or discarded in both arms.
