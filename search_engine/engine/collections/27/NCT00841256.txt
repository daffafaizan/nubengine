      in some patients. Alternative routes, e.g. nasal and oral, have therefore been investigated
      to find an immunotherapy regimen largely accepted by all groups of patients, including
      children.

      Sublingual specific immunotherapy (SLIT) may represent a more acceptable route of
      immunotherapy. It may be an optimal therapy option especially for children because they often
      fear injections.

      In this study children are to be treated with a preparation of a grass pollen allergen
      extract in a water/glycerol solution with phosphate buffered saline in comparison to a
      symptomatic standard treatment with add on placebo, in order to investigate efficacy and
      safety of the study drug.
