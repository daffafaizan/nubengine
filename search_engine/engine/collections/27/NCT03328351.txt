      The sample size was calculated using G*power 3.1(F test, analysis of variance [ANOVA]:
      repeated measure, within between interaction, and a priori: compute required sample size). A
      result of 10 participants (treatment group=5 and sham group=5) was used to calculate the
      effect size (ES) of 0.44 for the pressure pain threshold on the cervical spine after the
      intervention(immediate effect) between group. The power estimated for ANOVA for the two group
      with a significance of 0.05 revealed that a total sample size of 28 participants was
      necessary to obtain a power of 0.80. . a minimum of 14 needed to be recruited in this study
      Participants with unilateral neck pain and radiating symptoms to upper extremity of more than
      three months were recruited from King Abdul-Aziz Hospital and East Jeddah general hospital in
      Jeddah, Saudia Arabia All patients signed a consent form before they participate in the study
      after explaining all procedures to them. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
      Board (IRB) at the University of Dammam (IRB Number: PGS-20160-30-142) and was approved by
      ministry of health at Saudia Arabia (IRB number: H-02J-002). All electronic data pertinent to
      the patients were being saved in a secured laptop, whereas the paper document will be kept in
      a locked cabinet.

      Data analysis:

      All statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 20 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).
      Significance levels will be set at p â‰¤ 0.05. Mean and standard deviation will be calculated
      as descriptive statistics. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post
      hoc comparison, if needed will calculate the differences in the outcome measures: Quantitive
      sensory testing (QST), pain intensity, and active CROM
