      widespread and in patients undergoing chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy it is common in 80%
      of patients. Literature stress the need for systematic studies in cancer populations with
      different types of cancer and at different stages of the disease using patient-oriented
      fatigue assessment tools. The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is one of the scales used
      precisely in the evaluation of this syndrome and has proved to be a reliable and easy to use
      tool, also validated in Italian. Several authors have also shown that reduced physical
      activity and a worse quality of life are associated with fatigue, particularly in young
      patients.Several authors describe the experience of 11 new sarcoma patients undergoing
      chemotherapy treatment. Fatigue had been described as the prevalent symptom and was related
      to a worse quality of life.
