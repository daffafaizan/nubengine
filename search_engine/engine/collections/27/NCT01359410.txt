      pancreatectomy. Historically, previous attempts to reduce the leak rate have met with limited
      success. To examine this problem the investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial of
      stapled pancreatic transection versus mesh reinforced stapled pancreatic transection. For the
      duration of the study period, participating surgeons will utilize a standardized staple
      technique. Either a reabsorbable polytrimethylene carbonate mesh (SEAMGUARD®) or reabsorbable
      strips of bovine pericardium (PERI-STRIPS DRY®) will be used to reinforce the stapled
      pancreatic transection line in the test group. In order to have a uniform test method, the
      investigators will utilize a laparoscopic stapling device for both open and laparoscopic
      procedures and a uniform staple size (4.8mm). A drain will be placed in the left upper
      quadrant at the time of resection. Drainage of the pancreatic resection bed is widely
      accepted and remains our current standard of care.
