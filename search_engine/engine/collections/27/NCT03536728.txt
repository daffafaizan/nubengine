      dicaprate (AMXT1501) in combination with DFMO in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Secondary objectives include characterization of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMXT 1501 as
      well as pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of the impact of AMXT 1501 in combination with DFMO
      on polyamine uptake by circulating lymphocytes (blood cells).

      To these aims, the study will evaluate the safety, PK and PD profiles of orally-administered
      AMXT 1501 and DFMO. Approximately, 52 patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMXT 1501 and DFMO in
      combination. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below at which dose escalation is
      stopped.
