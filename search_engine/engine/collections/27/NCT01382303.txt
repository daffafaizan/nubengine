      spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio over 30mg/g in two consecutive measurements.

      Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive pentoxifylline (400mg three times
      daily) or placebo for 24 weeks.

      Fasting blood and spot urine will be collected at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      The investigators will evaluate the impact of pentoxifylline on proteinuria in type 2
      diabetic patients.
