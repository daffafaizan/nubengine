      epilepsy and ataxia are observed during Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) and virus is
      recovered in CSF, CNS is involved with strain-dependent severity in mice and rats infected by
      murine hepatitis virus, and murine infection with MHV A59 strain is a model of multiple
      sclerosis (MS). Mice encephalitis occurs through infection of olfactory bulb and spreads
      along the axonal pathway. Viral antigens and neuronal apoptosis are observed in brainstem and
      hypothalamus, without minimal or absent inflammation.

      Most COVID-19 patients with neurologic impairment displayed expected complications of severe
      infections (e.g. neuropathy and muscle loss, stroke) but encephalitis remained exceptional,
      as previously observed in SRAS. It is argued that central lesions may explain some of the
      clinical features ventilation failure, or disproportionate residual fatigue and cognition
      impairment in survivors of severe COVID infection. According to data obtained from various
      coronavirus infections in animals, the investigators ask if severe COVID infection in human
      could be associated with sub-clinical encephalitis. This clinical trial examines highly
      sensitive blood biomarkers of brain dysfunction in correlation with late clinical outcome.
      Biomarkers are neurofilament light chain (NFL) and GFAP. Clinical outcomes are death, signs
      of central neurologic sequellae, and fatigue. Clinical examination and blood samples will be
      obtained at inclusion (d0), which is mostly the entrance in intensive care unit (ICU), at day
      7 (between day 4 and exit from ICU) and at day 60.
