      medicine-based occupational therapy (OT) model of care that brings client voices to the
      forefront of treatment planning and intervention to enhance the existing interdisciplinary
      system of service delivery within Midtown Community Mental Health (MCMH). The investigators
      hope to accomplish this objective via the following specific aims:1) Assess current
      programming - particularly processes surrounding client assessment, treatment planning,
      intervention, care-coordination/residential placement, and discharge - within MCMH sites to
      better understand limitations/gaps previously identified by the site manager that impact
      equitable and effective treatment 2) Adapt an existing care model - the Art of Healing
      Wellness Model (AoHW) - to meet the needs of MCMH, implement the model using an OT
      practitioner, and track feasibility/acceptability outcomes. 3) Re-assess MCMH programming
      post implementation to identify/demonstrate change resulting from the model 4) Using OT in
      the role of consultant, offer training to current MCMH staff to enable implementation of the
      adapted AoHW by MCMH (baccalaureate level) care coordinators 5) Preliminarily evaluate
      usability of the adapted AoHW by MCMH staff via focus groups following training and staff
      implementation
