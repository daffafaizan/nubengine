    
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic debilitating musculoskeletal pain syndrome that causes substantial
      physical and psychological impairments. The provisional criteria of the ACR 2010 and the 2011
      self-report modification for survey and clinical research are widely used for fibromyalgia
      diagnosis. However, there is no Chinese version of fibromyalgia diagnosis criteria and
      severity assessment scales until now. The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability
      and the validity of the Chinese version of the 2011ModCr and 2016 ACR revisions to the
      2011ModCr, as well as its quantification scale, the Chinese version of Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire (FIQ-C) and Revised FIQ (FIQR-C). In this study, we'll divide patients with
      chronic pain without psychiatric disorders other than depression into two groups according to
      the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, a fibromyalgia group and a
      non-fibromyalgia group. Patients in both groups will be assessed using the 2011ModCr and 2016
      ACR revisions to the 2011ModCr. Furthermore, those in the fibromyalgia group will also
      complete FIQ-C, FIQR-C and several other validated questionnaires including the Medical
      Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), ect.
