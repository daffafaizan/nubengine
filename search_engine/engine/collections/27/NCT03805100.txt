      with wAMD. Approximately 580 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either LucentisÂ® or the investigational product, Xlucane in the study eye once every
      4 weeks for 52 weeks. The study eye will be defined as the eye meeting the enrollment
      criteria. The assigned study drug will be administered as an ophthalmic intravitreal (IVT)
      injection. A subgroup of 60 subjects at a select number of participating sites will be
      sequentially asked to participate in an evaluation of PK.
