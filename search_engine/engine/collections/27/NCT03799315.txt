      discharge from jail. During these assessments, seven-day point prevalence abstinence will be
      bio-verified with exhaled carbon monoxide, and self-reported general health, physical health,
      mental health, and substance use measures will also be obtained. The analysis is fully
      powered (i.e., power > .8) to detect significant between group effects on the primary outcome
      (i.e., the longitudinal, between group effect on bio-verified seven-day point prevalence
      abstinence over the 3 weeks post discharge). All analyses will be conducted on the intent to
      treat sample and will utilize pre-specified logistic and linear regression models.
