      invasive strategy with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been demonstrated to be
      the most effective strategy to treat AMI. Although drug-eluting stent (DES) has not shown
      benefits to reduce mortality rate among AMI patients compared with bare-metal stent (BMS),
      the use of DES in real-world is increasing because of reduced restenosis rates. AMI patients
      are at higher risk to develop atrial fibrillation (AF) than general population. However,
      whether early PCI with DES implantation is related to a reduced risk of AF still remains
      unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of DES implantation and
      the risk of AF among patients with AMI treated by early PCI.
