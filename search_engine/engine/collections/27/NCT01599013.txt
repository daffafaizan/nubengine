    
      Gemcitabine and carboplatin have been the most studied and used anticancer agents in
      cisplatin-unfit patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. Both agents previously
      demonstrated clinical activity as single agent and/or as part of combination regimen in
      patients with advanced or metastatic disease even if clinical benefits and survival remains
      limited in this setting for this population.

      The purpose of this study is to test in a randomized trial enrolling patients with renal
      impairment or moderate congestive heart failure two combinations of a novel cytotoxic agent,
      vinflunine, one with gemcitabine and another with carboplatin in order to determine the most
      promising combination in the first line treatment of advanced/metastatic urothelial
      carcinoma.
