      associated with significant morbidities. Poor compliance with positive airway pressure
      therapy remains an issue and leads to suboptimal treatment in children with OSA. Alternative
      therapeutic strategy is needed to manage this group of patients more effectively.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in children
      with OSA.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that HFNC therapy is effective in reducing the
      severity of OSA in children.

      Design: A 2-phase study - phase 1 is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy of HFNC
      therapy in children with OSA, phase 2 is an intervention period to evaluate the compliance
      and quality of life with HFNC therapy.

      Subjects: 46 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old with a diagnosis of
      moderate-to-severe OSA requiring CPAP therapy.

      Methods: In phase 1 study, eligible subject will be recruited for HFNC therapy titration with
      PSG to assess treatment efficacy. After titration, if HFNC therapy is shown to be effective,
      the participants will be recruited into the phase 2 intervention period to evaluate the
      compliance and quality of life with HFNC therapy. At baseline and follow-up visits,
      neurobehavioural and quality of life surveys will be completed, compliance data will be
      obtained.

      Primary outcome measure: Efficacy of the HFNC therapy, as defined by the change in OAHI from
      baseline to that with HFNC therapy.

      Expected results: Efficacy data to determine whether HFNC therapy can be an alternative
      therapy for children with OSA.
