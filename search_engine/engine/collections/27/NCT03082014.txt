      European countries: Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three sequences of
      antihypertensive treatment which are given as open-label oral medications in standard dose in
      the following order

      Arm A: Amlodipine > Losartan > Atenolol

      Arm B: Atenolol > Amlodipine > Losartan

      Arm C: Losartan > Atenolol > Amlodipine.

      The study starts with a two week run-in phase. During these first two weeks, patients are not
      allowed to take antihypertensive drugs except for the rescue medication. After the run-in
      period,every patient will take subsequently three different antihypertensive drugs (each drug
      from a separate drug class) according to the randomly assigned arm. Each study drug will be
      administered for four weeks.

      Patients will be monitored telemetrically with a dedicated BP device during the whole trial
      period of 14 weeks.
