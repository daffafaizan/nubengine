      contrast-enhanced CT scans done in a specified time period. Serum creatinine at baseline and
      at 48-72 hours post-contrast of the participants will be compared to determine presence of
      post contrast AKI (PC-AKI). Data on the participants' demographics, comorbidities, laboratory
      results and use of nephrotoxins will also be captured and analysed.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of AKI after intravenous
      contrast administration for contrast enhanced CT scans (CECT). The secondary objective is to
      identify risk factors of PC-AKI and possibly come up with a risk stratification system that
      can be utilized in clinical practice. The investigators hypothesize that there is significant
      risk of acute kidney injury after intravenous contrast media administration, but it lower
      than that in the setting of intraarterial contrast; and that risk factors of AKI may include:
      pre existing chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, proteinuria, use of
      nephrotoxins, age, increased dose of contrast.
