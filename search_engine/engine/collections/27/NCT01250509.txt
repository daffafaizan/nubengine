      Carroll et al. 2002). Obesity, in particular, abdominal obesity, confers increased risk for a
      host of diseases, including hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease,
      resulting in shortened life span (Fontaine, Redden et al. 2003). Psychological stress is
      widely cited anecdotally as a factor that causes people to engage in overeating, and studies
      provide strong evidence that stress can promote obesity. Stress induces selective preference
      of sweet, high-fat food and increases visceral fat depots. The telomere maintenance system
      (telomerase activity and telomere length)are markers of cellular aging and predict mortality
      (Cawthon et al, 2003)and have been linked to both psychological stress and components of the
      metabolic syndrome. The proposed study adapts a program called Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) that has been shown to be effective in a variety of other stress-related
      conditions. Fifty overweight, pre-menopausal women at risk for the Metabolic Syndrome will be
      randomized in a 1:1 distribution to either a 3-month intervention to reduce stress and
      overeating [Craving and Lifestyle Management with Mindfulness (CALMM)] or wait list control
      group. The primary outcome measures include amounts of abdominal fat, weight, and telomerase
      activity. Data from this study are intended to provide pilot data for use in planning a
      larger randomized, controlled trial that will investigate the effects of the CALMM
      intervention on the metabolic and psychological processes assessed in this pilot study.
