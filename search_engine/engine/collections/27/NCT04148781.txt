    
      Optic Neuritis (ON) is a condition that occurs in approximately 50% of individuals with
      relapse remitting MS, and is the presenting event in 15-20% of patients who go on to develop
      MS. ON usually presents with a decline in vision over several days to weeks with painful eye
      movements.

      Fampridine-SR is currently a Health Canada approved medication to treat walking impairment in
      persons with MS. Some small studies in the past have shown that Fampridine-SR may also have
      positive effects on visual functioning in those experiencing ON.

      This study will aim to assess the effect of taking Fampridine-SR for 8 weeks in 20 MS
      patients with unresolved optic neuritis on measures of visual functioning, and to determine
      the best measures to use in a future large scale study. The results of this study will also
      be used to estimate how many participants we will need in the future large scale study.
