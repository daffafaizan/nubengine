      treatment assigned), single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy adult
      volunteers. Canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitor) is currently under
      development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Healthy volunteers will take canagliflozin 50 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg tablets, orally (by
      mouth), once daily on Day 1 and on Days 4 to 9. All study drug administration will occur at
      approximately the same time each morning with 240 mL of noncarbonated water and will be
      followed by a standardized breakfast within 10 minutes.
