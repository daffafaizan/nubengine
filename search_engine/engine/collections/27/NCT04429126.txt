      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can persist up to months or years after head injury.
      However, thus far, only few non-pharmacological interventions, such as mindfulness, are
      implemented in reducing fatigue in TBI survivors. Prior works have suggested that acupressure
      can significantly improve fatigue in different populations, such as cancers survivors and
      patients with hemodialysis. Therefore, we would like to test whether acupressure effectively
      improve fatigue after TBI.
