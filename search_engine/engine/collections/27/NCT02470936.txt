      lifestyle intervention vs. usual care among men with low risk prostate cancer. We will
      recruit and consent 76 men with prostate cancer at UCSF. The subjects will be asked to
      complete questionnaires, 7 days accelerometer measurement, body measurements (weight, waist,
      hip, pulse, blood pressure) and collection of blood specimen at baseline and 3 months.
      Subjects will be randomized into two arms (Intervention Group and Control Group). The
      Intervention Group (N=38) will have access to the lifestyle website and an activity monitor
      (e.g., Fitbit), receive text messages, and be provided with individualized lifestyle
      recommendations. The Control Group (N=38) will have standard of care and be asked to continue
      with their usual lifestyle habits. They will receive access to the lifestyle website and be
      provided with individualized lifestyle recommendations at 3 months.
