      expressed on most Multiple Myeloma cells so it is an ideal target for CAR-T. In this study,
      investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting BCMA in patients with
      relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma. The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment,
      including adverse events and disease status after treatment.
