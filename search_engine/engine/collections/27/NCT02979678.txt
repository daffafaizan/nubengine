           additional issues relevant for new treatment strategies. A total of 5-10 patients from
           different countries (5-8) as well as health care professionals (5/country) will be
           interviewed (Phase 1).

        2. Operationalization of the issues into items; a provisional version of a the
           questionnaire and a hypothetic scale structure will be established (Phase2).

        3. The resulting provisional updated module will be tested with respect to understanding,
           comprehensiveness and applicability (according to the EORTC Module Development
           Guidelines). The items will be translated from English into other languages following a
           standardized forward-backward procedure. Total aof 260 patients will be interviewed from
           different cultural areas: Northern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, Asia (Phase
           3).

        4. The module and its scale structure will be field-tested in a large, international group
           of patients in order to determine its acceptability, reliability, validity,
           responsiveness and crosscultural applicability .
