      Increased levels of TGF-β2 in the eye have been linked to trabecular meshwork transformation,
      increased intraocular pressure and direct optic nerve damage.

      Trabeculectomy is the standard surgical intervention to reduce intraocular pressure in
      subjects no longer sufficiently responding to pressure-lowering medications. Scarring of the
      surgically opened canal (bleb) often abolishes the effect of trabeculectomy (despite the
      intraoperative use of Mitomycin C to prevent this). TGF-β2 has been described to play a
      distinct role in the fibrotic process of bleb closure.
