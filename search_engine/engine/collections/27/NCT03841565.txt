    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (partial response [PR], very good partial response
      [VGPR], complete response [CR], or stringent complete response [sCR]) of daratumumab
      retreatment in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with
      relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival and overall survival associated with retreatment with
      daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To determine the toxicities associated with retreatment with daratumumab in combination
      with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and daratumumab
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2, days 1-15 of cycles 3-6, and day 1
      of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
      cycles 1-12. Cycles every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for every 3 months until
      subsequent treatment or progressive disease, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
