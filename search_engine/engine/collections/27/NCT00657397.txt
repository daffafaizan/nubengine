      one year of treatment in patients inducted in primary care (PC) vs.those inducted in a
      specialised center for substance dependence (CSAPA).

      In this multisite, open-label, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial, opioid dependent
      individuals were randomized to start methadone either in PC or in a CSAPA. After
      stabilization of methadone dosage (~2 weeks), patients could change arm. Follow-up
      assessments through medical questionnaires and phone interviews was scheduled at month 0 (M0,
      enrolment) M3, M6, M12. The opiate treatment index (OTI) was used for computing the
      proportion of patients reporting no use of street opioids in the last month at M12 (primary
      outcome) in those inducted in PC or in a CSAPA and the non inferiority margins.

      Primary analysis was by intention to treat (ITT)
