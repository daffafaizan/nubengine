    
      This is an eight week study to clinically evaluate the effect of the low intensity long
      duration ultrasound (LITUS) device on symptoms of patients suffering from knee
      osteoarthritis. The device, samÂ® has been FDA-cleared for use. For the first two weeks of the
      study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain scores (NRS) three times per
      day. During the following 6 weeks, patients will self-apply the wearable LITUS device to
      their affected knee for 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores (NRS) will be
      recorded immediately before application of LITUS device as well as 30 minutes, 2-hours and
      4-hours after applying the device. A quality of life assessment (WOMAC), muscle strength and
      range of motion assessment (JTech) will be performed prior to the patient beginning the
      protocol and at the conclusion of the protocol.

      Up to 93 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study site. The study
      is designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and
      socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals where non-pharmacotherapies do not exist to manage
      pain. Subjects will be randomly assigned to active (60%) and placebo groups (40%). The
      sponsor and investigators are blinded as to which type of device each patient is assigned.

      The study will be monitored by an external monitor and a data safety monitoring board (DSMB).
