    
      Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who have received treatment with adalimumab
      (loading dose of 80 mg and thereafter 40 mg s.c. biweekly) for at least 6 weeks without a
      PASI reduction of 75% or greater qualify for the study. Adalimumab is continued and UVB-311nm
      phototherapy is added at 6 weeks or thereafter one a randomized body half (left or right;
      head exempt) 3 x per week until complete response (defined as reduction in PASI to < 3) for a
      maximum of another 6 weeks (until week 12). PASI score, visual analogue score (VAS) patient
      score for therapeutic response, and VAS patient score for severity of skin lesions is
      assessed weekly; and at follow-up visits at month 3, 6, and 12. Paired Wilcoxon testing for
      differences in PASI and patient VAS scores is done; Fischer exact test is applied to
      determine differences in complete remission, PASI reduction > 90%, > 75% and/or 50% between
      body sites.
