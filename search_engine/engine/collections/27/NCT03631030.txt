      diagnosed with chronic joint pain (â‰¥ 3 months), scheduled to receive Radiofrequency
      denervation and meet the selection criteria are eligible to participate in this study. The
      specific targeted areas of interest in this study will include Cervical facet joints,
      Thoracic facet joints, Lumbar facet joints, Sacroiliac (SI) region, hip and knee.

      The treating physician will follow Standard of Care treatment for all enrolled subjects. As
      illustrated in Figure 1, the study consists of a screening visit, a treatment visit and a
      follow up visit. All subjects receiving CRFA will receive an MRI 2 - 7 days after the CRFA
      procedure. Subjects receiving CRFA of the Sacroiliac Joint will also receive an MRI within 30
      days prior to the CRFA procedure. The treating physician may also request an MRI be performed
      prior to the procedure for subjects receiving CRFA of other targeted areas. The point of
      enrollment for each subject is the time that they sign the Informed Consent Form.

      MRI data will be reviewed by the radiologist on a per patient basis to confirm lesion
      characteristics. It is anticipated that 3-5 subjects per level will be needed to fully
      quantify lesion characteristics, however; enrollment will remain flexible for each targeted
      area based on real time review of MRI data.
