      past trials have not detected a cardiovascular benefit. A promising and unexplored
      explanation for these results is that the interventions were delivered too late in the
      natural history of CAD. Because no study has evaluated this possibility, there is a critical
      need to determine whether evidence-based depression treatment, delivered before the onset of
      clinical CAD, reduces cardiovascular risk. Accordingly, the objective of the proposed
      clinical and translational research is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of
      a highly disseminable depression intervention in decreasing CAD risk. To achieve this goal, a
      clinical trial of depressed primary care patients free of cardiovascular disease is being
      conducted. Patients will be randomized to usual care or a computer-based, cognitive
      behavioral intervention called Beating the Blues®, the most widely used and empirically
      supported computerized treatment program for depression. The primary outcome is brachial
      artery flow-mediated dilation, a noninvasive measure of endothelial function. The specific
      aim of the proposed trial is to evaluate whether Beating the Blues®, delivered prior to the
      onset of clinical CAD, improves endothelial dysfunction. Demonstrating that earlier treatment
      of depression with Beating the Blues lowers CAD risk, the long-term expected outcome, would
      place computed-based depression treatment in the armamentarium of CAD prevention strategies
      of the primary care provider. This change to clinical practice should result in improved
      cardiovascular risk management, which in turn would translate into reduced CAD morbidity and
      mortality.
