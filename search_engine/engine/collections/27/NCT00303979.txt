    
      IMPROVE HF, the largest US outpatient HF patient registry, has substantially contributed to
      our knowledge of how systolic HF and post MI left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD)
      patients are treated in the outpatient setting.

      The findings of IMPROVE HF clearly support this guideline and may help to establish a model
      framework for future performance improvement programs for outpatient cardiology practices.
