    
      The main objectives of this study are to study the role of the innate and adaptive immune
      response in allo-antibody formation and furthermore to identify the genetic and time
      dependent clinical risk factors on alloimmunization in SCD patients.

      Subjects without allo-antibodies, receiving a red blood cell transfusion, will be included in
      this study. At 5 time points blood will be drawn from these subjects. (T0: Before
      transfusion, T1: 1 day after transfusion, T2: 1 week after transfusion, T3: 4 weeks after
      transfusion, T4: 6 months after transfusion).

      At each time point specific markers of the immune system will be measured.
