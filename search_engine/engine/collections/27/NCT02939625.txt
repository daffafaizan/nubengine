      adhere adequately.

      There is need for further research into non-pharmacological therapies for clinical asthma
      control and in turn the use of CPAP and bilevel pressure in the airways has shown beneficial
      effects on autonomic modulation and bronchial responsiveness leading to the hypothesis that
      these therapies also have effects on the BIE.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect
      of these non-pharmacological therapies in several variables and especially the BIE.
