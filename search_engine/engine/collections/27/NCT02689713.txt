    
      This single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled pilot study conducted
      at San Antonio Military Medical Center will evaluate the effectiveness of topical
      voriconazole for pain relief at autogenous skin donor sites compared to a topical placebo
      application. The patients will act as their own control. All participants and investigators
      in the study will be blinded to the treatment arm utilized on each of the patient's donor
      sites (voriconazole versus placebo). Patients, who are scheduled for skin grafting and have
      met the inclusion criteria for this study, will be invited to enroll in the study. Only those
      patients who have been planned for skin graft sites that are approximately symmetrical in
      size will be allowed to enroll in the study. The donor site wounds will be studied using a
      paired design consisting of voriconazole or the placebo applied topically to same-patient
      matched donor sites. Patients will be queried via the pain assessment tool as to perceived
      pain at timed intervals. Dialysate samples will be collected via microdialysis probes at
      matching timed intervals in order to measure levels of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites
      shown in previous studies to be present in peripheral nerves.
