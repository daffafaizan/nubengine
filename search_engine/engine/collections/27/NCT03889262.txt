      It is widely used in many countries in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases (Multiple
      Sclerosis, stroke, Cerebral Palsy, etc.). Although the use of hippotherapy is widespread,
      many people can not reach and use this method effectively because of many reasons such as the
      high cost of caring, feeding, and sheltering horses or fear of people from horses. In recent
      years, hippotherapy simulation devices (mechanic and robotic horses) have been developed to
      overcome these problems. These devices aim to create the effects of hippotherapy on people by
      simulating a real horse's movement. The aim of this project is to develop and produce a
      simulated hippotherapy system, which can be controlled by electromyography (EMG) signals
      coming from the rider, movements programmable (for different musculoskeletal problems),
      rehabilitation-specific, providing evaluation during therapy, integrating virtual reality
      system and therapy games and investigate its effectiveness in children with cerebral palsy.
