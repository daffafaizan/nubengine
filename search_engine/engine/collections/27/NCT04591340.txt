      should follow the principle of sequential treatment of nutrition, which is the preferred
      scheme with individualized dietary advice or oral nutritional supplement, if their energy
      intake will not reach 60% of the goal level during the transplanting, then supplementary
      parenteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition is needed. The standardized nutrition
      therapy aims to improve quality of life and long-term survival rate of patients, reduce the
      complications and social burden of disease.
