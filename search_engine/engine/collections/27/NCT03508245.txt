      fail to significantly benefit from existing tic treatments. Case studies have shown morning
      exposure to light therapy, known to advance circadian phase is associated with modest to
      large tic reductions (Coles & Strauss, 2013; Niederhofer, 2003) suggesting the presence of
      circadian abnormalities (i.e., phase delay) in select individuals with PTDs. The present
      project assesses circadian phase and morningness-eveningness preference in youth with
      Persistent Tic Disorders (PTDs), including Tourette's Disorder (TD), and examines whether
      morning use of wearable short wavelength light therapy is associated with shifts in circadian
      rhythms and reductions in tic severity.

      Study participation will take place over a three-week period. Clinician-rated tic interview
      and rating scales of morningness-eveningness preference, sleep, tic, and other symptoms will
      be completed during an initial screening assessment. Participants will then monitor sleep at
      home using an actigraph for one week and return for a baseline clinical assessment of tic
      severity and evening assessment of internal melatonin levels involving saliva sampling every
      30 minutes for 6.5 hours in a dimly lit room. Next, participants will complete an abbreviated
      course (i.e., two weeks) of morning light therapy using wearable short wavelength (i.e.,
      blue-green) light-emitting glasses while continuing to monitor sleep using the actigraph.
      Following this two-week period participants will return for a final assessment of tic
      severity and internal melatonin levels.
