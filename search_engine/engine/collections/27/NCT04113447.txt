      Donation and to perform internationally validated Bayley-III developmental assessment tool at
      18 months (corrected for gestational age).

      The null hypothesis for this research is that children born following the use of
      Mitochondrial Donation (IVF) techniques have normal neurodevelopment developmental outcomes
      at 18 months.
