      adults. Participants assigned to the intervention group will train weekly on a special
      treadmill that will simulate tripping. Patients not assigned to the tripping program will
      walk on a standard treadmill. The training program will last for 4 weeks. Upon completion,
      participants will complete a test where a trip is simulated. Those assigned to the
      intervention group will test one additional time as well.
