      epithelial lining of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Three modalities of therapy have
      established roles in the treatment of carcinoma of the head and neck: chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy (XRT), and surgery. The choice of modality depends upon many factors such as the site
      and extent of the primary lesion, the likelihood of complete surgical resection, the presence
      of lymph node metastases, etc. Traditionally, smaller lesions (stage T1-T2) are effectively
      treated either, by surgical excision or irradiation whereas more advanced disease (stage
      III-IV) is treated with combined surgery and XRT. The subsequent morbidity related to
      extensive surgery is a major problem among survivors. Clearly, there is a need to develop
      therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced head and neck cancer with more effective
      approaches employing non-surgical modalities.

      Our hypothesis is that head and neck cancers are resistant to apoptosis from DNA damage
      induced by radiation and chemotherapy. This resistance is mediated by EGFR overexpression
      which results in downstream activation of cell survival signals, such as AKT, and may be
      overcome when Erlotinib (Tarceva) is co-administered with RADiation and cisPLATin
      (intraarterial chemotherapy).
