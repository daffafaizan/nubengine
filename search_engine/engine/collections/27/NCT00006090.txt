      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that is refractory to fludarabine or in relapse. II.
      Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in these patients when treated with this
      regimen. III. Evaluate the effects of this drug on cytokines, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours on days 1-15 OR on days 1-5, 8-12,
      and 15-19. Courses repeat with 2 to 5 week intervals between courses for 10-12 courses (about
      1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the second year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
