      anti-BCMA lentivirus-transduced autologous T cells in patients with refractory or relapsed
      multiple myeloma.

      Primary objectives:

        1. Determine the safety and tolerability of CAR-BCMA T cells (autologous T cells transduced
           with chimeric antigen receptors recognizing BCMA) in patients with refractory or
           relapsed multiple myeloma.

        2. Observe the cytokinetics of CAR-BCMA T cells.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Observe the anti-tumor response of CAR-BCMA T cells to refractory or relapsed multiple
           myeloma (evaluated by diagnostic criteria International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG2014
           version) as CR, sCR, ICR, MCR or VGPR).

        2. Make an evaluation on the distribution and in vivo survival of CAR-BCMA T cells in
           peripheral blood, lymph node, and bone marrow.

        3. Observe the immunogenicity of CAR-BCMA T cells, and determine if there is anti-BCMA scFv
           cellular immune response and anti-BCMA scFv humoral immune response.

        4. Observe the changes of cell subsets of CAR-BCMA T cells against T cells (Tcm, central
           memory T lymphocytes; Tem, effector memory T lymphocytes; Treg, regulatory T
           lymphocytes).
