      definitively unresectable colorectal liver metastases in selected patients with a 60%
      estimated survival at 5 years in a recent prospective Norwegian study. However, disease free
      survival (DFS) in this preliminary study has been poor with 90% of recurrence after LT.

      The objective of our study is to validate LT as a therapeutic option on a large multicentric
      scale throughout a highly strict policy selection in term of survival, disease free survival
      and quality of life. In order to reduce selection bias, unresectability criteria and
      theorical indication to LT will be confirmed by an independent Steering Committee including
      HPB surgeons, oncologists, radiologists and hepatologists.
