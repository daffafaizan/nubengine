      take place in the same patient concurrently, so the patient's results from one test will
      serve as the comparator with the other test device. No randomization or blinding is needed.

      Patients will be recruited from the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine (and another sleep
      center with enriched racial variety). Consecutive patients in whom the clinician has ordered
      a WatchPATâ„¢ will be potential candidates for an opportunity to participate in the study.
      Patients will be made aware of the trial by invitation from members of the healthcare team.
      Interested patients will be evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
