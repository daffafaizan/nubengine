      social capital among people with HIV and their guardians (in case of adolescents w HIV). This
      social capital accrual will be leveraged to support and disseminate social skills (i.e.
      positive parenting, conflict resolution), economic skills (i.e. entrepreneurship, farming),
      and health skills (i.e. ART adherence, retention in care to produce viral suppression). The
      overall outcome is improved social, health, and economic well-being.
