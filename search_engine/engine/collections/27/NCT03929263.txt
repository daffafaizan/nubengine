      effects of dyadic neurofeedback (dnf) on adolescent brain activation with fMRI hyperscanning.
      Parents and adolescents will also report on emotion regulation, depressive symptoms, and
      parenting practices. Data collection procedures will take place at the Laureate Institute for
      Brain Research (LIBR), which is equipped with two identical scanners that have advanced
      real-time fMRI systems capable of conducting parallel fMRI hyperscanning, including the
      capacity for neurofeedback. Parents will complete a phone screen to determine initial
      eligibility. If initial study criteria are met, a 2-hour in-person lab visit will be
      scheduled where mothers and daughters will complete consent/assent; diagnostic interviews;
      surveys on emotion regulation, parenting practices, depression, and anxiety; and additional
      screening. Survey data will be used for preliminary exploratory analyses. Based on data
      collected from the screening visit, participants will be invited to participate in the full
      study: a 4-hour visit where mothers and daughters will complete emotion ratings, mock scanner
      training, and fMRI tasks individually and together using hyperscanning (scan time = 16 min
      resting-state [2 runs], 7 min structural MRI, 40 min fMRI tasks, 10 min clinical MRI scans).
