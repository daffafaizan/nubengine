      type-2-diabetes, improving dyslipidemia and inducing robust weight loss. However, several
      RYGB-individuals, post surgery, suffers from dumping syndrome and postprandial
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PHH) due to the anatomical rearrangement of the
      gastro-intestinal system. Dasiglugaon (also known as (ZP4207) has shown great
      pharmacokinetic- and dynamic effects, compared to other glucagon analogues on the market,
      when administrated to hypoglycemic type-1-diabetics.

      Therefore we aim to examine the effects of two different doses of dasiglucagon on the
      postprandial nadir plasma glucose concentration in RYGB-operated individuals suffering from
      PHH by use of a mixed meal test (MMT).

      The study is designed as a double-blinded, randomised, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover study
      comprising 3 separate treatment days in which participants will undergo an MMT along with one
      of the following double-blinded interventions:

        1. Subcutaneous (sc) placebo (saline) injection

        2. Sc injection with 80 μg dasiglucagon

        3. Sc injection with 200 μg dasiglucagon
