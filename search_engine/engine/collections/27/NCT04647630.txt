    
      Patients admitted to the medical wards with a provisional diagnosis under "pneumonia","chest
      infection" or "fever" will be screened by research assistants.

      Patients eligible with the inclusion criteria will be recruited into the study. Informed
      consent will be signed for those patients willing to participate in the study. Patient will
      be asked to save approximately 40 ml of urine. The urine sample will be processed in local
      laboratory and shipped out to a commercial lab for detection of any pneumococcal pneumoniae,
      and if present, serotyping will be performed at the same time using the same urine sample by
      urinary antigen assay. Meanwhile patients will be managed as usual by their clinical teams.
      Investigations and treatment will be offered by the clinical team as deemed necessary. The
      study team will only perform collection of urine and will not interfere the clinical
      management of the patients.

      Positive results would be informed to the clinical teams for the appropriate action.
