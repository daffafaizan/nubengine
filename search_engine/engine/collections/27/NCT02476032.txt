    
      There are two groups in this research study: 1) The Self Applied group, and 2) the
      Professionally Applied group.

      Once it is determined that interested individuals qualify to participate in the study and
      have determined that they want to participate, the group that participants are in will be
      determined. The study has been designed to ensure that 66% of the study participants receives
      strips that contain the active ingredient and 33% of the subjects receive strips without the
      active ingredient. This means that there is a 1 out of 3 chance that participants will be
      assigned to receive the strip(s) without the active desensitizing ingredient. At the end of
      your 8-week participation, if it turns out that participants received the strips without the
      active ingredient, they will be offered a sample pack with two strips that contain the active
      desensitizing ingredient for them to use at home.
