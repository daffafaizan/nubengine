    
      This is a multicentre, randomized, active controlled prospective clinical trial in adult and
      adolescent patients with AR (seasonal and/or perennial), who have moderate-to-severe symptoms
      (rhinitis/ rhinoconjunctivitis), based on the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma
      (ARIA) 2008 Guidelines. The study consists of a 3 to 7-day Lead-in Period during which
      patients must meet a minimum symptom severity score to be eligible for the Treatment Period.
      All patients will start the Lead-in Period straight after Screening Visit as soon as
      in/exclusion criteria are fulfilled. The Lead-in Period will be followed by a 14-day
      double-blind Treatment Period. At some time point during the study, patients will receive
      Placebo and Dymista® nasal spray or Azep® nasal spray or Flixonase® nasal spray, 1 spray per
      nostril twice daily according to randomization. On the first day of the Lead-in Period
      patients must meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria and have a sufficient AR symptom score
      to qualify for entry. Qualified patients will be requested to keep a Diary of nasal and
      ocular symptoms throughout the study period. Additionally, patients will be requested to
      complete the Adult Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) and EuroQoL 5D
      questionnaire (EQ-5D) on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15. Both Questionnaires will be completed by
      adult patients only.
