    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disorder
      accompanied by extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid ( aÎ²) and the increase of cognitive
      dysfunctions. Several functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in the prodromal
      stage of AD (i.e., in MCI) have found increased hippocampal activity during a memory task to
      be predictive of memory worsening and disease progression. In this study the investigators
      are aiming to reduce hippocampal hyperactivity with real-time fMRI neurofeedback and test
      whether this will improve memory performance.

      This study will use a randomized, single-blind, parallel group design. Patients with MCI and
      healthy participants will be assigned to receive feedback from either the hippocampus
      (experimental group, N=42) or from another brain area (alternate ROI feedback group, N=42).
      All participants will be instructed to downregulate activity.
