      mother-child dyads in which Oxt had been administered during the birth process (n = 53).
      Controls: mother-child dyads without Oxt (n = 45). The RNP were recorded with a camcorder in
      biological nurturing position. An observer blinded to the group and the dose of Oxt codified
      the RNP (reach/not reached). To assess the type of breastfeeding telephone call was made at 3
      months old RN.
