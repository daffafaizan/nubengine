      double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in 50 participants with CLI who have
      undergone a major (above-knee or below-knee) lower extremity amputation. 25 participants will
      receive NAC 1200mg intravenously twice a day for 6 consecutive days following amputation. 25
      participants will receive placebo saline intravenous infusion twice a day for 6 days
      following amputation. Post-amputation participants will be monitored for specific
      anthropometric parameters and stump perfusion assessments (using laser-assisted fluorescent
      angiography and transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement). The primary study endpoints are
      to determine if lower extremity stump healing and perfusion are affected by perioperative NAC
      administration. A secondary endpoint will be to determine the effect size that would be
      necessary to power a larger clinical trial to determine whether NAC treatment can affect
      tissue perfusion and healing at major lower extremity amputation stumps in participants with
      CLI.
