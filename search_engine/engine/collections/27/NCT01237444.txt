      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) has been
      the mainstay of therapy for over 10 years, based on sound evidence derived from randomized
      controlled clinical trials and epidemiological data.A variety of new approaches designed to
      address the problems associated with combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
      are currently being explored. These include strategic treatment interruptions to reduce time
      on therapy, toxicity and cost;Based on its performance, a dual drug combination that includes
      lopinavir/ritonavir and spares the more toxic NRTIs such as thymidine nucleoside-analogs, but
      maintains non-thymidine nucleoside-analogs appears as a potentially simple, safe and
      effective regimen.
