      either IV acetaminophen or placebo. All patients received an opioid patient controlled
      anesthesia (PCA). IV acetaminophen (1 gram) or placebo is given 30 minutes prior to operation
      and every 6 hours thereafter for up to 5 days post-operatively or discharge.

      The investigators primary endpoint is to evaluate opioid consumption during the patient's
      hospital stay. The investigators secondary endpoints are to evaluate return of
      gastrointestinal function (ROGIF), time to diet ordered (TTDO), length of hospital stay
      (LOHS) and occurrence of ileus. Pain is measured with the pain visual analog scale score
      (PVASS) at 3, 8, 24 and 48 hours.
