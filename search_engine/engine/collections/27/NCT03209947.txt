      order to measure the frequency of ulnar nerve which surface is >8,3 mmÂ².

      The measures will be realized centered on the epicondyle : 2 cm higher, and 2 cm lower with 2
      echographs (ESAOTE) and 2 observers. An inter and intra observer study will also be realized
      to determine the reproducibility and reliability of the measurements.
