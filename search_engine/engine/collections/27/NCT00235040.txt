    
      Specific Aim 1: To design and implement an integrated documentation-based clinical decision
      support and physician feedback system, provided in an electronic health record (EHR), to
      improve the management of patients with acute medical conditions.

      Hypothesis 1: A documentation-based clinical decision support tool (CDSS) "smart form"
      physician feedback system, can be designed and implemented to facilitate documentation and
      physician order-entry, provide individualized, evidence-based recommendations for the
      management of patients acute respiratory infections (ARIs), and are usable by primary care
      physicians.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effectiveness of documentation-based CDSS and physician
      feedback on documentation and the clinical management of patients respiratory tract
      infections.

      Hypothesis 2A: A documentation-based CDSS "smart form" will increase the documentation of
      important clinical data in patients with ARI when compared to usual practice.

      Hypothesis 2B: A documentation-based CDSS "smart form" will increase adherence with
      guidelines for the management of patients with ARI when compared to usual practice.
