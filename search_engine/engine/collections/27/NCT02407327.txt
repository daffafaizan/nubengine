      total CTC numbers in advanced NSCLC at baseline, before starting treatment.

      To valuate CTC count modifications as an early predictor of response to treatment a
      prospective observational study will be conducted, consecutively enrolling 150 patients
      regardless of type or line of therapy, which will be reevaluated for disease status and CTC
      count depending on the type and schedule of treatment.

      Furthermore, purified CTC will be obtained by automated platform and DNA sequencing will be
      performed to assess sensitizing mutations in advanced NSCLC patients. The EGFR mutations or
      EML4-ALK fusion gene detected in CTC will be compared with those reported for the tumor
      specimen using standard sequencing.

      In parallel, the CTC count assay will be integrated with mAb targeting EGFR or EML4-ALK
      fusion gene, to test whether assaying the quote of EGFR-positive and ALK-positive CTC
      provides a more sensitive marker for rating pharmacodynamic effects in patients compared with
      total CTC counts.

      Moreover, it was reported that NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations manifest activation of the
      PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-AKT and MEK-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)
      signaling pathways under the control of EGFR, and exposure of such cells to EGFR-TKIs blocks
      signaling by both pathways and induces apoptosis 13. To evaluate whether live vs. apoptotic
      CTC changes under treatment may be used as predictor of tumor response, M30-positive CTC will
      be quantified as previously 8.

      Data obtained with the CTC assay will be correlated with common prognostic factors.
