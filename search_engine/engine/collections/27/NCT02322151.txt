      volunteer peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors in the National Marrow Donor Program
      (NMDP). Information about the excretion and pharmacokinetics of rhGCSF into human breast
      milk, however, is extremely limited. Two case reports exist, the first demonstrating only
      that subcutaneously administered rhGCSF is present in breast milk,1 and the second
      demonstrating that rhGCSF is not only present, but also remains in breast milk for two days
      after discontinuation of the medication.2 Based on the data from the latter case report, the
      NMDP suggests that donors abstain from breastfeeding during the administration of rhGCSF and
      for 48 hours after the last dose of rhGCSF is given. We intend to collect and test breast
      milk and peripheral blood from one volunteer NMDP donor during the course of her rhGCSF
      therapy and for 5 days thereafter, with the intention of better characterizing this rare and
      unique situation. Collected samples will be used for granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (GCSF) quantitation and complete blood counts. Additionally, we will collect a single breast
      milk sample from three rhGCSF-na(SqrRoot) ve volunteers for use as negative control samples
      for assay calibration.
