      examination time. This time would vary according to the body area/organ being visualized but
      would not exceed 30 minutes over the length of the clinical examination. Volunteers are
      eligible if they are willing to undergo an MR examination.

      Patients would not be required to make any additional visits beyond their
      clinically-indicated visits. The study duration would vary according to the body area/organ
      visualized but would not exceed 30 minutes over the length of the clinical examination.
      Volunteers would be required to keep one study appointment to include one MR imaging
      examination.

      There will be no interruption to the standard care given to patients who participate in this
      trial since the clinical portion of their examination will be completed prior to the study
      portion of the exam.
