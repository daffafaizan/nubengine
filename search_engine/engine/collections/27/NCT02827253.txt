      disease patients in advanced stages (stages 4 and 5 defined by KDOQI guidelines).

      Both groups will be evaluated with a MRI without contrast. A second MRI to identify brainÂ´s
      morphological changes will be performed in patients of the first group a year later and in
      patients of the second group that will have been begun haemodialysis six months after.

      In a first transverse evaluation, eighteen haemodialysis sessions from the first group will
      be studied with a retrospective analysis. The first three sessions of each month for six
      months before the MRI will be considered.

      In each session the investigators will collect haemodynamic variables (systolic arterial
      blood pressure pre and post dialysis), intradialytic hypotension based on different
      definitions (Nadir90, Nadir100, Fall20, Fall30) and proper haemodialysis variables (KtV,
      convective transport).

      In the first group and patients with CKD that will start haemodialysis, the investigators
      analyse the variables considered in the transverse evaluation until complete one year follow
      up.

      Statistical analysis will be done with SPSS version 20.
