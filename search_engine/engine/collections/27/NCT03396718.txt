      determined centrally by p16 immunohistochemistry and confirmation will be done by HPV DNA
      assessment using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based array. Patients positive for HPV will
      be treated with a reduced RT dose to the tumor and to elective neck. HPV negative patients
      will be treated with standard radio- or radiochemotherapy. Patients deemed at high risk for
      locoregional recurrences (presence of extracapsular spread, residual tumor or multiple
      affected nodes) will be treated separately from patients deemed at intermediate risk (T>=3,
      and / or 1-3 nodes positive). The high risk group will be treated with a higher dose and
      concurrent chemotherapy. After inclusion of 30 patients per treatment group, follow up for
      the patients will be awaited for two years and safety of the intervention will be assessed.
      The second de-escalation level will only be opened for accrual if not more than three
      locoregional recurrences will occur per treatment group.
