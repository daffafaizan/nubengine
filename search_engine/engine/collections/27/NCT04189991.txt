    
      All patients referred to our centre of oxygen titration during exertion will be offered to
      participate in our study.

      After baseline assessments, patients will have an oxygen titration using two different
      methods in random order:

        -  Usual titration protocol will include an manual oxygen increase during a titration 6
           minutes walk test

        -  Automatic titration protocol that will use the automated oxygen titration device to
           adjust oxygen flow rate during a titration 6 minutes walk test.

      After each titration protocol, the efficacy of the titration will be assessed in 3 validation
      6 minutes walk tests during which oxygen flow will be set at:

        -  The manually determined flow rate

        -  The 95th percentile flow rate of the automatic titration

        -  The median flow rate of the automatic titration

      During validation 6 minutes walk test, oxygen saturation, dyspnea, walked distance and heart
      rate will be recorded.
