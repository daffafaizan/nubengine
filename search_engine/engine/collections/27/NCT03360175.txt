    
      This is a prospective, observational pilot study that will assess whether 1) a peri-operative
      dysregulated metabolo-lipidomics or SPM profile is associated with slower resolution of pain
      after surgery and an increased risk for development of persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP),
      and 2) whether a peri-operative dysregulated metabolo-lipidomics profile correlates with low
      Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scores, duration of hospital stay and frequency of
      complications, e.g. wound infection.

      The study will address the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the correlation between the perioperative eicosanoid and
      pro-resolving lipid mediator temporal profile and day-to-day resolution of pain after
      thoracic surgery.

      We hypothesize that patients who have slower resolution of pain after thoracic surgery have
      dysregulated systemic lipid mediator pathways when compared to those patients who have faster
      resolution of pain.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effectiveness of perioperative SPM signature as a novel
      predictive marker for the development of persistent pain after surgery (PPSP).

      We hypothesize that patients with dysregulated systemic lipid mediator pathways, more
      specifically up-regulated pro-inflammatory lipid mediator pathways and down-regulated
      pro-resolving lipid mediator pathways, are more likely to develop PPSP.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the correlation between the perioperative eicosanoid and
      pro-resolving lipid mediator temporal profile and quality of recovery after surgery, duration
      of hospital stay and complications.

      We hypothesize that dysregulated lipid mediator profiles are associated with a decreased
      Quality of Recovery Score (QoR-15), prolonged hospital stay and increased rates of
      complications, such as problems with wound healing and infection.
