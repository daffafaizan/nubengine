      women. New national guidelines identify increasing screening uptake as the number one
      priority for reducing cervical cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Innovative screening
      strategies that eliminate the need for clinic-based screening could be highly effective in
      improving screening compliance while maintaining high-quality care. We propose a large,
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial within Group Health (a large integrated health care
      delivery system in Washington State) to compare effectiveness of two programmatic approaches
      to increasing cervical cancer screening among overdue women. The first approach (control arm)
      is usual care at Group Health, which consists of patient- and provider-level services to
      promote adherence to Pap screening, and the second approach (intervention arm) includes usual
      care plus a mailed in-home high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening kit. We will
      randomize eligible women to the in-home hrHPV screening arm or the usual care arm. Compared
      to usual care, we hypothesize that in-home hrHPV screening will enhance early detection and
      treatment of cervical neoplasia and improve compliance with screening. The trial will provide
      definitive evidence-based data on the impact of an in-home hrHPV screening program in a
      real-world clinical setting.
