      at the University Hospitals of Mainz and Frankfurt. Patients are assessed with regards to
      their diet using standardized questionnaire and nutritionists.

      Patients will be randomized into two parallel groups. The first group will continue a
      wheat-based Nutrition, while the second Group will receive dietary counselling to achieve an
      ATI-free nutrition, trying to reduce the daily ATI consumption.

      The clinical trial will run over 16 weeks including 4 visits at the study center. Study
      visits include physical examinations, blood-based parameters, cytokines and urine samples, as
      well for the analysis of the intestinal microbiome by using stool samples. In addition the
      patients have to complete dietary and health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires.
      Visits are planned at baseline, W4, W8 and W16.
