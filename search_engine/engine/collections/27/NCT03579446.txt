      I. To determine the proportion of successful opioid rotation (OR) from morphine equivalent
      daily dose (MEDD) to levorphanol at the primary end point. to levorphanol at the primary end
      point. The primary end point is either at day 10 +/- 1 or any day after 2 days of rotation to
      levorphanol if the patient reaches his/her baseline personalized pain goal (PPG) in
      situations where opioid rotation is performed due to uncontrolled pain and less than or equal
      to 4 breakthrough opioid doses are used.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median opioid rotation ratio (ORR) in patients undergoing successful
      opioid rotations from morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) to levorphanol in the Supportive
      Care Center (SCC) or Pain Clinic.

      II. To determine the effect of levorphanol on cancer pain (as measured by change in Edmonton
      Symptom Assessment System's [ESAS] pain item from baseline) in cancer outpatients undergoing
      opioid rotation to levorphanol at the primary end point of treatment.

      III. To determine the association between the opioid rotation ratio from MEDD to levorphanol
      and baseline MEDD prior to opioid rotation.

      IV. Measure levorphanol related side effects using the opioid side effect scale at day 10 +/-
      1 of starting levorphanol.

      V. Determine what percentage of patients rotated to levorphanol achieve their personalized
      pain goal.

      VI. Determine the predictors of successful opioid rotation from other opioids to levorphanol.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive levorphanol orally (PO) every 8 or 12 hours for 30 days. Patients may
      receive opioid regimen including hydrocodone, morphine sulfate, hydromorphone hydrochloride,
      oxycodone, and oxymorphone hydrochloride for breakthrough pain.
