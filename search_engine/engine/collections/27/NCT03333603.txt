      conduct a 8-week open label clinical trial for evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and safety
      of esomeprazole use for the schizophrenia. Investigators will give 40 mg/day esomeprazole in
      the first two weeks and 80 mg/day from the third week to the end of the trial. Investigators
      will check the area under the concentration of metabolites of esomeprazole on Day 1, Day 14
      and Day 56 and the genotype of CYP2C19. The GI symptoms and related drug side effects will be
      evaluated.
