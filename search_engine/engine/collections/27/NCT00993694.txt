        -  Define the incidence of methemoglobinemia in patients with hematologic malignancy or
           aplastic anemia who received dapsone prophylaxis through a retrospective chart review
           encompassing the last 15 years.

        -  Identify major risk factors for developing methemoglobinemia.

      OUTLINE: Medical charts are reviewed. Of particular interest is demographic information,
      reasons for beginning dapsone prophylaxis, duration of dapsone prophylaxis, dapsone dosing,
      methemoglobin level, and treatment with methylene blue.
