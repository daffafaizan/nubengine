      open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), long-term safety
      follow-up study of abiraterone acetate in approximately 300 patients from other completed
      abiraterone acetate clinical studies. Patients must have received at least 3 months of
      treatment with abiraterone acetate and a low-dose corticosteroid and, based on investigator
      assessment, may benefit from continued treatment. This study will consist of a screening
      period followed by open-label treatment of continued abiraterone acetate access. The patients
      will continue with the same abiraterone acetate and low-dose corticosteroid dosing regimen
      they were receiving in the previous abiraterone acetate clinical study until the investigator
      determines that the patient is no longer receiving benefit or the sponsor terminates the
      study. Patients can be withdrawn from the study if an alternative access (eg,
      patient-assistance program or commercial source of abiraterone acetate) is available and
      feasible. Each cycle of treatment will be 28 days. Investigators will monitor and assess the
      patients for response to treatment or progression according to routine practice or as
      clinically indicated to determine whether continued treatment with abiraterone acetate is
      warranted. No efficacy data are being collected. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study for a maximum duration of 6 years. End-of-study assessments will be performed at least
      30 days after the last dose of abiraterone or upon early withdrawal.
