    
      The primary objective is to evaluate cardiac left ventricular mass (measured with
      echocardiography by unique investigator) in females over 15 years of age affected with Fabry
      disease receiving 70 mg of agalsidase beta every other week, as compared with an untreated
      controlled group matched for gender and age.

      The secondary objectives include evaluation of :

        -  left ventricular posterior wall thickness (echocardiography)

        -  interventricular septum thickness (echocardiography)

        -  tissue doppler imaging (myocardial function)

        -  EKG

        -  creatinaemia

        -  serum cystatin C level

        -  urinary protein/creatinine ratio

        -  microalbuminuria

        -  Gb3 urinary levels

      Evaluation of tolerance and safety with :

        -  Home therapy infusions follow up

        -  Vitals

        -  Physical examination

        -  Adverse events

        -  Antibodies levels
