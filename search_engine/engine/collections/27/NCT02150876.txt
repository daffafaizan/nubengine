      prospectively included in the SWEET registry. Baseline and procedural characteristics were
      collected at index procedure. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 month and 1 year by
      clinic visit or follow-up call. The study end point was a composite of cardiac death (CD),
      myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 1 year.
