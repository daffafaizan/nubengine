      kidney transplantation. Therefore most of the patients receive an universal prophylaxis. On
      the contrary to CMV na√Øve patients, seropositive recipients (R+) have already mounted a
      specific immunologic response directed against the virus, which is not completely abrogated
      by immunosuppressive drugs. Although CMV infection management guidelines offer little
      guidance on immunosuppressive therapy for preventing CMV infection and disease, recent data
      plead for reappraising the place of mTOR inhibitors in this situation. The potential anti-CMV
      action of these molecules could be added to their potential antitumor effect and their
      equivalent immunosuppressive efficacy in kidney transplant recipients at low immunological
      risk. By the way, it could represent an alternative of a systematic universal prophylaxis in
      R+ kidney transplant recipients. However, the proof of this anti-CMV action must be confirmed
      in vivo in a study, which could have a close monitoring of CMV infection.

      We therefore designed a prospective multicentric randomized controlled trial comparing an
      immunosuppressive regimen based on everolimus and reduced dose of cyclosporine A to a regimen
      based on mycophenolic acid and standard dose of cyclosporine A, in order to demonstrate the
      superiority of the first one in the prevention of CMV infection.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms and will be followed for a
      period of 12 months. Whole blood CMV real time PCR will be performed every week during the
      first three months, then every two weeks from Month 3 to Month 6, then at Months 8, 10 and
      12. Incidence of CMV infection will be compared between the two arms at 6 and 12 months
      post-transplantation.
