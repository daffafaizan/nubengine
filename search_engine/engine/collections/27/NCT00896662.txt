        -  Evaluate the effect of in vivo aflibercept on the presence of different populations of
           dendritic cells (DC) and immature cells (ImC) in the peripheral blood of cancer patients
           by characterizing the time course (kinetics) of the improvement in antigen presenting
           cell (APC) phenotype (decline in DC/ImC ratio) occurring early and late after
           aflibercept administration.

        -  Evaluate the effect of aflibercept administration on DC function based on ability to
           stimulate antigen specific proliferative (allogeneic and tetanus toxoid) and cytolytic T
           cell responses (influenza) by characterizing the time course (kinetics) of the
           improvement in APC function occurring early and late after aflibercept administration.

        -  Explore the relationship of baseline aflibercept level and host APC phenotype.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo phlebotomy and blood collection at baseline and on days 15, 29, and 57.
      Samples are analyzed for dendritic cell phenotype, subpopulations, maturation status, and
      function in terms of ability to activate autologous T cells.
