    
      Aim of the study: to analyze the incidence of reinfection in patients with prosthetic hip
      infection who underwent surgery and received antibiotic therapy Methods: prospective cohort
      study in a French referral center for osteoarticular infections from November 2002 to March
      2010. Population

        -  all patients who consented to participate in the study with prosthetic hip infections
           treated by:

        -  debridement-synovectomy for acute infection or with one-stage or two-stage

        -  exchange arthroplasty or resection arthroplasty for chronic infection

        -  antibiotic therapy

      Outcome:

        -  Follow-up: minimum of 2 years

        -  Events monitored: reinfection including relapse and new infection, joint revision for
