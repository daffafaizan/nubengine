    
      Amino-terminal pro-B-type natiuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a prohormone released from
      cardiac ventricular myocytes in direct response to cardiac workload. Secreted in the
      biologically inactive form, NT-proBNP is cleaved in the circulation into BNP, which
      subsequently exerts both vasodilatory and diuretic effects. The principal clinical utility of
      serum NT-proBNP measurement has been as an adjunctive marker in the diagnosis of subclinical
      heart failure, with higher levels typically reflective of increasing cardiac dysfunction.

      The proposed prospective cohort study intends to collect serum NT-proBNP levels in singleton
      ACHD patients and a comparative normotensive control group at time of admission for delivery
      to characterize negative predictive values for intrapartum and postpartum cardiac events.
      Both pregnant patients with previously-diagnosed ACHD and those diagnosed and delivering
      during the study interval will be candidates for participation, and a gestational age
      threshold of 37 weeks will be utilized for the control group.
