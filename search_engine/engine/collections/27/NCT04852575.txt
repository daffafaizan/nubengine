      evaluation with a specialized physical or occupational therapist be and invited to enroll in
      the ReVital-CORE program for the pilot, feasibility study.

      Participants in the ReVital-CORE program study will be emailed an online evaluation each
      month via for one year. Once completed, the evaluation is automatically scored into: frail,
      pre-frail or robust categories using a validated frailty index. Any patient categorized as
      frail or pre-frail will be re-referred to rehabilitation by their cancer care team. For frail
      and pre-frail individuals, standard of care rehabilitation therapy will include either/and
      occupational and physical therapy evaluation and treatment and will be billed via their
      insurance.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate feasibility of the of the ReVital-CORE Program
      for individuals starting a new chemotherapy regimen. Secondary aims are to evaluate the
      prevalence, trajectory and predictors of frailty during the first year of chemotherapy
      treatment; and evaluate the impacts of prehab/rehabilitation for participants identified as
      frail and pre-frail.
