      fixation. This is commonly achieved via open reduction and internal fixation with
      angle-stable designed locking plates using either a volar or dorsal approach. Frequent
      complications of tendinitis are associated with the latter approach. Palmar application of
      angle-stable plates reduces this problem of extensor tendon irritation; however a high
      incidence of fracture collapse has been documented. Currently, there are no existing locking
      plates that provide sufficient stability particularly for complex fractures. Insufficient
      fragment fixation can result in loss of reduction due to interfragmentary movement and lead
      to mal- or nonunion.

      The Variable Angle LCP Two-Column Volar DR plate (VA LCP DR) is a novel development of the
      LCP Distal Radius Plate System, which is designed to treat a wide variety of distal radius
      fracture patterns. Because of its design (ie, low plate and screw profile, polished surface,
      rounded edges, various locking options), not only can the potential for tendon adhesions and
      soft tissue irritation be minimized, the plate can address fragments individually for each
      fracture type. Thus, the versatility of VA LCP facilitates the reduction and stabilization of
      even the most complex fractures, including those in osteoporotic bone.

      This prospective case-series will evaluate the performance of the new VA LCP DR plate in the
      treatment of complex articular fractures of the distal radius. The primary objective of this
      study involves the documentation of postoperative loss of reduction; functional outcomes,
      quality of life and rate of complications associated with fracture fixation will also be
      assessed as part of the secondary study aims.
