      weeks, half of the type 2 diabetic patients will receive mulberry leaf capsules three times
      per day with meals (made from Mulberry Zuccarin tablets - New Nordic, 400 mg of mulberry leaf
      extract per tablet) and half will receive placebo capsules. Following a one week wash out
      period, the treatments administered to each group will be reversed for the next 2 weeks, and
      data will continue to be gathered for a final wash out week. Patients will keep a diary of
      food, exercise, and fasting glucose each morning as well as at least one 2 hour pc glucose
      each day. Weight, hemoglobin A1C, liver function tests, and renal function tests will be done
      at baseline and at the end of the 6 weeks. As well, blood pressure will be monitored when the
      2 weekly batches of medication are distributed, and at the end of the 6 weeks.
