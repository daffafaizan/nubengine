      rates of hypothermia in the developing world. This study will compare the rates of
      hypothermia one hour after birth in full term infants randomized to receive standard WHO
      thermoregulation care (control group) or standard WHO thermoregulation care without immediate
      drying plus a plastic bag covering their torsos and lower extremities (intervention group).
      The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken within 15 minutes of birth at at one
      hour after birth with removal of the plastic bag. Hyperthermia, room temperature, and death
      will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With an estimated baseline
      hypothermia rate of 15% and a hypothesized 10% absolute risk reduction (66% relative risk
      reduction), a sample size of 276 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence
      interval of 95%.
