      Alzheimer's disease, often necessitating caregiver assistance, which can in many cases
      progress to institutionalization. Subjects with Alzheimer's disease dementia frequently
      experience disturbed sleep patterns characterized by insufficient nocturnal sleep and
      excessive daytime napping, which has been associated with both cognitive and behavioral
      pathology such as impaired daytime functioning, agitation, and nocturnal wandering.

      Although the causality of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear; some
      research suggests that the fragmented sleep and associated behavioral disturbances could be
      related to the degeneration of the serotonergic and noradrenergic innervation of
      suprachiasmatic nucleus andsubsequent disruption in melatonin secretion patterns.
      Additionally, research suggests that melatonin levels are decreased in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease

      In the United States, ramelteon is marketed for the treatment of insomnia characterized by
      difficulty with sleep onset and is under global development for the treatment of transient,
      chronic insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. It is believed that ramelteon works by
      binding melatonin to MT1/MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus which inhibits firing
      of specific neurons, which is thought to attenuate the alerting signal and allows the
      homeostatic mechanism to express itself and promote sleep.

      Study participation is anticipated to be about 11 weeks (approximately 3 months).
