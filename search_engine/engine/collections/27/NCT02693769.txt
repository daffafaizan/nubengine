      fluticasone/formoterol Breath actuated inhaler in subjects with the characteristics of fixed
      airflow obstruction and elevated eosinophils. These patients have typically been excluded
      from previous Flutiform pMDI asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) trials;
      for example in asthma studies, patients with a smoking history of 10 pack years or more have
      been excluded, conversely in COPD studies patients with any prior history of asthma have been
      excluded. It is expected that the data from this study will provide a greater understanding
      of the effects of fluticasone/formoterol in this patient population
