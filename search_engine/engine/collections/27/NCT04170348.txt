    
      This is a 2-year controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial comparing the
      efficacy in reducing the rate of respiratory events in sickle-cell disease of daily oral
      vitamin D3 (3,333 IU/d) with monthly bolus oral vitamin D3, (100,000 IU/mo) as a control. The
      scientific premise of the clinical trial is that circulating concentrations of vitamin D3,
      the parent compound, are the principal determinant of the anti-infective and immunomodulatory
      effects of supplementation.

      Eligible participants will be initially screened to determine their blood vitamin D levels.
      Those with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 5 and 60 ng/mL will be assigned by chance to
      one of the two arms for 24 months. Participants will be checked every month and will have
      periodic blood and urine tests to monitor for any side effects of the study treatments.
      Children above 5 y/o who can cooperate and understand the procedure will have lung function
      test once a year. Showing that a monthly dose of vitamin D reduces lung infections, asthma
      and the acute chest syndrome could help establish this simple, low-cost treatment as a way to
      decrease sickness and deaths in children and adolescents with sickle-cell disease.
