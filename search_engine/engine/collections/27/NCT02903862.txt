      Mindoula and DANA intervention and use subject feedback to aid in designing future
      interventions for caregivers.

      This is a remotely administered, virtual study targeting dementia caregivers who are mild to
      moderately depressed. Screening calls for online administration of four surveys to determine
      inclusion in the study arms. These surveys will be taken on the Health-eBrain website, both
      at baseline/screening and throughout participation. All other participation will be completed
      on the participant's mobile phone, and all psychological and cognitive tests will be
      self-administered.

      This study has a between-group design. Participants will be screened for eligibility and then
      randomized into each arm. The intervention arm will receive the Mindoula plus DANA
      intervention. The wait list control arm will take the psychological surveys at regular
      intervals then, after 12 weeks, be enrolled in the DANA-only observation group. The DANA-only
      group will take DANA and a usability questionnaire.
