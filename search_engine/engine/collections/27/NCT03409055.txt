      patients with pleural effusions complain of shortness of breath, cough, chest pain and are
      more hypoxic and tachypneic. Clinically significant effusions can slow recovery in the
      hospital and beyond, and are a critical source of hospital readmissions after discharge. It
      is not well characterized how this impacts hospital outcomes and costs. Further it is unknown
      if the effusions themselves are associated with impaired outcomes, or if pleural effusions
      simply arise in more complicated, older patients, thus suggesting the impaired outcomes are
      the result of coexisting morbidities. To better understand the impact of this complication
      and to address the question mentioned before, this study was carried out to determine the
      clinical and economic outcomes of pleural effusions in propensity-matched patients during
      early recovery from cardiac surgery. To compare patient groups with and without pleural
      effusion the following baseline characteristics were used e.g. age, sex, body-mass-index,
      priority of surgery, type of surgery, duration of surgery, APACHE II Score of patients on
      admission on the ICU.
