      this study is to better understand the anatomy of physiologically normal, or competent, BAVs
      without stenosis or insufficiency (AI) in order to support evidence-based standardization of
      BAV repair surgery. Men and women over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of BAV and minimal
      aortic valve calcification at baseline will undergo annual 4D computed tomography angiography
      (CTA) scans, routine transthoracic echocardiograms, and history and physical assessments over
      the course of the 5-year study period. Patients who are pregnant, have renal insufficiency
      (creatinine 2 mg/dL), or who have a contraindication to intravenous contrast will be
      excluded. Patients will be stratified into study groups according to baseline AI:
      approximately half of patients will have no to mild AI at baseline and the other half will
      have moderate to severe AI at baseline. Anatomical measurements will be obtained from the 4D
      CTA scans and analyzed at each phase of the cardiac cycle, as well as longitudinally. The 4D
      CTA imaging and analysis will not impact medical care of the study participants; the
      anatomical measurements will be used in the future as evidence-based standards for
      determining valve repair candidacy for BAV patients with AI.
