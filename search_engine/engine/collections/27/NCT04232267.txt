      parameters that provide a clinically significant depressive burden screener. This study uses
      objective physiological markers from MEB-001 to estimate the clinically significant
      depressive burden as subjectively reported by the subject with the BDI-II.

      This is a two (2)-phase, non-significant risk, cross-sectional, naturalistic, single-arm,
      multi-center study conducted under a common protocol and designed to:

      Phase 1: MEB-001 algorithm development (software medical device). Phase 2: Evaluate the
      effectiveness of the MEB-001 device in assessing physiological parameters that provide
      clinically significant depressive burden screener.
