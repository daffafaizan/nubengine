      recurrent inflammatory eczema. It is one of the most common skin diseases and is associated
      with reduced quality of life, functional impairment and sleep difficulties. There are
      currently no pharmacological treatments that are effective in curing the disorder in the
      longer-term. Itching is one of the core symptoms in AD and it has been shown that the
      behavioral response to itching, scratching, has a maintaining function in AD. Reducing
      scratching may therefore play an important role in alleviating AD. Although behavioral
      aspects play a significant role in AD only a few studies have investigated the effect of
      psychological treatment for AD. These studies have shown promising results and the present
      study aim to add to the body of knowledge by testing a new form of cognitive behavioral
      treatment for AD. This new treatment is based on the idea that patients could benefit from
      training in exposure to events that could lead to increase in itching while refraining from
      scratching. To enable this the treatment incorporates more recently developed cognitive
      behavioral components such as mindfulness training.

      The present study aims to investigate a new exposure-based cognitive behavioral psychological
      treatment for the disorder. The trial is a small scale open trial (n=25) with assessments at
      baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome is the SCORAD.
