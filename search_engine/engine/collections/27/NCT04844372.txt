    
      Leg and/or ankle surgery is frequently performed under General Anesthesia (GA). GA is
      frequently associated with a high risk of hypotension with significant consequences.

      Regional anesthesia could be an interesting alternative to GA in order to limit hemodynamic
      consequences, especially in elderly patients.

      Furthermore, in the current state of Covid 19 crisis, regional anesthesia could provide
      solutions in preserving drugs for GA and exposing less medical staff on patient's airway.

      Currently, unlike neuraxial anesthesia, few data deal with impact of peripheral RA and
      hemodynamic consequences.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of Regional anesthesia reduces the use of
      intraoperative vasopressor.

      After ethical committee approval, a retrospective cohort of patients with lower limb
      traumatism, in Montpellier's University Hospital, was analyzed from 2016 to 2020. An
      informational note was given to all patients participating to the study.
