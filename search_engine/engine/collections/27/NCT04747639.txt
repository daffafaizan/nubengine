    
      Single center, double-blind, randomized controlled cross-over trial with four treatments and
      four time points.

      The study has three primary objectives. The first primary objective is to confirm the in a
      previous study shown reduction of postprandial glycemic and insulinemic response after
      consumption of 500 ml glucose-free apple juice compared to 500 ml untreated apple juice.

      The second primary objective is to show the reduction of postprandial glycemic response after
      consumption of 250 ml glucose-free apple juice compared to 250 ml untreated apple juice.

      The third primary objective is to show the reduction of insulinemic response after
      consumption of 250 ml glucose-free apple juice compared to 250 ml untreated apple juice.

      Secondary objectives include safety aspects, specifically the occurrence of diarrhoea in all
      four treatment groups, differences between treatment groups on the Bristol Stool Forms Scale,
      gastro-intestinal symptoms and laboratory parameters. In addition, gluconate excretion and
      excreted portion of ingested gluconate are of interest as well as faecal pH.
