        -  Evaluate the efficacy of recombinant interferon alpha (IFN alpha) as a single agent in
           the treatment of recurrent unresectable meningiomas and malignant meningiomas.

        -  Determine the nature and extent of central nervous system (CNS) toxicities associated
           with the use of alpha interferon in current doses and schedules.

      OUTLINE: This is a two arm, randomized study. The first arm includes all histologically
      benign meningiomas. The second arm includes all other pathologies.

      All patients receive INF alpha as a subcutaneous injection Monday through Friday for 8 weeks.
      Treatment continues without interruption as long as there is no tumor recurrence or
      progression and toxicity is acceptable.

      Treatment continues without dose adjustment for the first 8 weeks as long as there are no
      toxic effects of grade III or greater. Dosage for subsequent courses is one dose level below
      the dose that produced toxicity of grade III or greater.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be entered per year into each arm.
