      surgery and it is strongly associated with poor surgical outcome. The clinical
      characteristics of postoperative delirium are fluctuating attention, visual hallucination,
      disorganized thought and alter sleep-wake cycles. This is quite similar to core features of
      Î±-synuclein-related cognitive disorders such as parkinson's disease dementia and dementia
      with lewy body. At that point, investigator thought that postoperative delirium is
      preclinical stage of a-synucleinopathy. In other words, a-synuclein related disorders and
      postoperative delirium may share an underlying neurochemical change in their pathogenesis.

      investigator will recruit age 65 and older patients scheduled to perform spine surgery. The
      pre-operative evaluation include neurologic exam, baseline cognitive function and
      a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms through Questionnaires.
