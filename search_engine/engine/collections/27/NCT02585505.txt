      tracking. The labeled stem cells will be given through different routes (intravenous and
      intraarterial)and tissue distribution studied. Patients will be followed up for the next 6
      months. Glucagon stimulated C peptide will be measured at baseline and at 6 months and HOMA
      IR and HOMA beta will be calculated.
