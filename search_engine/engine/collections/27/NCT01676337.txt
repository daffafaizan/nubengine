      system, and frequently results in ED visits for non-emergent conditions such as medication
      refills, ambulatory care sensitive conditions which are potentially preventable with
      appropriate outpatient management (e.g. foot infections). Many patients seen in the ED report
      they were unaware of past or future outpatient appointments for which they had been
      scheduled. These patients are clearly in need of primary care, yet fail to attend 30% of all
      scheduled outpatient appointments. Patients most often report that they failed to attend
      scheduled appointments as a result of forgetfulness or confusion regarding dates, times, or
      locations. National data confirmed by our previous work in the LAC+USC ED demonstrates that >
      80% of this population reports using a text-capable mobile device. The investigators believe
      a system of text message appointment reminders has tremendous potential to facilitate clinic
      attendance among these patients in desperate need of primary care.
