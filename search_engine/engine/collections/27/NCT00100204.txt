      recent years. Saliva contains many proteins, some of which are altered in various disease
      states. In this study, saliva is to be sampled in patients with head and neck radiation,
      diabetes, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, Sjogren's syndrome, cystinuria, methylmalonic
      acidemia and other conditions. Various novel analytical and data-processing tools will be
      used to infer characteristic salivary protein and salivary analyte signatures of these
      disorders. In some cases, these data will be evaluated with data for the oral flora present
      in the saliva and plaque of these patient groups and relate the presence and levels of
      particular bacteria to the proteomic profile.
