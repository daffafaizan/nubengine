      stage I lung cancer after ablation, to compare the similarities and differences of cfDNA
      methylation between surgical treatment and ablation in patients with stage I lung cancer, and
      to look for new indicators to assess the efficacy of ablation therapy and to monitor lung
      cancer recurrence.

      The main research content is to screen the cfDNA methylation index that can monitor the
      efficacy of stage I lung cancer ablation and compare the similarities and differences of
      cfDNA methylation in patients with stage I lung cancer after surgery and ablation.
