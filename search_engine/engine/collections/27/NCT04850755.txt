    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of selinexor in combination with nivolumab and
           ipilimumab

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor in combination with nivolumab and
           ipilimumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine Selinexor pharmacokinetics (PK) in Asian patients

        -  To describe anti-tumor responses with the combination in patients with advanced or
           metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To assess the immunomodulatory effects of selinexor in solid tumour malignancies and
           circulating immune cells

        -  To identify biomarkers of response to the combination of selinexor and nivolumab +
           ipilimumab. We will explore changes in PDL1 expression, T cell infiltration (including
           CD4 and CD8 positive cells), gene expression profiles on serial tumor biopsies
           pre-selinexor, post-selinexor alone, and after the combination of selinexor and
           ipilimumab + nivolumab where feasible.
