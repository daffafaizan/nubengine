      and powders) and in some other forms as well. Examples of foods containing probiotics are
      yogurt, fermented and unfermented milk, miso, and some juices and soy beverages. In probiotic
      foods and supplements, the bacteria may have been present originally or added during
      preparation. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of probiotics for alleviating the
      annoyed GI symptoms after LGB.

      Clostridium butyricum Probiotics is a novel microecological feed additive, it has the
      characteristic of heat tolerance, acid tolerance and antibiotic resistance and is general
      used to treat the intestinal tract disease in the clinical treatment. Its potential function
      in the situation that feed has been added universally with antibiotics will make it have a
      good development.

      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, prospective clinical trial was conducted
      among 60 patients undergoing gastric bypass for morbid obesity who had annoyed GI symptoms.
      Patients were randomized to the clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI group (80 mg daily , n=20,),
      bifidobacterium Longum BB536 group (2 packs daily, n=20),and biotase group(4 tablets daily,
      n=20). Control group (Biotase per day). Quality of life was measured and compared by the
      gastro-intestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) before and two weeks after in both groups.
      The higher score means that they have better quality of life. Through this study, we hope
      that we can find a effective probiotics can help all the patient received gastric bypass and
      bothered by their gastrointestinal problems also can improve their satisfaction of this
      operation.
