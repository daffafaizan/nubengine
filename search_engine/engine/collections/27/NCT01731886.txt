      deaths each year in the United States. Approximately one third of myeloma patients develop
      hypercalcemia and about two thirds present with anemia. As the second most common hematologic
      malignancy, myeloma remains incurable. In the last forty years, options for therapy have
      included melphalan-prednisone, anthracyclines, and vinca alkaloids; however, relapse with
      those regimens continues to be inevitable with a median survival of 3 years.
