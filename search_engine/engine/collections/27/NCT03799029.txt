      and neural levels in ADHD, both before and after cognitive training where there has been the
      addition of motivation elements. Near and far transfers effects of this new program are
      evaluated. For far transfers, ambulatory assessment is used to improve ecological validity.
      Neural activity has rarely been examined in cognitive training with ADHD participants, and
      that is why this study also includes FMRI measures. Long-term effects, defined as three and
      six months following the completion of cognitive training, are also investigated. This study
      focuses on children, adolescents and adults with ADHD. Indeed, cognitive training effects
      have been rarely studied over the lifespan.
