      Primary

        -  Determine the 1-year local control rate in patients undergoing resection of a solitary
           brain metastasis comprising intraoperative radiotherapy using the INTRABEAM® system.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine distant recurrence of disease in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this therapy in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study.

      Patients undergo surgical resection of a brain metastasis. Patients then undergo
      intraoperative radiotherapy using the INTRABEAM® system.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      Patients are followed within 48 hours after surgery, at 1 and 3 months, and then every 3
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-62 patients will be accrued for this study.
