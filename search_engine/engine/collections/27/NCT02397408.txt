      I. To assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect and localize prostate
      cancer within the prostate gland.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect the specific location of
      metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph node regions in patients undergoing radical
      prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection.

      II. To assess the comparative performance of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to already available
      imaging scans (bone scan, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      [NaF PET/CT], multiparametric1H magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and/or pelvic CT scans) for
      detecting and localization of disease within the prostate, lymph nodes, and distant
      metastatic sites.

      III. To determine the temporal distribution of 11C- and 18F-choline radiotracer in patients.
      The tissue uptake, retention, and clearance will be determined.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare regions of uptake on the 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to that on the sentinel
      lymph node imaging scans in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node-guided extended pelvic
      lymph node dissection.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 11C- and 18F-choline whole-body PET/MR imaging. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed up for 3 hours
