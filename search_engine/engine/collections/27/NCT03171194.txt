      with moderate to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MSCs will be derived
      from healthy donor umbilical cord cells and 1 dose of MSCs will be tested. MUSC has a good
      manufacturing practice (GMP) quality Clean Cell Facility to ensure the quality and safety of
      the MSCs prior to infusing into study participants. The goal of this study is to determine
      the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.

      The MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy
      donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they
      are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and
      processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in
      this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually
      located in the arm or hand. All participants will receive standard of care and their safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
