      and the risk of developing severe acute GVHD in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients
      receiving immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors.

      This proof-of-concept trial is aiming at evaluating CALCIneurin activity as a monitoring
      biomarker of efficacy of cyCLOsporine - (CALCICLO) - for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD. Our
      aim is to assess whether a longitudinal monitoring of CN activity would permit to adapt and
      optimize the dose of CsA that would prevent the onset of severe acute GVHD, yet still
      maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile.
