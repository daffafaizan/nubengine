      cholecystectomy) is endotracheal intubation (EI). AuraGain and I-Gel are supraglottic airway
      devices (SADs) used for airway control for certain types of surgeries.Previous studies have
      investigated and/or compared the performance of ProSealâ„¢ LMA (Intavent Orthofix, Maidenhead,
      UK) during LC. But the performances of I-Gel and AuraGain have not been studied well yet. The
      main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performances of new types of SADs
      (i.e. AuraGain and I-Gel) with endotracheal intubation regarding their insertion times, ease
      of insertion and perioperative complications. The secondary aim was to observe their effects
      on hemodynamic parameters and peak airway pressures.
