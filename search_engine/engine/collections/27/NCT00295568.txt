      (IHI) between human motor cortices with learning of performance of an accurate motor task
      (pinch force control). Performing a simple motor task is associated with activation in the
      contralateral motor areas. Activation of the ipsilateral motor/premotor cortex might be
      elicited by performing more challenging and difficult unimanual motor tasks. However, the
      functional role played by this ipsilateral activation has been controversial, and is felt to
      be more prominent with more complex tasks. Several studies using paired-pulse transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) revealed a significant IHI from the active upon the non-active
      hemisphere. Together these results suggested IHI between motor cortical areas may play a
      critical role in motor control and could influence manual dexterity. Taking these into
      account, it raises the interesting question of whether the IHI balance between both motor
      cortices is progressively modified during the learning phase of an accurate motor task. We
      hypothesize that learning to perform a tracking motor task requiring accurate control of
      pinch force generation (Tracking accurate), will increase IHI from the "learning" to the
      "non-learning" hemisphere to a larger extent than learning to perform a less precise tracking
      motor task (Tracking non-accurate). The primary outcome measure will be the amount of changes
      in IHI from the "learning" to the "non-learning" hemisphere as a function of learning both
      motor tasks.
