      trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with untreated p185-HER2 overexpressing stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs
      in these patients. III. Assess the pharmacodynamics of these drugs in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Regimen A: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90
      minutes on day 2. Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV
      over 30 minutes on day 8 and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 15. Patients proceed to
      regimen B on day 22 of regimen A. Regimen B: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90
      minutes, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients
      receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8
      and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance: After
      completion of 6 courses, patients with stable disease or partial response receive trastuzumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes weekly until tumor progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-48 patients will be accrued for this study.
