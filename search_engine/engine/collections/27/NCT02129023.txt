      H1: Compared with the control group participants (who do not use exergame) the experimental
      group participants (who use exergame) have better change in physical fitness. The difference
      between these two groups in the amount of change is negatively related to past exercise.

      H2: Compared with the control group participants (who do not use exergame) the experimental
      group participants (who use exergame) have better change in (a) mental health and (b)
      physical health after the intervention. The difference between these two groups in the amount
      of change is negatively related to past exercise.

      H3: Compared with the control group participants (who do not use exergame) the experimental
      group participants (who use exergame) have better change in (a) attitude, (b) intention and
      (c) behavior of doing another exercise in the future. The difference between these two groups
      in the amount of change is negatively related to past exercise.
