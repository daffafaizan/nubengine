      with concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic
      cancer following chemotherapy. RP2Ds and schedule of sorafenib and vorinostat defined as the
      doses and schedule that are the same as or less than the MTDs and schedule.

      This is a dose-escalation trial employing a standard "3+3" schema of sorafenib and
      vorinostat.

      The sample size with a total of 5 proposed dose levels and starting at dose level 1B for dose
      escalation, the number of patients evaluable for DLT ranges from 4-30. To account for about
      20% patients anticipated to subsequently be found to be not evaluable for toxicity,
      authorization for enrollment of 36 patients will be sought from regulatory authorities.
      Likely scenarios probably involve 12-24 evaluable patients and therefore 15-30 patients will
      be enrolled in the study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2-3
      months up to 2 years or until death.
