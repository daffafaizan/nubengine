      hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) vs. low dose physiologic growth hormone (GH) vs. higher dose
      GH treatment and withdrawal on endogenous overnight growth hormone secretion and pulsatility,
      as well as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Subjects with HIV-infection will be randomized
      to receive one of three treatments: GHRH 2mg/day, or growth hormone 6mcg/kg/day (physiologic
      "low" dose), or growth hormone 2mg/day ("higher" dose) for 2 weeks. At baseline and after two
      weeks of treatment, we will assess overnight growth hormone by frequent sampling as well as
      insulin stimulated glucose uptake by clamp. Subjects will then stop the treatment and will
      return for an identical assessment after a 2 week withdrawal period.
