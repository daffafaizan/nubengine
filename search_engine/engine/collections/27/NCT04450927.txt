      generation in future research. This information will be drawn from standard medical
      care/procedures and follow up of patients and healthy volunteers, including transplant
      donors, who are not currently receiving therapy on an active NHLBI research protocol. It
      allows investigation into the problems of these patients for the purpose of teaching and
      furthering general knowledge. The ability to evaluate and treat patients with a wide variety
      of diseases is critical to maintaining our accreditation with the hematology-oncology,
      cardiology, and pulmonary fellowship programs and training our fellows to be competent
      physicians, as well as for keeping all staff, including senior staff, up-to-date and familiar
      with the evaluation and treatment of patients with a wide spectrum of diseases. Periodic
      follow-up and treatment of patients previously entered on NHLBI protocols in order to monitor
      the long-term course of the underlying disease and the consequences of experimental
      treatments is also required for fellowship training, and for maintenance of good referral
      relationships with patients and their physicians. This study also allows for standard
      apheresis procedures for transplant donors and for care of volunteers who may present with a
      treatable condition.
