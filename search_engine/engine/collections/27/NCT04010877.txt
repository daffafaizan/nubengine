      myeloblasts that grow in the bone marrow and interfere with the generation of normal blood
      cells.

      Over the past few years, several groups have demonstrated that CD33 and CD123 CAR T cells can
      eradicate AML in both preclinical and clinical trials. Nevertheless, relapse after CAR T
      therapy remains a critical problem in treating AML. Disease relapse can be caused by antigen
      escape and by the outgrowth of residual leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are not effectively
      eliminated by CAR T cells. CLL-1 (C-type lectin-like molecule-1) is a transmembrane
      glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in LSCs but absent in HSCs (hematopoietic stem cells),
      suggesting that CLL-1 might be a promising target for novel AML therapy. In this study, we
      use CLL-1 CAR-T in combination with CD123 and/or CD33 CAR-T as a new strategy to address LSC
      issue and prevent relapse caused by antigen escape.

      The T cells from patients or transplantation donors will be genetically modified with
      lentiviral CAR vector to recognize specific molecules (CD33, CD123 or CLL-1) expressed on the
      surface of AML cells. The engineered T cells will be applied to patients through intravenous
      delivery.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      multiple CAR-T cell therapy in AML. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the
      function of CAR T cells and their persistency in the patients.
