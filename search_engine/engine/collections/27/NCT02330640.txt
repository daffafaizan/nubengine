      treatment for preserving bypass graft patency. Although the dual antiplatelet therapy post
      CABG has not been recommended by guideline, present studies indicated the patients could
      benefit from the dual anti-platelet therapy. Using clopidogrel+aspirin could significantly
      reduce the early saphenous vein graft occlusion. . Many surgeons empirically prescribe dual
      anti-platelet therapy in spite of the indeterminacy of the clinical effects. ticagrelor is a
      novel, reversibly binding, oral, direct-acting P2Y12-receptor antagonist. The ONSET/OFFSET
      Study also shows that ticagrelor achieved much rapid and greater platelet inhibition than
      high-loading-dose clopidogrel in patients with stable CAD. ticagrelor is a novel, reversibly
