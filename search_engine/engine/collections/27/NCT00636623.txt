      problem effectively and this has led to other forms of treatment. The aim of treating FM is
      to decrease pain and increase function by means of a multimodal therapeutic strategy, which,
      in most cases, includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In the
      literature on non-pharmacological treatment approaches for FM, different managements are
      described, such as exercise, electrotherapy, patient education, self-management programmes,
      massage techniques, cryotherapy, and acupuncture. There are a number of reasons why patients
      choose these complementary and alternative medicine approaches, including dissatisfaction
      with conventional treatments or concerns over the toxicity of drugs. However, there is no
      consensus about which treatment approach is the best.The current randomised controlled trial
      was undertaken as a first pilot study to assess and compare the effectiveness of Pilates
      exercises, an active-group therapy, and connective tissue massage, a passive-personalised
      therapy, in the management of FM in females.
