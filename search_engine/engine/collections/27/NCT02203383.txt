      This may be Obstructive Sleep Apnoea due to loss of pharyngeal muscle tone (OSA, associated
      with obesity and snoring and predisposing to hypertension, heart attack and stroke) or
      Central Sleep Apnoea (CSA). CSA is particularly prevalent in severe heart failure and
      associated with an adverse prognosis. The mechanism involves reflex hyperventilation due to
      pulmonary oedema, exaggerated chemosensor response to hypercapnoea associated with increased
      sympathetic nervous system activation and a prolonged circulation time.

      It is known that CRT improved CSA in 'responders' but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesis
      that CRT normalizes the respiratory response to carbon dioxide (the hypercapnic ventilatory
      response - HCVR).

      We will screen patients undergoing CRT with an Embletta sleep study to identify a group with
      moderate to severe CSA and a group with no sleep apnoea (controls). Patients will undergo
      assessment of the hypercapnic ventilatory response with a Read Re-Breathe test prior to
      device implantation and 6 weeks and 6 months afterwards. The gradient of minute ventilation
      vs PaCO2 will be compared.
