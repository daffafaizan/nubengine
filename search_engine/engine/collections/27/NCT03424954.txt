      colorectal cancer, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, and ulcerative colitis. During the 30-day
      post-operative period, patients that undergo ileostomy have a 36.1% rate of acute healthcare
      encounter compared to 16.2% of patients undergoing similar surgery but with primary
      anastomosis. The 30-day hospital readmission rate for ileostomy patients due to dehydration
      and renal failure is 17%, with the median cost per colorectal surgery readmission being
      $8,885. Thus, there is substantial room for post-operative improvement in the care of
      ileostomy patients, both to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient quality of life. An
      automated text messaging system can provide a way to consistently monitor patients' ileostomy
      output, ensuring that patients are measuring their daily output as instructed and allowing
      for timely preemptive intervention should output be outside normal limits.
