      randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=16 x 3 groups, ingredients, recipes and a
      culinary workshop) or a control group (n=16 x 3 groups, ingredients and recipes). Online
      questionnaires will be administered via the secure platform of INAF (FANI) at the beginning
      and the end of the study.
