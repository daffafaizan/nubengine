      methotrexate in patients treated with efalizumab (Raptiva) increases efficacy. The secondary
      objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate the efficacy of Raptiva in maintaining the
      clinical improvement induced by short-term treatment with combination therapy of Raptiva and
      methotrexate 2) to evaluate the safety of short-term combination therapy of Raptiva and
      methotrexate.

      The design of this study is to gain better control of the disease process while reducing
      potential toxicities by beginning treatment with Raptiva and adding methotrexate to those
      patients who do not improve significantly
