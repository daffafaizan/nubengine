      symptoms of patients with knee OA by comparing a functioning brace with a dummy. The dummy
      will be manufactured by Ã–ssur and has the same look as the real brace, but lacks the
      fundamental tightening effect of the straps of the real brace (an insert of elastic bands
      assures this), thereby nullifying its unloading capabilities. In a recent trial by Dr.
      Ingvarsson, the brace seemed to lessen the pain from knee OA, but no randomised, controlled
      studies have been conducted. This is mandatory if the effect of the brace and its use as an
      accepted treatment for knee OA is to be advocated for general use.
