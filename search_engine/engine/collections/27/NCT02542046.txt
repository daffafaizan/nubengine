      in the United States, the quality of bowel opacification has not been compared between the
      three major classes of positive oral contrast material (barium sulfate, ionic iodinated
      contrast material, and non-ionic iodinate contrast material). The investigators will
      retrospectively identify 250 patients each who received oral barium sulfate, diatrizoate, and
      iohexol for CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis (total 750 patients) and assess the quality
      of bowel lumen opacification by the positive oral contrast agents.

      Primary objective:

        -  To show the uniformity of bowel opacification is different between the three main types
           of CT oral contrast material used in the United States (Barium sulfate, Diatrizoate, and
           Iohexol).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To show whether or not one of the oral contrast agents provides more uniform
           opacification than the others in the proximal or distal bowel

        -  To assess the relative opacification of the distal small bowel (ileum) by the three
           contrast agents.
