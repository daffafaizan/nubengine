    
      All children between 3 -15 years old with clinical symptoms suggestive of pharyngitis (Mc
      Isaac score ≥3) and a microbiological test (rapid antigen detection) positive for group A
      Streptococcus (GAS) will be included in the study. In order to assess the strain of GAS as
      well as to identify co-infected children with respiratory virus, a throat culture and a
      nasopharyngeal swab will be performed, as well as a standard questionnaire and a standard
      physical exam. At this time, children will be randomized to either 6 days of amoxicilline or
      6 days of placebo treatment. During the treatment period, the investigators will ask the
      parents/legal guardians of the patients to pay close attention to the evolution of the
      symptoms (fever, pain, exudates…) as well as the treatment's adverse event, and to report
      their presence or absence in a dairy form. At day three after initiation of treatment, a
      standardized clinical evaluation will be completed by phone to identify if the patient still
      has symptoms of pharyngitis or signs of suppurative complications. One month after the
      inclusion in the study, a throat culture, a standardized questionnaire as well as a clinical
      evaluation will be performed to identify if the patient has or had signs of non-suppurative
      complications and non-resolving infection. Six month and one year after inclusion, a phone
      call will evaluate the possible relapses, recurrences and complications of GAS infection with
      a standardized questionnaire. GAS strains will be analyzed to identify their unique
      fingerprint and viral coinfections will be reported to possibly identify cofactors for
      increased complication rates.
