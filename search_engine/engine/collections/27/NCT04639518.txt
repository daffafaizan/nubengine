    
      This is a multi-center, open-label trial to be conducted in up to 70 pre-term infants in
      order to evaluate the safety and suitability of two feeding systems as they would typically
      be used in the neonatal care unit. Growth (in comparison to recommended growth goals),
      feeding tolerance, biochemical parameters, and adverse event reporting will be evaluated.

      The two feeding systems will be tested in two sub-studies to be conducted sequentially:
      sub-study 1 will evaluate a two-staged feeding system with HMOs in up to 35 pre-term infants;
      sub-study 2 will evaluate a two-staged feeding system without HMOs in up to 35 pre-term
      infants.
