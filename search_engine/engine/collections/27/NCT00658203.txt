    
      The study is a prospective, multicentre, controlled and randomised clinical investigation,
      with two single-blinded arms.

      The objective of the study is to compare the clinical benefits of Cardiac Resynchronisation
      Therapy (CRT) optimised by automatic PEA sensor features (PEA-CRT), with those obtained by
      standard optimisation procedure (STD-CRT).

      The patient candidate for inclusion in the study has a severe chronic Heart Failure,
      indicated for the implantation of a Biventricular pacing system according to updated ESC
      guidelines (2005).

      All patients included in the study will be followed-up for 1 year; patient's follow-ups are
      scheduled during hospitalisation, at one month, 3 months, 6 months and one year after
      implantation.
