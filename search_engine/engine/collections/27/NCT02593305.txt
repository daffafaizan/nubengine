      disease and stroke. Blood pressure regulation is mediated by many factors including but not
      limited to metabolic factors, pressure/stretch sensing receptors located in the aorta and
      carotid arteries, endothelial cell function, and kidney function (via water and sodium
      absorption/excretion). It has been shown that many of these regulatory mechanisms are altered
      and/or become dysfunctional with aging. Specifically older adults commonly demonstrate a
      decreased sensitivity in pressure receptors and/or endothelial dysfunction. Additionally with
      aging, there is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and arterial stiffness
      which can contribute to higher blood pressure. The important vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO),
      has been implicated as a key signaling molecule involved in several of the mechanisms in
      blood pressure regulation outlined above. A decreased NO production or bioavailability is
      thought to contribute to several of the physiologic changes that come with aging. Therefore,
      the overall aim of this study is to use a randomized, double-blind crossover, placebo
      controlled study to examine the effects of acute dietary nitrate supplementation (to boost
      bioavailable NO) on various parameters of blood pressure regulation and responsiveness in
      normal healthy older adults. Our main hypothesis is that 4 weeks of dietary nitrate
      supplementation will decrease the blood pressure responses in older adults in response to a
      variety of physiological stressors.
