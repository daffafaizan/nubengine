      stressor ([yohimbine + hydrocortisone] vs. placebo) within-subject, randomized crossover
      design. Each participant will complete 4 sessions (stressor vs. placebo, crossed with rTMS
      vs. sham), each separated by at least 1 week. Participants will complete these 4 (2x2 within
      subject) test conditions in randomized order: sham rTMS/placebo stress, sham rTMS/active
      stress, active rTMS/ placebo stress, and active rTMS/active stress.

      The PI will perform randomization using a Latin Square and will assign participants to
      conditions and prepare medication (stressor or placebo) for each participant's sessions. The
      PI will keep others blinded and will not be involved in study assessments.
