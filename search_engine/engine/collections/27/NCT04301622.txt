        1. To estimate the individual component survivorship of EVOLUTION速 BIOFOAM速 Tibia and
           EVOLUTION速 CS/CR Porous Femur components, including EVOLUTION速 CS tibial inserts

        2. To find out the cumulative incidence of component revision of each component in this
           combination.

        3. To find out the functional outcome scores at early, midterm, and long term follow-up.
