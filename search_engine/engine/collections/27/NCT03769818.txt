      abdominal surgery. In the last decade, there has been a significant shift away from thoracic
      epidural analgesia (TEA) that has been long considered as the gold standard. Various
      techniques have tried to replicate the analgesic efficacy of TEA. They include transversus
      abdominis plane analgesia (TAP), rectus sheath analgesia (RS), wound infusion analgesia (WI)
      and trans muscular quadratus lumborum analgesia. However, each of these techniques has
      specific limitations that prevent them from being the analgesic technique of choice for all
      open abdominal surgeries. Chin et al first described the erector spinae plane (ESP) block for
      providing analgesia following ventral hernia repair. The unique feature of the
      ultrasound-guided truncal blocks is that in all of these techniques, in contrast to
      peripheral nerve blocks, no nerve or plexus needs to be identified: Local anesthesia (LA) is
      injected in a particular muscle plane, in which the injectate spreads and reaches the
      intended nerves. This simple mechanism has made delivery of nerve blocks easy and versatile.
