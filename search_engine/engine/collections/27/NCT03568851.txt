      participants will undergo an informed consent process. After, participants will answer
      questions regarding demographic information, medical history, obstetric and reproductive
      history, previous lactation history, and the Infant Feeding Intentions questionnaire.

      Participants who are eligible after the second eligibility verification at the time of
      delivery hospitalization will be enrolled in the study. Enrolled participants will be given
      breastmilk and infant feeding logs to complete. Study staff will contact participants at 1,
      2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after delivery to ask about breastmilk feeding practices in the last
      24 hours, infant feeding, vaginal bleeding, sexual activity, use of contraceptive methods,
      and repeat pregnancies. In between the monthly phone calls, study staff will ask participants
      about the occurrence of vaginal bleeding.

      For the sub-study, participants are recruited from the main study. Those who are eligible and
      interested will undergo an informed consent process. Participants will be given urinary LH
      detection kits and instructions for use at time of enrollment. Daily urine LH testing will
      start after 8 weeks postpartum. Participants will also receive monthly diaries to complete in
      addition to the breastmilk and infant feeding logs in the main study. Study staff will
      contact participants at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months to review the diary information. If the
      urine LH test is positive, the participant will undergo a blood draw for serum progesterone
      levels to confirm ovulation.

      The planned enrollment is 394 participants for the main study and 40 participants in the
      sub-study.
