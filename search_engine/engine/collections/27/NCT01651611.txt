      randomized to the experimental condition and 10 to the control condition. All smokers who
      enroll in the study at a particular PHD receive the same intervention. Smokers at control
      sites receive written materials that offer strategies for quitting and information about
      availability of treatment programs, as well as a one-time meeting with a Tobacco Treatment
      Advocate (TTA). The intervention group receives the same written materials but also has much
      more extensive interactions with a TTA. TTAs provide peer counseling (Peer Counseling is
      defined as: performance of limited counselor functions, under counselor supervision, by
      person of similar age,gender, race, ethnicity and/or SES of the counselee) to smokers during
      in- person Motivational Enhancement meetings (target range 7-9) as well as additional in
      person and phone contacts, as needed for each participant, over a 6-month period. TTAs
      receive intensive training in motivational interviewing and smoking cessation counseling
      deliver the intervention components (counseling activities and provision of environmental
      supports) in addition to encouraging utilization of smoking cessation treatment programs such
      as the Smokers' QuitLine (SQL) and clinic-based programs. In order to avoid the potential for
      contamination due to TTAs interacting with participants at both intervention and control
      sites, meetings with participants at control sites are conducted by special Control TTAs.
      Data are collected from study participants at baseline, 3 months, 7 months and 12 months, and
      also from the SQL and clinics.
