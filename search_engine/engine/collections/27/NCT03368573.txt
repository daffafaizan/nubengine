    
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the
      study design using a feasibility RCT.

      The end-points to assess this objective are:

        -  Acceptability of randomisation. The number of patients who do not participate and state
           randomisation as the reason for non-participation. The study team shall also monitor
           drop-out rates immediately after randomisation and the number of errors in randomisation
           at each site.

        -  Acceptability of study design. The number of eligible patients at each site and the
           numbers who consent to take part/withdraw. Withdrawal rates will be recorded alongside
           time point in the trial to ascertain acceptability of the study duration.

        -  Acceptability of outcome measures. Completion rates for outcomes to determine most
           appropriate methods of data collection.

        -  Acceptability/feasibility of protocol. Record non-adherence of healthcare professionals
           to the protocol and explore reasons.

        -  Feasibility of future RCT. Estimate the hours per week needed to run the RCT and
           therefore the number of research assistants/fellows required and time commitment
           required by HCPs.
