      metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin calcium, and
      gemcitabine. II. Evaluate and establish the toxic effect profile of 5-FU, leucovorin calcium,
      and gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intravenous leucovorin calcium for
      60 minutes and bolus infusions of fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by gemcitabine infusions,
      weekly for six weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. The dosage of gemcitabine is increased if
      fewer than 3 of the first 6 patients experience grade 3-4 toxicities. Phase II proceeds at
      the maximum tolerated dose (1 dose level below that at which 3 patients experience grade 3-4
      toxicities). Patients receive a minimum of two courses of treatment to be considered
      evaluable for response. Patients with stable disease, partial, or complete remission may
      continue therapy for up to six treatment cycles. Patients exhibiting disease progression or
      intolerable toxic effects are removed from the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued.
