      spots on the enamel around the brackets and can lead to cavitation (Al Maaitah et al., 2011).
      White spot lesions compromise esthetics and can be extremely difficult or even impossible to
      reverse.

      Natural remineralization through saliva involving a mineral gain in the surface layer of
      white spot lesions has little improvement on the esthetic and structural properties of the
      deeper lesions (Karlinsey et al., 2009 and Cochrane et al., 2010). Management of white spot
      lesion should involve methods of both preventing demineralization and encourage the
      remineralization of existing lesions. In both of these processes, the efficacy of fluoride is
      well established. Fluoride increases the initial rate of remineralization of early enamel
      lesions. Consequently, it slows down the caries process and arresting the lesion. Fluoride
      varnish provides a protective coat over the tooth which adheres longer to the tooth surface
      (Demito et al., 2004 and Ten Cate et al., 2008).
