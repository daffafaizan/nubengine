      quality, endometrial receptiveness and pre-embryo transfer. Several previous studies show a
      lack of agreement concerning the greatest measurement. For instance, some of them refer to
      the distance between the catheter and the uterine fundus, whereas some others take as a
      reference the air-bubble where the pre-embryos were placed.

      It is for this reason that in the present study, we aim to evaluate the air bubble location
      ratio into the uterine cavity with reproductive success, taking into account the different
      variables to reach success. That is, embryo characteristics (quality, development day)
      endometrium preparation (cycle type, hormone levels on day 5) and even the transfer procedure
      (type of catheter, blood, difficulty channeling).

      It is a study that aims to collect data from January 2013 to october 2019. To this end, the
      images generated during pre-embryos transfer are analyzed retrospectively. Therefore, it is
      evaluated the existing differences on implantation rate according to air-bubble placement
      into uterine cavity during the transfer procedure.
