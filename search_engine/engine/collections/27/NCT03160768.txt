      identified from SJLIFE protocol participants. After signing consent, the subject will have a
      blood specimen collected at the same time as the blood draw for the SJLIFE protocol. These
      samples will have T cell isolation performed then placed on ice and stored until batch
      shipment for investigation of p16 expression.
