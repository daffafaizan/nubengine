      the United States and they suffer high rates of obesity. Short sleep is a risk factor for
      obesity. An improved understanding of the underlying behavioral mechanisms by which short
      sleep duration may impact obesity among Mexican American children is critical to prevent
      and/or reduce obesity and chronic disease in this population. This research will focus on
      behavioral mechanisms (i.e., diet and physical activity) that link sleep duration to obesity.
      Mexican American 8-10-year-olds will participate in a 3-week crossover study to examine: 1)
      contextual factors (i.e., bedtime routines, sleep hygiene, familism) that may impact sleep;
      and 2) the impact of prior night's sleep duration on diet and physical activity the
      subsequent day. This research design will make it possible to examine whether sufficient
      sleep is protective of energy balance (e.g., healthful dietary intake/patterns and physical
      activity) as well as contextual factors related sleep.
