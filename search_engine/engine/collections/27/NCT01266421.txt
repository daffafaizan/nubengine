      fertility. It causes chronic inflammation, ovarian cyst formation, fibrosis and adhesions.
      Symptoms seem to respond to decreased circulating estrogen. The mainstay of medical treatment
      is hormonal induced anovulation and a reduction in endogenous estrogen production.

      Medications for endometriosis such as Danazol and GnRH agonists have clinically relevant
      side-effects limiting treatment duration with these medications to 6-12 months.

      Dienogest (DNG) is a 19-nortestosterone derivative progestogen. DNG 2mg/day is a reliable and
      effective treatment for dysmenorrhea, premenstrual pain, dyspareunia and diffuse pelvic pain
      associated with endometriosis.

      Two important class effects of progestogens are the induction of bleeding disturbances and
      their influence on mood disturbance. It is not known what influence DNG will have on bleeding
      disturbances associated with endometriosis, particularly over a longer time frame.

      In addition, women who suffer from endometriosis are at high risk of developing depressive
      symptoms. It is difficult to differentiate if depressive symptoms are causally associated
      with progestogen use or sequela of the disease process.

      This study investigates the safety of DNG for endometriosis with regard to medical
      interventions for anemia and worsening of depressive symptoms associated with the disease. It
      is a prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort study with two cohorts: users of DNG
      and users of other medications for the treatment of endometriosis. The study will be
      implemented in several European countries.
