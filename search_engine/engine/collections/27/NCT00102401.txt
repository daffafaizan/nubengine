      continue to experience dyspnea or shortness of breath. This study will evaluate two different
      ways to provide education and support to help patients manage their shortness of breath. One
      program will be conducted in a face-to-face setting and a second through the Internet. The
      main difference between the two programs is the way they are administered. The education,
      exercise, and monitoring components are the same. The overall goal of this study is to find
      out whether the two programs are comparable in their effect on shortness of breath (dyspnea)
      with activities of daily living, exercise adherence and performance, and pulmonary
      exacerbations (frequency and duration) at 3 and 6 months. Perception of support,
      self-efficacy for exercise and managing dyspnea, and health resource utilization will also be
      measured at 3 and 6 months. This study is a randomized, longitudinal, repeated measures
      design with measurement times at 0, 3, and 6 months.
