      determine how much perampanel actually crosses the blood brain barrier into the cerebral
      spinal fluid when the drug is taken.

      During a routinely scheduled neurosurgical procedure, one to two mL of cerebral spinal fluid
      will be obtained from the subarachnoid space of the brain. Five mL of arterial blood will
      also be drawn from the patients arterial line during their procedure. The blood samples and
      cerebral spinal fluid samples will be compared to see how much perampanel is in the blood
      versus the cerebral spinal fluid.
