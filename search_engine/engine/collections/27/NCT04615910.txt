      within the INNODIA project (an Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium (IMI-2),
      established through Horizon 2020 initiative of the European Union, involving academic,
      industry and charitable partners).

      In the VER-A-T1D study, the effects of treatment of newly diagnosed patients with T1D with
      Verapamil will be evaluated. Verapamil appears to protect beta cell function, an effect that
      could in part be caused by protection against beta cell apoptosis. GLP-1 receptors are
      expressed in high densities in beta cells. Exendin, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, can be labeled
      with radionuclides and thus be utilized for visualization of beta cells in vivo by positron
      emission tomography (PET). This technology has been demonstrated to deliver quantitative
      information of the radiotracer uptake in the pancreas demonstrating a linear correlation with
      beta cell mass. In VER-A-T1D, we propose to measure beta cell mass at the time points of
      inclusion and at evaluation after 12 months. If verapamil protects beta cells against
      apoptosis, we expect that the uptake of the radiotracer will be higher at 12 months in
      comparison to the first measurement in the treatment group. The study will be a substudy to
      VER-A-T1D.
