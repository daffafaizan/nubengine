    
      To enhance the care of patients seen in the primary care setting, Atrium Health has designed
      a virtual behavioral health integration program. A behavioral health care team comprised of
      licensed clinicians (Behavioral Health Professionals), health coaches, a consulting
      psychiatric pharmacist and psychiatric providers follow patients for up to 3 months or more
      depending on patient need after their primary care office visit. This virtual behavioral
      health integration (VBHI) program is currently available in 36 Atrium Health primary care
      practices providing support to over 200 providers and medical residents. The Behavioral
      health Service line is expanding the program to additional primary care practices. Atrium
      Health and the Carolinas Physician Alliance is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of
      the program on reducing the total cost of care.
