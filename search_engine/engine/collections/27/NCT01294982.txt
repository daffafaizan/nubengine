    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of AOBO-001 in adults with overactive bladder. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of AOBO 001 compared with placebo on the basis of the
      change from baseline in average number of micturition episodes per 24 hours from the 3-day
      diaries and average number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours from the 3 day
      diaries during the double-blind treatment period in adult patients with OAB. Secondary
      efficacy objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of AOBO-001 compared with placebo on the
      basis of the number and severity of urgency episodes by using the Patient's Perception of
      Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), nocturia episodes, volume voided per micturition, and
      Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) global assessment measure. An additional
      secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AOBO-001 compared with
      placebo.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions to double-blind treatment with AOBO
      001 1.6 g twice daily (3.2 g daily), AOBO-001 3.2 g twice daily (6.4 g daily) or placebo
      capsules twice daily.

      Efficacy assessments include urinary diary assessments, including the number of micturitions
      (daytime, nighttime), number of urge incontinence episodes, number/grading of urgency
      episodes (Patient's Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale or PPIUS), and volume of voided
      urine; and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) questionnaire. Safety assessments
      include post-void residual urine volume measured by bladder scan; vital signs, 12-lead ECGs,
      complete or brief physical examinations, clinical laboratory safety tests, and
      treatment-emergent adverse events.
