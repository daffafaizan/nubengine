      to 200 preterm infants. The aim and hypotheses were selected based on the most informative
      outcomes given the scope of the funding. The investigators will test the hypotheses that
      Nifty Feeding Cup feeding compared to generic cup feeding will result in:

        1. Less spillage

        2. Greater caregiver satisfaction

        3. Shorter duration of feeds
