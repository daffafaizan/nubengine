      others do not. There are many known factors which play a role in causing heart disease, such
      as diet and lifestyle. Also, we know that inflammation, a process in the body which causes
      painful joints in arthritis or swelling at a site if injury, also contributes to heart
      disease. In particular, we will address whether leukotrienes, a component of inflammation, is
      involved in promoting heart disease. We will study this by giving subjects at high risk for
      heart disease a drug called montelukast which causes leukotrienes to have a reduced effect in
      the body. In addition for comparison, we will give other subjects a placebo for the same
      amount of time. These subjects will then be crossed-over and will receive either montelukast
      or placebo depending on which treatment they received first. We will compare these subjects
      using blood tests to see if subjects who take montelukast show signs of less inflammation
      caused by early heart disease as compared to subjects who do not.
