      various previous studies.

      In addition, InterMune has also initiated an Early Access Program to make pirfenidone
      available to a limited number of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the United
      States. This program is also being conducted under this protocol. Registration of patients
      with documented IPF has been closed as of October 2005.
