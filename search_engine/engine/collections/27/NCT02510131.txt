      their problem and individuals for whom Kegel exercises are likely to be for benefit will be
      recruited into this study.

      One hundred and eighty women who participants who agree to be randomized to Kegel's or
      Hyacinth exercises will be randomized.

      The treatment allocation will be sealed opaque enveloped and stored in a secure location.

      Participants will be blinded from the treatment arm, and as much as possible, participants in
      different arms of the study would be given different appointment dates to avoid
      contamination.

      Exercises will be prescribed by a trained personnel, and flexibility is added to the routine
      to enable tailoring to individual lifestyles and choices.
