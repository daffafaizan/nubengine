      prostate cancer. The number of cells measured in these cancers has been shown to be
      prognostic. There is little information on the presence or importance of circulating tumor
      cells in bladder cancer. This trial is designed to determine if patients with advanced
      bladder cancer have circulating tumor cells and if these circulating cells are affected by
      treatment of the cancer.
