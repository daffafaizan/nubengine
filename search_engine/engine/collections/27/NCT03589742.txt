    
      This feasibility study intended for the evaluation of the technique in humans prior to a
      Safety and efficacy study based on the non-inferiority of AblaViewÂ® Ablation Catheter against
      a control device. Thus, no randomization has been decided and no blinding has been considered
      necessary.

      The primary clinical endpoints of this investigation are as follows:

        -  Primary Endpoint 1: Feasibility of the technique in humans. Validate that the technique
           is able to provide real time image of the change in the optical properties of the heart
           tissue during the ablation procedure.

        -  Primary Endpoint 2: Safety of the technique, major complications incidence (equal to or
           below regular procedure incidence of serious adverse events of 5%) 30 days after the
           procedure (ictus, cardiac tamponade, major hemorrhage, esophageal lesion, death)

        -  Secondary Endpoint 1: Safety of the device, complications incidence within the 30 days
           after the procedure (Detachable parts, irrigation leak, malfunction of the
           handling/steering, break of electrical parts and "pop" occurrence) The Principal
           Investigator will be responsible for the evaluation of the Primary Endpoint 1, providing
           feedback from every patient and describing the feasibility of the technique according to
           his criteria.

      The Primary Endpoint 2 will be measured according to the clinical practice guidance for the
      evaluation of: ictus, cardiac tamponades, major hemorrhage, esophageal lesion and death, and
      will be recorded right after the procedure and in the patient record for the 30 days follow
      up visit.

      The Secondary Endpoint 1 will be measured according to the Principal investigator's criteria
      and the assessment of the Medlumics technician for the evaluation of detachable parts,
      irrigation leaks, malfunction of the handling/steering, break of electrical parts and "pop"
      occurrence), and will be recorded right after the procedure and in the patient record for the
      30 days follow up visit.

      Subjects will only be replaced if the recruitment period is not ended and the eligible number
      of patients is under 15, they will not be replaced if they get excluded after the beginning
      of the study.
