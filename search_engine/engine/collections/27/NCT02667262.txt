      medical claims data. If such data can be used to develop a model for identifying patients
      experiencing prescription opioid abuse/addiction it could be widely applied to patient
      populations throughout the United States.

      A study recently conducted at Group Health comparing International Classification of Disease,
      Ninth edition (ICD-9) coding for opioid abuse/addiction to textual mentions in clinical notes
      describing abuse/addiction found that ICD-9 codes were 64% sensitive and 96% specific in
      their ability to identify patients experiencing opioid abuse/addiction (compared to evidence
      from clinical notes). This Group Health study considered codes for abuse (305.x) and
      addiction (304.x) equivalent because clinicians' usage of these codes did not differentiate
      well between abuse and addiction.

      Needed are methods that can accurately identify patients experiencing opioid abuse/addiction
      based on widely available claims data.

      This study will not evaluate opioid misuse because this will be captured by instruments in a
      prospective study of pain patients (Study 1A) using a combination of adapted validated
      instruments, and other new instruments that will be evaluated in post-marketing requirement
      (PMR) Study 2, plus medical record review to supplement questionnaire-based measurement of
      misuse, abuse and addiction with aberrant behaviors and physician text entries in the medical
      records.
