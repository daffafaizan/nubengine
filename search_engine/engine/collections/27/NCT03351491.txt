      the field of health. The appearance of numerous mobile health applications over the past
      years explains this strong attractiveness.

      According to some studies, these could lead to savings in health care systems by promoting a
      preventive approach and refocusing cares on the patient who would be more independent.
      However, not much data on the use of smartphone health applications by patients are reported
      in the scientific literature.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of use of smartphone mobile
      health applications among primary care patients aged 18 to 69 in the Grenoble region, France.

      The secondary objectives are the collection of the kind of application used, the rhythm of
      usage of these health applications and the comparison of the frequency of use with the
      sociodemographic, geographical and medical characteristics of the studied population.

      To this end, the investigators use a questionnaire distributed by voluntary general
      practitioners and filled by patients. The number of subjects to be included is 385 and the
      number of distributed questionnaires is 1500.
