      standard of care treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Fatigue is a very common side
      effect of sunitinib that frequently causes dose reductions. The cause of this fatigue remains
      unclear. It has been shown that TKIs disrupt growth factor pathways in muscles leading to
      muscle shrinkage. If sunitinib associated fatigue is due to altered muscle physiology at a
      molecular level, there will be observable changes in the uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi in
      scintigraphy scans. The study objective is to determine if sunitinib-induced fatigue as
      determined by VO2 and QOL fatigue related questionnaire responses are correlated to molecular
      changes in the muscles as evidenced by 99mTc-sestamibi uptake.
