      word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether daily administration of levodopa, coupled with
      several hours of language training every day, will significantly improve naming abilities in
      patients with aphasia as compared to placebo administration. We furthermore examine with
      magnetic resonance imaging which brain regions need to be functionally intact for a
      dopaminergic improvement of language therapy.
