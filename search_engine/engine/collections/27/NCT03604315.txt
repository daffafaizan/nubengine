      I. Evaluate fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace ([18F]Fluorthanatrace) positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as an imaging biomarker of poly [ADP-ribose]
      polymerase (PARP)-1 activity in 3 cohorts of cancer patients: 1) ovarian, fallopian tube,
      primary peritoneal 2) breast cancer, and 3) non-ovarian, non-breast solid tumor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of [18F]Fluorthanatrace. II. Correlate [18F]Fluorthanatrace uptake
      measures with BRCA mutation status. III. Correlate [18F]Fluorthanatrace uptake measures with
      poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP-1) activity in tumor tissue samples in patients who
      undergo biopsies.

      IV. Evaluate change in [18F]Fluorthanatrace uptake measures after therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously (IV) and undergo FDG PET/CT scan over
      20-30 minutes if they have not already had one per standard of care. At least 20-24 hours
      later, patients receive fluorine F 18 fluorthanatrace IV and undergo fluorine F 18
      fluorthanatrace ([18F]FTT) PET/CT over 1 hour.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours.
