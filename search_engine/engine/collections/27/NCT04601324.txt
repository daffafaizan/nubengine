      prevalence worldwide. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis has a significant negative impact on an
      individual's quality of life. When the symptoms are not well managed with allergen avoidance
      and first line pharmacotherapies, patients often resort to using a combination of
      medications. Physicians may recommend combination therapies to patients with
      moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis, however, there is a scarcity of research indicating
      efficacy of combination therapy use. The investigators of this study aim to evaluate the
      efficacy of combining oral antihistamine (rupatadine) with nasal steroid (fluticasone
      propionate) compared to a well-studied combination therapy of nasal steroid with nasal
      antihistamine spray (MP-AzeFlu) in people suffering from medium-to-severe allergic rhinitis.
      Oral rupatadine is a potent antihistamine and platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist,
      which has not been studied in combination therapy in allergic rhinitis. Fluticasone
      propionate is a well established, first line nasal steroid.

      Adults 19 years or older, seen in the Principal Investigator's office presenting with
      moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis will be identified by the principal investigator and
      invited to participate in this prospective study. Patients will be recruited into the study
      in a consecutive manner. After providing consent, baseline characteristics will be collected.
      The investigator aims to recruit 51 patients in each study group respectively. Descriptive
      statistics will be used to analyze the baseline characteristic data.
