      specific coagulation profile associated with thrombocytopenia. This distinct entity, defined
      as thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (TAMOF), has been demonstrated to
      predispose affected children to worsening organ failure and increased risk of death. A
      preliminary single-center study performed at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP)
      suggested significant improvement in organ system dysfunction in TAMOF patients using a
      plasma exchange protocol compared to standard therapy alone. The investigators desire to
      further evaluate plasma profiles and clinical outcomes in pediatric TAMOF in a broader
      geographic setting. The investigators propose to perform a prospective multi-center
      observational cohort study to evaluate plasma response and clinical outcomes in pediatric
      patients with TAMOF due to critical illness associated with systemic infection, sepsis, organ
      transplant, chemotherapy or cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma samples will be obtained from all
      patients for measurement of markers of coagulation and inflammation. The primary clinical
      endpoints measured will be organ failure index scores, pediatric logistic organ dysfunction
      (PELOD) scores, and days until resolution of organ failures. Cohort outcome analysis will
      also be performed by pairing patients at different centers receiving standard therapy with
      those receiving plasma exchange as an additional therapy.
