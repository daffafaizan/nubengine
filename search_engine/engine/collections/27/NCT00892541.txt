      crossover study in healthy male volunteers. The study consists of a screening period (within
      21 days before the first study drug administration) before randomization; an open-label
      treatment phase consisting of 2 periods during which subjects will receive a single oral dose
      of ER OROS paliperidone alone (Treatment A) or in combination with 200 mg trimethoprim twice
      daily (Treatment B); and end-of-study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures
      in Period 2 or early withdrawal. The pharmacokinetic blood and urine samples will be
      collected over a 96 hour period after ER OROS paliperidone administration. Successive ER OROS
      paliperidone administrations will be separated by at least 14 days. Given that the main
      elimination route of paliperidone is renal clearance and about half of this is through active
      secretion in the renal tubule, competition for this route of elimination can occur when other
      actively secreted drugs are coadministered. Therefore, the possible influence on the renal
      excretion of paliperidone will be investigated when a competitor for active renal secretion,
      trimethoprim, is coadministered. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the
      study. Treatment A: a single oral dose of 6 mg ER OROS paliperidone on Day 1; Treatment B: a
      200 mg trimethoprim tablet twice daily from Day 1 to Day 8 and a single oral dose of 6 mg ER
      OROS paliperidone on Day 5.
