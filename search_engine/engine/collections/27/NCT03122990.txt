    
      Periodontal treatment, consisting in both supra- and sub-gingival mechanical instrumentation
      of the root surface (scaling and root planing), will be performed by a single periodontist on
      patients with periodontitis and hypertension.

      The aim of this study is to compare quadrant scaling and root planing (Q-SRP) versus
      full-mouth treatment (FM-SRP) in terms of acute-phase responses following non surgical
      periodontal treatment in patients affected by periodontitis and high blood pressure.

      Treatment will be provided using both hand and ultrasonic instrumentation with Ô¨Åne tips.

      FM-SRP patients will received treatment within 24 h. Q-SRP patients will received four
      quadrants sessions of periodontal treatment with an interval of 1 week between sessions.

      Vital, endothelial function and blood inflammatory parameters will be evaluated at baseline,
      24 hours after the first treatment and after 3 months. Periodontal parameters will be
      evaluated at baseline and after 3 months.
