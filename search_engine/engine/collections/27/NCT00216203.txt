    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Week 1 (day 1):

        -  Cetuximab 400mg/m2

      Week 2 (Cycle 1, Day 1):

        -  Cetuximab 250mg/m2 plus premetrexed at the assigned dose level.

      Patients will be treated with cetuximab on day 1, 8, 15 of each 21 day cycle.

      Patients will be treated with pemetrexed on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for a maximum of 6
      cycles.

      Acceptable toxicity and SD, PR or CR: treat up to 6 cycles then continue cetuximab weekly
      until PD or excess toxicity

      Performance status: ECOG 0-2

      Life expectancy: At least 12 weeks

      Hematopoietic:

        -  ANC > 1,500/mm3

        -  Platelets > 100,000/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 1.5 X ULN. AST may be < 5 X ULN for patients with
           liver metastases

        -  Alkaline phosphatase < 5 X ULN

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance > 45 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault)

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease (i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,
           unstable angina, and congestive heart failure)

      Pulmonary:

        -  Not specified
