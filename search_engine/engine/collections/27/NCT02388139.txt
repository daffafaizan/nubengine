    
      Gathered data:

        -  descriptive general demographic data;

        -  previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart
           failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting -
           CABG, known renal disease), cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal
           perimeter, body mass index, smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension,
           dyslipidaemia);

        -  routine biological data and specific non-genetic biomarkers;

        -  information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms):
           coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications,
           final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow);

        -  echocardiography at admission (LVEF);

        -  metabolic data (obtained from body composition monitoring) - body water, body fat
           tissue;

        -  renal arteries angiographic details (two independent operators evaluate stenosis based
           on a predefined scale);

        -  renal dimensions;

        -  measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs
           post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial);

        -  heart rate variability;

        -  in-hospital and one month follow-up MACE;
