    
      Specific Aim: To determine if adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to
      a single-injection nerve block results in improved postoperative pain control.

      Hypothesis 1: Adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to a
      single-injection nerve block results in lower average pain scores during movement the day
      following surgery.

      Specific Aim2: To determine if adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to
      a single-injection nerve block results in decreased average pain scores, opioid use, sleep
      disturbances, and improved patient satisfaction.

      Hypothesis 2: Adding a continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane nerve block to a
      single-injection nerve block results in decreased average pain scores, oral opioid
      consumption, sleep disturbances, and improved patient satisfaction the day following surgery.
