      block of choice for knee surgery. The ACB aims to inject local anesthetics (LA) within the
      neurovascular sheath in the subsartorial adductor canal around the femoral nerve. The point
      where the sartorius muscle crosses over the femoral artery is generally the accepted site for
      performing ACB. Clinically, injecting LA in the adductor canal blocks the sensory innervation
      of the knee and thus offers pain relief that is similar to FNB while conserving motor power
      around the knee. While these benefits are desirable, the exact location for performing ACB
      that ensures these benefits, remains debatable. The subsartorial adductor canal itself is
      7-10cm long and the anatomical location of the sensory and motor nerves that innervate the
      knee and its surrounding muscles in this canal may vary. This randomized controlled trial is
      designed to identify and refine the ACB technique by clinically determining the effects of
      various ACB injection locations on postoperative analgesia and quadriceps motor power
      following ACL repair.
