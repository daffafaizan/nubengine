      limb ischemia. The primary outcome is change in the six-minute walk distance at 3-month
      follow-up after the first study drug injection. A secondary outcome in change in six-minute
      walk distance at 6-month follow-up. Additional secondary outcomes are pain-free and maximal
      treadmill walking distance, calf biopsy measures of skeletal muscle regeneration, capillary
      density, and autophagy, and MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion at three-month follow-up.
      Investigators will also measure change in six-minute walk distance at 12-month follow-up.
