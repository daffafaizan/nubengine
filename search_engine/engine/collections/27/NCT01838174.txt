    
      Patients with their first episode of unilateral acute ON will be treated with either 3 days
      of IV methylprednisolone followed by 11 days of oral prednisone or 15 days of intramuscular
      or subcutaneous corticotropin (Acthar).

      This is a parallel active group, randomized controlled trial in which up to 100 people with
      clinically unilateral acute optic neuritis (â‰¤ 2 weeks of vision loss; with or without a
      previous diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS) will be treated with either ACTH or IV
      methylprednisolone/prednisone for 2 weeks to assess RNFL thickness. The primary, secondary,
      and tertiary outcomes will be as noted above. Participants will be assessed for
      inclusion/exclusion criteria by their treating neurologist/ophthalmologist at the University
      of Colorado Denver (PI- Dr. Jeffrey Bennett) or The University of Pennsylvania Scheie Eye
      Institute (PI- Dr. Kenneth Shindler). Following informed consent, the University of Colorado
      will determine patient randomization for both sites per the established randomization scheme.
      A secured fax or email confirmation regarding randomization will be sent to the University of
      Pennsylvania research staff and proper pharmacy orders will be placed by the site
      investigator or designee. We expect to enroll up to 50 subjects per institution.

      Following informed consent and randomization, participants will undergo baseline procedures
      (visit 1) and receive treatment with either high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg IV qD for 3
      days followed by 60 mg oral prednisone daily for 11 days) or Acthar (80 U IM or SC daily for
      5 days followed by 40 U IM or SC daily for 10 days). Study follow-up visits will subsequently
      occur at 1, 3, and 6 months. During each visit, including baseline (visit 1), ETDRS, low
      contrast acuity (2.5%), and color vision (Farnsworth D-15) will be assessed. OCT evaluations
      (Optic Disc Cube 200x200 and Macular Cube 512x128) will be performed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6
      months using spectral domain OCT (Cirrus OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Automated
      visual fields (Humphrey 30-2 SITA) will be performed at baseline (visit 1) and month 6.
      Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 Instrument, 25-item
      Visual Function Questionnaire with 10-item supplement, Beck's Depression Inventory
      questionnaires will be assessed at each study visit. The patient's treating physician will
      perform blood tests and MRI evaluations to exclude other causes of optic neuropathy at the
      initial study visit as part of their routine care.

      RNFL edema will be defined as either average RNFL thickness greater than the 95th percentile
      of the age matched normal database or a ratio of RNFL thickness (affected/fellow eye) greater
      than 1.1 in any quadrant.8 The study sites will collect and report data on AEs and SAEs per
      standard practice.
