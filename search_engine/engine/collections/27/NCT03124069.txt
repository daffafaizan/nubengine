    
      The investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded study. Up to 45 OSA patients
      who currently use a nasal or nasal pillows mask will be recruited

      This study will involve a baseline (Visit One) data gathering with the participant's PAP
      therapy and their usual mask. This will be followed by the participants being fitted with the
      trial nasal mask for use in-home (Visit Two). The participant then will come in to return the
      mask (Visit Three) and give feedback on their experience using the mask in home in the form
      of a structured interview during Visit Three. The maximum amount of time the participants
      will be exposed to the trial mask in-home will be 14 Â± 5 days from Visit Two.

      The mask and CPAP (if used from the loan research pool) will be returned to the institution
      at the conclusion of the trial and participant will return to their usual mask and therapy
      device for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

      Neither the investigators nor the participants will be blinded to the study.
