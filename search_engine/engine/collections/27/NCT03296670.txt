      documented as being the most effective method for restoration of epicardial blood flow.
      However, stenting does not necessarily equate to epicardial blood flow; not every patient
      achieves TIMI 3 flow after successful PCI.

      Currently, there are two main types of interventions to improve epicardial blood flow. One is
      the mechanical method, which included thrombus aspiration catheter and the distal protective
      devices. It has been confirmed that the mechanical method can effectively improve epicardial
      and myocardial perfusion in patient with part of large vessels and high burden thrombus. But
      for patients with small vessels and no obvious visual thrombus, the efficacy is not
      significant.

      The other intervention is medicine which included GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, adenosine,
      sodium nitroprusside, verapamil etc. Part of the drugs have some effect but the overall
      clinical efficacy is still not satisfied.

      The study intends to use targeted perfusion catheter to deliver drug to the distal targeted
      blood vessels. TFG and cTFC are applied to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with
      Alprostadil or Nitroglycerin on coronary blood flow in STEMI patients with CSFP.
