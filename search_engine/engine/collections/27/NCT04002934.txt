      which results in disruption of nerve signal, damage to axons, and, ultimately,
      neurodegeneration. In order to treat MS, new methods for promoting repair (remyelination) are
      sorely needed.

      There is a strong preclinical (including EAE) and epidemiologic rationale for investigating
      the remyelinating potential of estrogenic compounds, including evidence of endogenous
      (puberty, postpartum periods) and exogenous hormonal influences on MS risk and course. MS
      affects 3 times more women than men, and disease course in women appears overall less
      aggressive (on MRI, fewer T2-hyperintense demyelinated lesions develop into axonal
      destruction visualized as hypointense T1 "black holes").

      Bazedoxifene (BZA), a third-generation SERM with extensive safety data in humans, was
      identified in a novel high-throughput screen (BIMA screen) for compounds capable of promoting
      remyelination. Subsequent analysis validated BZA's remyelinating effect in vitro and in vivo
      following demyelinating insult. Given strong pre-clinical support for BZA's remyelinating
      potential, and the clinical success of other compounds identified using the BIMA screen
      (Green et al., 2017), the investigators will investigate the use of BZA as a remyelinating
      therapy in patients with MS.
