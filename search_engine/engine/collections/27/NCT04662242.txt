      acute inflammatory process within abdominal cavity. Many of the patients with acute abdomen
      have severe sepsis and are critically ill that require an emergency surgery.

      The mortality rate of such patients are high because these patients usually have a profound
      pathophysiological dysregulation and multiple organ dysfunction. One of the mechanism of is
      the loss of anti-oxidative capacity of cells that fail to recover from ischemic-reperfusion
      injury.

      Selenium is an important cofactor that participate in the antioxidant activity of glutathione
      peroxidase reaction. There are evidences that critically ill patients may benefit from
      selenium supplement by better outcome and less mortality but the dose and results are still
      heterogenous and inconclusive.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of selenium replacement in critical
      patients of acute abdomen, to see if there is a significant impact on prognosis, and to
      establish a clinical guide in the future.
