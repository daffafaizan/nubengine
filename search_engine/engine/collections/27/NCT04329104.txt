      (CIS43LS), a human monoclonal antibody, against naturally occurring Plasmodium falciparum
      (Pf) infection.

      The first part of the study is an open-label dose-escalation study for safety and
      tolerability. Participants will be assigned to one of three dose arms. Dosing will begin in
      the lowest dose arm. Once all participants in that arm reach Day 7 post-infusion, if no
      safety concerns have arisen, dosing will begin at the subsequent dose level. This process
      will be repeated until participants complete the third dose arm. Participants will be
      followed for safety to assess adverse events (AEs) at study visits 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28
      days after administration, then monthly through 24 weeks after administration.

      After the last subject in the highest dose arm reaches Day 7 safety follow-up, an interim
      safety evaluation will be performed before enrollment begins for the second part of the
      study.

      The second part of the study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      assess safety and protective efficacy of CIS43LS and placebo. Participants in the efficacy
      study will receive the study agent and be followed at study visits 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28
      days later, and once every 2 weeks thereafter through 24 weeks. Primary study assessments
      include physical examinations and blood collection for identification of Pf infection and
      other research laboratory evaluations.
