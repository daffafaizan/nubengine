      planus, 30 control individuals having age, gender and periodontal status matched with both
      patients groups acting as a control group. Relative gene expression of miRNA-138 was
      estimated using Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technique in oral mucosa of
      both oral lichen planus patients and control subjects. Sub grouping of oral lichen planus
      patients were performed into reticular, atrophic and erosive groups (n=10 each). Cyclin D1
      gene expression was estimated using Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      technique and Cyclin D1 protein level was estimated using immunohistochemistry.
