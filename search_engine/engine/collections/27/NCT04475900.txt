    
      In this study, an eye twin based on finite element modeling is used to measure advanced
      properties of corneal biomechanics. Raw data of Corvis ST measurement are exported from the
      device and imported into the model. The outcome of these calculations are merged together and
      are compared to further clinical findings (e. g. corneal topography and tomography, axial eye
      length).

      Further information were obtained:

      Age, sex, refraction, family history, known duration of disease, previous ocular surgery,
      systemic diseases, systemic and topical medication; biomicroscopy, anterior optical coherence
      tomography (OCT), Scheimpflug-based tomography (Pentacam), Biomechanical assessment (Ocular
      Response Analyzer and Corneal Visualization with the Scheimpflug Technology), optical
      biometry, confocal microscopy, endothelium cell count.
