      arms:

      Docetaxel Docetaxel + Gemcitabine

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (docetaxel) and 1 will receive
      treatment B (Docetaxel + Gemcitabine). The study is not blinded so both the patient and the
      doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
