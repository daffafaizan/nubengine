      peritoneal temperature during laparoscopic surgery.

      CO2 insufflation at the peritoneal level to generate the pneumoperitoneum necessary to
      perform laparoscopic surgery results in a decrease in peritoneal temperature greater than
      that generated at the central level (esophageal temperature).

      The potential long-term advantages of maintaining normothermia at the peritoneal level during
      laparoscopic surgery may derive from the reversal of the harmful effects of hypothermia at
      the level of the peritoneal microenvironment since the regional hypoxia resulting from
      vasoconstriction and the inhibition of functionality cellular that can favor complications
      such as bleeding or suture dehiscence.

      On the other hand, the immune system can be affected by regional hypothermia in several ways.
      First, postoperative vasoconstriction restricts metabolic heat to the central regions of the
      body and accelerates overheating, but can simultaneously reduce tissue perfusion by
      inhibiting oxidative destruction of neutrophils, which is the first line of defense against
      bacterial contamination. Second, hypothermia reduces systemic immunity and decreases
      macrophage motility. Third, hypothermia reduces the recovery capacity necessary for wound
      contamination.
