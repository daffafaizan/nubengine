    
      This study will be conducted in TWO (2) PHASES:

      Phase 1: Prospective cohort study of patients with diabetes mellitus, in which index cardiac
      MRI will be done after screening to determine FIBROTIC INDEX. Patients are subsequently
      followed for 5 years for a primary endpoint (composite cardiovascular event).

      Phase 2: Of the patients with "HIGH" FIBROTIC INDEX, 50 patients will be randomly selected
      and randomized 1:1 to placebo:eplerenone 25 mg daily for 6 months, and a repeat cardiac MRI
      will be done to assess the fibrotic index post-treatment.

      Phase 2 is a PILOT study of 50 patients.

      The inclusion/exclusion criteria for the different phases is shown below.
