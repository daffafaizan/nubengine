      perioperative adverse events including hypoxemia (1-3). The incidence of hypoxemia was 168
      per 1000 in a general procedural sedation and analgesia population (4). The clinical
      significance of transient episodes of hypoxemia remains debatable. However, many
      peri-operative incidents are often short-term and limited in nature, but a number of them are
      a predictor to a serious complication with a permanent injury (5).This study investigates if
      high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as compared to low flow nasal cannula (LFNC) will result in a
      lower incidence of intra-procedural oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia in patients with atrial
      fibrillation undergoing deep sedation for radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA).
