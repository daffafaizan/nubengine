      collection of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data,
      medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) from thousands of
      patients with cancer or at risk of having cancer. Their hope is to, over time, facilitate new
      clinical trials, technology, informatics solutions, and personalized medicine to each cancer
      patient.
