      This is a single-center prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Randomization will occur before operation.

      Operation: The surgeon will perform mitral surgery and only those patients randomized to
      tricuspid valve repair will perform tricuspid valve repair using a rigid 3-dimensional
      annuloplasty ring using standard techniques.
