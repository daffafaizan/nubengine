    
      Multicenter, open-label, outpatient study of the safety and effectiveness of repeated doses
      of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with troublesome sialorrhea. The primary
      goal is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC (administered
      intraglandularly as single total dose of 3,500 Units) treatments every 13 weeks over a
      maximum possible duration of 1 year in adult subjects with troublesome sialorrhea. The
      secondary goal is to assess the magnitude of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC (administered
      intraglandularly as a single total dose of 3,500 Units) using effectiveness assessments
      performed at intervals after treatments every 13 weeks over a maximum possible duration of 1
      year.
