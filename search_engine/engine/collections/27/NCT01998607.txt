    
      This is a multiple cross-sectional survey study of practicing oncology practitioners
      prescribing XGEVA in Europe from across but not limited to the 5 largest European countries
      by population (including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.) and 4 Nordic countries
      (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden). The survey will be conducted in two rounds. The two
      survey rounds will be conducted 12 to 18 months and 24 to 30 months after XGEVA becomes
      commercially available in the participating countries. The initial contact and screening of
      potential participating oncology practitioners will continue until a total of 210 eligible
      and consenting oncology practitioners complete the survey per round. For the 5 largest
      European countries by population, it is intended that 30 oncology practitioners will be
      surveyed per country per survey round. If this sample size cannot be achieved, oncology
      practitioners from another country in that region will be surveyed to achieve a regional
      sample size of 150 per survey round. Oncology practitioners from the Nordic countries will be
      surveyed to achieve a regional sample size of 60 per survey round. For all countires, the
      number of surveys collected in each country in the second survey round will, where possible,
      equate to the number of surveys collected in each country in the first survey round.
