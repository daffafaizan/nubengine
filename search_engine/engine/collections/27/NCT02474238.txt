      the perforation, the technique should be able to effectively combine most of the advantages
      of both lasers whilst avoiding their disadvantages. It is possibly the ideal iridotomy
      technique to use in the Asian irides. The investigators aim to study the energy use for laser
      iridotomy comparing between the two techniques as well as objectively measure the variables
      associated with complications.
