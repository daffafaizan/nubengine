      the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Adherence will be estimated based on to which
      extent the patients actually have effectuated their prescriptions at Norwegian pharmacies. In
      the 5-year long treatment period, the patients receive a prescription refill of tamoxifen or
      aromatase inhibitor tablets for a 100 days interval. Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) will
      be used as proxy for adherence. The estimations will be performed in the following way: For
      each patient, we will receive the total number of pills and the total length of time from
      first to latest prescription effectuated. MPR is the number of pills divided by the total
      number of days in the time from first prescription to discontinuation. Discontinuation will
      be estimated to date for latest effectuation of the prescription plus 100 days (due to the
      number of pills prescribed). From these estimations, we will categorize the patients in
      groups taking MPR and total period of time into consideration. Taking prescript medication
      equal to or more than 80% is considered as adherent (MPR â‰¥ 80 %). Likewise, non-adherence is
      defined as MPR < 80 %.
