      serum and, possibly, amniotic liquid. We will take an additional tube during the takings
      collected for routine management of the disease.

      The analysis of samples will be carried out in Toulouse at the Institute of Metabolic and
      Cardiovascular Diseases or with fee-for-service suppliers.
