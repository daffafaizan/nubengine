      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of alpelisib in
      combination with weekly cisplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate and median progression-free survival with the
      treatment combination in HPV positive (+) solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To characterize the safety profile of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 or 1-21, and cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, or days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
