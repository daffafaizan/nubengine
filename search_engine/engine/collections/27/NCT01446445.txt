      systemic exposure to the drug and is related to the effectiveness and safety. According to
      the population model developed by our group, less than 16% of patients treated achieve the
      therapeutic goal of AUC (40 to 50 mcg â€¢ h / L) after drug dosing according to summary of
      product characteristics (SPC). Especially, patients with impaired renal function values
      (creatinine clearance (CrC)l <30 ml / min) or high (CrCl> 70 ml / min) would be overdosed and
      underdosed, respectively, with the risk of more adverse effects or therapeutic failure.

      Therefore, the individualization of the dosage of GCV, can contribute greatly to achieve
      optimal exposure to the drug in transplant patients, especially in the cases of extreme
      values of renal function (CrCl decreased and high). As a consequence, minimize adverse
      effects, ensure greater efficiency in the target population and reduce associated costs.
