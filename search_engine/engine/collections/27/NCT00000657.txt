      may be caused by some action of the AIDS virus on the nervous system, although similar
      problems can be caused by other infections because the AIDS virus lowers the body's ability
      to fight other infections. It is important to determine whether symptoms are due to ADC or to
      some other infection since treatment varies for different conditions. AZT has been shown to
      be beneficial to people with ADC although its effectiveness has only been studied in a small
      number of patients. Studies suggest that higher doses of AZT are more likely to be effective
      than standard doses in improving symptoms of ADC.

      Patients are randomly assigned to receive either oral ddI or oral AZT.
