      treatment of ABPA consists in systemic corticosteroids and anti fungal therapy, which can
      have severe side effects. The diagnosis is difficult, based on several but non-specific
      characteristics. One of the radiologic abnormalities on CTscan could be more specific : high
      attenuation in impacted mucus, but this sign is found in about 30% of cases. Recent articles
      and investigators experience seem to demonstrate that MRI could provide an interesting tool
      for ABPA diagnosis, studying the signal of bronchial impactions. The aim of the study is to
      describe the MRI characteristics of patients with ABPA and compare the results with those
      obtained by CTscan, and in order to determine if there is a specific signal of impaction in
      ABPA.
