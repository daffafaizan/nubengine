           the "cytological molecular markers Detect + P16INK4A" methods of screening accuracy and
           reliability, as well as the screening method of the biological effects.

        2. Markov set up mathematical model of screening tests to quantify the inputs and the
           evaluation proceeds. With a view to optimize and perfect a simple, convenient, practical
           and efficient program of cervical cancer screening.
