    
      The study design is a prospective, multicenter, noncontrolled study of the commercially
      available Persona Partial Knee. The study will require each site to obtain IRB approval prior
      to study enrollment. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the
      Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their partial knee
      arthroplasty. Investigators will collect clinical data for a required 2 years with the option
      to continue follow-up assessment up to 10 years. Follow-up clinical visits include 3 months,
      1 year, 2, 5, and 10 years post-operatively.

      The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcomes
      data for the commercially available Persona Partial Knee System. The assessments will
      include: implant survivorship based on revision with removal of the study device; safety
      based on incidence and frequency of adverse events; and clinical performance measured by
      overall pain and function, quality of life data, radiographic parameters, and survivorship.
