      Inaccurate BPs may lead to under and/or over-treatment of health conditions and medical
      diseases such as hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) measurement using automatic, non-invasive
      oscillometric monitors is common in clinics, physicians'offices and hospital settings. The
      brachial (upper arm) site is the gold standard for non-invasive BPs. However, in some
      situations, this site is inaccessible due to injury, surgery, dialysis shunts, intravenous
      devices, and lymphedema. When the upper arm is difficult to access or the available BP cuffs
      do not fit an individual's arm, the forearm site is often the preferable alternative. The
      increased incidence of obesity nationally also contributes to the heightened use of forearm
      BPs. Questions remain concerning the accuracy of forearm non-invasive BP measurements.
      Although most researchers report that upper arm and forearm readings are not interchangeable,
      size of differences vary for individuals and factors influencing differences in readings have
      not been thoroughly investigated.
