      immunization of Sabin-IPV and DTaP be carried out as soon as possible, and the immunogenicity
      and safety studies should also be conducted. Currently in China the vaccination schedules of
      sIPV and DTaP overlap at infants' 3rd and 4th months of age. In order to avoid the
      vaccination time conflict and explore the possibility of simultaneous vaccination, we design
      this clinical study of simultaneous vaccination of the two vaccines.

      To be specific, the subjects were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 : sIPV (1st, 2nd, and 3rd
      doses) and DTaP (1st, 2nd, and 3rd doses) were simultaneously inoculated at 3,4,5 months old
      ; Group 2 : received 1 dose of sIPV at 3,4,5 months old ; Group 3 : received 1 dose of DTaP
      at 3,4,5 months old . Blood sample would be collected both before vaccination and 28-40 days
      after the 3rd dose of vaccination. Neutralization antibody would also be detected to evaluate
      the seroprotection rates and antibody geometric mean concentrations. The safety of both
      immunization schedule will be monitored as well.
