      measurements for accurate intraocular lens (IOL) calculation, surgical technique and
      surgeon's experience but also the use of prophylactic topical antibiotics and
      anti-inflammatories (steroidal and non-steroidal, NSAID) to decrease the risk of
      postoperative infection (i.e. endophthalmitis) and intraocular inflammation (i.e. macular
      edema, CME).

      Even though, the large body of literature that supports the significance of prophylactic eye
      drops prior to surgery, patient compliance is a common problem. Different factors have been
      associated with patient's lack of compliance. It could be due to patient's inability to self
      administer the drops, lack of understanding of the importance of using the prophylactic
      treatment as well as understanding the instructions of how to administer the drops and its
      storage, or just forgetfulness or the fact that they don't like to put the drops multiple
      times a day for 2-4 weeks, therefore they just avoid doing it.

      There is a new option called "Dropless cataract surgery". This modality of treatment involves
      the injection of an eye compatible compound at time of cataract surgery.

      The purpose of is to assess the efficacy the compound injected during routine cataract
      surgery and intraocular (IOL) implantation with and without a topical NSAID compared to
      standard prophylactic treatment that includes the topical use of Moxifloxacin, Ilevro, and
      Prednisolone acetate 1%.
