    
      Prospective, observer-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover, comparison in consecutive
      open-angle glaucoma patients, insufficiently controlled with preserved latanoprost
      monotherapy (mean 24-hr IOP greater than 20 mmHg). Patients were randomized to either morning
      (08:00), or evening (20:00) preservative-free tafluprost/timolol fixed combination for 3
      months and then were crossed over. After each treatment period patients underwent habitual
      24-hour intraocular pressure monitoring with Goldmann tonometry in the sitting position (at
      10:00, 14:00, 18:00 and 22:00) and Perkins tonometry in the supine position (at 02:00 and
      06:00).

      Primary Study Objective: Mean 24-hour efficacy with both dosing regimens of
      tafluprost/timolol fixed combination versus latanoprost monotherapy.

      Secondary Study Objectives

        1. Mean efficacy with the evening dosing of tafluprost/timolol compared with the
           morning-dosed tafluprost/timolol fixed combination at each time point measured.

        2. Mean daytime and mean nighttime IOP control with the two dosing regimens.

        3. Mean peak and fluctuation of 24-hour pressure with the evening and the morning dosing of
           the fixed combination.
