      transduced with a recombinant retroviral vector containing the low-density lipoprotein
      receptor gene. The transduced hepatocytes are infused via the inferior mesenteric vein 3 days
      following surgery.

      Traditional therapy is discontinued for 4 weeks prior to protocol therapy and may resume 6
      weeks after the hepatocyte infusion.
