    
      This pilot study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, which will compare endotoxin
      (0.4ng/kg i.v.) to placebo (0.0ng/kg) in non-treatment seeking adults meeting criteria for
      DSM-5 alcohol use disorders (n=32 total, n=16 per group).

      Eligibility screening consists of an intake session and a physical exam. Participants meeting
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive a single dose of 0.4ng/kg i.v. endotoxin
      or placebo during a single laboratory session to evaluate ad-libitum alcohol consumption.

      During the laboratory session, endotoxin (or placebo) administration will precede a 2-hour
      alcohol self-administration period.

      Participants will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to evaluate drinking behavior.

      Adverse events are evaluated during the laboratory session and follow-up, and will be
      tabulated.
