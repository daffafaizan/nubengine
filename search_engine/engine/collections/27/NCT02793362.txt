      trauma or generalized illness. However, the nature of these sarcopenia is different from that
      of geriatric population. Post stroke sarcopenia is underestimated however reduction in the
      motor uni number begins within 4 hours post stroke and after 3 weeks, sarcopenia can be seen
      in both hemiplegia and normal side. This muscular weakness can hinder functional recovery
      process.
