    
      -  Participants will be "randomized" into one of the following study groups: Docetaxel or
           Docetaxel with Zactima. Randomization means that participants will be put into a group
           by chance.

        -  The Docetaxel group will receive docetaxel on the first day of every treatment cycle,
           which lasts for 3 weeks. Even though treatment will occur once every three weeks,
           participants will return to the clinic on a weekly basis for the first two cycles. After
           the first two cycles, they will only have to return to the clinic at the start of each
           cycle.

        -  The combination Docetaxel and Zactima group will also receive docetaxel once every three
           weeks. In addition to the docetaxel, they will also take a Zactima pill orally every
           morning. They will also have to return to the clinic on a weekly basis just as those in
           the docetaxel only group.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed during each cycle of treatment,
           regardless of which group the participant is randomized into. These are considered
           standard of care for treating patients with chemotherapy for recurrent head and neck
           cancer: physical exams; blood tests; urine test; nasopharyngoscopy; repeat imaging of
           the tumor (x-ray, CT, MRI or PET); photographs of the tumor. In addition to the tests
           mentioned above, the Zactima group will have EKGs performed 3 times on the first day of
           treatment, once at week 2, then at the beginning of cycles 2 and 3, and then every 6
           weeks.

        -  Participants will continue on the study as long as they are receiving benefit and are
           not experiencing any unmanageable side effects.
