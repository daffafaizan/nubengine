      cellular process of autophagy resulting in neuronal cell death. This disruption leads to a
      form of spastic paraplegia with the additional disruption to involuntary body processes, such
      as respiration and thermoregulation. This study will provide valuable information about the
      natural progression of children with a TECPR2 mutation.
