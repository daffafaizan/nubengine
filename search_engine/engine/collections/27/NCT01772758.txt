      contributes to 1) endothelial dysfunction and 2) exercise intolerance in patients with CF.
      This study consists of two separate sub-studies, or protocols. Protocol 1: AOC tested the
      effect of an antioxidant cocktail (AOC) on endothelial function at rest and during exercise
      in CF patients. Protocol 2: BH4 tested the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on endothelial
      function at rest and during exercise in CF patients.
