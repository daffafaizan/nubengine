      hearing to listen selectively in the presence of noise, to combine information from two ears
      properly, to process speech when it is slightly degraded, and to integrate auditory
      information when it is delivered faster than the individual with (C)APD can process.( The
      estimated prevalence of (C)APD in the school-aged population is approximately 2 to 5 %, and
      the estimated prevalence of (C)APD in the older adult population is 76 %. These percentages
      are higher than those affected by hearing loss.

      Dyslexia and (C)APD are common comorbidities and since there is limited research on (C)APD
      within each related academic discipline. Furthermore the language, audiologiological , and
      cognitive nature of the disorder confirmed that a multi-disciplinary effort is needed in
      order to provide clinical decision and effective intervention for the (C)APD population.
      Hence Development of additional intervention tools for use in clinics, schools and home
      settings is warranted .

      The aim of this work is to develop a novel Arabic (C)APD remediation program ,to study the
      outcome of the program and to validate it's effectiveness by comparing it to the Arabic
      computer based auditory training(CBAT) program.
