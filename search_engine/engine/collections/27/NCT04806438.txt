      Group A (nebulized lignocaine group) as a control group (n = 60) received 5 ml of 10%
      lignocaine by air driven jet nebulizer for 20 min .

      Group B (nerve block group) (n = 60) received bilateral superior laryngeal nerve block and
      trans-tracheal instillation of 4 ml of 2% lignocaine, along with viscous xylocaine gargles
      twice.

      Patient tolerance was assessed using the Global Tolerance Score, based on a visual analogue
      scale ( VAS).
