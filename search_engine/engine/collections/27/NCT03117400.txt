      lesions ≥ 20mm (LSLs). There is no proven therapy for CSPEB and it remains a significant
      drawback of EMR. Visible vessels within the post EMR defect (PED) present themselves as
      logical targets for prophylactic treatment to prevent CSPEB. However, the clinical
      significance of these vessels is largely unknown. In the majority of studies risk factors
      identified for CSPEB include right colon location, lesion size and aspirin use. The
      investigators aimed to systematically describe and evaluate the clinical significance of the
      various endoscopic features of the post EMR defect PED including visible vessels.

      A prospective study of LSLs ≥ 20mm referred for EMR at a single tertiary referral center will
      be performed.

      Data collection includes patient, procedural and lesion characteristics. In all cases a
      systematic description of the PED is undertaken. The data of particular interest to this
      study includes: use of blood thinners, PED features including size, number and herniation of
      visible vessels, submucosal haemorrhage, fibrosis, fat and exposed muscle and the rate of
      CSPEB.These features were analysed for significant association with CSPEB. CSPEB was defined
      as any bleeding occurring after the completion of the procedure necessitating emergency
      department presentation, hospitalization or reintervention. CSPEB was compared to features of
      the PED to detect significant associations, using chi2 or Fisher's exact tests. Significant
      univariate variables will be taken forward for binomial logistic regression modelling.
