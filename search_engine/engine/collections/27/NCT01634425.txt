      the past decade; we now intend to investigate how best to achieve timely diagnosis and risk
      stratification of patients that present to pre-hospital emergency medical services with
      symptoms suspicious for acute NSTEMI through utilization of systematic clinical assessment,
      pre-hospital 12 lead electrocardiogram and point of care measurement of biomarkers.
      Additionally, where deemed appropriate these patients will be enrolled in a clinical Chest
      Pain Protocol utilizing the pre-hospital biomarkers. We hypothesize that establishing a
      pre-hospital diagnosis in this condition may facilitate efficient triage and -as appropriate-
      in-hospital disposition. Additionally, the enhanced pre-hospital assessment of this
      population will facilitate appropriate timely disposition of those patients not found to have
      acute cardiovascular disease. These processes will facilitate decanting the frequently
      overcrowded and under resources Emergency Departments.
