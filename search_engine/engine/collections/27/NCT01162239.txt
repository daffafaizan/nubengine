      treatment to other extended treatments. All participants will be assessed at baseline on
      demographics, smoking behaviors, nicotine dependence, depression, alcohol and other drug
      history and problems, mood disturbance, treatment support, stress, health status, and
      motivation for change. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment
      conditions. All participants will receive 12 weeks of combined pharmacological treatment
      (varenicline) and behavioral treatment (five individual counseling sessions). Following this
      brief treatment, participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment protocols

        1. Monthly Brief Contact or

        2. Extended Non-Specific Behavioral Treatment or

        3. Extended Relapse Prevention Treatment or

        4. Extended Relapse Prevention Treatment + availability of varenicline treatment.

      Each extended treatment protocol is 40 weeks in duration following the initial 12 weeks of
      treatment.

      All participants will be assessed at weeks 12, 24, 52, 64, and 104, on smoking as well as
      other psychometric measures.
