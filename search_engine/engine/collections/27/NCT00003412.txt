      interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) in women with advanced breast cancer who have undergone high dose
      chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. II. Determine the effect of rhIL-12 on cellular and
      humoral immune systems following high dose chemotherapy. III. Explore the effect on treatment
      failure of rhIL-12 after high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-12 (rhIL-12). RhIL-12 therapy begins
      3-5 weeks after discharge from the chemotherapy/stem cell transplant hospitalization or 2-3
      weeks after completion of posttransplant radiation. Patients receive rhIL-12 subcutaneously
      twice a week for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level
      of rhIL-12. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months after
      treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2
      years.
