    
      Patients with suspected, latent and manifest PH and controls are investigated by MRI
      according to the following protocol in breathhold or free breathing (depending on the
      patients' breath-hold abilities). In case of elevated Creatinin values, no contrast agent is
      applied.

        -  Planning of cardiac views: Planning of 2-chamber view, short axes view and 4-chamber
           view.

        -  Morphological overview: Transversal and coronal Haste images

        -  Left and right heart functional and valve evaluation: Cine 2-chamber imaging,
           Multi-slice cine 4-chamber imaging, Cine Left and Right ventricular outflow tract
           imaging and Multi-slice cine short axes imaging covering the left and right ventricle
           for evaluation of EDV, ESV, SV, EF, CO and muscle mass.

        -  Phase Contrast Imaging: Flow measurements in the aorta, the pulmonary artery and the
           heart.

        -  Perfusion measurement.

        -  Late enhancement measurement: Multi-slice short axes view, multi-slice 2-chamber view
           and multi-slice 4-chamber view.
