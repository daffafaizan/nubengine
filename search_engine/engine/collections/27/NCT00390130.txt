      serious adverse effects reported. However, pain on vaccination continues to be a frequent
      occurrence and is the most common cause of childhood iatrogenic pain. In a recent study of
      paediatricians in the USA, more than ninety percent reported at least one parental vaccine
      refusal in the past year. The most common concerns cited by parents were short-term reactions
      and pain from multiple injections.

      One of the factors responsible for vaccination pain is the vaccine material itself. Even the
      same vaccine, when made by different pharmaceutical companies may produce different pain
      responses. Anecdotal reports from doctors and nurses indicate that Pentacel (DPTaP+Hib) is a
      relatively painless vaccine to administer whereas Prevnar (conjugated pneumococcal vaccine)
      causes significant pain on injection and severe distress to the infant being vaccinated. For
      this reason, many vaccinators administer Pentacel [DPT] prior to Prevnar [PCV] when providing
      both vaccines in one visit. However, the difference in infant pain responses has not been
      documented. Although it has been shown that very early pain events affect infants' later
      experience of pain, it has not been demonstrated that the sequence in which vaccines are
      administered affects pain response. This study will assess whether there should be a
      predetermined sequence recommended for administering these two vaccines, with the less
      painful vaccine (Pentacel) being given first.
