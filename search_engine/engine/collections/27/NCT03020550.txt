      with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. We will measure heart rate variability and
      galvanic skin response in patients during the visits and video record the visits. Subjects
      will complete a daily GERD symptom diary for 2 weeks and then return to the study center to
      complete additional questionnaires and an exit interview.
