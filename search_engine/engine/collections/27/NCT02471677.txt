      longer elimination half-life and extended time to peak levels than recombinant follicle
      stimulating hormone (rFSH). A single injection of corifollitropin alfa may replace seven
      daily injections follitropin beta during the first week of ovarian stimulation, reducing
      patient discomfort.

      The purpose of this RCT is to compare a single injection of corifollitropin-alfa versus daily
      injections of follitropin beta regarding the number of oocytes retrieved, as well as hormonal
      profile and follicle development in patients with high response undergoing ovarian
      stimulation for IVF using a GnRH antagonist protocol. In addition, incidence of unexpected
      ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) will be evaluated, although it is anticipated that
      GnRH agonist triggering will eliminate occurrence of the syndrome.
