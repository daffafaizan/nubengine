    
      This is a first-in-human (FIH) study of 42037788 (referred to as CNTO 0007), a cell therapy
      being tested to see if it may be useful in treating patients with ischemic cerebral
      infarction also known as stroke. Patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive
      a single dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo (identical in appearance to CNTO 0007 but does not
      contain cells) by intravenous (IV) infusion (injection directly into a vein). Patients and
      study staff will not know if patients are assigned CNTO 0007 or the placebo. The study will
      be conducted in 2 stages (Stage A and Stage B). In Stage A, the highest dose of CNTO 0007
      that does not cause unacceptable side effects, referred to as the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) will be determined to and administered to patients in Stage B of the study. In Stage A,
      5 (up to 7) cohorts (groups) of 4-8 patients each will be administered a single IV infusion
      of CNTO 0007 or placebo 1-5 days (depending on cohort) after stroke (the first cohort of
      patients will receive the lowest dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo and each subsequent cohort will
      be administered a higher dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo until the MTD is determined). In Stage
      B, patients will be administered a single IV infusion of the MTD within a specified number of
      days after stroke.
