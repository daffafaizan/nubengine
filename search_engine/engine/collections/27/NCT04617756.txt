      face a poor prognosis. Indeed, patients who have undergone RNU for UTUC have 5-year
      recurrence-free and cancer specific survival probabilities of 69% and 73% respectively.
      Additional systemic therapy therefore seems justified for prolonged cancer control. However,
      there have been very few studies on neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies in UTUC. Recently, the
      UK's multicentric POUT trial reported the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in UTUC patients.
      Level 1 evidence has been provided for neoadjuvant therapy for urothelial carcinoma of the
      bladder via meta-analysis in 2005 but there are also several arguments for systemic therapy
      in this context especially as most patients lose the function of one kidney and cannot
      receive nephrotoxic cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Urothelial carcinoma of the upper tract
      have a different genetic background from carcinomas of the lower tract. The investigators
      hypothesized that there would be a greater occurrence of lower pathological stages among
      study group patients who receive neoadjuvant combined Durvalumab/Gemcitabine/Cisplatin or
      Carboplatin prior to RNU compared to the current literature (Gregg et al. 2018, Almassi et
      al. 2018). The primary objective is to assess the pathological complete response rate (ypT0)
      in each cohort and independently of a combination therapy with neoadjuvant durvalumab and
      chemotherapy (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) before surgery in patients with high-risk, localized,
      non-metastatic urothelial carcinomas of the upper tract.Secondary objectives include:
      assessing partial response rate to treatment, assessing the safety and tolerability of the
      treatment and evaluating the overall survival, bladder recurrence and dissemination at two
      years of follow-up.
