      the circadian clock gene system. The circadian clock regulation, optimize glucose metabolism
      for the consumption of high energy and carbohydrate (CH) meals in the early hours of the day
      and for fasting at evening and night. Circadian disruption which occurs when the meal timing
      is not aligned with the circadian clock rhythms like skipping breakfast, overeating CH at
      night or eating CH all day, lead to desynchronized clock genes and can result in adverse
      health outcomes like insulin resistance, obesity hyperglycemia and T2D. Although the clock
      genes are disseminated in almost all peripheral tissues, those localized in the liver, are
      particularly important for the regulation of glucose metabolism, influencing the enzymatic
      determinants of the hepatic glucose output, by enhancing glycogen storage and suppressing
      nocturnal hepatic glucose production (glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
      sequentially).Therefore, the disruption of the hepatic clock genes lead to fasting,
      nocturnal, and to postprandial hyperglycemia in T2D. The researchers had previously shown in
      T2D, that compared to 6Mdiet, the 3Meal diet timing schedule, was most effective in reducing
      body weight, HbA1c, overall hyperglycemia, and led to up-regulation of SIRT1 and Clock Genes
      mRNA expression in leukocytes. However, this effect of meal timing had never been explored in
      liver cells. The investigators hypothesized that compared to Allday Diet (6Mdiet), the serum
      collected from T2D participants following Breakfast Diet (3Mdiet) will up-regulate SIRT1 and
      Clock Genes oscillatory mRNA expression in cultured hepatocytes.
