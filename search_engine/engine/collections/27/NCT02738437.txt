      with wire cerclage on the stability of the sternum following median sternotomy.

      It has been shown previously that wire cerclage alone does not provide a stabile
      osteosynthesis following median sternotomy. The hypothesis is that if a stabile
      osteosynthesis can be achieved patient recovery can be hastened and patient discomfort and
      pain reduced.

      One half of the patients received only wire cerclage the other both bone cement and wire
      cerclage.

      The stability of the sternum was evaluated using radiostereometric analysis, PET-CT and
      patient reported outcomes in the form of SF-36 and VAS.
