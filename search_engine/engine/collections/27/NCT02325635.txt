    
      GI practice sites that have recently agreed to participate in the GIQuIC program will be
      randomized on a site-basis, to the EQUIP intervention or control.

      Baseline ADR and polyp/surveillance predication accuracy will be collected for approximately
      3 months.

      Sites randomized to the EQUIP intervention will undergo face-to-face training by a study
      investigator, followed by active monitoring and feedback.

      Control sites will not receive supplemental training and will be monitored by with no
      feedback. After completion of the study all sites will be offered the intervention (as is
      standard feedback in GIQuIC ).
