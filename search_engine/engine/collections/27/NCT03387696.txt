      conditions especially patients with heavy immunosuppression or patients with trauma or
      extensive burns. The incidence of Mucormycosis is currently increasing reaching 7% of
      invasive fungal infections in some immunocompromised patients. Because of its aggressive
      nature, Mucormycosis is associated with poor survival and high morbidity ; mortality is
      estimated between 16% and 64% according to different retrospective studies. No study has ever
      evaluated prognosis of patients with mucormycosis admitted in intensive care units (ICU).

      ZygoRÃ©a is a retrospective and multicentric French study aimed to evaluate survival of
      patients with mucormycosis admitted in ICU at day-28 after admission. This study will also
      try also to describe the epidemiology of patients admitted in ICU and to evaluate the
      prognosis of different subgroups of patients according to :

        -  their clinical characteristics : demographic characteristics, clinical conditions and
           factors of immunosuppression

        -  the characteristics of the fungal infection

        -  the treatment strategy

        -  the severity of the initial illness, evaluated by severity scores

      Twenty-one French ICU are currently including more than 45 patients.
