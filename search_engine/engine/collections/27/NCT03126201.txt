      diseases leading to end stage renal disease worldwide. Numerous studies have been conducted
      in order to identify the etiology of this debilitating disease. Beyond the etiological
      research, however, few studies managed to demonstrate the possible predictors of disease
      progression in patients. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the effects of histopathological,
      clinical, and laboratory features of patients with primary FSGS on the disease progression.
