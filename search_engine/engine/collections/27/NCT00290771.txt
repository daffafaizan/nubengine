      CSTI571H2201 and CSTI571H2202) which were conducted separately but reported together in a
      single clinical study report. Both studies were phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm
      studies that evaluated the efficacy of imatinib mesylate plus hydroxyurea in subjects with
      progressive glioblastoma multiforme. The studies were identical in design with two
      exceptions: Patients in study CSTI571H2201 received a dose of imatinib 600 mg once daily and
      were not allowed concomitant use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (EIACDs); patients
      in study CSTI571H2202 received a dose of imatinib 500 mg twice daily and were allowed
      concomitant use of EIACDs.
