      haemorrhoidectomy at Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos (Móstoles-Spain) will be
      performed. The patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Experimental group (EG): Patients undergoing Milligan Morgan´s procedure and application
           of Vitamin E ointment on the surgical bed.

        -  Control group (CG): Patients undergoing Milligan Morgan´s procedure and application of
           Vaseline on the surgical bed.

      Postoperative pain determined by VAS at the 1st, 3rd and 7th postoperative days, and need for
      morphine rescue will be investigated by a blined epidemiology nurse.
