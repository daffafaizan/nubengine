      I. Estimate the major complication rate among patients potentially eligible for a hospital at
      home program for management of neutropenic fever.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients potentially eligible for
      admission to a hospital at home program for management of neutropenic fever.

      II. Describe situations or treatments experienced by potentially eligible patients admitted
      for neutropenic fever that would be difficult to accomplish in a hypothetical hospital at
      home program (e.g., blood transfusions, echocardiograms, computed tomography [CT] scans).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed.
