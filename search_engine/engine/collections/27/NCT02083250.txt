    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAHA (vorinostat) in combination with the
      preparative regimen fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), clofarabine, and busulfan followed
      by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for patients with advanced acute
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of graft versus host disease (GVHD), engraftment, progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD), fludarabine
      phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour, clofarabine IV over 1 hour, and busulfan IV over 3
      hours on days -6 to -3. Patients receiving a transplant from a human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched unrelated donor, receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on days -3 to
      -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant
      on day 0.
