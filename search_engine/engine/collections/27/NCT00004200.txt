      with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with prinomastat (AG3340) or placebo and
      temozolomide following radiotherapy. II. Compare the safety of these regimens in these
      patients. III. Compare the quality of life in these patients on these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      receive oral prinomastat or placebo twice daily in combination with oral temozolomide daily
      on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
