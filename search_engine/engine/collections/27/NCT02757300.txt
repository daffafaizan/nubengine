      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a complication of anaesthesia and responsible
      for malaise of surgical patients. Furthermore, PONV has been shown causing additive costs due
      to anti-emetic drugs and prolonged hospitalisation. The occurrence of PONV is multifactorial.
      Beside individual patients factors, opioid use and type of surgery seem to be responsible for
      occurrence of PONV. Especially, sinus surgery carries a high risk of PONV. Blood from the
      operation site entering the stomach has been discussed the potential cause for PONV in this
      specific patient population.

      Therefore, hypopharyngeal packing following orotracheal intubation is a common clinical
      practice to prevent blood passing through the esophagus and so to lower the incidence of
      PONV.

      Unfortunately, there are limited data data supporting the effectiveness of this procedure. In
      contrast, some references suggest that hypopharyngeal packing may be associated with
      postoperative mucosal injury and sore throat with high impact on patientsÂ´ well-being.

      To evaluate the usefulness and safety of hypopharyngeal packing the investigators perform
      prospective randomized study with the following objective:

      1. Does pharyngeal packing during sinus surgery increase the incidence of mucosal injury?
