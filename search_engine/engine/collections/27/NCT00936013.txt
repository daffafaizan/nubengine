      treat recent outbreak novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection around world. But limited
      stock and resistant strain emergence raised increasing concerns. Chinese medicinal herbs, are
      derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat
      the disease. The investigators performed RCT to indicate that a combination treatment of
      Chinese medicinal herbs and oseltamivir is more effective than single oseltamivir in treating
      novel influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia.
