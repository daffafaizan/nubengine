      others. The presence of hyperacusis (diagnosed or undiagnosed) can be an important reason why
      some persons reject amplified sound from hearing aids. Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT),
      originally proposed for the treatment of persons with debilitating tinnitus, offers the
      significant secondary benefit of increased Loudness Discomfort Levels (LDLs), along with
      expansion of the dynamic range for loudness. TRT uses both counseling and sound therapy from
      daily exposure to soft sound from bilateral noise generator devices (NGs) and has been
      promoted as an intervention for hyperacusis. The hypothesis of this investigational study is
      that the counseling and sound therapy principles used in TRT can be applied successfully to
      treat hearing-impaired hearing-aid candidates with reduced sound tolerance who are otherwise
      should benefit from hearing aids.

      The current study is being implemented as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial to assess the efficacy of a TRT-based intervention for reduced sound tolerance in
      hearing-aid eligible persons with hyperacusis and/or restricted dynamic ranges. The trial
      design allows for the evaluation of the efficacy of partial treatments, including the effects
      of counseling separately from the effects of sound therapy. Forty hearing-impaired subjects
      (without primary tinnitus) are being assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups: 1)
      full treatment, both counseling and sound-therapy (n=10); 2) counseling with placebo sound
      therapy (n=10); 3) sound therapy without counseling (n=10); and 4) placebo sound therapy
      without counseling (n=10). Subjects are being evaluated at least monthly, typically for five
      months or more, on a variety of audiometric tests, including LDLs, the Contour Test for
      Loudness for tones and speech, word recognition measured at each session's comfortable and
      loud levels, and electrophysiological measures.
