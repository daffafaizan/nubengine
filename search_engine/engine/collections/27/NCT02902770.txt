      efficacy, safety and feasibility of non-opioid analgesics IV Lidocaine and IV Ketorolac and
      combination of both in patients with renal colic. The hypothesis and proposed study will try
      to determine if a combination of IV lidocaine and IV ketorolac is superior to either drug
      alone and if this non-opioid analgesic combination is effective for controlling pain of renal
      colic origin. The trial will compare pain scores at 15 min and 30 min between and within the
      three treatment groups of the study: IV ketorolac 30mg push and 10 minute normal saline drip
      placebo, 1.5mg/kg IV lidocaine drip (given over 10 minutes) and normal saline push placebo,
      or IV ketorolac push and IV lidocaine drip.

      Once a patient is enrolled, the on duty ED pharmacist will prepare any one of the three
      treatment groups based on a predetermined randomization list generated via SPSS 19.0.The
      study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and side effects at baseline, 15,
      30 and 60 minutes post-medication administration. If the patient still reports pain of five
      or greater and requests additional pain relief then morphine at 0.1mg/kg will be given as the
      rescue analgesic. Blinding of medication from the patient, research team, and staff will be
      strictly maintained by the pharmacist investigators.

      Sample Size Calculation:

      Fifty per group or 150 is needed given a standard 1.3 as the minimum clinically significant
      score and 3.0 as our standard deviation at 80% power and a=.05.
