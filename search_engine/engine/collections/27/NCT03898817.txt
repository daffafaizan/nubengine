      (human induced Pluripotent Stem cells) from somatic cells of patients. The patient
      recruitment was organized by the Montpellier and NÃ®mes public hospitals.

      The project is to generate a hiPS cell line for the 3 syndromes from fibroblasts and/or blood
      samples. Then, we could induce differentiation of hiPS to a target cell line of the diseases.
      Finally we could study the disease development following the genomic instability (karyotype,
      array-CGH) and the cellular ageing (senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, telomere
      length).

      For each mutated enzyme, we will perform a transcriptional profiling (splice, mRNA
      quantification) and protein studies (western blot). All results will be compared to wild type
      cells.
