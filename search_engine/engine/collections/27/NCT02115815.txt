      sF with 2.5 mcg glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) + 2% weight per volume stable emulsion (n=20) or
      placebo (n=4) Cohort 2: RSV sF 50 mcg (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 2a: MEDI7510 (50 mcg RSV
      sF with 2.5 mcg glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) + 2% weight per volume stable emulsion (n=20) or
      placebo (n=4) Cohort 3: 80 mcg RSV sF (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 3a: MEDI7510 (80 mcg RSV
