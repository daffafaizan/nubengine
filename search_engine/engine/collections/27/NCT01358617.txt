      I. Determine whether ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) expression is an
      indirect cancer stem cell marker in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma. Correlate UCHL1
      expression with staging information and patient's outcome.

      Study Subtype: Observational Observational Study Model: Case-control Time Perspective:
      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: None Retained Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Tissue microarray samples from patients with Neuroblastoma supplied
      by the COG Biopathology Center Sampling Method: Probability

      OUTLINE:

      Archived tissue microarray samples are analyzed for ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1
      (UCHL1) expression by UCHL1 monoclonal antibody and peroxidase technique. Results are then
      compared with patients' clinical data, including age at diagnosis, race, date of diagnosis,
      histology, stage and location at diagnosis, presence of cancer predisposition, date of
      completion of treatment, surgery performed, type of chemotherapy received, history of
      recurrence, and status (alive with disease, alive without disease, dead), if available.
