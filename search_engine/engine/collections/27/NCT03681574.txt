      and after oncologic procedures (myelogram or lumbar puncture) in children among 1 and 6
      years. Three groups were compared: the control group received placebo, the other two groups
      received gabapentin at 15mg/kg or at 30mg/kg. All patients received the same protocols
      (anesthesia and analgesia). Anesthesia protocol used was induction with sevoflurane 8% plus
      N2O 50% and oxygen, maintenance with sevoflurane 4%. We provided local analgesia with 5%
      lidocaine creme before the procedure. If it was required, dipyrone 10mg/kg every 6 hours was
      given as rescue analgesia. To prevent post-operative vomit, ondasentron 0,1mg/kg was
      administered when intrathecal chemotherapy. The mYPAS scale was used to evaluate preoperative
      anxiety at several moments: at basal, at after 1-hour administration, at separation from
      parents, and at induction. The PAED scale was applied after 30 minutes of procedure to
      evaluate postoperative agitation. The CHIPPS scale was used to assess postoperative pain. The
      frequency of vomits was recorded for 8 hours after the procedure finished.
